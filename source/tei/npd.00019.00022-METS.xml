            <seg id="p008">State of Nebraska Department of Public Instruction Lincoln December 31, 1908. ESlr: — I have the honor to submit herewith the report of this rtment for the biennium ending December 31, 1908. Permit me k your careful consideration to the questions discussed herein in ng such recommendations to the Legislature as your judgment Public Schools and Partisan Politics The people of Nebraska stand as a unit for the eternal separation of our public schools from partisan politics. The Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska and the Board of Education of the State Normal Schools are absolutely non-partisan in their management of these respective institutions. Fitness is made the sole test in the selection of all members of these faculties, and lack of fitness the sole cause for dispensing with the services of any member thereof. Boards of education, as a rule, throughout the state are free from nepotism, favoritism, sectarianism, and partisan politics in the selection of teachers. This is as it should 'oe. Our public school system is of the people, by the people, and for the people. It is for Republican and Democrat, for Populist and Prohibitionist, for Independent and Socialist, for Catholic and Protestant, for Atheist and Jew. No man has ever presented this question with better logic than William McKinley, when he said: "Permanently engrafted upon the policy and legislation of the state, it is free to all; to it all are invited and welcome, without money and without price. It is supported with boundless generosity by the people of the state, open to the children of the humblest citizen or exiled sojourner within our gates, as freely and ungrudgingly as to the native born or the children of the most opulent. Within its jurisdictions all distinctions, social, political, and religious, are banished; all differences hushed, all barriers removed. It recognizes neither party nor church, creed, condition, nor station, but free as the air we breathe, its bounties and benefits fall in equal measure upon all." Certification Fees. This report with my other reports on file in your office, as well as the receipts and redeemed checks on file in the office of the State </seg>
            <seg id="p009">8 I Superintendent, answer for the use made by me of the fees obtained under the present certification law; and yet it would have been more satisfactory to me to have 'been permitted by law to account for all of said fees through the regular channels of the offices of the State Auditor and the State Treasurer. Therefore, in the interest of the public and as a protection to the State Superintendent himself, I shall recommend to the next legislature that said law be so amended as to require the State Superintendent to turn over all examination fees received by him each month to the State Treasurer, said fees when received by the State Treasurer to be set aside by him and known as the "Teachers' Certification Fund;" all money in said fund to be appropriated and used for the payment of expenses incurred in carrying out the certification law as provided in the original act of 1905; said fees to be paid out by the State Treasurer upon warrants issued by the Auditor on vouchers duly sworn to by the claimant and approved by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. I have conferred on this question with my successor, Superintendent E. C. Rishop, and this proposed amendment meets his unqualified approval. Junior Normal Schools. All of the appropriation for Junior Normal Schools has been used. With an appropriation of $15,000, the same as made the pre - ceding biennium for five Junior Normals and the $13,832.6(9 raised through the liberality of county boards and the people of the towns in which the Junior Normals were located, we have 'been able to maintain, without a deficiency, the eight Junior Normals provided by thft last legislature. But this places tco great a burden upon the people of the local towns and counties, who have contributed for the support of these schools a larger amount than the state itself during the past biennium. when we take into consideration that the law requires that each of the places where a Junior Normal School is established shall place at the of the state, without cost, its public school buildings, text books and apparatus. The aggregate value of this property in the eight Junior Normal towns — Alliance, Alma, Broken Bow, Geneva, McCook. North Platte, O'Neill and Valentine — is not less than $300,000. tThe enrollment in the eight Junior Normal Schools for the session 907 was 1,262, and for 1908 was 1,448, making a total enrollment the biennium of 2,710. During the past six years the total enroll - it in the Junior Normal Schools has reached 6,758 teachers, er did the state do so much good with so little money in the pro - icnal training of its teachers. Senator Jesse L. Root, now a member of the Supreme Court, known in the last legislature as "the watch dog of the treasury," after visiting the Junior Normal Schools at Alliance and North Platte, wrote this department, under date of June 27, 1907, as follows: "I had time to and did give my personal attention, both at Alliance and North Platte, to the work being done in the Junior Normals there. I am </seg>
            <seg id="p010">9 Bn educator, but I was deeply impressed with the value of and the sity for these schools. I regret the appropriation was not greater hat purpose, although it was all that was asketf, as I remember ippropriati Therefore, in the light of the amount contributed by the local people for the support of these schools and the opinion held by Judge Roct on the need of a larger appropriation for their maintenance and support, I shall recommend to the next legislature an appropriation of at least $30,000 for the Junior Normal Schools. Touchers' Training School There are three imperative duties placed upon the state in cducati n — efficient teaching, free schools and compulsory attendance. Kffic ient teaching is the key to the situation. Without it free schools and compulsory attendance avail little. Making the I pos - sible of all the agencies in Nebraska for the professional training of teacli- state university, the state normal schools, the junior normal schools, the private and denominational schools, colleges and rsitii's, and the normal training high schools — each year we are forced to permit at least 1,000 third grade teachers without any profes - sional "training to take upon them .■ responsible work of in - structing the youth. This is absolutely necessary in order to supply the weak rural schools in the remote sections of the state with tea&lt; evident, therefore, that an additional agency should be emp for giving some training to this class of teachers who must be used for irs to come in -ak rural districts. Several facts be kept in mind in the solution of the problem: First, a large irtion of these teachers cannot afford the expense of attending school a great distance from home: •ecoad, the wages from employment in these weak rural districts do not remunerate one for the ex: of taking even an elementary normal course or normal training high school course; and third, these teachers come from the eighth grade in the rural schools and from non-accredited high schools. To meet these conditions there are needed several teachers' training schools with a short course of study in connection with the regularly established high schools, so situated as to accommodate this class of teachers. In my opinion, the logical locations for such training schools would be at the places where the eight junior normal schools are now located. These schools should be maintained at the expense of the state during the regular school year, and placed under the management of the state superintendent of public instruction. At least one com - petent instructor should be employed to devote all of his time to this work. Some may say, let this class of teachers get their training at the junior normal schools. But the junior normals are maintained only eight weeks during the summer and do not give sufficient time Tot preparation. A great number of this class of teachers are not </seg>
            <seg id="p011">10 Ely qualified to enter the state normal schools or the normal ing high schools. If it is argued that they could attend the te normals or denominational schools maintaining preparatory ■tments. my answer is that the distance and expense are so great make it almost prohibitory for a large majority. There should be two one-year courses of study, — one to prepare the student for a third grade county certificate, the other to prepare the student for a second grade county certificate. The third grade cer - tificate course should provide instruction in the following subjects: (a) first semester, reading 5, orthography 3, penmanship 2, arith - metic 5, grammar 5, history 5; (b) second semester, geography 5, phys - iology and hygene 5, English composition 5, mental arithmetic 5, theory and practice of teaching 5. The second grade certificate course should comprise the following subjects: (a) first semester, reading 5, arithmetic 5, civics 5, drawing 3, mental arithmetic 2, grammar 5; (b) second semester, agriculture 5, bookkeeping 5, geography 5, history 5, theory and practice of teaching 5. The minimum qualifications of candidates for entrance to the third grade certificate course in these teachers' training schools should be as follows: First, they must be at least fifteen years old at the time of entrance; second, they must subscribe to the following decla - ration: "We, the undersigned, hereby declare that our object in asking admission to the teachers' training school is to prepare ourselves for teaching; and that our purpose is to engage in teaching in the public schools of Nebraska on the completion of such preparation; third, they must poaaesa an eighth grade education or the equivalent. (The minimum qualifications of candidates for entrance to the sec - grade certificate course in these teachers' training schools should be Hows: First, they must be at least sixteen years old at the time of •nee; second, they must subscribe to the following declaration: the undersigned, hereby declare that our object in asking admis - to the teachers' training school is to prepare ourselves for teaching e public schools of Nebraska on the completion of such prepara - ' they must possess a one-year high school education or its 'alent. The school year should be divided into two semesters of eighteen weeks each. It is very important that the study of methods in these schools should not be merely theoretical. Teachers should be trained not only to observe carfully, but to interpret intelligently the principles of teaching as exemplified by the actual work in instruction of pupils in the grades. To afford this training, the class should at least once a week during the semester in which theory and practice of teaching comee, be given an opportunity to witness skillful teaching in the grades. For practice work, each student should foe required to teach at least five practice lesson* in a class composed of his fellow students, under the direct supervision of the instructor in charge. Due attention </seg>
            <seg id="p012">11 careful study of actual school conditions in the weak rural school districts of the state. On an average, at each of these schools there would be twenty-five prospective teachers taking the work of each course, making a total of 400 annually, or 800 for the biennium, who would receive this training in the eight schools. In the aggregate this gives us one great state training school. For the support and maintenance of this work, the state should appropriate not less than $20,000 for the ensuing biennium. It is impossible for the state to train this class of teachers as economically under any other plan. It will be impossible to supply these weak rural districts with better qualified teachers for many years to come, for the reason that these districts cannot afford to pay a sufficient salary to secure a higher standard of qualifications in their teachers. This is a simple matter of business and sentiment will not change the facts. Aid to Weak Districts. Of the appropriation of $50,000 for weak school districts, the first payment of $2 4,996 was made in January, 1908, and the second pay - ment of $25,004 will be made before the close of this biennium. No special appropriation ever •before made in Nebraska has given school advantages that have been shared in by so large a number of school children of the state. The first payment was apportioned to forty-five counties containing 711 school districts entitled to state aid, and with a school census of 14,351. This means that during this biennium over 15,000 boys and girls will receive increased school privileges under the provisions of this act. Although forty-five counties are represented in the distribution of this fund, more than eighty-five per cent of the total amount will be received by twenty-five counties, the larger payment in every instance going to the northern and western counties and the greatest benefits being derived by districts showing the greatest need of special assistance. The good resulting from the enactment of this law has already been written into the official records of the state. In 1906-7 there were 330 school districts in the state that held less than three months of school. In 1907-8 the year following the enactment of the law, 238 districts failed to hold a term of three months or more. A start has been made in the right direction, but upon future legislatures rests the responsibility of carrying forward effectively the good work that was begun two years ago. A condition that compels 238 school districts in Nebraska to hold less than three months of school each year is a menace to the welfare of our state and a crime against every child of school age residing in such districts. The best evidence of the successful operation of this law is shown by the very strong endorsements given it by county superintendents and school officers. The following is an extract from the resolutions </seg>
            <seg id="p013">12 at the close of its annual session held at Ogalalla in April, 1908: » "Whereas, The last state legislature wisely considered the needs he frontier portion of this great state in the appropriation of 000 for the aid of weak districts, and ■ "Whereas, Thousands of children have for the first time received benefits of more than three months of school each year, and "Whereas, This noble attempt to give a fair and square deal to the children of the pioneers whose lives are dedicated to the gaining of the frontier from a primeval wild to civilization and settlement, has brought to light the pressing need for larger effort in this direction; therefore, be it "Resolved, by the teachers of the western Nebraska educational association, in convention assembled, that we express our hearttelt gratitude to the governor, the state legislature, the state department of education and all who participated in the passage of this beneficent law; and be it further "Resolved, That we hereby petition the governor and the state legislature for an appropriation of cot less than $180,000, annually, to the end that every district in Nebraska, with reasonable limitations as to area, shall be able to maintain at least a seven months' term, and that these great reforms may not perish in Nebraska; and pleading the fairness and justice of our petition, we appeal to the great heart of all Nebraska for continued, active support in the solution of this, one of the greatest of educational problem While my heart beats in sympathy with this appeal, my honest judgment will not let me ask the next legislature to make an appro - priation of $360,000 for this purpose for the ensuing biennium. 1 cannot refrain from quoting Judge Root in a letter to this department. June 27, 1907, relative to his investigation of the question of state aid for weak school districts. He says: "I also looked into the matter of the area of the school districts and the value of the property as related to state aid. I am satisfied this measure should have been enacted years ago, and that its scope should be extended rather than diminished." I am confident, therefore, that future legislatures will follow the departure made by the session of 1907, and that Ne - braska will continue not only to deal generously with her university, normal schools and high schools, but will also continue to appropriate sufficient money to be used in giving better free school privileges to the boy and the girl in the weak rural district. Such a policy will make it possible for all boys and girls in the state living in these excep - tionally weak districts to receive at least twice the amount of schooling they are now getting. This law should f oe so amended as to give these exceptionally weak and yet deserving public school districts at least $240 per year. Even by giving each of these districts $240 a year, yet there will still be a considerable number unable to maintain seven months of school. The legislature of 1909 should not stop short of an appropriation of $100,000 state aid to weak districts for the next bien- </seg>
            <seg id="p014">13 KL There were not sufficient data for the legislature of 1907 to e an appropriation commensurate with the needs of these districts, reasonable person who makes a careful study of this question t admit that $100,000 for the next biennum is absolutely necessary. Normal Training High Schools. At the close of the present biennium, March 31, 1909, there will be a surplus of at least $15,000 on hand in the appropriation for normal training work for high schools, to be applied on this the biennium beginning April 1, 1909. For the school year 1907-8 the number of high schools approved for normal training under the act of 1907 was sixty-eight, and the number of juniors and seniors who ribed to the entrance declaration and did the work was 1,200; for the school year 1908-9 eighty-six high schools have been approved and the number of juniors and seniors who have subscribed to the entrance declaration and are now pursuing the work is 1.508. This is a show - ing far beyond the most sanguine expectations cf the most enthusiastic friends of this movement. It cost the state of New York $51,000 to give 1,173 students normal training in her high schools during the school year 1907-8. It cost Nebraska nearly $30,000 to give 1,212 students normal training in her high schools for the same year. The cost per capita in New York, based on the class of ten, was $50, while in Nebraska the cost per capita on the class of ten was $35. And yet, according to Commissioner Draper of New York, the high schools of that state gave this training at a loss of nearly $7,000 to the public high schools doing the work. It Is evident that Nebraska high schools did not receive a remuneration commensurate with the service they rendered the state in this great work of supplying professionally trained teachers for the rural schools. Therefore, I recommend that our law be so amended that a high school maintaining a normal training class be paid according to the number of students who complete the normal training course and pass the required examination for a teacher's certificate under the rules now in force for the certification of graduates of normal training high schools. Not how many in the class at the beginning, but how many finish the course — that is the question. The interests of the state, the measure of efficiency of the schools lie not in the large nuntfber enrolled but in the number of students graduated each year. Every person who weighs this question carefully in all its phases must admit that in order for this work to be properly done with an equitable remuneration therefor, an allowance of $100 per capita should be made each year for graduating a class of one to five from the normal training course in each year; and for each additional member of the normal training class who finishes the course up to and including ten, an allowance of $75 per capita each year; and for each additional member of the normal training class over and above ten who finishes the normal training course each year, a per capita allowance of $50; all work to be com- </seg>
            <seg id="p015">14 pleted and all accounts settled on or before the second Monday of July in each year. If we estimate the average daily attendance of all students above the tenth grade at the Peru state normal school for the school year of 8 at 500, the cost per capita would be about $120, but if we base the cost of training teachers at Peru on the New York method, that is, the finished product — the graduates from the elementary and advanced courses — the cost per capita at Peru for the school year 1907-8 would be nearly $320. The average cost per capita in the New York state normal schools for the same school year, according to Commissioner Draper, was $405.02, a decrease per capita of $75.04 frcm the preceding year. It follows, therefore, that whether we base the cost per capita at Peru on the average daily attendance above the tenth grade or on the finished product, we have figured very conservatively when we find it per capita on the average daily attendance and nearly $320 per capita on the finished product. Peru is taken as a basis of compa because it has been long established, is well organized, and therefore prepared to do this work as economically measured by its efficient any other state normal school in America. Since the Randall law went into effect in 190 7. the minimum standard for an elementary state certificate at Peru has been raised to Io year high school education, or its equivalent, plus one year's ent attendance and creditable work. The minimum standard of fication for graduates oi the normal training course in our normal ing high schools is fcur full years of academic work above the :h grade, during the last two years of which special attention \en to a review of the essential common branches and to the ■iples of education, school management, and the theory and practice &gt;aching. The state requires the same entrance requirements to trmal training class whether at Peru cr at a normal training school, but the state requires Peru to give but one year's academic and professional training to turn out its finished product from lementary course, while it requires the normal training high school Ive two years cf academic work and professional training to out its finished product. Therefore, I maintain that my estimate i the amount the state should pay per capita for the finished ict of our normal training high schools is altogether reasonable and and that the finished product is the mcst equitable basis on a to figure the cost. tAt least 100 high schools would qualify under this plan during lext biennium. It would place at the disposal of the state over 'i in buildings, books, apparatus and equipment, and at the time give the state services of at least 500 professional teachers, would train during the next two years net less than 3,000 pro« - ve teachers— 1,000 of whom would finish the course. If the cost per capita to the state for training teachers in our </seg>
            <seg id="p016">15 it may be well to take into consideration the saving in money to the parents whose sons and daughters are trained at home through the agency of our normal training high schools. It is conservati. say that the average cost per capita for a year's normal training ai is at least $200. To be sure, it would cost the parents at least $100 per capita to provide for their sons and daughters if educated at home in the normal training high schools. But the cost to these parents for giving their sons and daughters this normal training at Peru would be at least $100 per capita over what it would cost to give them this training at home. On this estimate it is a saving to the i&gt; these prospective teachers of $300,000 a year, or $600,000 for the liuni. In the light of these facts. 1 consider it my du nmend that the next legislature make an appropriation of at least $100,000 for the maintenance of normal training in the high schools of Nebraska. Agricultural and Industrial Schools. On entering upon my official duties as state luperinten January 4, 1905, I was convinced that the time had come to emp!. the importance of agricultural education and industrial training, and practically added a new department to the office by instructing Deputy Hishtp to devote his whole time to the promotion of this work during my first term. The success which crowned his efforts was so phenominal that we were forced to continue it during the present term. At this time there are at least 20,000 bovs and girls in Nebraska inter - various lines of work. This impels me to recommend the establishment of no less than fifteen nor more than twenty state agricul - tural high schools, under the management and control of the board of regents of the University of Nebraska. The course of study should be \ebraska high school manual, issued jointly by the University of Nebraska and the state superintendent cf public instruction, so modified provide for the theory and practice of the elements of agriculture, manual training and domestic science. Opportunity should also be given for work in the theory and practice of manual training and domestic sciences in the grades 'below the high school. I These state agricultural high schools shouli 1&gt;e establish* rtments of the regular public high schools at the places d ?for. For the support and maintenance of these schools there Id be appropriated not less than |1M,HI. No state agricultural school should be established as a department of any regular ic school unless there is given to the state the fret- use of a tract of containing at least five acres conveniently situated to said high ol, for actual practice by all students in the agricultural depart - ts of these high schools under the direction of competent instructors xperimental work in agriculture. The appropriation made by the state should be sufficient to give each high school not less than two teachers for this work — one to </seg>
            <seg id="p017">16 teach the theory and practice of agriculture and its allied sciences, the other to teach the theory and practice of manual training and domestic science — Buch teachers to be selected cr approved by the board of regents of the University of Nebraska. The state appropriation should also be sufficient to provide the necessary equipment for all of this Since agriculture is a requirement for a teacher's certificate, there would be at least 500 prospective teachers preparing for the rural schools in these twenty agricultural high schools during the nest biennium, who would be given opportunity for professional and prac - tical training in this subject. In addition thereto there would ue at least 500 students in attendance at these schools pursuing the theory and practice of agriculture for its commercial and practical value to them as twentieth century farmers. In addition to these two classes in agriculture there would be, on the most conservative estimate, 200 students in the grammar grades and in the high school of each of these twenty schools, pursuing the theory and practice of manual training and domestic science during the next biennium, or a total of 4,000, giving us a grand total of 5,000 students in these schools who would pursue the theory and practice of agriculture, manual train - ing and domestic science during the next biennium, provided these schools are so distributed as to serve all sections of the state to the best advantage possible. I do net know of any other educational policy that would do so much to induce our boys and girls to complete the eighth grade and to finish the high school course, and which would be of so much practical value to them in solving the actual problems of everyday life and in meeting the everyday responsibilities of American citizens. "The people must needs take thought of what they shall eat and where - withal they shall be clothed. And the education that fits them best for this is, from necessity, the best; at least until they are so developed and improved that the people, the great longing, struggling, hungering, needing, hoping, despairing, and yet unyielding people, shall not need to take thought only of what they shall eat and wear." Moreover, it is the most economical plan possible for the state. One hundred thou - sand dollars appropriated for this purpose would do more to promote the general welfare of our great commonwealth than it is possible to do with five times this amount through any other channel. At each place where a state agricultural high school is established the piroilc school buildings, textbooks and apparatus should be placed at the service of the state, without cost, aggregating in money value nearly $1,000,000. This plan would give the state 100 acres in experimental farms, a faculty of 100 members, and a school of 5,000 students, making the greatest agricultural and industrial school in the United States. The first educator in Nebraska to emphasize this phase of education was State Superintendent S. R. Thompson. In his second biennial report, submitted December 31. 1860. he devotes sixteen pages to his </seg>
            <seg id="p018">17 arguments for agricultural and industrial education, in many paragraphs of which he grows eloquent as well as logical for industrial education in the common schools, agricultural and industrial education in the secondary schools, and higher agricultural and industrial education in the agricultural and industrial colleges. Let me quote one or two cf his paragraphs: I "There are diminutive souls who think any kind of manual labor iding; there are others who by some kind of inconceivable logic convinced themselves that selling turnips is a much more dignified jyment than growing them, or that standing behind a counter uring off ribbons is more refined and elevated employment than ling behind a loom and weaving them. I prefer to think with ce Mann: "It is every way creditable to handle the yard-stick and ure tape; the only discredit comes in having a soul whose range ought is as short as the stick and as narrow as the tape.' " "Who does net know that the cities would become emasculated, effeminated, debilitated, and depopulated in a few generations, were it not for the steady stream of sturdy, honest, hearty life that contin - ually flows from the country into them? And shall this class that furnishes nine-tenths of the food and three-fourths cf the brains of all the professions be forever cheated out of such means of education as are adapted to their wants, and be compelled to accept a professional hope for and expect a better day? The true dignity of agriculture must not appear in the borrowed luster of the great men who have fol - lowed it, but in its union with true culture and its direction by the highest intelligence. Belief in its present worthiness, hope for its improvement, and joy in its promise must inspire the farmer as he drives his plow afield; and the great public must come to believe— as It does now in the public schools — in the importance, the possibilities, and the necessity of industrial education." Let us join President Roosevelt in his crusade in behalf of agricul - tural education and industrial training. "Teach the boy and girl that their business is to earn their own livelihood Teach the boy that he is to be the homemaker; the girl that she must ultimately be the home - keeper; that the work of the father is to 'be the bread winner, and that of the mother the housekeeper; that their work is the most important by far in all the land; that the work of the statesman, the writer, the captain cf industry and all the rest is conditioned first upon the work that finds its expression in the family, that supports the family. So teach the boy that he is to be expected to earn his own livelihood; that it is a shame and a scandal for him not to be self-dependent, not to be able to hold his own in the rough work of actual life; teach the girl that so far from its being her duty to avoid all labor, all effort, it should be a matter of pride to her to be as good a housewife as her mother was before her." * </seg>
            <seg id="p019">18 i Administration of Department. During the present biennium the office force has averaged twelve members. This is three times the number employed at the beginning of my first term. The increase in office force has been necessary on account of the additional work placed upon the department by recent school legislation. The volume of work has been more than trebled. Under the certification law of 1905 'our board of examiners for county certificates mark the answer papers of at least 10,000 different teachers annually. This means an average of at least eight subjects for each teacher, a total of 80,000 answer papers, with over 320,000 pages of manuscript to be read: making for the biennium 20,000 different teachers examined. 160,000 answer papers marked, and 640,000 pages of manuscript read. This is some evidence of the herculean task placed upon the department by this one law. Our examining committee is ab - solutely non-partisan and non-sectarian — Republicans, Democrats, Popu - lists, Prohibitionists, Catholics and Protestants are represented thereon. The efficiency of this committee will equal that of the United States Civil Service Commission. rThe work of Deputy E. C. Bishop in the conduct of the Boys and i Agricultural and Industrial Associations is, in its importance and volume of office and field work done, a department in itself. We now have ov&gt; 8 of the most progp outh in the state enrolled as active members in these organizations. This work with the inspection of non-accredited high schools under the new free high school law has taken most of Mr. Bishop's time and that of one stenographer. The organization and management of the junior normal schools is ve«t&lt;?d in and res' upon this department. The increased number ot these schools has almost doubled the work in this field. It may be argued that the selection of the seventy-five members of the junior normal faculties is too great a centralization of power to be place! in the hands of one man. To avoid this danger and escape this criticism, I proposed an amendment to the law on this point, placing the manage - ment ct the junior normal schools in the hands of the board of education of the state normal schools and had It introduced into the legislature of 1905. But this proposed amendment was defeated by an overwhelming in the legislature. So far as efficient and economical manage - ment is concerned, 1 doubt if the present method can be improved upon. Let the conduct of these schools in the past answer for their management in the future. Character, scholarship, and fitness for the particular work to be done, has been the sole criterion in the selection of these faculties. Political and church affil - iations have been absolutely disregarded. Superintendent Softley, my opponent four years ago, has been a member of the junior normal faculties each year during both of my terms. Superintendent Watson, my opponent two years ago. served as principal of the Valentine junior </seg>
            <seg id="p020">19 at the beginning of my second term, but could not accept. Superin - tendent Abbott, the Democratic candidate for state superintendent in the last campaign, served as a member of the O'Neill junior normal faculty during the present biennium. Had he not been selected by Governor-elect Shallenberger as superintendent of the Institute for the Blind, Superintendent E. C. Bishop would tender him a position in the faculty of the O'Neill junior normal school for the session of 1909. Among other Democratic members of the junior normal faculties may be named the following leading school men: Supt. D. W. Hayes, prin - cipal of the Alliance junior normal; Dr. H. K. Wolfe, principal of the O'Neill junior normal; and Superintendents Cark, Hopkins and Vauck of the Geneva junior normal. I During the present biennium there has been an average of nty-eight normal training high schools to be inspected, with over 0 normal training high school students to be prepared for teach - under the supervision of this department. This work has occupied time of one inspector, one secretary, and one examiner, which i - »t half the force employed by the state of New York for practically same amount of work. The new free high school law has placed a great volume of work upon the office through the inspecting and approving of high school courses of study, equipment and teaching force; and in attendance at eighth grade promotion exercises in all sections of the state by repre - sentatives of this department. These eighth grade promotion exei have given us some of the best "red letter" days in the history of rational work in Nebraska. At Aurora, the eighth grade graduating of Hamilton county in May. i!»08, numbered nearly 150. The fathers, mothers and teachers of these young people assembled from all sections of the county. We had a rural audience of over people. Such occasions mean much in promoting the cause of popular education among the country people. Another burden placed upoon the department by the last legis - lature was the enactment of the King law, providing for a thorough inspection cf all private and denominational schools authorized by law to grant teachers' certificates. There are twelve of these schools. Twice each year a careful inspection was made of the work being done at each of these institutions in the certification of teachers and an educa - tional inventory was taken at the close of each year's work of • applicant for a teacher's certificate. There were issued by these twelve private and denominational schools during the present 'bienniuni second grade state certificates. 1#3 normal first grade state certitii and 103 college first grade state certificates, a total of 579 certificates. During the same time the University of Nebraska issued 11 first grade state certificates, and the state normal schools 227 elementary (second grade state) certificates, and 391 diplomas (normal first grade state certificates), a total of 7."&gt;1 teachers' certificates from the three state institutions. These figures show that the private and </seg>
            <seg id="p021">20 denominational schools certified five-sevenths as many teachers during the biennium as did the state schools. But the expense of inspecting the private schools was placed upon this department without any extra appropriation therefor. The total expenses directly charge - able to this inspection for the biennium will not be less than $2,500. This inspection must be continued, or the law authorizing private and denominational schools to certificate teachers must be repealed. It is too great a temptation to any private or denominational school to be given this right without the proper inspection. It will be evident also from Superintendent Fulmer's exhaustive paper on The Inspection of Private and Denominational Schools published else - where in this report that this inspection has had as wholesome effect Kle state schools as It has had on the private schools in raising tandard for certificating teachers. The field work of the department during the biennium has been extensive and strenuous. The number of miles traveled in Nebraska by the state board of examiners for life certificates in the inspection of the twelve private and denominational schools as required by the King law; the extensive travel &gt;by Deputy E. C. Bishop in visiting county institutes, county and district teachers' associations, junior normal schools, normal training high schools, eighth grade promotion exercises and high school commencements, and conventions of the boys and girls' industrial associations; and the distance traveled by myself in all of these fields, will aggregate over 100,000 miles for the biennium. This is exclusive of the travel by the inspector of the normal training high schools. About one-half of these traveling expenses incurred by Mr. Bishop and myself have been paid r oy the places that secured our services. Since this field work is to promote the cause of education throughout the state, the appropriation for this department should be sufficient to cover all traveling expenses of the state superintendent and his deputy during the next biennium. It must be understood that the services of the state superintendent and his deputy in attendance at all of these meetings are given gratuitously, but their traveling ex - peases must be borne by the state or the communities served. Permit me to call your attention to some appropriations made for this department by past legislatures. For the &lt;biennium beginning April, 1883, $10,700; for 1891, $13,339; for 1903, $il,000, and in addition thereto over $2,000 deficiency; for 1905, the first term of my administration, $10,000 in a blanket sum, with $1,000 deficiency at its close; for 1907, $13,000; and yet for every biennium preceding the present, the appropriations were made for this department — no matter what the political party in power — by members of the legislature who had free transportation, for those in this office who had free transporta - tion, and hence up to the time of the last legislature, transportation was never an item to be considered in the appropriations. Therefore, when we take into consideration the extra amount of work placed upon this department by recent school legislation which must be charged direct to </seg>
            <seg id="p022">SUPERINTENDENT'S INTRODUCTION 21 office expenses, it is evident that the appropriation made by the last legislature, was not commensurate with the extra demands made upon the office in work and expense. A careful consideration of these facts will show that my estimate of $15,000 for the next biennium is reason - able and just. Kdtira tii mal History of Nebraska. In December, 1907, I announced that immediately after Year it would be my purpose to begin writing an educational history of the state under the title "Fifty Years of Educational Progress in Nebraska." It was my plan to make my twentieth biennial report comprise such a history. But the amount of office work, the lack of funds and sufficient help, have made it impossible to do more at this time than to make this report a foundation for such a work, so that a complete history may be built upon it in the future. Such a publication should give a full history of the leading public school districts that are types or models, a history of the state teachers' association, county and district associations, district and state declam - atory unions, county institutes, union normal institutes, junior normal schools, normal training in high schools, state normal schools, the state university, private and denominational academies, colleges and universities, the evolution of our school laws, the Nebraska school - masters' club, school journals and publications; at least one volume devoted to the school men and school women who have placed Nebraska in her proud station in the educational world, at least one volume to educational classics containing papers, addresses and lectures b&gt; braska educators, and such other topics as may develop in the publi - cation of such an educational history of the state. All of which is respectfully submitted. JASPER L. McBRIEX, THE GOVERNOR OF NEBRASKA. </seg>

            <seg id="p026">Having been officially connected with the State Department of ation for the past eight years — four years as deputy and four years as superintendent — I have thought it well to review the prin - cipal educational policies inaugurated and school legislation en during th&gt; Most of these policies and ■ atf Superintendent W. K. Fowler in his first biennial report to the Governor. IMS. The beginning of his second term was r.iark the passage of laws providing for the establishment of a seron.l normal school and five junior normal schools, and the erection of a chapel building at the Peru state normal. The legislature of provided for a new library building at Peru. The same legislature placed the certification of teachers under practically t rules and regulations as those of the I'nited States Civil Service Commit a minimum requirement in normal training for first and county certificates, and raised the qualifications of high school teachers to graduation from the advanced course of a college, university or normal school or a life certificate obtain. examination. The school legisation enacted by the legislature of is of far-reaching importance. Never since public schools ■ i lished in this state did the common schools n &gt; fair a hearing. There are five acts of that session desiring special mention: ( 1 &gt; A law providing for a library in every public school district a law providing for normal training in high school viding state aid to weak districts by appropriating $50,000 then ( i ) a law raising the standard of certification of teachers by private and denominational schools by providing for a more rigid i each year by the state superintendent or by the state board of exam - for life certificates; ( ."&gt; ) a free high school law. The action of the Board of Regents of the I'niversity of Nebraska in the spring of 190K in establishing a teachers college in connection with that tution is worthy of special commendation. While all of these policies and laws have been discus.' previous reports either by Superintendent Fowler or myself, their importance warrants a review at this time. The wonderful awakening along educational lines and the extraordinary success in wholesome school legislation during these years are largely due to the members of the legislatures, individually and collectively, for their deep personal interest in educational affairs and for their recognition of the needs of the common schools, and to the united efforts of the school men and </seg>
            <seg id="p027">2 school women of the state. The teachers of Nebraska are men and women of heart power as well as brain power. They are men and women of irreproachable character and high ideals. I have often gone wrong through defect of judgment. When right, I have often been thought wrong by those whose position would not command a view of the whole ground. The approbation of my friends is sufficient consolation to me for the past; and my future solicitude will be to retain the good opinion of those who have stood so loyally by me, to remember those who have differed with me by doing them all the good in my power. Every difference of opinion is not a difference of prin - ciple. Different persons often see the same subject in a different light. In school affairs there is no place for political favoritism or political punishment. Among the happiest memories of my lile will be my association with the school men and school women who have worked so earnestly with one heart and one mind to advance the cause of popular and higher education in every county, town, school district, college, university and normal school in our great commonwealth. The ch(prmal School Idea I During the past eight years we have had much discussion on normal school question in Nebraska. Flagrant inaccuracies and s distortion of facts have formed the chief argument of those &gt;sed to normal schools. Here is one of the false arguments used: the discussion of normal schools some people forget the fact that original demand tor such schools was caused by the very inferior larship possessed by the average candidate for the pedagogue's r in this country. The great universities were yet to be organized." Such assertions are plainly without foundation. The founding of the great universities in this country antedates the establishment of normal schools more than 200 years. The first college founded in America was in 1636, receiving the name of Harvard College two years later. William and Mary College obtained a charter from the king and queen in 1693. Yale was founded in 1700; and before the French and Indian war three other colleges and universities were established, which have since become Columbia, Princeton, and the University of Pennsylvania. The first public agitation of the normal school idea in this country was started by Charles Brooks, of Medford, Mass. In 1835, Mr. Brooks called a convention of the citizens of Plymouth, to whom be opened the whole matter as clearly and as strongly as he could showing that the great work must begin by founding a state normal school in Plymouth county. At one of these conventions Daniel Wtibcter and John Quincy Adams were present, and gave expressions of approval to the feelings and sentiment which had been developed by contact with enthusiastic leaders of the movement. Mr. Webster said that the ultimate aim was to elevate and improve the primary schools, but that there was still a larger view; that every </seg>
            <seg id="p028">3 tand every woman, every brother and every sister, is a teacher; that nts are eminently teachers; that if normal schools are to teach hers, they make parents and all who in any way influence iren more nearly competent to their high office; that in family there would be better teaching; and that the effect would be throughout society. Mr. Adams was likewise hopeful and enthu - :ic. The first state board of education of Massachusetts was established by vote of the legislature, and was organized on the 29th of June. 1837, with Horace Mann as its secretary. The new board of educa - tion recommended, as was expected, the enactment of a law for the establishment of state normal schools. The board decided to establish three normal schools. The opening date for the first school came July 3, 1839. Assembled in the recitation room of the normal school building were the august visitors of the school with the newly elected principal, and 'before them sat three timid girls — only three — to be examined and enrolled as the first pupils of the first state normal school in America. The first quarter closed with twelve students. In the fall a model school was conducted with thirty-three pupils. t There are in the United States at this time about 175 public al schools, with 2,200 instructors, and 50,000 normal students 1 o.ooo normal graduates. There are about 140 private normal )ls, with 1,000 instructors, 25,000 normal students, and •" al graduates. These figures do not include the universities and colleges having departments of education and those offering courses for the training of teachers. Were these schools considered, it would give us at this time a grand total of about 1,500 institutions, in which over 100,000 stu receive normal training. »The state appropriations for public normal schools in the United ss for the past fifteen years were, for buildings nearly $10,000,000. support about $30,000,000, making a grand total of nearly 000,000 for public normal schools in fifteen years. I Eleven states and territories support only one state normal ►ol each. Massachusetts has ten state normal schools, Oregon four, nsylvania thirteen, New York eleven; Ohio has in the last few ■g secured a signal triumph in the establshment of two state normal &gt;ols. Iowa has but recently dedicated one of the most modern nal school buildings in the United States. Kansas is liberal in appropriations for the great state normal school at Emporia. Even Missouri is showing us the necessity of supporting liberally six state nal schools, and the youngest state in the Union, Oklahoma, has e state normal schools. tThe aim of the normal school is to prepare teachers for their in the public schools of the state. The successful teacher must •ss scholarship plus technical skill in teaching and managing, colleges and universities, in the main, fit their students for the </seg>
            <seg id="p029">4 Iessions and the business world. The lawyer and physician : after the specific interests of their clients and patients, the Ister cares for the spiritual welfare of his particular par - the business man looks after his own interests alone; but the lie school teacher gives her best thought and her best efforts to the iren of all the people. It is therefore both a duty and a nee the state to found and support state normal schools. From this evident that the function of the normal school is peculiar and that responsibilities are greater than those of other educational insti - )ns. One opponent of the normal school* says: "It is urged by some old-fashioned people that there is something peculiar in the normal school to commend it beyond a well-equipped university, because it teaches people how to teach other people, while the university merely teaches people and stops there." I Permit me to quote from Gladstone in his great lecture on i-rn Training for Life: "In dealing with professions I have not icularly referred to the new profession, as it may be called, of teacher. In other times our fathers were content to leave this irtant office, like some other great social functions, to be learned, by apprenticeship or theory, but by practice. In tlu&gt; results of )l:i meth a as much imperfect, and, I am afraid, no small ality. What we awkwardly call social science is a great growth of lay we live in: and the first place among its achievements appears 9 due to the organization of teaching." According to Gladstone, then, it is not the old-fashioned people who believe there is something peculiar in the normal school. A normal school is a peculiar school. It is equally true that the peculiar work of such a school cannot be delegated to any other school. No other school can prepare teachers so well for their work as the school which makes such preparation its sole bush And it was Col. Parker, the greatest American educator since Horace Mann, who said: "The day has come when steps should be taken to see that no college or university graduate is ever allowed to take upon himself the sacred office of teacher without at least two rears' professional training in a school or college fully equipped for that purpose." KNo man has emphasized the importance of the professional ing of teachers with better logic than J. Sterling Morton, when Jd: B"We demand for Nebraska educated educators. We demand pro - onally trained teachers. We demand from our legislature laws ng the standard of the profession and exalting the office of the ler. "As the doctor of medicine or the practitioner of law is only ad - mitted within the pale of his calling upon the production of his parchment or certificates, so the applicant for the position of instructor in our primary and other schools should be required by law to first produce his diploma, his authority to teach, from the normal schools." "We call no uneducated quack or charlatan to perform surgery upon the bodies cf our children lest they may be deformed, crippled and maimed physically all their lives. Let us take equal care that we 'ntrust the development of the mental faculties to skilled instructors </seg>
            <seg id="p030">5 Ibe mutilated, deformed or crippled to halt and limp through the centuries of their never-ending lives. The deformed body die, and be forever put out of sight under the ground, but a I male moustrous by bad teaching dies not, but stalks foi ng the ages, an immortal mockery of the divine image." Our State Normal Schools tThe state normal schools of Nebraska are facing mat&lt; rtunities. They are also facing great responsibilities. The on of the Nebraska legislature took an advanced step for the ;ssional training of teachers. None of the newer states, few, i: le older states, have taken such a step forward in the statutory irements on teachers' qualifications. I "On and after September 1, 1'JOT, no person shall be grarr flcate to teach in the high school department of any high school let or in the high school department of any city school di us state who is not a graduate from a regular four year a college or university, or a graduate from the atlvam ■ college, university, or normal school in this state authi aw to grant teachers' certificates, or who does not hold a onal state certificate obtained from the state superintendent on lination before him or a committee appointed by him as pro iw. "On and after September 1. 1!M)7, no person shall be eligible to teach in the grades below the high school department in any high school district or in the grades below the high school d - in any city school district in this state who does not hold at h second grade certificate issued in Nebraska." §And en and after that date, no one shall be eligible to a second e county certificate who has not had at least eight week*' normal ing; nor shall any one be eligible to a first grade county certr has not had at least twelve weeks' normal training. This places an herculean task upon state, private and denomina - tional institutions authorized by law to grant teachers' certifie; I Let all these schools of Nebraska profit by the criticism passed upon normal schools of the I'nited States by Commissioner Harris, when aid that these institutions have as yet failed to provide an ideal prap - ion for all classes of teachers, due to the fact that they ha. ■ly all cases disregarded some of the most fundamental principles rofessional training. The most obvious of these defects is a failure to differentiate the work they have attempted. The result of this failure is that all students, irrespective of the part they are to take in the profession, are trained side by sfde. The same course is supposed to train teachers to become city superintendents, county superintendents, prin - cipals and teachers at high schools, elementary teachers, primary teachers, and teachers in normal schools and colleges. It is certain that the qualifications and equipment needed for teachers in these various positions are different in a very large degree. The great advance made in educational methods during the past twenty years surely warrants us In saying that a new order in the problem of </seg>
            <seg id="p031">6 training teachers is beginning, resulting, first, from the demand of pub - lic opinion for a higher class of trained teachers in all departments of the school, and, secondly, from the recent movement in colleges and universities in establishing departments of education. All students of educational evolution admit that the method of instruction and the or - ganization of the work of training teachers vary according to the grade of education in which the students expect to work. As further claimed .mmissioner Harris, "There is one method for higher education and another for the elementary, within each of which there should be a further discrimination of methods so that five stages of method will be noted. These five he enumerates as the method of the kindergarten, of the elementary school, of the secondary school, of the college, and of the university." Speaking of the work which will be required of the future normal school and the department of education in the university, he says: P'The student will be taught to present a branch of study symbol - according to the method of the kindergarten, by topical facts the elementary school, scientifically as in the secondary school, aratively as in the college, — as a specialist would investigate the post graduate course." We can hope to attain the high ideal set by Commissioner Harris only by continuing the present policy of the board of education of the state normal schools and by paying our instructors in these schools a salary commensurate with their qualifications, experience and success. Every member of the faculties in these schools is selected upon merit alone, and the tenure of office continues so long as efficient work is ren - dered the state. I am a believer in civil service, but above all I want efficient service. When there is not such service the tenure of office should cease. Therefore, it is sincerely hoped that the next legislature will increase the appropriation for salaries at these institutions so that the board of education of the state normal schools may raise the wages of each and every efficient instructor therein at least ten per cent. The Peru State 9{ormjd The first state normal school of Nebraska had its beginning in 1866 at Mt. Vernon College, a private institution under the control of the Methodist Episcopal Church. When Nebraska became a state in the Union the property of this college, sometimes called the Peru Seminary, was turned over to the board of education of the state normal school. The first term of the Nebraska state normal school at Peru opened October 24, 1867, with three regular teachers. It is evident from the history of this school that the changes in the pres - idency have been too frequent to permit the working out of an educa - tional policy. Let us hope, therefore, for a tenure of office for President Crabtree of at least twenty-five years. The matriculation of students in the Peru state normal during Its career of more than forty years has reached over 10,000, and yet </seg>

            <seg id="p034">7 only $170,0000 has been appropriated by the state for buildings at Peru. The next legislature will act within the \&gt;ounds of strict economy by giving Peru at least $50,000 for new buidings. A more extended history of this school is given elsewhere in this volume. The Kearney State SUprmal For many years every session of the Nebraska legislature prior to that of 1903 had to face the problem of a second state normal school. Especially did the members of the legislature from the central and western counties plead for a central or western state normal school. Teachers living in those sections of the state were so far from educa - tional institutions that few had an opportunity to fit themselves for teaching. State Superintendent Fowler realizing the needs of the west convinced the legislature of the justice of their claims and a bill was passed providing for a second state normal school, which was located by the board of education of the state normal schools at Kearney, one of the best normal school towns in the United States. The Kearney state normal opened its first regular term in Sep - tember, 1905. By the end of the third year, June, 1908, the matricula - tion of different students numbered 2,100. The success of the school has been phenomenal from the first. Even before the building was completed hundreds of students were seeking admission. The success of this school is without parallel in the history of normal schools in America. On the success and needs of this institution, the board of education of the state normal schools deem it proper to ask the next legislature for an appropriation of $100,000 for new buildings. The Teachers College As the professional schoolmaster of the world, Germany leads the nations of all ages. In the golden age of Greece as well as in the imperial days of Rome, the central thought in education was the acquisition of knowledge by the few at the expense of the many. Modern Germany believes that the cultivation of the highest art of imparting knowledge is essential in order to effectively and univer - sally promote the acquisition of knowledge, and so came to pass the German methods of training teachers. Not until the last quarter of a century did America begin to approach Germany's ideal in this matter. The establishment of a chair of Education in the University of Michigan in 1879, was a notable step in advance. To no other movement is Minnesota so indebted for her excellent school system. Her sec - ondary schools are now manned with university men who are profes - sionally trained as teachers and as school administrators. The excellent effects, growing out of this movement have led other states to follow the example of the University of Minnesota until now twenty of the leading universities of this country have established chairs for the exclusive training of teachers for secondary schools, elementary </seg>
            <seg id="p035">8 schools, supervisors and superintendents. Our nearest approach to iany"s excellent system is found in the Teachers College, the fore - most of which was established over ten years ago in connection with Columbia I'niversity. This college has given education in America a new impetus. The value of such a college is attested by the large numbers that have been graduated from Columbia's Teachers College in its short history. More than a thousand teachers have gone out from this institution in the last seven years. These have carried the badge of the baccalaureate degree and the teacher's diploma. These schoolmasters are found in every state of the Union and in many countries beyond the borders of our continent. The Teachers College, ranking as it does with the colleges of Law and Medicine, has a great :itage over the University Department of Education. Its functions are such that it must develop along lines peculiarly different from those of the Arts or Industrial Colleges. It is to this Individuality that the Teachers College at Columbia owes its great success as a training school. Other states are raising their Departments of Ed - ucation to the dignity of a college as rapidly as their Board of Regents can pave the way. Besides Columbia there are now well established teachers colleges at the University of Illinois. Minnesota, Missouri. Syracuse, and University of Chicago, every one of which has wonderfully strengthened the university with which it is con- The regents of the I'niversity of Nebraska, responding last February to the urgent demand of the public school men and of recent school legislation of our state, established a Teachers College in the rsity of Nebraska. This college has opened under the most irious circumstances. The enrollment passed the three hundred mark during the first month, which foreshadows a great future. The intendents and principals of our state are manifesting a deep I the progress of the new institution which Is destined to ■ greatest factor in the state of Nebraska for the preparation achers. The Board, at the same time that It provided for the ng of the Teachers College, arranged for the establishment of an experimental school where the prospective teachers may receive practical as well as theoretical training. The importance of the teachers college for the scientific study of education is well emphasizei by Professor Strong of the University of Edinburgh in the March. I9(i7. number of the Westminster Review, in an article on "The University and Education." Professor Stron? argues that the university must include within the scope of its activities the scientific study of all those phases of life associated with the well-being and progress of the state and the nation that are capable of higher intellectual formulation and treatment. He contends that Whatever demands concentrated thought, whether in the fortn of historical inquiry, systematic development, critical interpretation, or laborious research, with the ultimate aim of raising the standards of </seg>
            <seg id="p036">9 t intellectual or moral life of the community, will rightly demand &gt; representation or other in the scheme of university study." 1 this basis he demands that attention be paid by the English and tish universities to both the theoretical and practical study of edu - m. In this connection Professor Strong refers to Columbia I'ni - ty and Teachers College in the following terms: "Already the Americans have begun to realize the necessity of giving some such distinction to education. Many of their large uii - have initiated separate departments, faculties, or schools of e tion, taking rank with the departments or faculties of medicine, law. philosophy, etc.. and those universities not so provided are rapidly coming into line. "Recently, with a view to making a special Inquiry into work, I paid a visit to two of the most pro and diatlngu of tkCM schools ol education.

As an institution for the training of teachers, it is unique. We have no institution in Great Ilritain in any degree approaching it. The best of the German methods of training I'acher have been adapted, modified and adjuster! to their new environment, and the result has been admirable; but whether an union on precisely the same lines would succeed in thli country would be a question for careful consideration.

Experienced teachers, almin - latratire oncers, and representatives from all the ranks of education, are to be lound among its students.

            <seg id="p037">10 their moss-covered ideas as the only true gospel of education. This reminds me of an incident: An eminent lawyer bad in court a very clear case. After presenting an array of testimony, law, and prece - dent! that he thought was unanswerable, he submitted his case. To his utter astonishment, the Judge, who was bigotedly and dogmatically on the opposite side in prejudice, decided every point of the case against him. After he had recovered from his amazement, he arose and proceeded to read Blackstone and leading jurists, the statute law, and judicial decisions, flatly contradicting the decision of the court. The Judge pompously interrupted him with: "That will do you no good; the mind of the court is made up; you cannot change it." The lawyer replied: "I have no expectation of changing the opinion of the court. I o not question the infallibility and the infallible accuracy of its decision. I only want to show what consummate fools Black - stone. Kent, and all jurists, our legislators, and all the judges, except the judge of this court, must have been." The logic of time will vindicate the judgment of the board of regents in establishing the Teachers College of the University of Nebraska. Great praise is due Dr. G. \V. A. Luckey and Doctor H. K. Wolfe for the splendid services they both have rendered the department iucation which was the forerunner of the Teachers College. new college, with Doctor Charles Fordyce as dean and head professor of educational theory and practice, Doctor G. W. A. Luckey as head professor of the history and science of education, Doctor H. K. Wolfe as professor of educational psychology — a trium - virate of renowned educators — and a faculty of professional instructors, is placed in the front rank among the teachers colleges of the United States. Within three years it will be training 500 prospective teachers, within five years 750, and within ten years from the date of its estab - lishment it will be training at least 1,000 teachers. This is my hope, this is my prayer, this is my faith in the future of the Teachers College of the University of Nebraska. Inspection ofPrfbate Schools ((The following paper on the INSPECTION OF PRIVATE AND OM1NATIONAL SCHOOLS AUTHORIZED BY LAW TO GRANT CHERS CERTIFICATES was read 'before the Nebraska School - ers' Club. Lincoln, November 22, 1907, by Superintendent C. A. ler, of Beatrice, president of the state board of examiners for life flcates. This paper and the report of the Conference on Certifl - m following give the complete history up to September, 1908, of certification of teachers by private and denominational schools an official statement of the requirements made of these institutions r the existing statute. ) For sixteen years, covering the period 1881-1897, the State Normal School at Peru was the only educational institution in Nebraska authorized by law to grant teachers' certificates to its graduates, licensing: them to teach in any school district in the state for a term </seg>
            <seg id="p038">11 of years or for life without examination by any other officials connected with the school system. Meanwhile, a number of private and denominational srhools sprang up, some of the stronger of which with an increasingly large student body, with well qualified faculties, and with more or less adequate equipment, as compared with the State Normal School. These institutions, maintained largely or in part by tuition, came to realize their disadvantage in competition with a school not only supported by state funds, but authorized by law to issue state certificates to its graduates. — these two advantages, being supplemented by the prestige which graduation from a state school is often supposed to carry. For, quite naturally, young people in choosing a school to attend, other considerations being equally balanced, would many times "be attracted to the state school by the diploma-certificate alone. It was argued that where private schools maintained a standard equal to that of the State Normal it was an unjust discrimination to deny their graduates the same privilege of certification. As a result of this agitation, a law was enacted in 189 7 authorizing the issuance of a state professional certificate to any graduate from the University of Nebraska in a course leading to the degree of bachelor of science or bachelor of art, which should also Include a prescribed amount of study in the Department of Education, pro - viding such graduate had had three years' successful experience as a teacher in the public schools of Nebraska and held a first grade county certificate issued in the state. By this law the University of Ne - braska was also authorized to grant a three year state certificate, commonly called a first grade state certificate, to any graduate from a course as above prescribed. tThe same Legislature provided for the recognition of private al schools and colleges on the basis of the State Normal School, power of official recognition was vested in the State Superin - ;nt of Public Instruction. KThis, it was claimed, gave the University of Nebraska a decided Qtage over private schools. However, in 1901, the act of 1897 amended to include other colleges and universities recognized le basis of the University of Nebraska. KA11 this was a step towards unification of courses of study: It resulted in an elevation of standards in private schools through - he state. A quotation from the Fifteenth Biennial Report of the Superintendent (Jackson), 1898, page 29, reads as follows: K"The act of the last Legislature to grant equal privileges to gra'u - of the University of Nebraska with graduates of other eiucati~nal utions within the state was new and has placed the Universi - :ter footing for recognition in other states." Again on page 30 of the same report the State Superlntt "The act setting forth the conditions under which teachers' state certificates shall be granted to persons completing certain work In uni- » </seg>
            <seg id="p039">12 versifies, colleges, and normal schools, that should meet with certain requirements, has not been tested as yet, no school having been declared fully meeting the provisions of the act." The difficulties which beset private institutions in winning recog - nition may be better understood from an extract from the law in substance as follow?: Other colleges, universities, and normal schools in the state, incorporated under the law, and officially recognized by the State Superintendent as maintaining entrance requirements and degree requirements equal to those of the University of Nebraska, if colleges or universities, and maintaining courses of study equal to that at Peru Normal, if normal schools, such institutions to have in- Tested at least $50,000 each, and to employ faculties of recognized ability, were given the same privileges of certification as the Univer - 4 Nebraska and Peru Normal. Under this law which was operative until superseded by the in due course of time: tOn the basis of the University of Nebraska. — Doane College, Grand d College, Hastings College, Crelghton University, and Union ge; on the basis of the State Normal Schools, — Fremont Normal ge. Nebraska Normal College, York College, Luther Academy lemmtary state certificates- alone; on the 'basis of both the Uni - ty of Nebraska and the State Normals, — Nebraska Wesleyan *rsity. Hellevue College, Cotner University. Under this law which was operative until superseded l&gt;y the law enacted in 1907. to receive the State Superintendent's official recognition, a school must produce evidence that at least $50,000 was invested in the plant or lay at its disposal; it must also satisfy the State :intendent that it had a standard course of study in print and in actual operation, a standard equipment, and a standard faculty, as measured by the two state institutions. When such a showing waa made, and recognition received, the school was empowered to issue state certificates to its graduates under the same conditions as at the of Nebraska and the Peru State Normal. K Inasmuch as the State Superintendent was unable to Inspect and the work of these schools personally, recognition carried it almost unrestricted authority for certification, and the signing rtiflcates by the State Superintendent drifted into mere formality. Quite naturally, in the keenness of competition again came the charges that some schools in order to draw patronage were offering "cut-rate" certificates in points of time of attendance and scholastic attainmei unfair'' weie hoard on every side. Such rumors became current in all part of the state. Many came to feel that some of the private institutions were abusing the power conferred upon them to grant teachers' certificates when they were the sole authority to pass upon the fitness rf applicants for such honors. Complaints poured into the State Department. I quote Superintendent McBrien: "Then there had come to me various complaints from representatives of state schools as well as private schools that certain state schools and certain </seg>
            <seg id="p040">13 I ate schools were abusing the authority conferred upon them to grant hers' certificates. One president of a private school "was loud In denunciation ( to various persons, though never making any com - nt to me) ot a certain other president of an approved school sing the authority to grant teachers' certificates. It was very sing to me therefor, to find this president who was loud in his mciation of a fellow president throwing up his hands and crying, I! Knough!' when we were anxious to put his school under the rol of the Board of Regents so far as the issuance of teachers' Ificates was concerned. I may add that this man is no longer a lent of Nebraska." It is gratifying to know that subsequent investigations have proved the exaggeration or utter falsity of many of these charges. t Again the enactment of further legislaion to correct these re - d abuses was invoked. Senator King was the first legislator eak out on the question. The history of the new inspection law in its formative period is interesting in the extreme. The bill as originally drafted by the State Department of Education on the request of Senator King pro - ! that the Board of Regents control the issuance of teachers' certificates by all schools recognized on the basis of the University of Nebraska, and that the State Board of Education should control the •nee of certificates by all schools recognized on the basis of the state normal schools. There was strenuous objection from all of the private institutions to having these boards govern the issuance of certificates. The representatives of private schools desired to continue the control of the issuance of certificates solely with the State Super - intendent, to which the State Superintendent offered a protest for reasons so apparent that no explanation is needed here. The repre - sentatives oi the various private schools met Senator King and Super - intendent McBrien to confer on the question at issue. They agreed that the State Superintendent was the proper and legitimate authority. Senator King and Superintendent McBrien argued for the the original bill. Finally a happy compromise was suggested by Prof. W. R. Jackson, of the Nebraska Wesleyan University, to make the State Superintendent or the State Board of Examiners for Life Certifi - cates the authority. The State Superintendent agreed to this with the :ve declaration in that conference that said Board would do the work of inspection during his administration and that only upon their recommendation would any private institution be permitted to grant any certificate. Superintendent McBrien now declares his belief that this is a much more effective agency of inspection than either that contained in the original bill or under the old plan of placing the authority solely in the hands of the State Superintendent. KThe new law governing certification by colleges is here quoted 11. The law governing certification by normal schools is similar s provisions: </seg>
            <seg id="p041">14 STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT Sec. la, Subd. 9. — Graduates I'niversity of Nebraska or other in - corporated schools of this state. — All graduates of the University of Ne - braska holding the degree of bachelor of arts or bachelor of science and in addition thereto certificates authorized by the board of regents showing: that such graduates have completed the course of Instruction prescribed by the regents and faculty of said university for the special training and instruction of teachers, and such other graduates as hold the same degrees from any college or university duly incorporated under the laws of the state of Nebraska, who, in the judgment of the state superintendent of public instruction or the state board of examiners for life certificates, have completed in their respective institutions an equivalent of the courses in the University of Nebraska for said degrees - prescribed by the regents and faculty of said university, shall be accredited as qualified teachers within the meaning of the school law of this state; and all such graduates shall have equal privileges, upon equal conditions, with graduates from any and all other educational institutions within this state under the school law thereof. Said col - leges shall from year to year maintain entrance requirements, degree requirements and professional study requirements equivalent to those of the University of Nebraska. Each year the state superin - tendent of public instruction shall satisfy himself by personal inspec - tion or by the personal inspection of the state board of examiners for life certificates that said requirements have been maintained before any certificate can be granted by such institution. Said certificates are hereby declared to be valid as first grade state certificates entitling the holders to teach in the public schools of the state of Nebraska for a period of three years from their date. Said certificates shall be signed by the president and secretary of the board of trustees and the pres - ident or chancellor of the proper institution. (Amended 1907.) ■ Until after the passage of the bill its real import was probably - realized by the framers, the legislators, or the State Board of niners upon whose shoulders a heavy load of responsibility fell. Under the new law as interpreted by the State Superintendent not a single person can be certificated by private schools In Nebraska without the approval of this board. That is to say, the blanket form of recognition by the State Superintendent empowering a school to&gt; certificate its own graduates is done away with. The Board must pass upon the institution as to its standard of equipment and efficiency, the qualifications of the faculty, and upon the fitness of each applicant for a certificate, all relative to the standards maintained *&gt;y the University of Nebraska and the State Normal Schools. Everything is measured by these state schools. However high the requirements, the private schools must elevate their standards to the same plane; and however low the standard, private schools may fall to the same level without forfeiting their recognition. One may readily appreciate the importance the Board must attach to a thorough and exact knowledge of the courses of study, entrance and graduation requirements, standards of instruction and training, and equipment, of the state schools for the purposes of inspection of other •chools. That private schools should know early in the year the standards by which they are to be measured is also apparent. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">15 The instructions given the board by the State Superintendent ■when the law became operative are as follows: 1"We shall make the Peru State Normal the standard of measure - for all schools recognized on the basis of the state normal schools; the University of Nebraska the standard of measurement for all &gt;ls recognized on that basis. "We shall have to move with considerable dispatch in this busi - ness and proceed at once with the work of inspection. I desire you to report at Peru, Monday morning, April 29, 1907, to put in two days of inspection there, in order that you may know what to require of pri - vate and denominational schools seeking recognition on the basis of the state normal schools. I want a thorough and impartial inspection. The new law providing for a two-year high school education or its equivalent as the minimum entrance requirement at the state normal schools must be taken into consideration. You will note that the two-year high school course of study, as given on page 6 of the Ne - braska High School Manual issued jointly by the University of Nebraska and this department, is the standard of measurement. I have gone over this two-year course of study with Inspector Reed, and I am mailing you a copy with the changes made therein as agreed upon between the university and this department. t"In the inspection of private and denominational schools, you be careful to note that the two-year preparatory course which they now establish is the equal in every respect to the course outlined le High School Manual, if not literally identical. I take it for ted that these private and denominational schools will desire to ilish a preparatory course rather than refuse admission to persons have not such academic qualifications. "There are now no private or denominational schools that have recognition and authority to grant teachers' certificates this year, as the old law was repealed and the new law passed with the emergency clause. However, it is not our desire to work any hardship on any school or its students by putting increased requirements into force before September 1, 1907, and I shall consider it the intent of the law to give all schools recognized under the old law authority to grant teachers' certificates this year as in previous years since their recog - nition. Let it be understood that every private and denominational school recognized under the old law on the basis of the state normal schools must measure up to the standard of the graduates of the state normal school at Peru who receive certificates there this year prior to September 1, 1907. In other words, no student at a private or denom - inational school shall be granted an elementary state certificate, a first grade state certificate, or a life cerificate on a less number of credits or scholarship than Peru will require ot its graduates for these various grades of certificates on or before September 1, 1907. The same will ve true of those institutions recognized on the basis of the University of Nebraska. After September 1, 1907. every private or denominational school recognized on the basis of the state normal schools or the university or both must each year meet all entrance requirements, degree requirements and professional training require - ments demanded at the State Normal Schools and University of Ne - braska for teachers' certificates as provided under the new law. "After the inspection of the state normal school at Peru and the University of Nebraska, we shall proceed at once to inspect private and denominational schools recognized on the basis of one or both of these state institutions. We shall endeavor to inspect all schools in time for their graduate* to know wheher I - muster for state certificates. No omnibus inspection is to t Kach and • </seg>

The is of the institution must show how long each such applicant has been in attendance thereat, what studies he has pursued, and how much time he has devoted to each subject. Each school must also show the qualifications of its instructors, where they were educated, and what their standing in the educational world is. I "In the inspection of every private and denominational school ire recommending that a certificate be granted to any student ■ein, satisfy yourselves that the course of study at such institution quivalent to that of the state institution on the basis of which &gt;eks recognition, that it has a faculty of instructors fully competent ;ive and who are actually giving satisfactory instruction in the lired branches, and that the entrance requirements, degree require - t.s and professional study requirements, and the time required for completion of the course of study is the same as at the state insti - an by which it is to toe measured." The Board spent two days in Peru. They visited classes, talked students and teachers, inspected the model school closely, looked into the equipment, examined the office records, compar? 1 the printed requirements and class work with those in actual operation. They finally met all candidates for certificates together and gathered from them the data given on blanks planned for the particular jiurpo.se of ascertaining their fitness for certification. The data included such items as age, date of entrance, weeks attended, previous preparation, experience in teaching, credits accepted by Peru from other schools, credits earned at Peru and date of expected graduation. These blanks were filled out in the presence of the Board and collected. They were then compared with blanks from the office giving like information. KAt the University of Nebraska inspection was confined for lack me to the course of study outlined for the Department of Educa - but the records of graduates from that department were ascer - d as at Peru. In this manner the standards were established for private normal schools and colleges. I In all other institutions the same plan of inspection was followed, andidates for certificates were met by the Board, were required 1 the blanks which were later compared with the office blanks, the applicants were declared "passed" or "not passed" and their ■ filed with the State Superintendent. When schools just e commencement sent in certificates to foe countersigned by the Superintendent, in no instance was the signature affixed unless the was found placed on the "passed" list from that school. All the blanks collected and reports filed are now in the office of the State Superintendent. ■Such in brief is the plan of inspection. Profiting by experience work will be much improved this year by the Board and also tly facilitated by better blanks. </seg>
            <seg id="p044">EUiHT YEARS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 17 B Perhaps the most important change will be the thorough visitation ie schools during the year, and a second time just before com - ement for the gathering of data concerning individual stud The attitude of all schools was in every case friendly and cordial. More than this, all schools evinced a willingness, even an eagei to meet any requirement however rigid, and any standard hov high. But in each case also followed the statement, "We want to know that all schools are held to the same standard." The Board became a kind of clearing house for charges and complaints against the various institutions. These charges and plainfs were investigated and the results made known to the plaining school. Here are a few specific examples Kit was stated that Peru was to graduate a student with certain encies in entrance requirements and time of attendance according s own standard. Upon investigation it was found that the man's j was not on the list of graduates. It was also charged that Fremont Xormal had been graduatir was about to graduate immature students, mere children, upon a few weeks attendance. What this school has done in the past the Board does not presume to know, but in justice to the school it ma that this summer there were thirty-three applicants for life anil grade state certificates who averaged twenty-four years of age with none younger than nineteen, and whose experience in teaching averaged three years. The complainant acknowledged that he had been informed concerning this year's class at least. t Again, the rumor was persistent that Kearney Xormal had ed its enrollment with children and had by so doing reduced the dance upon the city schools to a noticeable extent. The BoarS I there a student body probably as mature in appearance as that in other normal school. When the blanks were collected it was I that only a very few graduates were residents of Kean B Various and conflicting were the charges and complaints. In fact, ly every school was criticized by some other. While in a few i there was reason for criticism it should be stated that in .nces the charges were entirely groundless. IThe Board took things as they found them, not as they were in the Only once, at the request of the State Superintendent, did they tigate back records. KOne of the elements of strength the system possesses is the inty of a full investigation of charges of irregularity made by any in against a school. Thus far the paper has been confined for the most part to a detailed description of methods of inspection. In this visitation of schools the Board made some interesting observations and formed some equally interesting opinions. Some of these observations and opinions together with some of my own I shall now review for the </seg>
            <seg id="p045">18 K deration of this representative body of educators. Understand, ver, that other members of the Board and the State Superinten - are in no way to be held responsible for any statements made in aper. 1(1) Inasmuch as the efficiency of the law depends upon a correct •rstanding and interpretation of the standards maintained in the i schools, it is necessary that the Board as well as all private schools ully informed as to courses of study, entrance and graduation irements, and all other regulations common to normal schools colleges. It is al&amp;o necessary that they 'be notified promptly of changes or variations in the same. Emphasis is placed upon the r because of the reasonable flexibility in regulations and stand - necessary in any school. For a full and free discussion of all questions pertaining to the law, representatives of all state and private schools, the Examining Board and the State Superintendent, should meet in conference each year during the October meeting of Superintendents and Principals, or the State Teachers' Association. That the State Superintendent and the heads of the State Normal Schools are friendly and helpful in their attitude towards private and denominational schools cannot be questioned in the light of what now follows. A desire to insure a feeling of absolute Justice, and to assure private and denominational schools of harmony between the paper and actual requirements by which they are measured, evidently prompted the action. 'Nov. 2, 1907. "Supt. C. A. Fulmer: I have just conferred with President Crabtree of the Peru State al School, and we have agreed to request the Board of Education e State Normal Schools not to grant any certificates to grad - from the state normal schools or junior normal schools until -edentials have been passed upon by the State Board of Examiners (e certificates. We shall take this matter up with Pres. Thomas e Kearney State Normal School at the earliest opportunity and e he will join with us in this request. J. L. McBRIEN, State Superintendent.' The following was telephoned to me two or three days later: "I have talked with Pres. Thomas over the telephone today, and he agrees with us in our request to the Board of Education relative to the State Hoard of Examiners passing upon the applications of can - didates from the state normal and junior normal schools before certifi - cates are granted. J. L. McBRIEN." tin order to further insure the Board of Examiners of his willing - to co-operate in the work of inspection, Pres. Crabtree writes the uring under date of November 20: "In case your committee is willing to take the additional work on itself, Peru begs to submit lists of graduates and data for each graduate for your approval before submitting these lists to the </seg>
            <seg id="p046">19 11 of education. Possibly it may be worth while in your deal - with other schools to favor us in this manner. I am sure such an igement will be of value to us. We will greatly appreciate your ng suggestions and criticisms regarding our work just as you make sstions and criticisms on the work of other schools and colleges I While this school has been taken as one of the standards of iurement, we will be pleased to have your assistance in the matter stting right standards for the schools required by law to meet irements of the state schools. The tendency here is to advance lards possibly more rapildy than should be done. If we are re - ng more than you consider wise to require of other schools give word of caution. If wise at any time to increase entrance require - :s or certificate requirements a recommendation of the committee be favorably received. In other words this school wil be pleased to upon your committee not only as inspectors and examiners but as lers as well. J. W. CRABTREE." 1(2) The entrance requirements for state schools as prescribed by new law are adequate and should be met by standard normal 3lS. (3) In the past, all normal schools to a greater or less extent, have been accustomed to accept for normal training subjects grades from high schools, academies, and even eighth grades, all of which are on purely academic work. In this way large numbers of elementary certificates have been granted on very little instruction in methods and in some cases none at all. The increased entrance requirements in force this year will make the call for such concessions lew urgent, but surely every student should be required to take the normal training work except in a few cases where possibly experience or other equally valuable training may be substituted. (4) It may not be generally known, but it is a fact nevertheless, that the elementary state certificate has come to stand for very little in the way of education or training. Hundreds of these certificates have been issued in past years and many of them the year just closed which stand for one year of normal schooling beyond the eighth grade and that year not much but review of common branches except for a certain amount of observation work. This means that numbers of holders of the elementary state certificates, supposedly honored people, could scarcely enter the tenth grade of a good high school. Now of course under the new law the increased entrance requirements of at least two years of high school work will lend to this certificate a higher tone but even then it is doubtful whether it longer merits a place in our certification system. Time will reveal the effects of the bettered conditions. (5) The propriety of authorizing Junior Normals to Issue the elementary state certificate, in view of their shifting faculties and short terms, has been questioned by many friends of the Junior Normal movement. At least, it would seem wise to have the appli - cants for certification passed upon the same as those in other school.. </seg>
            <seg id="p047">20 (6) Standards in school work cannot be invariable, neither can requirements be inflexible. For these reasons comparison with a stan - dard school is often beset with difficulties. For example, Peru grad - uates a mature man, with two or three years of credit from the University of Nebraska, considerable experience in teaching, in twenty-four weeks. This ought not necessarily to mean that another school may graduate an eighteen year old girl with three years credit from a high school, in twenty-four weeks. They are not parallel cases. Again, work done in a class numbering one hundred, especially In a subject such as algebra, cannot 'be as efficient and thorough as In a class of twenty-five. In a standard school a subject is pursued 36 weeks, 5 recitations a week, with 45 minute periods. What may be reasonably be con - strued as an equivalent for this* in a private school where the same subject is pursued 36 weeks, 5 recitations a week, and 60 minute recitations? In other words, if in the standard school under conditions m stated above 30 weeks is the minimum time for certification, would 22 Vz weeks be the equivalent under conditions as stated above in the private school? All will agree that allowance in time should be made for maturity of student, and long periods of recitation, but how much is the question. Ii 7 i The Peru Normal School has marked an epoch in the history ucation in Nebraska by placing at the head of its training school ong public school man who knows the needs of teachers and rstands how to train them. This should not be understood as tlcism of Prof. Rouse's, predecessor, for the Peru training school model of excellence in most particulars. But Normal Training rtments which are supposed to fit teachers for the public schools direction of a supervisor who is intimately acquainted with the public school system and the normal school. It Is an example irmal school administration to be emulated. KThe movement, advanced, if not introduced into the state, by Pres. tree, to add to normal school faculties a few strong, experienced, practical city superintendents, county superintendents, and high &gt;1 principals, is but an indication of true educational growth in aska. I In keeping with this idea, universities and colleges which train lers, should add to the faculties of their Departments of Education k just such men and women. This plan would tend to neutralize ultra theoretic training of teachers which is so often criticized, out sacrificing scholarship in the least. If the University of Nebraska establishes a Teachers' College for the training of teachers and undoubtedly such a step would be gen - erally applauded, a part of its faculty it would seem should be composed of men and women who have enjoyed recent successful experience in general public school work. </seg>

            <seg id="p050">21 I That all institutions in the state affected by the new law willingly lend their co-operation and assistance in meeting reasoa - requirements qr standards, is evidenced by the following 1 extracts from letters, written for quotation In this paper. The following questions were submitted to the heads of these schools: ■ ( 1 ) In your opinion, what of good have the enactment of the law and the work of inspection accomplished thus far? ■ i L' I What faults 'or weaknesses have you discovered in the or in the plan of inspection as followed the past year? ■ What suggestions for a more Beneficial plan of insp you offer? Pres. A. O. Thomas of the Kearney State Normal "In answer to question (1). — I think some good has a! accrued from the inspection of schools. In the first place it matter to make a fine showing on paper, of course of stud&gt; but it is easy to grow lax in enforcing your own rules. I think the Inspection will bring about better work and insure the completion of the courses of study laid down. 2nd. There are some weaknesses in the law, not necessarily in the law but in humanity. Stu:lents may enter most of the schools from the eighth grade, or even earlier. They can take preparatory studies. It is easy to give credit in own school later on in the courses for work done in preparatory courses. It will foe" a hard matter to adjust this properly. I think the plan of inspection as followed last year is all right, with the excep - tion of the time devoted to it. By starting in earlier, you will be able to give whatever inspection the school needs. During the last spring you were hurried from one school to another, and also ham by pressure of your duties at home. No doubt the committee will be able to go into a school and remain until it has complete inspection in a satisfactory manner, without being hurried away li the work is entirely done. 3rd. I do not know that I have suggestions that would be of any particular value. As tinu - by you will have to work out your own devices and methods of tical and professional inspection. If you have the data on hand before you start out, you will know what to look for when you the school; for example, if you have the notation concerning in - structors, their education, experience, etc., if you also know the nu of pupils in the school, the number in the different classes, an i a partial report from the heads of the institutions before you leave office, it will give you something upon which to work in the institution. I believe it is all right to have the students fill out the blank them - selves, but the blanks should be so arranged that there wouli be no difficulty in determining the wishes of the committee in the answer: for example, the classification of courses of study should be definite." Pres. J. W. Crabtree, Peru State Normal. "(1) I am of the opinion that the new law and the work of Inspection has already had the effect of increasing the thoroughness and the efficiency of work in some of the private schools, and that the visits and suggestions of the committee have been of inspirational value to state schools, colleges, and private^ schools alike. (2) There may be a question as to the principle of giving private schools the same right of certification as schools fully controlled and operate </seg>
            <seg id="p051">22 I state. I would consider it quite safe to grant this privilege to &gt;wed colleges. It can be hardly be considered safe to give tbe liege to schools operated to make money for its owner without most rigid inspection. The present plan seems to be adequate. I would recommend shifting the burden of responsibility from State Superintendent to the commission recently appointed by the b Association, or to the regents of the university together with the I Board of Education. The same inspection plan should be con - ed. " Dr. H. K. Wolfe, University of Nebraska. I "I fear the spring is expecting too much of some of the little lets which proceed from it. As one of said tricklets or trick - i 1 am densely ignorant of specific instances. You can't help B good by your presence' in such places. If there is any opposition ould like to lend my head for a battering ram. You ought to more power and I think you ought to visit doubtful schools ■ frequently and in the aggregate spend more time in such schools you felt able to do the past year. This same committee might examine into the requirements for the bachelor's degrees." Pres. Wm. E. Schell, York College. EThe new law and the work of inspection referred to in your communication, constitute a long step forward in respect to mity in the character and amount of work, not simply scheduled per, but actually done by candidates for state certificates, during attendance at the recognized educational institutions of Nebraska, no objections to the said law nor suggestions for a more beneficial )f inspection." Pres. Geo. Sutherland, Grand Island College. "I have no suggestion to make in regard to a different plan. I have discovered no faults or weaknesses in the plan of inspection or in the law authorizing the inspection of private schools. I think that the certainty of an annual visit will make all schools very careful to come up to the standard which the law places before them. This effect will be seen in schools that have maintained high standards. It will be Men also in schools that have been suspected of failing to come up to proper standards of work. The need is that the committee shall do their work without fear or favor. No school should wish to receive * recognition that it does not earn. In my judgment the personnel of the committee is more important than the plan. I hope the com - mittee of last year will be continued." Pres. J. M. Pile, Nebraska Normal College. "It will lead to greater uniformity in courses of study and per - haps to more substantial work that each line of work may show absolute strength in preparation of teachers. Each school must prove Its worth 'by work as seen by disinterested examiners whose duty it is to see every weakness as well as every excellence. Each instructor will be anxious for his department to show at least equal strength with other departments of the school and the head of each school must ■see that his compares favorably with others doing similar grade of work. Doubtless it will lead to a better understanding of the edu - cational conditions and ideals of the various schools thus enabling each to profit by strong points in others. (2) I see no faults. I am satisfied unless it should be that the examining power should fix a minimum course for all schools — definite — for different grades of certificates. (3) The only suggestion I care to make is the time. </seg>
            <seg id="p052">23 talize the examiners have been limited in time for this work and generally judge the work in short time. However, if the work ■ach member of the faculty could be looked Into the examiners d the better judge of both strength and weakness. The heais or various schools will encourage the Board to do this. I feel con - it. Have heard no complaints from anyone concerning the plan of nination. Personally I am pleased to have the examination for school." Pres. Guy W. Wadsworth, Bellevue College. I "(I) I think the new law and the inspection have accomplished t good. The inspectors by their encouragement and criticism ■ certainly a help to Bellevue. (2) I have no suggestion to make le matter of inspection. I am glad the work was thorough and not ere form. (3) We are trying to make our Normal School as as any in the state and welcome any suggestions from as good ol men as any one of the three on the State Examining Commit- Pres. A. E. Turner, Hastings College. i"I can only say that, on account of the change in the head of the rtment, I am unable to answer specifically, the inquiries which make. It is the opinion of our Dean, and other members of the Itv, that the plan has 'been helpful to our work and in no way ful. As to its faults or weaknesses, I shall be able toward the of the year to express intelligently, our opinion. I hope we may the pleasure of a visit from you during the winter." Pres. M. P. Dowling, Creighton University. "I take it for granted that the purpose of the law is to secure as many capable and well-trained teachers as possible; but the exist - ing laws bar out a number of persons who would form excellent material for the teaching profession. Plenty of young people, when they begin to study, have no very definite idea of what they will do when they have finished their high school or college course. Their Immediate intention is to acquire a good education and they leave to - the future the determination of the particular way in which they shall apply it. At the close of their school-days, when the problem of adopting a life-work, or simply making a living, confronts them, their ideas take more definite form. This is especially true of those who are not compelled to work their way through school but depend upon their parents for support. At the end of their school-course an opportunity to enter the teaching profession presents itself and they would be very glad to accept the chance, but unfortunately they have taken no normal or pedagogical training whatever, because they never thought of taking up that occupation. The legal requirements, which are prohibitive, prevent them from becoming teachers in the class to&gt; which they feel they belong. Nevertheless, their general education, their mental equipment, their intellectual development, their actual knowledge, their ambition to succeed, their willingness to work, their adaptability, their tact, all make them more desirable as teachers than those of fewer attainments but who have covered the history of educa - tion, methods of teaching, hygiene and other required branches. Now. would it not be well to so frame the law. that those otherwise fitted by their knowledge, charcter and intellectual development, to become good teachers, could make up the purely technical requirements bv a special course, during which they would concentrate their attention on these subjects for a number of assigned periods or hours? I feet confident that if this were done, you could get many very desirable can - didates into the teaching profession. Ton would thus open the doors. </seg>
            <seg id="p053">24 I to incompetents, but to capable persons vouched for by schools that known to require thorough work in all branches they undertake to h, and whose work in the line of general education can ue ained and passed upon by your visiting committee. I think also better results would be attained if the inspection were directed er to assuring the committee that the school does thorough work be general curriculum of teaching than in specific attention to minor details of school management and discipline, much of ih must be largely theoretical and can afterwards be supplied by I rainy man who hes not taken it up ex professo during his school -se. I would prefer an examiner to come into a school and see thoroughly the students are taught, what they know and how they lire their knowledge; because I believe that a student will gain valuable object lessons from the earnestness, good methods and staking efforts of a capable teacher, as he will from such theoretical ructirn as is rften imparted. Natural aptitude, tact, liking for the k and ambition sometimes have more to do with success i the amount of technical instruction received, it would be for advantage of the school which needs a teacher, if B. A.'s and grad - * of high schools could be permitted conditionally to teach, while living themselves in the technical stu'i. "Some of the most gifted men in our country, men who subse - quently mace their mark as statesmen, jurists and diplomats, began life as Echcol teachers, when the restrictions were fewer for the candi - date than they are new; and who will dot'bt that men of their calibre, native ability &gt;f character an1 manhood qualifications, even though they revoted themselves only for a limited time to teaching, would have a far more telling influence on the minds and lives of their pupils than those of inferior mental power who have met the present demand for theoretical training and who fill all the requirements of curriculum preparation. I would lay more stress on force of character, mental power and scholarship, without disregarding the technical preparation; and I would let down the bars somewhat in favor of those ■who can add vigorous manhood to the knowledge required in a teacher." Prof. W. R. Jackson, Nebraska Wesleyan University. KI. The enactment of the new law and work of inspection resulted in establishing a standard of requirements for the various &gt;ls. It gives an opportunity to ascertain whether the standard is met or whether work is credited that is inferior in true cultural ■. such as will cheapen the course and the certificate. Kit has resulted in establishing a checking system as to the time &gt;nt. Students can not do as much work in a term of ten weeks a semester of eighteen weeks. It should give to county super - dents and school officers some assurance that those receiving state Icates of a certain class have all had at least a minimum of ssional training. II think the law is all right; it has a tendency to centralize &gt;lacing the determining of accrediting in the office of the State irtment of Education and the State Board of Examiners. It is the : economical and consistent method of dealing with the problem, new law simply adds new duties to a board already in existence board that is peculiarly adapted to this special work in that it was jned from the first to determine who should receive state cer - ites. It stands for no particular school, but is thoroughly dem - tlc in its organized capacity. Its one aim is to secure for the ols of the state from the various institutions the best possible t of teachers. </seg>
            <seg id="p054">25 Kag and the weak points of each. It may thus be able to suggest how weak places may be made stronger. It is a'ole to pass on to other ols the strong features. I deem it one of the best movements the state has made for education. It reduces to something of a system and brings unity and r out of a number of disassociated institutions. Kit has a tendency to do away with the quick-meal process of ing out certificates. It is becoming more evident that it is not so h to the credit of an institution that it is able to grind out the est grist of certificates. Genuine quality of work and fitness ior hing are in greater demand. tl believe the committee has done much to raise the standard: yet its work has just begun. The system of "checking-up" oyed last spring was very good. kit. Considering the shortness of the time for working out the in. the State Board is to be congratulated upon the strength efficiency of its plans. The board seems to be working In the direction, and, so far as it has gone, there seems to be no for adverse criticism. III. Among the things that may be suggested as possible means of making the inspection more beneficial may be mentioned the following: 1. Schools should not be informed when the inspeetioi made. ■ 2. A longer time should be given to the inspection of each tution. Several inspections should be made. 4. Upon reaching an institution, the state board of inspectors should mark out their own program of visitation. The length of recitation periods should be taken carefully Into account, as also the general average of time occupied in prepa - ration of lessons. ■ The number cf subjects carried should not be more than will it of a thorough mastery. K7. The length of terms should be counted by weeks to see ter the number of subjects completed is disproportionate to the employed. 8. The plan and management of the observation work should e special attention to ascertain whether it is professional in its nature or a mere empty form. What special professional training have the critic teachers had? Are there adequate discussions ot aim, subject matter, and teaching processes? Is child-nature properly takffl into account? K9. Do advanced normal students have actual practice in teach- How long are the daily teaching periods? Do they teach more one subject? How many weeks of practice teaching are given? : is the total number of hours of teaching each must do? ■ 10. How is the training school organized? Do teachers oversight of a grade other than the one they are teaching? 11. Are educational principles and correct teaching processes •brought out. or does the aim seem to be to cram the mind with memory of mere facts? No doubt all of these things, and many other features looking toward more effective inspection, have already had the consideration of the board of inspectors. May the good work go on! D. B. Perry, Doane College. "(1) Such inspection calls special attention to the privilege </seg>
            <seg id="p055">26 - both teachers and students keyed up to do better work. It brings about closer connection between the college and our great public school system and thereby secures heartier co-operation. We have discovered no weaknesses. We should be glad to see one or more of the examiners oftener." I No answer was received from President Clemmons of Fremont ege doubtless because the letter reached him about the time of recent flre in his school.. It was probably lost. Dr. .1. A. Beattie, University, replied by saying that he had misplaced the •r and if there should be time to send him the questions again he \i be glad to answer. There was not the time. Certainly if the law has accomplished anything in the way of gooci. the heads of these schools deserve the praise for their helpful co-operation with the board. The board is under a double debt of gratitude to Pres. Crabtree and Registrar Redmond who gave them their whole time for two days, together with the office force, in assist - ing in the formulation of plans, and the arrangement of blanks and reports. To their help and courtesy whatever efficiency the system of iaspection has attained, that is, as far as the plan is concerned, is in large measure due. In this, as in other recent acts of school legislation, State Supt. McBrien has been the leading spirit, directing the work of the board with wisdom and skill. KThe state has reason to be proud of her state schools and as welt &gt;rivate educational institutions. ■The new law promises the maintaining of high educational lards, the elevation of the tone of teachers' certificates, and the [ial unification of the whole school system of the state. Conference on Certification BOn Thursday forenoon, September 3, 1908, an important confer - on certification matters was held in the office of the state super - dent, at which representatives of all schools concerned were ■nt. After a careful and exhaustive report by the state board of exam - iner* for life certificates on the work of inspection for the year just past, the conference unanimously adopted the following resolutions: KThat on and after September 1, 1909, no elementary state cate or second grade state certificate shall be granted by any insti - unless such certificate shall comprise all the subjects required first grade county certificate, and that no such certificate shall anted on less than a three year high school education, or its ilent, plus twenty-four weeks resident attendance. 2. That on and after September 1, 1908, the rule for reckoning the time element shall be the same as that used by the North Ontral Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. The basis for fixing the length of the recitation period and the number of recitation periods per week is as follows: About 800 minutes (not to exceed 850) per week in recitation. </seg>
            <seg id="p056">27 iiinutes, to find the number of recitation periods per week. If the th of the recitation period is forty minutes, the number of reci - &gt;ns per week will be 20; if the length of the period is fifty minutes, number of recitation periods per week will be sixteen. Forty is mmended as the minimum and fifty as the maximum length of recitation period. This does not include the time for changing is but time spent in solid recitation. Music, physical training, :ary training apd such cultural work may be carried in aidition le number of recitation periods per week as found 'by this division. ■3. That on and after September 1, 1908, the basis of earning ts at institutions authorized by law to grant teachers' certificates he same as used by Nebraska high schools accredited to the ersity of Nebraska.

That on and after September 1, 1909, no first grade state ficate shall 'be issued on less than a four-year high school educa - , or its equivalent,, plus fifty-two weeks' attendance at some recog - 1 institution, twenty-four weeks of which must be in the institution ting the certificate. E&gt;. That on and after September 1, 1909, no elementary or d grade state certificate shall be granted to juniors on less than r-year high school education, or its equivalent, plus twenty-four 5' resident attendance. 7. That on and after September 1, 1908, the state board of examiners for life certificates shall not consider that a student has finished the required technical work who is short on time. K Colleges and universities granting the university state teachers' Icate of the first grade should observe the following requirement ! by the University of Nebraska: KThat on and after September 1, 1908, the forty hours under title, cial Knowledge" be divided, if possible, between a major of 1 6 s and two minors of 12 hours each: otherwise, hold to the irement as shown on pages 186-188, Bulletin University of Ne - ka, 1908-9. 1 Institutions granting normal first and second grade state cer - tes should observe the following requirements for observation practice teaching made by the state normal schools, and maintain •alents: Observation Work in Training Cowse Required one recitation period of 45 minutes daily for 36 weeks, and two preparation periods daily for 36 weeks, or one-fourth the student's time. The lowest minimum in time, as a result of experience or advanced scholarship, is 2 4 weeks, requiring one-fourth of the students time on the observation work. (Half of the period is used for observation work daily and the r half for discussion, laying the foundation work for the next day's ■vation and for directing assigned readings. The student is assigned ings and note book work so as to require the same time in prepara - as arithmetic or grammar. Notice that in this course the observa - work is expected to have one-fourth the student's time for recitation one-fourth of his time for the preparation of the work. 4 </seg>
            <seg id="p057">28 Observation Work in Junior Ye*r. Required one period of 45 minutes daily for 18 weeks and two preparation periods of 4 5 minutes each for 18 weeks, or one-fourth the student's entire time and work for 18 weeks. The actual observation U for three days a week, and special methods tased largely on the results of observation the other two days. The observation work may all be completed and then the special method work continued daily. 'Pro'essionjil Teaching for Juniors . In order to get the elementary (second grade) certificate for the completion of the junior year, the work must include the following minimums: Psychology 5 hours (that is, five recitations per week). history of education 4 hours, observation work 5 hours. The student must have all work completed below the senior year, or near enough for completion in the senior year and one summer school. Practice Teaching for Seniors. iThe required practice work is one-fourth a student's time for one . that is 1 recitation period daily and two preparation periods. He recitation period of practice work, one-half the period, or twenty ites (the length of a recitation in the model grade school) is &gt;ted to actual practice work and the other half to the observation lie practice teaching of another senior. In the model high school recitation period is forty-five minutes. The preparation consists in preparation of lessons, making plans, doing assigned readings and attending conferences. The preparation of work is considered just as essential as practice teaching itself. No amount of successful experience as a teacher excuses a student from observation work and practice teaching.

Junior &amp;{prmal Schools. Junior normal schools were first established in Nebraska by the legislature of 1903. This law provided for five tchools, three of which were located by the legislature at Alliance, McCook, and Valentine, and two of which were to be located by the state superintendent. </seg>
            <seg id="p058">29 These two schools were located at Holdrege and North Platte by State Superintendent Wm. K. Fowler before the location of the state normal school at Kearney by the board of education of the state normal schools. The appropriation of the legislature of 1903 for the main - tenance of the junior normals was $12,000. During the first biennium for these schools all of this appropriation was expended and in addi - tion thereto over $6,000 was contributed for their maintenance by the patriotic people of Alliance, Holdrege, McCook, North Platte, and Valentine, and the counties in the territory of these schools. In addition to this donation, these towns placed at the disposal of the state their school buildings and grounds, books and apparatus, which in the aggregate represent over $175,000 in school property. tin December, 1904, Superintendent Fowler recommended to the lature of 1905 that an appropriation of $18,000 be made 'or these jls during their second biennium. The governor and the state :or in that year presumed to have the right to pass upon this late and scaled it down to $12,000, but the legislature of d the appropriation to $15,000. This appropriation was all ex - ed during that biennium and in addition thereto the good people lliance, Holdrege, McCook, North Platte, and Valentine again ■ibuted over $7,500 for the maintenance of these schools. The first junior normal law made the term ten weeks. The law as amended in 1907 makes the term not less than six nor more than eight weeks. The length of term at these schools for 1907 was seven -weeks, for 1908 six weeks. The junior normal law as amended by the legislature of 1907 provides for eight junior normals, three of which were located by the legislature at Alliance, McCook, and Valentine. This left five to be located by the state superintendent. March 30, 1907, applications for a junior normal school had been received from the following places: Albion, Alliance, Alma, Broken Bow, Central City, Geneva, Holdrege. McCook. North Platte, O'Neill, Ord, South Sioux City, and Valentine. On that date we made the following announcement: "No application for a junior normal school will be considered if received at this office after April 15." Up to that date no additional applications were received, and on April 15 we proceeded to a careful consideration of the applications of all the aforesaid towns. After due deliberation, we decided to locate the five junior normals at our disposal at Alma, Broken Bow, Geneva, North Platte, and O'Neill, provided that these towns would meet the legal requirements. About April 23d we re - ceived an application from Superintendent Perdue with a strong endorsement by Senator Randall for a junior normal school in Madison. K Alliance, Alma, Broken Bow, Geneva, McCook, North Platte, 111, and Valentine having met all legal requirements, in accord - with the authority vested in us, junior normal schools were ed at these places for the year 1907. It will be observed by the * normal law, as amended, that the state superintendent may </seg>
            <seg id="p059">30 change the location of a junior normal school in any year for reason - able cause. It la not necessary here for us to enter into a discussion of all the reasons which prompted us to locate these schools as we did. It may not be out of placs to give some of the reasons. There was not suf - ficient patronage apparent from counties adjoining Boone to locate a Junior normal at Albion. Alma was selected instead of Holdrege on account of the latter being bo near the new state normal school at Kearney. Central City is the seat of the Nebraska Central College, Iurch school, under the management of The Friends. Then, too, ral City is only 64 miles by rail on the main line of the Union Be from Kearney, the seat of the new state normal school. At there was not sufficient sentiment in surrounding counties, on unt of private summer schools at Spalding and St. Paul in adjoin - counties, to warrant locating a junior normal there. The Ne- Ica Normal College at Wayne offers ample opportunities for teach - n northeastern Nebraska, and we did not deem it wise to locate Klor normal at South Sioux City, just across the river from Sioux Iowa. Madison's application came in after we had practically ti upon other places. Madison is only 45 miles by rail from At each place where we located a junior normal school we have letters on file from the county superintendents in the neighboring counties pledging a hearty support and co-operation to make these schools a success. At each of the other places making application for a junior normal school there was no expressed sentiment in behalf of any of them from any county superintendent in a neighboring county. We realise that the responsibility placed upon us in the location of these schools will bring with it some criticism, no matter where we were to locate them. We stated frankly to every member of the legis - lature who conferred with us on the location of these schools that we would much prefer that their location be made by the legislature, but the legislature placed the responsibility upon us. We have made the location In accordance with our best judgment. We confidently expect that the success of these schools will vindicate us in the matter of their location. Five of them are north of the Platte river and in the big sixth congressional district; three of them are south of the Platte river, — two in the fifth congressional district, and one in the fourth congres - siofMl district. We have endeavored to give the greatest good to the greatest number of teachers who would patronize these schools, giving careful consideration to the location of private, denominational and state schools already established. Alma is 107 miles by rail from Kearney and teachers going from there to Kearney have to stop over one night at Oxford. There will be a large attendance at Alma from the home county, Harlan, and from the neighboring counties of Franklin, Furnas, Kearney, Phelps, and </seg>

The junior normal there will give ample opportunity to the teachers of Box Butte county and the neighboring counties of Dawes, Cheyenne, Banner, Kimball, Scotts Bluff, the south half of Sheridan, the north half of Deuel, Grant and Hooker. It is 123 miles by rail from Broken Bow to Kearney. Custer county is four times the size of the average county. It requires 260 teachers for its public schools. It is more than twice the size of Rhode Island. It is evident that Custer county alone is entitled to a junior normal school, but there will be teachers in attendance from the counties of Logan, Thomas, Blaine, Loup, Garfleld, Valley and Sher- The success of the union normal institute at Geneva in 1906 is sufficient reason for the location of a junior normal there. There were 450 teachers in attendance at the union normal there for six weeks last summer. There will be a large attendance from the home county of Filmore, and the neighboring counties of Clay, Jefferson, Nuckolls, Saline, and Thayer. Geneva is about midway between the two state normal schools at Peru and Kearney, and will accommodate a great number of teachers in the south central half of the state. McCook is the unquestioned educational center for southwestern Nebraska. There will be a large attendance of teachers from the home county of Red Willow, and from the neighboring counties of Frontier, Furcas, Gosper, Hayes, Hitchcock, Chase, and Dundy, with Hayes and Hitchcock uniting under the union normal institute law. t North Platte is the county seat of Lincoln county, which is four s the size of the average county in the eastern half of the state, lorth Platte there will be a loyal patronage from the home county incoln, with a good attendance from the neighboring counties of h, Perkins, Dawson, McPherson, Logan, and the south half of &gt;i. There was a strong plea made in behalf of North Platte from hboring counties. t O'Neill, the county seat of Holt county, which is the fourth county te in the state, will have a large attendance from its teachers, over in number, with a good patronage from the neighboring counties ntelope, Boyd, Keya Paha, Rock, Pierce, and the north half of Gar - and Wheeler. Several county superintendents entered a plea in If of a junior normal school at O'Neill. t Valentine, the county seat of Cherry county, — a county four and half times the size of Rhode Island, — has been one of the most essful junior normal schools since their establishment. There will large delegation of teachers from Brown and Sheridan counties ttendance at Valentine, and a loyal patronage from the home ty, Cherry. 1 State Superintendent Wm. K.

Among the true friends of the junior normal schools in gislature of 1905, special mention should be made of Representa- Currie of Dawes, McAllister of Deuel, Perry of Furnas, Horton of Paha, Luce of Hiarlan, Gleim of Red Willow, and Douglas of Rock. The junior normal law, as amended by the legislature of 1907, was introduced in the Senate as Senate File No. 232, by Senators Hanna of Cherry and Phillips of Holt. It was simultaneously intro - duced in the House as House Roll No. 193, by Representatives Gleim of Red Willow, Green of Holt, Logsdon of Fillmore, Henry of Holt, Snyder of Harlan. and Wilson of Custer. The Senate, being composed of thirty-three members, worked more rapidly and the bill was passed there first. When H. R. No. 193 came up for consideration in the House, S. F. No. 232 was substituted therefor. This gives Senator Hanna the honor of being connected with the authorship of both the junior normal laws. All these members of the legislature of 1907 worked in season and out of season for the junior normal cause. Great praise is due them, individually and collectively, for the suc - cess which crowned their efforts. I The legislature of 1907 appropriated only $15,000 for the mainte - e of these schools for the ensuing bienniuni, but as the new law ires the county in which a junior normal school is located to give ■-fourths of its institute fund to the support of a junior normal )1. we had an appropriation of about $20,000 for the bien- This with the local patronage and the enrollment fee for the re and musical course gave us about $25,000 for the biennium. The average number of persons for each faculty during the past two years was nine. Character, scholarship and fitness for the partic - ular work to be done have been the sole criterion in the selection of these faculties. Politics and church have been disregarded. Super - tendent Softley, our opponent four years ago, was a member of the junior normal faculty during the past four years under our appointment at North Platte. Superintendent R. H. Watson, our opponent two years ago, served as the principal of the Valentine junior normal school under Superintendent Fowler's last administration, and Mr. Watson hald the same position during my first term. During the past six years, the enrollment in the five junior normal schools reached over 5,000 teachers. Never did the state do so much good with $42,000 in the training of its teachers or in any other field. We were surprised to find that some members of the legislature, on their first consideration, thought that It meant the erection of normal school buildings in which to hold these summer terms. A careful reading of the law shows that no junior normal school can be established at any place unless the board of education gives the free use of its school buildings, apparatus, and all equipment to such school. This means that the school districts of Alliance, Alma, </seg>
            <seg id="p064">33 Ben Bow, Geneva, McCook, North Platte, OXeill, and Valentine place at the free disposal of the state for the work of these schools, ast $300,000 in buildings, books, and apparatus. I The state cannot find a more economical way for training its iers. We had nearly 1,500 teachers enrolled in these eight junior lal schools the past summer. Many county superintendents testified to the better work accomplished by their schools as a It of the professional training given their teachers in the junior ials. The hearty support given these schools by county superin - pnts. the attendance on the part of teachers, the liberal patronage gentrous donations from each place where junior normals have located, the excellent services rendered the state by thr principals instructors, the heroic efforts put forth by the teachers themselves b a record full of credit and honor. For the maintenance of the eight junior normal schools during the current biennium the state appropriated $15,000. There was raised from the institute funds of the various counties, enrollment few and donations by commercial clubs and patriotic citizens of the junior normal towns a total of $13,832.69. This made a grand total $28,832.69 for the maintenance of these schools during the past two years. It is evident from these figures that too great a burden is placed upon the local people. Besides, we were forced to appeal to the missionary spirit of the instructors, and to shorten the term to seven weeks in 1907 and six weeks in 1908 in order to avoid a defi - ciency. To meet the law requiring eight weeks of normal training for a second grade county certificate, the junior normal schools should maintain the maximum term of eight weeks. Therefore, the legis - lature of 1909 should appropriate not less than $30,000 for the maintenance of the junior normal schools during the next biennium. A detailed statement of enrollments and finances of the junior normal schools for the current biennium is given herewith. </seg>

            <seg id="p069">38 Vitalizing the Teacher. By means of the work and influence of the junior normals. »( Paper read by Supt. George H. Thomas, superintendent city ■Is, McCook, and principal McCook junior normal school, be - the State Teachers' Association, Friday, December 27, 1907.) The decade just closing, immediately following a period of unusual national depression, has, with all its prosperity, industrial expansion, and commercial activity, developed and strengthened ideals that betoken better things for the future. As the historian will con - ceive of the years, much happened that will enrich the pages of history. A war engaged in for humanity's sake; colonial policies thrust upon us meet unexpectedly; the inter-oceanic canal; the hunting out and punishment of public plunderers; the control of predatory wealth, — the treatment of these problems in all their various bearings, have, with the larger and more prominent part taken by the individual in shaping them, revealed an undeniably quicker con - science and a more vigorous vitality, in the national life. It has been period of marked advance along every line. So it has been here at home. Probably no field of accomplish - ment reflects this spirit of the times, representing progress, more truly than does the work of education. The essence of every movement has been sober thought for single units — of special help to pupil, teacher or school. The result has been an educational awakening; pupils and teachers alike have put forth greater endeavors; school con - ditions have been bettered in proportion as increased skill has been acquired. The cause of education has profited from the new stand - ards of ethical belief which have enthused the country at large. The junior normal schools, normal training in high schools, free high school education, aid to weak districts, more rational certification laws, increased normal school and enlarged university opportunities, — these have been the agencies which have promoted this educational revival. The work of the junior normal schools is not to be regarded in any disproportion. As Gilbert Parker makes David say in The Weavers: "Think (not) that what you do is of vast value. Work because it is yours to be adjusting the machinery in your own little work shop of life to the wide mechanism of the universe and time. One wheel set right, one flying belt adjusted and there is a step forward to the final hitmony." Yet the junior normals, in their own peculiar and re - stricted fields, have a most important and exceedingly useful work to perform; and whatever stands as a positive help to the end we seek — the perfection of the Nebraska educational system — is of good report before men. In the summer of 1902. State Superintendent W. K. Fowler organized union normal institutes of five weeks' length, at Holdrege. Culbertson and Sidney. These were the precursors of the junior normals. In the following year the legislature appropriated $12,000 </seg>
            <seg id="p070">39 I he biennium for the support of five such summer schools of ten s each, locations being made at Alliance, Valentine, McCook. rege and North Platte. Such an arrangement continued for four i, save that during the last two the state increased the appropri - to $15,000. During the present biennium eight schools are main - d, Alma, Broken Bow, O'Neill and Geneva being added, and rege being dropped, while the length of the term is reduced to&gt; i weeks. The cost to the state is the same. Why have such summer schools at all, and why locate them where they are? Nebraska is a much larger state, territorially than the casual traveler within its confines is accustomed to think. Broken Bow is ••out west," but it is farther from Broken Bow on to Alliance than from Lincoln to Broken Bow. The counties of Cherry, Holt, Custer and Lincoln, at whose county seats junior normals are located, disregarding: any adjoining, and, therefore, contributing districts, are, in square miles, ten times the size of the sovereign state of Rhode Island. la northern and western parts of the state there are perhaps 20 counties with no high schools; there are common schools widely separated. The distances to established schools in eastern Nebraska count up into hundreds of miles, while the expense of reaching them seems all but prohibitive. Yet there are young people here, ambitious, eager, alert, needing only the spur of opportunity to send them on to larger living. The junior normals are placed in the center of these vast reaches of country where the problem is that of overcoming isolation and of insufficient local school facilities. We are carrying normal train- Ing, enthusiasm and pedagogic vitality home to those who have been obliged to teach without them. Again, instruction and normal training being required, under existing state certification laws, the means of acquiring them must be provided, and it seems a pity that public properties, consisting of buildings, books and equipment in general, such as are owned by the school corporations named in the heart of these extreme districts, should remain idle one-fourth of the entire year, when their use could supply an actual need. These properties are used free of cost to the state. Tn this manner emphasis ia laid upon the disproportionate amount of time public buildings, such as schools and churches, are idle in the year's length, and the economic need there is to utilize such a waste. I The spirit of the times is toward centralization, not in one mass, hat would be confusion, but in multiplied centers; and so long as i exists extensive areas of sparsely settled country, so long as large jers of young people, by reason of prohibitive distance or expense, schools nearer home, that long will the demand live for local ial training centers. The five years these junior normals have been in existence stoutly testify to their worth. About 5,000 teachers and prospective teach- </seg>
            <seg id="p071">40 •rs from remote districts have been enrolled, only a small per cent of whom would or could have attended any other Institution of summer training. The cost to the state has not exceeded $150 per week at ■each school. There have been in that time, disregarding the original union normal Institutes, 37 weeks of schooling, a trifle more than a full school year, made up out of the scraps and wastes of time, precious weeks saved and blessed to hardworking teachers, striving winter and summer against odds to advance in their profession. Only consecrated school teachers would bear such a burden, and win suc - cess. Moreover, with this magnificent showing in the junior normals, the senior normals, at Peru and Kearney, have literally turned appli - cants away from their halls, for lack of room, while every private normal has enjoyed a full enrollment. The junior normals have had the effect of impelling student-teachers on to the higher schools for laager and more systematic courses; they have acted as feeders, and hence, Indirectly, have served beneficially in a manner not at first gercelved. But it is not enough that these schools be brought near to those who will attend them, or that the attendance has been large, or that the expense of maintenance has been low ; what have they benefited the Individual? ("Ye shall know them by their fruits ") "A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit, neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit." "Every tree that bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down and cast into the fire." "Wherefore by their fruits ye shall know them." KThe junior normals have done the work cf university extension iking the gospel of betterment in the persons of men and women, uctors and lecturers, into the uttermost parts of the common - th; K These have inspired young men and young women to carry on education in the established institutions of higher learning in asks; KThey have brought under the influence of capable Instructors g people heretofore deprived of very wide opportunities and lsed them with larger purposes; They have offered the means to aspiring teachers to raise their teaching certificate grades and so by that much to become more truly professional in their work; kThey have served as a clearing house wherein qualifications tested and talented teachers promoted to better positions. Four le best grade teachers in the McCook city schools today, were id out" in the junior normal there; KThey have assisted to weed out the incompetent and the shiftless, h, if this were their greatest service, they would still be abundantly Bed before the world; They have so inspired and enthused their students that these students became better teachers. Thus testify the county superintend- </seg>

Doing any one of these things constitutes a vitalization of the teacher and her work. So long as conditions, geographical and educational, remain as they are now, there will be a genuine need out on the edge of things to bring out prospective rural school teachers in contact with the better life, with stimulating lecturers and enter - tainers, with consecrated instructors, with true school spirit, and that long, the junior normal schools, with their systematic short term en of study, ending in definite aim, should be continued, as a vital link in the educational plan, having in view the making of a teacher. cHprmal draining in High Schools. Sketch of the 9(e-w York PUn. I Normal training in high schools is not a new question in the atiowal world. It was first inaugurated in the state of New York t seventy-five years ago. This was before the opening of the first lal school in America at Lexington, Massachusetts, July 3. 1839. William T. Harris, when he was United States Commissioner of nation, declared normal training in high schools as carried out ■r the New York system the most efficient and economical plan devised for giving the rural schools better qualified teachers, is the opinion of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Edu - m in the United States. Hon. Andrew Sloan Draper, Commissioner of Education for the State of New York, jurist and educator of national reputation, in his annual report for 1905, has this to say in behalf of normal training In high schools: "For a long time the state has maintained training classes for teachers in the high schools and academies. These were in charge of the Board of Regents until 1889, when by voluntary action of the Board and then by legislative act, their management was transferred to the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. These classes are not Intended to do the work of the normal schools. They are expected to provide limited instruction in pedagogical courses for beginners in such work who reside in their neighborhood. It often happens that students who begin in these classes acquire an interest in the sub - jects in which they have been drilled to an extent which leads them to go to the normal schools or to pedagogical courses in the colleges and universities. There are over 100 of these training classes in the better academies and high schools in the various parts of the state. They are distributed under appointment by the Commissioner of Educa - tion, with some reference to the ability of the schools to care for them and to the convenience of intending students. The expense of these classes to the state is a little more than $100,000 annually. In the last y«mr they instructed 2,921 students." </seg>
            <seg id="p075">42 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT Kin his annual report for 1906, Commissioner Draper speaks y but eloquently for normal training in the high schools of New ■ "The most fruitful if not the most hopeful source of good teach - for the district schools is found in the training classes. It is dently believed that this agency for providing teachers for the 1 schools will be ever increasing in its efficiency." Kit will be observed from Commissioner Draper's report for 1908 some defects of the law and a false economy on the part of the legislature greatly interfered with the success of normal training le high schools of that state during the year covered by said ■t. He says: ("There were maintained in the secondary schools of the state UK the year. 92 training classes with an enrollment of 1,173 ents. a decrease of 5 in the number of classes and 168 in the ber of students. There were graduated 8 76 teachers which is crease of 309 from the preceding year. The amount expended by state for these classes was $51,000. Total cost to the schools 136.96. "The decrease in number of classes and consequent decrease in number of students and graduates is due in no small measure to the inequitable wording of the statute which makes it uncertain whether the state allotment for maintaining a class will be received by the school. The law requires that a school in order to receive the allot - ment of $500 shall maintain a class of 10 members throughout the year. It is often difficult to secure a sufficient number of students in excess of 10 to insure the continuance of 10 members throughout the year. If by sickness or death or by graduation of part of the class at the end of the first term it becomes impossible to mainain a class of 10 for the entire year the school loses the entire allotment. A teacher has been employed at a minimum salary of $500, the school has had the expense of providing the additional equipment required by the regulations and in the end finds itself, from causes over which it had no control, deprived of the support which it anticipated from the state. Acting in good faith in its endeavor to aid the state in securing trained teachers, the school is made to suffer a financial loss. It is not surprising therefore that a number of school boards decline to assume the risk of maintaining a training class. Of the 92 schools in which training classes were organized the following eight failed to receive the allotment: Andover. Wellsville, Ellington, Oneida, Baldwinville, Cambridge, Palmyra, Pen Yan. Unless the law shall be amended in its reading, it may be confidently expected that the number of training classes will be greatly diminished and that one of the most fruitful sources of supply of teachers for the rural schools will be cut off. In the face of the growing scarcity of teachers, the state cannot afford to pursue any policy other than one of encouragement to schools to organize training classes. The amount of money paid by the state to the schools for maintenance of the 92 classes was $51,200. The cost to the schools for maintaining the classes was $58,134.96 or a net loss to the schools of $6,934.96. Such money loss to the schools must entail a far-reaching and more disastrous loss to tl am confident that the New York legislature will hearken unto the of Judge Draper and so amend the law and increase the appropri - that the great work of normal training in that state may serve </seg>
            <seg id="p076">EIGHT YEARS OP EDUCATIONAL PROGK 43 I purpose for which it was established, and that is to supply the 1 schools with properly qualified teachers. A legislature that 80 ntly appropriated the sum of four hundred thousand ($400,000) irs for the purchase of a site for a state educational building and i in addition thereto appropriated three million five hundred sand ($3,500,000) dollars to erect said building thereon, will hesitate long to make adequate appropriation for normal training igh schools. History of the PUn in Nebraska. ■ This policy was first recommended by State Superintendent K. Fowler in his Seventeenth Biennial Report, from which we the following extracts: "I would recommend the organization of training classes in col - leges, normal schools, and such academies and high ichooli as are able to meet the requirements for such a class. These training classes should be under the unrestricted supervision of the state superin - tendent of public instruction. On or before the first day of July of each year, application for appointment to instruct training classes should t&gt;f presented to the state superintendent by the trustees of the insti - tution desiring such appointment on blank forms provided for the pur- These applications should Bet forth the various facts or informa - tion regarding the school, giving the number of teachers employed, the enrollment in the different departments, opportunities afforled for observation and practice work, the names, qualifications and sa'.aries of instructors. Before being forwarded the application s'aouli be approved by the county superintendent of the county in which such school is located. The idea of permanency is an important factor to be considered in the approval of such schools, for it is essential to retain, as far as possible, the same institutions year after year and make them educational centers for this work. Certain specific require - ments should be prescribed in the regulations issued by the state superintendent as a requisite for approving these institutions, among which are the following: The institution must furnish as an instructor (or instructors) a college graduate or a ncrmal school tjraiuate v.ith three years' experience in teaching since graduation, or the holder of a professional state certificate with three years' experience In teaching: all instructors of such classes must be approved by the state superin - tendent; a minimum salary of $500 must be paid instructors': the school must provide opportunity fcr the members of the class to cl methods of teaching in the several grades of common school work and to teach in such grades under proper supervision; it must conduct course separate from all other r-eitations; ani it must maintain a class, that is. a class of not More than twenty bers for each instructor for at least thirty-six weeks in the year. "Candidates for admission to the training class should possess as a minimum qualification a certificate of graduation from the eighth grade. They should be at ;it the time of en - trance. They should also subscribe in prool fait'i to the following declaration: 'We. the undersigned, hereby declare that our object in asking admission to the training class is to prepare ourselves for teach - ing, and it is our purpose to engage in teaching in the rural schools of Nebraska at the close of such preparation. We pledge ourselves to remain in the class during the year unless prevented by illneFs or ex - i by the state superintendent of public instruction.' ■-■ </seg>
            <seg id="p077">44 "The special mission of the training class is to provide the rural schools, that are not in position to engage normal graduates, with teachers who are proficient in the common branches and have devoted at least a year to special preparation — largely in professional work. province of the normal school and the province of the training class are, therefore, clear and distinct. The two are supplementary agencies and are not to be regaded in any sense as rivals. I am of the opinion that many training class graduates after teaching a few years will be enabled to complete a course of study in a normal school, a step impracticable before they gain a foothold from the training class. The normal school proper cannot supply the demand for teachers in the country districts. Moreover, the graduate from the advanced normal course is, as a rule, beyond their reach, owing to the financial condition of a large majority of the rural school districts. The training class is the only means of providing trained teachers for the country schools." Normal Training Required- IThe law relative to normal training as a requisite for securing a or second grade county certificate is very brief, but definite and irehensive. It was enacted by the legislature of 1905. It reads: |)n and after September 1, 1907, no person shall be granted a first county certificate who has not had at least twelve weeks normal ng in a college, university, or normal school of approved stand - i this or in another state, or in a state junior normal school of ska, or in a liit.li school of Nebraska approved by the state super - li'iit &lt;if public instruction as Ix-inn cquip|x (1 to gtrc such normal nit.

While the statute empowers the state superintendent to prescribe all the requirements for high schools qualifying for normal training, we hesitated to inaugurate a law of such magnitude without the help of the school men and women most deeply interested in the results to be obtained by a proper application and enforcement of it. Therefore at the Association of Superintendents and Principals of Graded Schools at Its session in October, 1905, we requested that a committee be ap - pointed consisting of the president of that association, one member at large, and cne member from each congressional district, the presidents of the state normal schools, and the head of the department of education of the University of Nebraska, with instructions to consider the subject of normal training in the high schools of Nebraska in accordance with the law, acd to report to the State Teachers' Association. The follow - ing committee was appointed, with the state superintendent as ex-officio </seg>
            <seg id="p078">45 tSupt. E. L. Rouse, Plattsmouth, chairman; Supt. A. A. H ir, secretary; Supt W. H. Pillsbury, Falls City; Prin. X. M. Gra- South Omaha; Supt. E. B.

McBrlen, State rintendent, Lincoln. Th? committee held three meetings, counseled with as many prin - cipals and superintendents of graded schools as possible, and call' its assistance the heads of departments of education in colleges, uni - versities and approved normal schools of Nebraska. At the meeting of the State Teachers" Association in December, 1905, the committee made the following report, which was unanimously adopted: (it'iH-ral Requirement*. Kl. A high school in order to be approved for normal training be a school accredited to the University of Nebraska, with a four ' course of study. B2. At least three teachers exclusive of the city superintct, give their entire time to instruction in high school branches. 3. High school gm for high school normal training. 4. The course in normal training shall be elective, and shall consist of the three following lines of study: I (a) A review for at least nine weeks in each of the following; ects — reading, grammar, arithmetic, and geography — -to be given earlier than the eleventh grade. This work should include sub - matter, underlying principles and methods of teaching, and should le the student to approach the subject from the stanipoint of ier as well as that of student.

Certification of Norm*! Training Students. The students of the normal training classes in the high schools are required to take the county certificate examination in theory and art of teaching, arithmetic, geography, grammar, history and reading, and to earn passing grades of 70 or more in these subjects before their normal training work is recognized a? complying with the conditions of sections 7 and 8, subdivision 6, governing normal training as a basis of certification. When the normal training students have earned parsing grades, as above stated, in these six subjects, have done the- </seg>
            <seg id="p082">49 normal training class work under the inspection of the department of education, and have graduated from the normal training high school, their grades, as accepted by the University of Nebraska for entrance to that institution, are accepted towards the completion of their standing for a first grade county certificate, with the sing' ception of American history, in which only the examination grade iken for certification. Every normal training high school is expected to do satisfactory class work in the following subjects: Algebra, botany, geometry. ; ivies and EDglish. In addition to this, most normal training high schools are now adjusting their courses to meet the requirements of the agricultural department of the University of Nebraska so that practically all normal training high schools will do satisfactory work in agriculture for the school year 1908-9. Also many of the stronger high schools are doing advanced work in physiology, which is appr by the University, and perhaps half a dozen high schools are doing work in mechanical drawing, complying with the requirements of the University. We, therefore , give a minimum credit to normal training high schools by reason of graduation from the high school and m ance by the University, of six subjects. Most high schools will have I subjects by the addition of agriculture. Nearly half of the high schools will have eight, by adding physiology to the list, and perhaps six high schools will have nine subjects by the addition of mechanical drawing. There are required nineteen subjects for a first grade county certificate, hence, the graduate of a normal training high school will have to pass the normal training examination which is identical with the teachers' examination in six subjects. He will rec lit in from six to nine subjects by reason of their credit with the State University and he will have to add to this a minimum of foir and a maximum of seven subjects that must be earned on examination without being required in the normal training r&gt; . which are not accredited to the University of Nebraska. All normal training students are required to take the exami: in bookkeeping, mental arithmetic, orthography and penmanship In addition to the examination for the completion of the normal tr« work above outlined, and in addition to the subjects ac accreditment to the University of Nebraska. Success of Work in Nebra.sk*. Kit there were any who ever doubted the success of normal tra: e high schools of Nebraska, that doubt must now be dispell&gt; - esults of the last year, by the number of schools that h.-. and the number of pupils who have registered for the work in schools for the year 1908-9. On September 7, 1907, one hundred six of th? strongest schools in the state, at least one in each representative district, were no - tified to make a showing of their equipment and ability to do this work. </seg>
            <seg id="p083">50 I September 14* a second notification was s.nt, in which it was stated: you wish your school to be considered for this work, see to it that application blank from your board of education and all other nec - ry blanks are filled out and returned to this department not later i October 1, 1907. Similar notice was sent to all these schools 1, 19C8. It was undoubtedly the intent of the legislature when it appro - priated $50,000 for the promotion of this work in the strongest high schools of Nebraska that none but those who actually desire to fit them - - to teach in the public schools of this state upon their gradua - tion from high school should be permitted to take this work. Therefore the following obligation was required of all desiring admission to normal training classes in Nebraska high schools: "We. the undersigned, hereby declare that our object in asking ad - mission to the normal training class in high school is to prepare ourselves for teaching, and it is our purpose to engage in teaching in the public schools of Nebraska at the completion of such preparation. We pledge ourselv s to remain in the class the required time unless prevented by illness cr excused by the state superintendent iblic instruction." iTwo agencies f r supervision have been employe! — examination inspection. The examinations have been conducted under the same i and regulations governing the issuance of teachers' certificates •r tfce certification law. The same care has been exercised in the •ration of questions and grading of answer papers by the state lining board for county certificates. These examinations serve as IaI test of proficiency on the part of those pursuing the instruc - ts well as those giving it. They are therefore an important means istruction and supervision. It is the aim to make the questions xaminati: ns suggestive and directive — teaching questions as as test questions. At least once every term each class in normal training is visited by a representative of this department, who submits a written report •Th? following is the list of 106 schools to whom our letters of rnber 7 and 14, 1907, were mailed: Ainsworth, Alliance, Albion, Alma, Arapahoe, Ashland.

After the reports of the examiners and inspectors are all in, a circular letter based on these reports is issued to the superintendents, principals and normal training instructors, containing general criticisms and suggestions; also a table of results, showing subject by subject the total number of papers submitted, the total number of pi accepted, the total number ninety per cent or above, the number below 60 per cent, and the percentage of accepted papers or passing grades earned. The number of high schools approved for normal training under the act of 1907 for the school year 1907-8 was sixty-eight (68), and the number of juniors and seniors who subscribed to the entrance declara - tion and did the work was twelve hundred twelve (1212); for the school year 1908-9, eighty-six (86) high schools have been approved, and the number of juniors and seniors who have subscribed to the entrance declaration ani are now pursuing the work is fifteen hundred two (1502). This is a showing far beyond the most sangui: taticns of the most enthusiastic friends of the movement in Nebraska. Interesting Points of Comparison- The provisions of the New York law and those of the Nebraska statute form many interesting points of comparison. The minimum qualification in scholarship for entrance to a normal training class in igh schools of New York is a standing of at least 70 per cent in the following subjects, attained in a uniform examination for teachers' certificates: Arithmetic, composition, geography, grammar, penman - ship, physiology and hygiene, American history, aDd civil government. Substituting agriculture for civil government and adding mental arith - metic, you have the Nebraska eighth grade education required for entrance to our high schools under the free high school law. The minimum scholarship for entrance to a normal training class in the high schools of Nebraska is the eighth grade education plus a two year high school education or its equivalent. It takes one year to complete the course in New York; it takes two years to complete it in Nebraska. In other words, the minimum for a normal training teacher's certificate in New York is three years below that in Nebraska. In New York the following course of study is prescribed, for the completion of which the minimum time of one year is required: First term, first period, arithmetic; second period, psychology and principles of education, school management, art of questioning; third period, history of education, American history; fourth period, drawing and general review. Second term, first period, English composition and grammar; second period, geography, physiology and hygiene; third period, reading, civil government; fourth period, school law and general review.

The work in all «tfi of this course, save the purely professional ones, include «t matter, underlying principles and methods of education. In wing them as subject matter, it is the special aim to take them up the standpoint of the teacher rather than that of the •nt; to approach them from the science side rather than the art Contrast this with Nebraska's normal training course which covers tour full years of academic work above the eighth grade, during the last two years of which especial attention is given to a review of reading, arithmetic, grammar, geography, and history, with seventy - two periods of professional training, including psychology-, history and principles of education, school management, and the theory and art of teaching. Attention has already been called to this course of study on a preceding page of this report. I New York normal training high school students who attain a ding of 75 per cent in all subjects of their normal training course entitled to receive a training class certificate valid for three years thereafter renewable for five year periods, if the holder has had at I two years of successful experience under the certificate, which Ificate is good only in the rural schools. Graduates from the normal ling course of high schools in Nebraska with no grade below 65 cent in any one subject and with a general average of at least 75 percent are entitled to a second grade county centiflcate, gooi! for two yean; with no grade below 70 per cent in any one subject and with an ee of at least 80 per cent, a first grade county certificate good for years; with no grade in any subject below 80 and an average grade of at least 85 per cent, a "with credit" first grade county certifi - cate, renewable without examination so long as the holder shows the proper professional spirit; with no grade below 85 per cent and an aver - age of at least 90 per cent a "with honor" first grade county certificate. renewable without examination so long as the holder shows the proper professional spirit. There is ample opportunity, therefore, for the well qualified graduate of the normal training course in Nebraska high schools to earn a certificate practically good for life and one which qualifies the holder to teach any where in the state except in the high school department of a high school district or the high school depart - ment of a city school district. The nineteen subjects required for the first grade county certificate of any grade are arithmetic, English com - position, geography, grammar, history, mental arithmetic, orthography, penmanship, physiology and hygiene, reading, agriculture, bookkeeping, . drawing, theory and art of teaching, algebra, botany, geometry. and physics. KThe New York law requires that schools, in order to receive the tnent of $500 per year, shall maintain a class of ten members lghout the school year. The Nebraska law requires that a school. </seg>
            <seg id="p088">53 In order to receive the appropriation of $350 per year shall maintain a class of ten for at least eighteen weeks each year. It cost the state of New York $51,000 to give 1,171 students normal training in her high schools during the school j It cost Nebraska 17.55 to give 1,111 students normal training in her high schools for the year 1907-8. The cost per capita in New York on the class of ten was $50, while in Nebraska the cost per capita based on the I was $35 for the same school year. And yet, if the New York high schools gave this training at a loss of nearly $7,000, U noted in Commissioner Draper's report, when they received |H capita, it is evident that the Nebraska high schools did not rec*-: remuneration commensurate with trie service they rend - in this great work of supplying professionally trained teachers for the rural schools. Therefore, I reconim;-nd that our law be so amended that a high srhool maintaining a normal training class be paid according to the num - ber of students who complete the normal training course and pa - required examination for a teacher's certificate under the rules now in force for the certification of graduates of normal training high sci Not how many in the class at the beginning, but how many finish the course, — that is the question. The interests of the state, th&lt; of efficiency of the schools, lie not in the large number enrolled, but in the number of students graduated each year. Every person weighs this question carefully in all its phases must admit that in for this work to b? properly done with an equitable remuneration t for an allowance of $10 0 per capita should b? made each year for graduating a class of one to five from the normal training course in each year; and for each additional member of the normal training class who finishes the course up to and including ten, an allowance of $75 per cap - ita each year; and for each additional member of the normal training class over and above ten who finishes the normal training coursr year a per capita allowance of $50; all work to be completed and all accounts settled on or before the second Monday of July in each If we figure the eost of normal training at the Peru state normal on the average daily attendance of all students above the tenth grade for the school year 1907-8, the cost per capita was about $120, but if we base the cost of training teachers at Peru on the New York method, that is, the finished product — graduates from the elementary and advanced courses — the cost per capita at Peru for the school year 1907-8 was nearly $320. The average cost per capita in the Xew York state normals for that school year, according to Commissioner Draper was $450.02, a decrease per capita of $72.04 from the ]&gt;r ing year. It follows, therefore, that whether you base the cost per capita at Peru on the average daily attendance above the tenth grade or on the finished product, we have figured very conservatively when we find it $120 per capita on the average daily attendance and nearly $320 per capita on the finished product. Peru is taken as a basis of </seg>
            <seg id="p089">54 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT comparison because it has been long established and is well organized mod therefore prepared to do the work as economically, measured by its efficiency, as any state normal school in America. 1 maintain that the cost of educating teachers at Peru, based on the average daily attendance of all students above the tenth grade, is a lair estimate of the cost of the finished product from the elementary course there. This is the most conservative method of figuring the cost of normal training of any basis it is possible to use. Up to the time the Ran:. all law went into effect — making the entrance qualifica - tions at the state normals a two year high school education or its equiv - alent — the minimum requirement fcr an elementary state certificate was an eighth gra '■■ education plus cne year's attendance and study at * state normal school. Since the Randall law went into effect in 1907 the minimum standard for an elementary state certificate has been a two year high school education or its equivalent plus twenty-four weeks' attendance and study at a state normal school. From what has already been stated relative to the minimum standard of certification for grad - uates of the normal training course in Nebraska high schools it follows that such a graduate possesses over one year's scholarship above the minimum en which the elementary state certificate is now granted. I am persuaded, therefor, that it is fair to compare the cost to the state of training teachers in our normal training high schools with the cost of training them in the elementary course at the state normal school. K Therefore, I maintain that my estimate as to the amount the should pay our normal training high schools for this great work is ether reasonable and just. Khigh schools would qualify under this plan during ext biennium. It would place at the disposal of the state over 9,000 in buildings, books, apparatus and equipment, and at the time give the state the services of at least 500 professional ?r&amp;, who would train during the next two years not less than 3,000 active teachers — 1,000 of whom would finish the course. If the cost per capita to the state for training teachers in our normal training high schools is less than the cost per capita to the state for training teachers in the elementary course at Peru, it may be well to take into consideration the saving In money to the parents whose sons and daughters are trained at home through the agency of our normal training high schools. It is conservative to say that the average cost per capita for a year's normal training at Peru is at least $200. To be sure, it would cost the parents at least $100 per capita to provide for their sons and daughters if educated at home in the normal training high schools. But the cost to these parents for their sons and daugh - ters to obtain this normal training at Peru would be at least $100 per capita over what i t would cost to give them this training at home. On this estimate it is a saving to the parents of these pros - pective teachers of $300,000 a year, or $600,000 for the biennium. In </seg>
            <seg id="p090">55 Slight of these facts, I consider it my duty to recommend that the legislature make an appropriation of at least $100,000 for the itenance of normal training in the high schools of Nebraska. Expert Testimony. (It only myself bore witness for this cause my testimony may be &gt;ted. Remember that I have already quoted two of America's teat educators — Commissioners Draper and Harris. Some may k these men too far away and that they do not properly understand conditions to speak intelligently upon the question. Hundreds of -aska's leading educators would be glad to testify in behalf of the y of normal training in high schools. Space will permit only of the veterans to speak. Hear their words and let the state profit Prin. A. H. Waterhouse of the Omaha schools writes concerning the class of 1907-8: "There are about forty-five girls taking the work. They have taken for the first term and will continue to take for the remainder of the year American history and civics. During the larger part of the first term they took arithmetic, and for the remainder of the term they have taken grammar, which subject they will finish in the first six weeks of the second term. The subject will be followed for about thirteen weeks with a study of geography. This work will be in charge of Miss McDonald, who for years was one of the best eighth grade teachers in the city, and who has proven herself to be a strong. -taking 1 hijjh PcSool teacher. Reading' will be in charge of two teachers. The drill in reading, or the academic part, will be in charge of Miss Peterson, a graduate of the Chicago University and a student under Professor Clark. Methods in primary reading will be given by Miss Clara B. Cooper, director of the training class, under the direction of the superintendent. Agriculture will be in charge of Miss Stringer. head of the biology department and one of the thre? be?t teachers of botany in the country, according to Dr. Bergen, the text book author. She has recently specialized in this subject. She will also charge of the review in physiology.

(A Symposium on the Mission of the Various Agencies Emi&gt; I in Nebraska for the Professional Training of Teachers.) The Teachers College. Doctor Charles Fordyce. Dean Teachers College University of Nebraska. (At no time in the annals of history has there been such a wide id interest in the scientific study of education as during the last a century. This period has been marked by a constant wrangle een the conservative elements upon the on; hand, and the devotee form upon the other. And educational progress has been niea - ie degree in which the enlightened reformer has proved victor paralyzing influences of blind conservatism. In this movement &gt; events deserve consideration: first, the inauguration of the normal )1; second, the establishment of the university Department of ation; and third, the advent of the Teachers College. The first normal school was established in Massachusetts about a half a century ago, and was instituted for the express purpose of training elementary teachers. And altho this species of training school has been feebly supported by legislatures, and severely criticised ty scholars, yet it is just to say of it that it has formed the fundament «f the public school system in this country. But for it, the elementary teacher would have been without professional training. The signifi - cance of this is clear when we remember that 95 per cent of the citizens of this country receive their only education in the elementary schools. </seg>
            <seg id="p092">57 yet it has infused iDto the common school system such ideals as have given an impetus to educational progress. The real function of the normal school is the training of elementary teachers, but it has thwarted from its original design by being compelled to take into the same classes candidates for elementary work, grammar school work and high school work, as well as supervisors and county superintend- It is obviously impossible for this or any other agency for training, to meet the needs of classes whos j aims are so variuu- W« might well take a lesson from France whose normal schools are among Here there is one class differentiated for the training of elementary teachers, another for secondary, and still another for the &gt;-r of teachers. No one of these will admit any candidate wh&lt; not want to prepare for the particular kind of education which its curriculum represents. Our normal schools limited as they are in number, ought not to be forced out of their legitimate line of work, are compelled to confine their curriculum to such narrow limits as are inadequate to the equipment of teachers and superintei; our larger high schools. The great majority of those who go into the field of elementary teaching, must enter their work soon after leaving the high school. The normal school in order to adapt its curriculum to the needs of such, is compelled to extend its' course but a year or two above the tweltth grade, hence the limitation of its curriculum. I'niversity authorities have been slow to come into a realization of their nsibility in this matter of the preparation of teachers. Many college men have evidently held that the profession of teaching is the only one in which technical training is unnecessary: they to think that a college graduate can k mysterious pr suddenly transformed from a learner to an instructor by emerging from the classic halls of the university and taking a place behind the teacher's desk. As a result the great army of alumni who go forth from our col - :ind universities to engage in teaching, flounder about in a h&lt; :n their efforts to beat out a rational system of procedure. Many of them discouraged by the close of the first year of experimentation, abandon their efforts; others persist until they have furrowed out a channel in which they may glide rather easily, until they have finally gained a successful experience; but it is at a great cost of time and energy upon the part of the pseudo teacher, and a great slaughter of the innocents on the part of the pupils. Our college graduates go out with excellent scholarship but no idea as to how to organize their knowl - edge into lessons adapted to the immatuity of the student in the second - ary school. It is not uncommon for the alumnus to give lessnos in his - tory or science just as he received thrm in his senior or graduate year in the university. Superintendents and principales in response to a tionaire on this subject, say that most college graduates do poor work in the first year or two of their apprenticeship; that it takes much time and patience upon their part to break in these raw recruits, and that </seg>
            <seg id="p093">58 normal graduates even with a narrow academic preparation but with a technical training, usually outstrip the university man for the first year or two. The collegian gives much of his last two years to special - ization in which the fundamentals of his subjects are by him so com - pletely interwoven and overlaid with the mass of detail in which he I* now concerned that he cannot find them, yet they are the ones with which he must deal in his attempts to instruct the young. In prep - aration for teaching in the secondary school, he should revert to these elements and discover them afresh, and so organize them that they may be seen not only from the teacher's standpoint, but from that of the learner. That university students may have the opportunity to give borne special preparation for the important work of instructor, courses devote! exclusively to the science and art of education should find a place in the curriculum; such courses would enrich the uni\ schedule not only because of their adaptability to those go forth to teach, but they would offeT valuable discipline to all: for it is as essential to offer work in education because students are to become parents, as because they are to become teachers. The science of education can be profitably studied by all who aspire to general culture: for the history of education is a part of the story of civilization, organization and administration of public schools are organic elements in state and municipal life; when parents become as familiar with matters in education as they are upon other matters, they will be content with none but the best of teachers for their youth. This general enlightenment in the field of education would tend ■ minate the keen and distasteful competition now existing between the professionally and the un professionally trained candidate for the higher places in our schools. With a desire to help the university along these lines in the discharge of its legitimate function to the state, Dr. Wayland of Brown University and Horace Mann of Antioch College, were actuated about a half a century ago to recommend the establishment airs of education in colleges and universities. Their endeavors rewarded, however, with only partial success. The honor of estab - lishing the first permanent chair of education belongs to the University of Michigan. In 1879 President James B. Angel of Michigan University. had the conviction that the university is under obligation to the state to contribute to the training of candidates for the public school. He induced his Board of Regents to establish a chair for the following par - poses: first, to fit university students for the higher positions in the public school service. Second, to promote the study of Educational Science. Third, to teach the history of education and educational doctrines. Fourth, to secure to teachers the rights and prerogatives and advantages of the profession. K Fifth, to give a more perfect unity to the state educational sys - by bringing the secondary schools into closer relation to the rsity. </seg>
            <seg id="p094">59 KThis gave birth to the most important movement in this country - he professional training of the secondary teacher. I At the time of the establishment of the chair of education in the ■er&amp;ity of Michigan, there were in the English speaking world only chairs for the exclusive training of teachers, one in Edinburgh the other in St. Andrews. The value of this step on the part of state of Michigan is attested by the results in their educational im. It is now one of the best in the world. The free public schools there directly under the control of the university, which trains a t per cent of the secondary teachers, to whom it has secured the pre - tives of a profession. That the University of Michigan is itself flted, is manifest by the number of teachers constantly entering tails to further their technical study. The excellent example of Michigan has stimulated other univer - sities to provide similar facilities in the study of education. Today twenty of our leading universities offer such courses. These univer - sities realize now that it is the duty of the state to offer all forms of culture that minister to the welfare of the professions in which its citizens are engaged. They have incorporated into their curricula special courses in law, by which the youth are technically trained to care for our property; and others that insure skill in physicians to look after the welfare of our bodies. Certainly they should not fail to prepare those whose business it is to care for the unfolding minds of our youth. The importance of this undertaking is evident when we consider that twenty per cent of the population of this commonwealth is enrolled in our schools which are maintained at an annual cost of over three hundred millions of dollars; one fourth of the taxes levied In the United States are for the support of education. In Nebraska alone we expend seven millions of dollars annually to maintain our public schools, in which there are registered nearly a half million pupils, re - quiring the services of ten thousand teachers. A country spending so much for public education should not be indifferent as to whether or not this money be economically and efficiently expended. In Nebraska there were graduated in 1908, 375 students from pedagogical courses. This represents less than 4% of the number actually engaged in the public schools of our state. Statistics further shows that 33% of these teachers abandon the profession each year, so that practically all of our teachers are changed in three years. From this it is evident that less than 10% of our instructors are technically trained for their work. The normal schools have done good service in the preparation of candidates for the common schools and smaller high schools, but the better class of the city schools are already by the regulations of the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools compelled to close the door of promotion to all except college bred teachers, and for these there is now a strong demand for profes - sional training. The departments of education are giving excellent aid in academic and theoretical work, but they have thus far done but little « </seg>
            <seg id="p095">60 I fording that training that fits the candidate for actual teaching by g practice in the classroom itself. In response to the call for still and better training together with technical culture, the third and efficient agency for the equipment of the teacher has appeared in orm of the Teachers' College — the first and foremost of which was lished about ten years ago in connection with Columbia University, college has put education on a sound basis and has d the department of education to the dignity of a college, ranking those of law and medicine. This new institution has incorporated in the main the German plan which is probably without a peer. This requires first, a liberal culture; secondly, a special knowledge of the subjects to be taught; and thirdly, an acquaintance with the professional aspect of educatloaal science, to which is added skill in teaching. Such requirements have developed in Germany the best secondary schools known. None but those of broad scholarship and tested successful experience in teaching are employed in their schools. University diplomas are not accepted in any as credentials for teaching as they are here. In connection with their university education, the candidates must show an exhaustive ledge of the three or four subjects which they expect to teach. Academic knowledge is necessary to the art of teaching, but this how - profound does not admit the candidate to the secondary school. He must also have an acquaintance with the laws of mental phenomena and of mental growth — a knowledge of the social, philosophic and pedagogical sciences. And in addition to this, he must spend two final years in gaining that practical knowledge requisite to the actual teaching of his chosen subjects. One of these years is spent in the •t'b seminar and the other in the Trial year, in the seminar each candidate must visit the classes taught aDd make a careful study of the aims and processes of the secondary school. When he has become familiar with their workings, he is required to organize and teach a series of lessons under the guidance of the regular teacher. Before the leMons are presented, they are carefully planned and subjected to a critical examination in which they are tested from a theoretical and practical pedagogical standpoint. In the Trial year, the candidate's capacity to give instruction is still further strengthened by teaching several hours weekly in the public schools. The stronger features of this German system are found in the Teachers' College at Columbia, and although this institution has been organized cnly about a decade it is today exerting a most potent influence on scientific education in this country. Through this school and the ral others recently organized, teaching is gradually rising to the dignity of a profession, and in the same way that law and medicine were brought to the plane of efficiency. It was not until the last century when these two professions were scientifically organized and given a proper place in the curricula of our universities, that they •named dignity.

"This close ionship of the teachers college with the arts college is one enjoyed o other professional school." Indeed, three-fourths of the culture tie teacher must be in the academic college, and the remaining th only is of a technical nature. Since the conditions for gradu - i embrace the required work for the baccalaureate degree in the college, and since the elective work in education is chosen so largely the social and philosophical sciences, it seems reasonable that the lers college should ask for the arts degree. This institution is likely to supersede the department of education, because it has incorporated the finishing and most vital touch of the German system, namely, the experimental school. It is in the Teachers' Seminar and the Trial Year that the student adds to his academic and professional knowledge the teaching skill which gives the German secondary teacher his superiority. The half dozen teachers colleges established in this country have organized as an organic part of their system, practice schools where the student may not only study the exemplary methods of teaching but where she may actually plan and teach a series of lessons. The most defective point in departments of education is the absence of this feature; for in many of these departments there has been no systematic work in the observation and practice of teaching, or if offered, it has been in connection with the public schools where the department is so limited by the traditional and conservative elements of the school that the results are unsatisfactory. The experimental school should inculcate and demonstrate the best scientific principles and the highest professional aims of the institution with which it is connected. These are often out of harmony with the ideals of the public school of the city in which the university is located. The only rational plan is to maintain in connection with the univer - sity a model school that will yield itself as a field for experimentation. As a preparation for the technical work done in the practice school, general methods courses should be given in connection with the majors that the candidate desires to teach. Methods courses should not be, as they are in many of our feebler training schools, cheap devices and empty, patent panaceas as a substitute for skillful presentation of ■well-organized academic matter. Xor should they be on the other hand, methods courses in name only, affording an additional opportunity to give academic subject matter. These courses should be in change of teachers thoroughly grounded first in the academic, and secondly in the philosophical and pedagogical aspects of their subject. Such courses can be given efficiently only by men and women whose experience has been extended and abundantly tested in the public schools. The train - ing school is to the prospective teacher what the hospital post is to the Intending physician. Just as a medical student learns in his academic course the normal functions of the human body, the causes of disease. </seg>

Academic knowledge alone however profound, will not make the teacher, nor can technical skill unless it rest upon the solid foundation of a liberal culture. The Teachers College aims to furnish both. This Institution foreshadows better things for education in America. At the close of the year 1907 there were in this country six teachers colleges located at the following, universities: Columbia, Chicago, Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri and Syracuse. At the opening of the present year, the regents of the University of Nebraska added to this list a seventh school which with the hearty co-operation cf faculty, students and public school men wilt develop into a Teachers College worthy of a place in the great institu - tion of which it is to form a part. The Mission of the Normal 'Department 2nd the I epartmeni of Edu- cation in the Denominational Schools. Dean C. A. Fulmer, Nebraska Wesleyan University I Nebraska has had a great educational awakening. Increasingly numbers of students are turning each year towards higher utions of learning. On every side the cry "more education" is 1. Standards of certification have been raised, the summer &gt;ls are thronged with teachers eager for further scholastic and ■ssional training, and county, district, and state associations are d-breaking in points of attendance and enthusiasm. Progressive school legislation, a fearless and wise leader as State Superintendent with the support of Nebraska's foremost educators, an aroused public conscience, and a responsive willingness on the part of teachers to meet any reasonable requirements, have combined to bring; about this revival. You need but to travel from one educational insti - tution to another, visit the summer schools and county institutes, and attend associations, to feel the impulse of this wave of progress. In years agone, in an olden country, the people were awakened from the sleep of centuries by an overturning of traditional standards and customs, they were amazed by the transformation wrought by the touch of the Master's hand, they were aroused by a revelation of duties to be performed and opportunities for greater service, and inspired by a glimpse of a better life. Everywhere could be heard attempted explanations of the change that had come, criticisms of methods em - 1 in the transformation, doubts concerning the permanency of the reform, and hallelujahs over the wonders wrought. But the fact re - mained as expressed in these words: "The blind receive their Bight, the lame walk, the lepers are cleansed, and the deaf hear, the dead are Mlaed up, and the poor have the gospel preached unto them." Just now, in Nebraska, the Illustration will apply to our educa - tional awakening. Those whose eyes have been blinded by ignorance </seg>
            <seg id="p100">EIGHT YEAR8 OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 63 I disregard of opportunities and duties are receiving sight, those have as teachers been lame and enfeebled by lack of scholastic professional training are being made to walk, those who have 3d their ears to the invitation of higher education are hearing the dead teachers quickened by professional spirit are coming to life, best of all, rich and poor, in strong districts and weak, are having gospel of education preached unto them free of cost. And the end 3t yet. I The urgent need of the schools is better trained teachers. The ges, normals, and high schools, cannot at present supply the »nd. Last year's entire available output of the fifteen institutions orized by law to grant teachers' certificates was taken by Septem - first, 1908, and since that time numerous calls for more trained lers have been received. All of these institutions with one or exceptions, report an increased enrollment for the year just entered i. Some of them are crowded beyond their capacity. KA11 of this indicates that state, private, and church schools as this ational revival spreads, will be taxed to their limits to supply the ber of trained teachers needed. I The mission of the denominational school in the important work eacher-training is a common one with state and private schools, — of giving to prospective teachers the best possible practical and iretical preparation for the great work of educating Nebraska's \ and daughters. "With charity for all and malice towards none" izing that every institution doing an honest business has a place in field, all must assist in maintaining present standards and in raising a still higher as rapidly as it may be done safely. All have a common mission in meeting, uniformly, the require - ments of the new laws relative to certification. All have a further common mission in preaching the doctrine and supplementing the preaching by wholesome example, that certification and teacher-train - ing are not one and the same thing. IL'ntil two years ago, dozens of elementary state certificates had granted upon one year's high school education, and sometimes plus twenty-four weeks of normal training which was in many nces nothing but a review of the common branches. Under the &gt;nt law such a certificate can be granted to no one who has not had ast a two year high school education plus a minimum of tw&lt; weeks normal training in common branches presented largely from method side. According to a recent ruling, after this year no entary or second grade state certificate can be granted upon a three year high school education plus twenty-four w lal training. A common mission of all these schools, in my judgment, is to insist that after September first, 1910, the requirements for the elementary or second grade state certificate shall be four years of high school •education or its equivalent plus one year of normal training. One </seg>
            <seg id="p101">64 Imoo mission of state, private, and denominational schools, then, will • been fulfilled if after September first, 1910, our state certification been placed upon the following rational basis: (a) Requirements, first grade state certificate to be four full years of high school ration plus two full years of normal training; (b) requirements he elementary or second grade state certificate to be four full years igh school education plus one full year of normal training. Then orlze normal training high schools to issue some kind of certificate the system will more nearly represent our high ideals in educa - il thought and progresss. KBut the denominational institution has special missions and advan - in teacher-training, some of which cannot be shared by state and te schools. I First. A school founded and maintained by voluntary contri - tns from the members and friends of its denomination, educates ly free of cost to the state a large number of teachers whom the schools with its limited accommodations could not handle, i If it were deemed wise to train all of them in state institutions expense of establishing and maintaining schools with sufficient city to furnish our full supply of teachers would be a heavier en than the taxpayers would willingly assume. Second. Under the present law the state schools are made the standard of measurement of other similar institutions. More than this, by the courtesy of Presidents Crabtre? and Thomas, candidates for certification in both state normals are held to the same rules of inspection, and checking as candidates for certification in other schools. That is to say, the action of these two presidents has given the State Board of Inspectors authority to reject or approve applications for certificates from our state normal schools. To set, and measure up to, a standard have brought equal respon - sibility upon state and denominational schools. And the eagerness to set a good standard and a necessity to measure up to that standard have resulted in a most salutary housecleaning including sweeping, washing, and scrubbing, in all schools. In fact, under the present law, it takes a very careful and thorough housekeeper to keep her house in order and to be ready to entertain company that may arrive unexpectedly. Un - doubtedly our state schools render a more efficient service under the spur of of competition. I Third. There is a growing conviction in the minds of people one who has so much to do with the shaping of human life and icter ought to be a Christian. In state and private schools various :ies are doing a great religious work, but by force of circum - «s to the church school alone comes the privilege of emphasizing itian character-building. That this is preeminently a mission of lenominational college all will admit. ■Fourth. Quite often as in Nebraska on account of the attrac - ess of free tuition or the sometimes supposed prestige attached to </seg>
            <seg id="p102">65 graduation from a state school, the equipment of some institutions becomes inadequate for the large crowds of students. When it becomes necessary to give over much of the teaching to tutors, readers, or assistants, when classes are too large, the efficiency of the work is impaired. In teacher-training especially no second hand work is desir - able. The denominational college then has sometimes an advantage in its smaller classes where real enthusiasm and inspiration pass from teacher to taught and you will fiDd education as "the quickening touch of one life upon another" exemplified. Fifth. Grammar grade children desire and determine to enter high school largely because of their intimate associations with high school friends. They hear about the high school work and pleasures and so their interest is s.roused. We also know that association with college students will induce students to enter college. Where a normal department is maintained by a denominational college scarcely a teacher completes the training or professional course without taking advanced college work of some kind. It is convenient to do so and the example is contagious. The college with a normal department, therefore, enjoys a distinct advantage over the separate normal school in that teachers in process of training are in a college atmosphere which always con - duces to higher education. I Sixth. The great mission of the church college through its. artment of Education is to train teachers for the secondary schools. i is so because the state university will be unable to furnish a suf - nt number of secondary teachers, while the mission of the normal tols proper must of necessity be restricted to the training of teachers elementary schools. Even now, in Nebraska, we have agreed that a four year high school course or its equivalent shall be the minimum scholastic re - quirement for teachers in elementary schools. No one qualified to pan judgment upon the question considers this standard of scholarship too high. Four years of academic training above the elementary school furnishes a fair basis for the professional training of elementary teachers. It is the consensus of opinion among the educators of the country as expressed in the report of the Committee of Seventeen printed in the proceedings of the National Educational Association for 1907, that a four year college course should be the minimum scholastic requirement for teachers in secondary schools. Even now, the large majority of teachers in the four year high schools of the state are college trained and in a few years this will be Nebraska's standard and it is none too high. We believe that both academic and professional training should be required of teachers and that in the main the academic should precede the professional. We quote Dr. Luckey in his contribution to the report of the committee above referred to as follows: "It is difficult for the student to approach a subject both in the attitude of the learrer and the attitude of the teacher at the same time." Ideal preparation </seg>
            <seg id="p103">66 K aching in secondary schools is graduation from a four yean' col - course plus professional work, or perhaps professional work d late in the college course. Our normal schools are or should be professional schools — training schools. In the matter of academic training above the two years now in the courses, our normal schools have no mission. There is&gt; a ques - tion whether a normal school can fulfill both missions They will be unable for years to come to train elementary teachers in sufficient num - bers to supply the demand. Furthermore, it is unwise, extravagant, and IVess duplication of the equipment and work of the state university to attempt to give instruction in higher subject matter in our normal schools. In this the normal schools cannot and should not attempt to compete with the colleges. I Again, if our state normals whioh set the standard for other ial schools in the state increase the amount of academic work eir courses the result would be a weakening of the professional ing which is the peculiar mission of the normal school. Under conditions we should have our state normals and other normals h are required by law to copy after them, efficient to a high &gt;e in neither academic nor professional training. I do not want to be misunderstood. Normal graduates number among them many successful secondary teaohers. principals and super - intendents and until the colleges can furnish more teachers the normal schools will have to come to the rescue. Furthermore, we are proud of our state normals and their records. But within a few years when we shall have become properly standardized educationally we shall find normal schools training elementary teachers which is their real mission, or giving professional training to college graduates, and the State University and Department of Education in church colleges training secondary teachers which will then be considered their exclusive mission in the preparation of teachers. Church schools have their important place in the educational field. To summarize: I believe that the denominational school has a distinctive mission in the training of teachers in that — (1) It affords educational facilities the state could not furnish 'without overburdensome taxation. (2) By competition it stimulates state and private Institutions to better work. (3) It affords distinct opportunities for Christian education ( 4 ( Because of its smaller enrollment it brings students into riww touch with the real teachers of the school and gives to each one a goodly share of attention and consideration. (5) Through association with college students and breathing college atmosphere it encourages the student teacher to take some higher work than is required for her certificate and often to complete the entire college conn*. </seg>
            <seg id="p104">67 t(6) Its greatest mission throagh the Department of Education t be tbe training of teachers for secondary schools. The PrTbate Normal Schools. President W. H. Clemmons, Fremont Normal College. I Misunderstandings generally arise from a different conception of b meaning of the basic terms upon which an argument rests. That may be properly understood I desire to define closely the terms Dund which these fragmentary thoughts are gathered. Professional means skilled for a special service. The word has a greater bearing upon mental culture than upon physical culture. Normal means according to an established law, that which Is in harmony with nature, that which is free from deformity either phys - ical, moral or intellectual. In school work it meaDB sympathy in character, knowledge, impartation, and soul; it is the equal sharing with the child or student in Platonic love and charity. t Private means unconnected with state aid, self-supporting, per - al retirement, ( I suppose the retirement here means time and etude for reflection upon bad deeds dome anJ good deeds omitted.) t Training means bringing anyone into a more perfect understand - of his own mental, moral and social powers. It includes develop - it through device; it is the most essential garment for the teacher, yer, doctor, business man or statesman; its key note is original ividualism. Believing these statements to be true, I desire to con - n them as essential factors in the making of a teacher. LA carpenter, in order to erect a building, must have at least three gs, knowledge, proper tools and well selected material. iThe making of a teacher involves at least three things, the terial from which the teacher is to be made, the instructor and ■ell selected course of study. The course of study should be outlined h but one end in view and that is to make a thinker in the broadest, est and most perfect sense of that term and without loss of time. i\ says: "Be ye transformed by the renewing of your mind," "As nan thiDketh in his heart, so is he." What we need and must have our profession is brain muscle imbedded in common sense. The Is and foibles that belong to our courses of study and which enter gely into the development of the same, should be omitted. The common school teacher is required by law to give instruction In too many subjects to do justice either to herself or to her pupils. For the best educational culture, a few subjects well taught will give the pupils a more comprehensive idea of that which he is to follow when he enters the higher institution of learning, and at the same time his intellectual grasp of all new matter will give him a pleasure that he does not now possess, and I am not, at the present time, able to see how he will ever have that power or pleasure at the rate he must travel from the time he enters the cradle of learning, till he passes through the twelfth or fourteenth grades. If the studies were fewer and possibly more wisely selected he could do it and be well </seg>
            <seg id="p105">68 grounded, and the teacher, the pupil and the grown-up commonwealth would rejoice. With a decade of such a crusade, in my judgment, the entire people would be more accurate and profound thinkers; conse - quently they would move easier into the channels of business, be more careful, more considerate of the rights of others, more economical and better providers. I do not believe that these last statements are overdrawn for they fall in line with the great teaching truth; think first, reason well, weigh judgment, then act. There is a difference between a common schoo curriculum and a curriculum of study arranged with a special end in view of making a teacher; but like the common school curriculum the teacher's curriculum should not be over burdened with subject matter neither should the course be chosen for tone or title, but for the complete development and mastery of truth. The aim being to develop the teacher in thought-power and device. For example, a working and teaching knowledge of our own English language should include the subjects, English Grammar, Rhetoric, Word Analysis, Synonym-. In following out this line of development, it will be found that the rea power and good usage of 'our language depends upon the synonym The synonym is reflective in that it looks back to English grammar makes simple and more easily understood reading, and gives the finer tooes to literature. In this selection of classified subjects the conti - nuity of thought development is retained. The prospective teacher developed in this way has an unadulterated reserve force from which to draw. Her working knowledge is complete and the child Is not stultified because the teacher is fearful of getting into deep water when directing the minds of her pupils in the study of English grammar What is true of this particular branch of learning is equally true of all other subjects which the teacher is required to impart to others The Private Normal emphasizes this classification of studies ant method of procedure in the making of a teacher. We believe in unity of purpose, but not in uniformity of action. Uniformity of course o study and time development Is wrong and will never make any other than a mechanical-professional output. First, because the Individ nalism of the institution is gone. Second, because the push and pul power of both the Institution and student are shackled. My doctrine is thai the finished product of an institution and the effect of that prod uct in the community or state, should determine the destiny of tha institution as to its professional worth. To make good is the watch word. An anxious and exacting public is very capable of judging the merits or demerits of an institution of learning. The patrons of the world have a different schooling from the ordinary technical institu tion of learning. Nature's teachings are always good, they are prac tlcal, they are free from rubbish and are complete, they have no respect for special privileges and therefore they are lasting. No one believes, for a moment, that safe development does not carry with 1 time, sacrifice of momentary pleasure and even Ion of sleep. But to </seg>
            <seg id="p106">69 place a limitation and a how and a where the work shall be done. Is unjust and not in harmony with the spirit of the age. Such a spirit is fraught with danger to the ambitious youth and to the person who has not the legalized advantages of his more favorite brother or sister. The making of a teacher depends largely upon the way a subject Is presented. The lecture plan unfolds and develops, but the question plan does more, it puts the how and the why into the develop - ment and makes it an every-day-usable-product. I see no difference between the good teacher and the good business man. Both are the embodiment of simplicity; both take no note of time; both free them - selves of all superfluities and strike directly at the point to be gained; both are accurate and usually rapid thinkers; both worry more over a lack of mental understanding than they do over intellectual fatigue, — and both succeed. The teacher must know himself thoroughly before he is able to direct others. By self I mean that be, the teacher, must know his weak points as well as his strong points. This Is absolutely necessary that he may be self-poised at all times. A teacher must know, he must operate, he must clean up. To know implies freedom of action; to operate means to advance, to apply, to cultivate, to stim - ulate those under his charge and to create within each one mental energy; to clean up means to leave nothing undone when seeking a truth, always remembering and holding steadfastly to the fact that every truth worthy of possession has a beginning and an ending; and also that it is closely allied to all other truths and to be great as a teacher he must present clearly and concisely all points that develop - ment may be complete. The Private Normal realizes that its only defense and hope of living depends upon merit. Merit is here used in the sense of personal value; he is a good teacher because he is a good thinker and knows how to bring out the latent powers in a child: his information is valuable because it Is usable and his estimate Is placed upon him by the world because of true worth. It is quite possible owing to these beliefs that the mission of the Private Normal has been misunderstood; and it is likewise due to these facts that it seeks to hew strictly to the line of theory development. It dares not drop below par, it cannot afford to be selfish, it must be broad in its useful - ness and powerful in its presentation.

It is not the mission of the normal school no more than of the college to say what other institu - tions are capable or not capable of doing, at least not so much their mission as to show by actual work and by actual results what the normal school itself is capable of accomplishing.

            <seg id="p110">71 Eils, but rather to welcome and commend every worthy effort to ase the efficiency of the teaching force of the public schools of tate. It is the mission of the state normal school to assist in making teaching mean more than simply hearing classes and keeping school, to give to men and women in addition to thorough attainment in schol - arship, the teaching inspiration, that pedagogic breath that not only carries knowledge into the mind but that fills the soul with a love of youth and a desire to contribute to its welfare in a most positive manner. tThe professional ideal of Horace Mann over sixty years ago has - realized in part at least. In the face of the most bitter opposition Harvard and other colleges he asserted that the time would when every state would have one or more training schools for ers and that the colleges themselves would endorse professional ing. The value of professional training for lawyers and physicians was conceded many years before any special importance was attached by people generally to professional training for teachers. Just why the colleges should hold out against professional training for teachers until absolutely forced to recognize it by public opinion is a most puzzling ion. Colleges began by conceding the value of special training for teachers for positions in the elementary grades, but only during the last decade have colleges been willing to recognize professional training as havirg any value whatever for high school teachers. Teach - ers' colleges have been planted in universities and other institutions against the most active opposition of the faculties in practically every institution where a teachers' college has been organized. These teach - ers colleges have been established by chancellors and regents not by faculties. But strangely enough after once established the teachers' college in a short time wins the confidence of the faculty also. Quite likely the organized effort of Harvard and other colleges to crush the normal school idea, planted a prejudice in that early day, in the minds of college men that could only be removed by the powerful force of public opinion. But may we not say at the present time what we could not have said a decade ago, namely, that Horace Mann's dream has come true, that the colleges of the United States now be - sincerely enough iD professional training. It has been the mission of the state normal to continue to sow the seed from the time of Horace Mann on down which has at last brought about such a bountiful harvest, as shown in our own state, in our many training schools; junior normals, state normals, private normals, normal departments, teachers colleges and normal training in high schools. The State Normal School wisely welcomes the recent movement to give professional training in practically every leading educational insti - tution in the state. In this state, the normal school was in a position to hold for awhile at least a monopoly on specialized professional </seg>
            <seg id="p111">72 training. The narrow selfish view was not to allow other Institutions to encroach on our ground. But the broader, better balanced, wiser view was taken and the state normal if not a leader was at least well along in the line, pushing for professional training wherever teacherb were being educated. Why should the state normal stand in the way of some normal training for the high school graduate who desires to teach in the country? Why stand in the way of the graduate of Wesleyan or the State University getting in addition to scholarship, knowledge and prac - tice io teaching? The normal school does not suffer as a result of this policy. Its graduates are still in demand for positions in the common schools. If the state normal continues to maintain standards and to keep abreast of the educational progress of the day, the time will never come when those of its graduates of ample preparation will not find an opportunity to teach in the, secondary schools of the state. The fact that the teachers' college is now engaged in a valuable form of specialized service for those in tb« university or after going there who decide to become teachers of secondary schools, does not necessarily mean that other leading well equipped institutions shall not reach a way into that same field and fit some of its graduates for work above the elementary grades. Why should not Wesleyan with her large faculty of excellent teaohers give her students an opportunity to prepare for teaching in kindergarten grades? Why not also in the grammar grades? Why not in the high school? The organization of a new normal school at Kearney doubled the attendance at Peru and yet the new school opened with a surprisingly large attendance. The teachers colleges at Wesleyan and the state university serve to emphasize the importance of professional training for nigh school teachers, and though increasing the output materially in - creases in a still larger degree the demand for professionally trained teachers, and Peru's product continues to be in increasing demand. Increasing the courses of study in state normal schools as has been done throughout the United States from two year courses to four year courses not only gives a preparation for teaching in the high school but It gives a longer period of preparation for teaching in the grades. I Many city schools already make an effort to get teachers who have four years' training above the twelve year high school. The ion therefore of the state normal school is to meet the demand increased scholarship and increased professional preparation as Uy as that demand becomes evident, if not to keep somewhat in nee of such a demand. I Where an institution has a large faculty and ample equipment as fesleyan university, as well as at Peru, there is a decided advantage he schools of the state if opportunity is afforded for preparation teaching in all grades in the public schools: primary, grammar le and high school. More than half the college graduates who </seg>
            <seg id="p112">73 teach school decide to teach after entering college, not before. A great many do not decide to become teachers until at the end of their second or third year in college. Some of these are specially adapted by nature to teach in primary grades, some in grammar grades and some in the high schools. The institution offering only the prepara - tion for the grades or only the preparation for high school work, necessarily sends out many teachers who though they have training are nevertheless misfits having prepared for a phase of work for which they are not adapted. The Teachers College at Columbia University make* a strong point in advertising on the value of the opportunity in that college to get observation and practice teaching in both the grades below and the grades above the one in which the special preparation is made. »This is perhaps the fundamental reason why Columbia ersity is able to send out the largest number of rounded out special - in every department of educational work. Colleges limited in means and equipment will find it impossible to carry courses and departments of training for teacners of all grades in the schools. But large colleges well equipped should ceitainly be encouraged in training teachers for all grades of work in the public schools. KThe state normal schools are not displeased but greatly pleased e the number of our excellent colleges engaged in this phase of itlonal work. In conclusion the mission of the state normal school in Nebraska is: KTo welcome and commend every worthy effort of other instl - s to increase the efficiency of the teaching force of the state. 2. Not only to have high professional ideals but to constantly strive to attain to them, and though having lofty aspirations to be cer - tain that our feet are nevertheless on terra firma. »3. In preparing teachers not to limit our energies to any one i of preparation but to give students scholarship and professional jment that prepares in a general way for teaching in all grades then to add to this the more specialized preparational work as far consistent with the size of the faculty, the equipment aud the purpose of the institution. K4. To attach importance to the natural adaptation of men and en for the various departments of educational service, and to add is in each case whatever value there is in professional training. K&gt;. To never send men and women into the schools whose lives the standpoint of character and habits are not worthy of imitation, means that no members of our own faculty use tobacco or indulge ler such undesirable habits. It means that character is rated even i scholarship and professional attainment. 6. It is rot a mission of hampering and hindering. Our warfare would be against ignorance and crime rather than against other agencies for education, and refinement. Ours is a mission of peace and good will. </seg>
            <seg id="p113">74 tt. The mission is for as high a degree of professional training for ere as for any other form of service as that of law, medicine, e ministry. Permit me to close with a quotation from the late J. Sterling Morton, a statement which has recently been placed I proceedings of the National Educational Association as the most iterpretation yet made of the value of professional training: "We demand for Nebraska educated educators. We demand pro - fetsionally trained teachers, men and women of irreproachable charac - ter &amp;nd well-tested abilities. We demand from our legislature laws raising the standard of the profession and exalting the office of the teacher. As the doctor of medicine or the practitioner at law is only admitted within the pale oi his calling upon the production of hi* parchment or certificates so the applicant for the position of instructor in our primary and other schools should be required by law to first produce his diploma, his authority to teach, from the normal schools.

Let us take equal care that we ist the development of the mental faculties to skilled instructor* agnanimous character that the mentalities of our children may not lutilated, deformed and crippled to halt and limp through all the jries of their never-ending lives.

I For twenty years we Nebraskans have boasted the lowest per of illiteracy of all the states in our land. A quarter of one per is quite enough to boast of, if nothing is worth anything. Just this illiteracy is, which we haven't got, is rather hazy in my . but it is doubtless a good thing to be shy of, else we should not been boasting so long of our lack of it. Incidentally we are also i of our university and normal schools, and high schools, of our ges and private schools and we are not at all ashamed of our let schools; for are we not the most literate state in the union? KMore than twenty-five years ago I visited my first sod school i; and when I saw the white interior walls and the clean, highly shed, patent furniture, equal to the best provided by our western , I thought, where in the world can you find such rural schools? I had Dot learned at that time to judge the efficacy of school work wholly by the worth of the teacher, and a properly certificated, and enthroned young woman seemed the law's majesty embodied. Those dark days of the seventies, the eighties and even the nineties mast be forgiven. We did the best we could if not always, per- </seg>
            <seg id="p114">EIGHT YEARS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 75 I the best we knew. It is probable also that we acted wisely, ;h blindly, in erecting this magnificent state university which has inated the course and pointed the goal to all Nebraska's children ved with open eyes and Pierian thirst. Then we could not have ied both opportunity and stimulus. I think we did well to build it-house. But now Nebraska is strong and wise enough to compete with sister states, for the olive and the laurel, and at the same time minister most efficiently to those whose lowly circumstances shut out all view of both Olympus and Olympia. The momentum of the higher schools Insures their progress and directive power. The city elementary school follows securely in the wake of wealth and knowledge. The farmer's children alone are In the valley. Let me present some present facts, compare our condition with that of other states, show you what has been done in recent years and beg your co-operation in the ways of further relief. The facts are that well qualified teachers, normal and university graduates, dread and shun the country schools. Hence town and city absorb this limited supply. From two to three thousand new teachers are required each year by Nebraska's schools. From the graduates of all normal schools, colleges and universities in the country we get less than one-fourth of this number. How have the others been prepared? Some of them doubtless by partial courses, others by high schools, and etill others, and the larger part, by the country schools themselves. It is not exaggeration to say that for many years Nebraska has annually placed in charge of rural schools not less than 1,000 young people who bad never taught a term, or attended a higher school than the country school or the eighth grade of some small town. I wish all cultured people in Nebraska might realize fir a minute what this means. I have lived it for many hours. I do it this way. In imagination I am living on a farm. This is easy an 1 delightful. My little daughter Katharine goes to the district school a&gt; ~ut one mile away. Her teacher went to the same school and finished the eighth grade last year. Her teacher had finished the eighth grade in the same county the year before and her teacher hail also ciphered as far. Not for four school generations had the pale blood of even a third rate high school pupil circulated In our school house. What kind of results come from this condition? Of what use is one or twenty years' experience to such an embryonic teacher? Development is arrested and gradually the mind shrivels up and withers all ft touches. Yes, I can imagine such a state. I Even today. I am reliably informed, after six years of special t to relieve this deplorable condition, one-half of the rural teach - of Nebraska have never enjoyed school advantages beyond the th grade. A few of these have "studied up" and may have acquired tter education than some high school graduates possess, but nearly f this half are bounded on the north by a "practical arithmetic," </seg>
            <seg id="p115">76 on the south by definitions in grammar, on the east by descriptive geography, and on the west by 300 pages of topics on United States history, and on top by the weekly newspaper. There are teachers In Nebraska today receiving $40 per month (perhaps $50) who never attended a higher school than the eighth grade. Our professionally trained university graduates seldom receive more than $60 per month on first entering upon school work. Are these additional eight years of general and special and professional training worthy of no greater consideration than this? Have not salaries in Nebraska so increased during the past few years that the state can justly demand higher qualifications on the part of its teachers? Certainly the standard has been raised. Let us heave ho! once more, and if the salaries still climb, then yank up the standard another notch. I A learned, ambitious and cloud-dwelling professor asked me not ago if 1 did not think it time to raise the requirements of our ersity teachers' certificate to conform with those of Germany. His .ledge of the German requirements was just equal to his under - ling of Nebraska conditions. You can solve this equation when you that all the colleges in Nebraska are unable to supply the pres - ;&lt; niand for high school teachers and that the German requirements i little more difficult to fulfill than the same German university de - ls for the degree of doctor of philosophy! I believe there are now ■ high school teachers in Nebraska holding that degree. tFor a similar reason Nebraska cannot elevate the requirements for • \\.«t grade of teachers' certificate to an equality with those. of lany. where about fourteen years of schooling are required for snse to teach. But we are merely the most literate state in the i. How nice to have this reputation when it costs so little. Just California, very little more populous than Nebraska, supports five state normal schools at a co&amp;t of more than three times as much ki we pay for normal schools. Her university costs nearly three times as much as ours, and besides the state pays nearly half the total cost of iblir schools. Th? High Schools receive from the state about for each student attending. Such liberality naturally calls for good I Nearly half of the teachers in California are grad - uates of colleges or state normal schools. The requirements for the lowest prade of certificate are almost equal to our requirements for a county first grade, certainly equivalent to a three years' course in a high •chool. tin Wisconsin there are seven state normal schools, entirely sup - d by the state and entirely apart from these there are seven county ing schools whose support comes equally from the county and A second grade certificate in Wisconsin requires examination in ommon branches anil in Algebra, Physical Geography, Geometry, ■lean Literature and Composition. In West Virginia for the lowest certificate applicants are examined </seg>
            <seg id="p116">in all subjects taught in the grades and additionally in Theory and Art of Teaching, Civil Government, Bookkeeping, and General History. For the lowest certificate in Missouri examination is required in Civil Government and Pedagogy besides the common branches with an average of 80% in all subjects. And for a second grade certificate Elementary Algebra is added and the examination in English covers the ground gone over in the first two years of the high school. An average &lt;&gt; it required for a second grade certificate. Pennsyl - vania is a little slow, but even there, for the lowest certificate, a knowledge of Theory and Art and Elementary Algebra is required. iln Montana a third grade certificate good for one year may be ;d once, but after that a second grade Is necessary. For a second le certificate examination in Civics, Physiology, Geography and Ele - tary Algebra besides the common branches is required. Iowa does issue certificates good for more than one year on examination y in common branches. I Maryland requires for second grade certificate, their lowest, Elemen- Algebra and one book of Plane Geometry, Theory and Art of Teach - and Civil Government. In Colorado for the lowest grade certificate nlnation in common branches and in Civil Government. Theory and :tice, State School Law and the elements of the Natural Scr ?quired. These relations are perhaps sufficient to show that Nebraska is far the head of the procession on scholastic requirements for lowest teachers' certificates. If we had extraordinary means for preparing teachers, it is possible that competition might bring some relief es - pecially would this be true if we had a high and fixed standard of wages. Public sentiment, however, which just now favors fair wages cannot be depended upon to maintain present salaries if good teach - eis can be secured for less. Only one alternative then exists, the standard for certificates must be raised and then the state mu^ to it that sufficient means exist for an adequate supply of teachers to qualify. Teachers' wages are no higher than wages for domestic service, the state must protect our children by advancing requirements. Fifty years ago Massachusetts had four state normal schools. Fifty years ago Kentucky levied a three mill tax for the support of the common schools. In 1855 the State Superintendent of Maine complained In a tone familiar to modern ears "that want of well qualified teachers for our public schools is undoubtedly one of the greatest obstacles to their success. It is, however, a hopeful sign that the people are becom - ing more and more convinced that however much th«y may do for their schools in providing convenient and attractive wbool houses and In raising money for their support, yet without competent and skillful teachers, these schools cannot perform their true mission. This convic - tion manifests itself in loud demands for this class of instructors, and. in an increased willingness to remunerate them according to this more rea - sonable estimate In which their services are beginning to be regarded." </seg>
            <seg id="p117">78 The hopeful spirit of our fraternity is abundantly manifest Id this - early report which soberly states the average wages of women teachers In Maine to be $1.90 per week. At that time Maine had about a quarter million children of school age. I In the same year, 1855, State Superintendent Andrew G. Curtin ennsylvania says in his annual report, "The leading feature of every rt emanating from this departmnet to the legislature for twenty ■ is the want of a sufficient number of well qualified teachers." In year Pennsylvania employed 12,143 teachers and paid the women verage salary of $14.89 per month. About the same time the new i of Illinois was paying women teachers, on the average, $12 per th. We have moved since those days, and we are moving now. I urge continued motion rather than great acceleration. Much of our effort must be given to experiment and to temporary devices. We cannot afford to wait until the problem has been completely solved before we take up our pencil. The demand is upon us, we must grapple with and ameliorate these conditions at once, even if we violate all the rules of Herbart and of Pedagogy. In time Nebraska will work out the problem of preparing teachers for the country schools in her own way, which way after all will not be very different from the way other states have solved the same problem. If we school people were given authority we could make short shrift of the whole business; but practical politics forbids such delegation of power. During his first term of office State Superintendent Fowler, after thoroughly familiarizing himself with conditions in all parts of the state and in all kinds of schools became convinced that something must be done to better the instruction in Nebraska's country schools, espe - cially in those parts of the state poorly supplied with high schools. Fortunately Nebraska was again coming to her own in material re - sources, and people were able to hold up their heads and look steadily forward. Naturally Supt. Fowler first tried to discover how other states were solving this problem. Most of the states recognizing the nistence of such a problem had elaborate and costly processes of solu - tion, which would require many years to bring into operation. Some - thing should be done at once. For many years Nebraska had known legally a combination or union normal institute and summer school. The voluntary association of several counties had often resulted in a better and a longer county Institute and occasionally in a strong school lasting for several weeks. Brooding over this germ and its possibilities for immediate good, if county superintendents were all angels — and socialists — forgetting self, Supt. Fowler read and earnestly sought for more Mght. Perhaps in reading the Report of the Committee of Twelve on Rural Schools he was struck by this sentence: "It is evident that for the fitting preparation - of teachers for the rural schools some agency is needed intermediate - between the brief convention or institute and the normal school, with </seg>
            <seg id="p118">79 Us two or four years course, so far beyond the reach of the majority cf rural school teachers." And a^.an; "Other conditions remaining the same attendance at a school is in an inverse ratio to the distance between school and home, this is especially true for a short course." Doubtless the Report of the Committee of Fifteen on Elementary Schools contributed suggestions, and finally the highly centralized and exceed - ingly pliable New York system offered the key to the whole situation. Take the union normal school directly under the supervision of the state department and let the state control and finance it. And so the chick was hatched. Five Junior Normal Schools were established by the legislature of 1903 and $12,000 appropriated for their support for two years. Three were located by the legislature at Alliance, McCook and Val - eDtine, and two by State Superintendent Fowler at Holdrege and North Platte. The next legislature increased the appropriation to $15,000 and the last legislature gave the same amount. During the first four years the term of the junior normal was ten weeks each summer. One year ago this was reduced to seven and the past summer it was changed to six weeks. For $42,000 therefore the state has conducted five or more summer schools during fifty-three weeks with an aggregate attendance of nearly 1,000 teachers for each of the fifty-three weeks. No first class high school in Nebraska costs the locality as little per pupil as this, and it is obvious that the junior normals are worth more to their students than even the best high school would be for the same length of time. Under the law of 1907 State Superintendent McBrien located three additional junior normal schools at Geneva, Broken Bow and O'Neill. The wisdom of his act is proved by the large attendance at each of these schools. Gradually the quality of the work in these summer schools is improving as the horizon of the students widens and as the instructors come to see more clearly the peculiar function of this institution. Much of the manifest improvement in product is due to the terrific energy and wise tact of our worthy State Superintendent. I wish to point out only one notable instance of philosophic insight in this con - nection. The great danger of centralized authority is its tendency to uniformity. Supt. McBrien has had eight Junior Normals under his •direction. Recognizing the diversity in their surroundings he has encour - aiei rather than restrained divergent development. Hence we have eight more or less distinct types of the Junior Normal. Only by so doing could he have attained such results. I In closing allow me a forecast of further development. Shall we i more years of Junior Normals? Are they to be a permanent part ur state system? They have accomplished too much good to be idoned until other agencies are strong enough to do their work; and hey are so contrary to best educational theory that they cannot hope iirvive Indefinitely. We cannot do without them for a few years, they ought to be temporarily increased in number and in elfectlTe- </seg>
            <seg id="p119">80 I No opponent of the Junior Normal theory has remained hostile the most cursory examination of their need and accomplishment. Nebraska State Teachers Association ought to go on record as -ing for the next two years the establishment of ten Junior Normal ols to be in session eight weeks each summer. Whether they Ld be continued longer than two years may safely be left till our ing in 1910. If other and better and sufficient agencies shall been evolved by that time we may gladly put aside this temporary lient however satisfactory it has seemed to be. But the appropria - ought to be doubled for the next two years. I do not believe Nebraska can afford to use temporary makeshifts in preparing teachers for the rural schools longer than is absolutely necessary. We should establish at once two additional State Normal Schools. Our experiment with normal training in the high school is a good thing, but we have not yet proved it to be permanently desir - able. We have jumped tremendously in a short time, from one normal school to seventy-five. Let us not lose sight of our problem. There are other reforms of the high school which must not be overlooked. The high school is not primarily a normal school any more than it is primarily a preparatory school for the university or a business college. •ong enough it may perform, in a way, all these functions. But it is absurd for a high school which r -quires all of its students to study Latin to attempt permanently the work of the business college and of the normal training school. If the high school is to offer a solution of this problem we must set to work differentiating a tjpt of high school that will be more effective than our present preparatory course to the university is. Such preparatory studies are not the best foundation for teaching in country schools. Reviews of text books in the five essen - tials and a smattering of professional theory and details of school practice are not the best preparation for a university course. We must limit this work to the strong high school in eastern Nebraska and, with greatly increased state aid. build up a few equally strong high schools In central and western Nebraska specifically for this purpose. K Either some such plan or a great increase in number of Normal Schools will ultimately be followed, and until some prog - in this direction has been made the Junior Normal Schools of aska should be continued and liberally supported. Normal Training High School. Inspector I. A. Downey. State Department of Public Instruction Like all other human Institutions of worth the free school system of Nebraska in its present state is the result of evolution.

            <seg id="p122">81 with the present time. Educational progress has kept pace with the growth of the state, but when we survey the field we are amazed to pr that some of the recent advances educationally were not made years ago. One vital fact which our people have been slow to recognize is that each child is entitled to a square deal educationally. Until recently the fact that a child chanced to reside upon the rural side of an imaginary line was accepted as sufficient reason for withholding from him the educational advantages that were freely offered to his cousin who was so fortunate educationally as to reside on the urban side of the same imaginary line. This discrimination was wholly unjustifiable, and especially so in a state which has for its motto 'Equality before the Law." The educational system of the state of Nebraska 1 creature of the law. The state, therefore, should b? true to its motto and provide, in so far as social and physical conditions will permit, the same educational advantages to all. The rural pupil has been handicapped by the want of a good build - ing and ample apparatus; by a comparatively short term and the lack of a strong school spirit in his community, but more than by all these, he has been hindered by the want of a trained teacher. I do not want to be understood as casting any reflection upon those who taught in the rural districts. I only say that they were untrained, and therefore. too often unsuccessful. I freely grant that they taught the best that they could under the circumstances. The circunist. re wrong and it was the business of the state to provide the remedy, fntil very recently about one teacher in ten was teaching on a county third grade certificate; four were teaching on county third grade certificates to each three that were teaching on county first grade certificates. The holders of the first grade certificates usually taught in the urban districts while the holders of third grade certificates invariably taught in the rural districts. The former had not superior scholarship alone, but, as a rule, they were trained teachers. Between these two classes stood the thousands of teachers with county second grade certificates, to secure which the applicants had need of no training and but United scholarship. These teachers were employed in the rural districts. In addition to these three classes there was another class, considerable in number, holding state certificates of different grades, to secure which a certain amount of training, proportional to the grade of the certif - icate, was required. These teachers, usually the best in the field, were employed almost exclusively in the urban districts, and their efforts were supplemented by the best teachers holding county first grade certificates. Thus, we see that the urban schools were being taught by trained teachers holding state and county first grade certificates, while the rural schools were presided over by untrained teachers holding county s-cond and third grade teachers' certificates. Another factor which improved the quality of the urban teaching was careful super - vision by trained and scholarly city superintendents. It may be urged </seg>
            <seg id="p123">82 that the rural teaching was also supervised, but experience and obser - vation have combined to convince me that county supervision is a misnomer. This is not because of a lack of competency upon the part of the county superintendent but is the result of physical conditions over which he has no control. To fully equalize the disparity in the educa - tional facilities of the urban and rural schools is regarded as an impos - sible task, but able educators who love justice and approve the doctrine of the square deal have for some time been exercising themselves in an effort to improve conditions in the rural schools. It is my mission this afternoon to speak concerning one of the movements which has for its purpose the raising of the standard of efficiency on the part of those who are to teach the sons and daughters of our rural friends. In 1905 the legislature of the state of Nebraska enacted a law which made normal training a requisite to the securing of a county second or first grade teachers' certificate. This law went Into effect September 1, 1907, Good and proper an this law is, yet under conditions as they then existed, it was sure to fail to accomplish the purpose for which it was enacted. There are in the state about 10,000 teachers, and of this number there are each year about 3,000 beginners. If we subtract from this the usual number of third grade teachers we mu:t yet train more than 2,000 to go out each year. The full rapacity of all of the splendid institutions so ably discussed here this afternoon is far too limited to supply the required number of trained •ts. Last year these institutions issued 334 first grade state certificates and 247 second grade state certificates. This total of 608 teachers, either wholly or partially trained, may not represent the full capacity of the institutions mentioned, but it does represent the number "which by the influence of all that the advertising art could accomplish were induced to offer themselves upon the pedagogical altar as set up In these schools. This was 1,500 short of the number required. Facilities bad. to be provided to train this additional number. The first Temedy proposed was the enlargement of the state normals and the educational department of the state university. While this was desir - able, even necessary to a considerable extent, vet it was very evident that room and facility at these institutions would not supply the required amount of finished product, for the very simple rts«on that the raw material would be wanting. To state it differentlj, .*nlare;ed capacity of the training schools would be useless unless a larger number of students could be induced to leave their homes and enter them. Since no inducements could now be offered that had not already been used, it was evident that the required number of students could not be brought to the training schools, therefore, it was thought wise to bring the training schools to the students. The result was the normal training act of 1905, which made it possible for certain schools to offer a normal training course in connection with the high school course. This act carried no appropriation nor did it provide for any Inspection or adequate supervision, and for these reasons it was not sufficiently </seg>
            <seg id="p124">83 effective. The legislature of 1907 removed the defects of the previous enactment and the present act resulted. This law provides that a high school district maintaining a school of twelve grades, accredited to the University of Nebraska, and employing not less than two teachers in the high school department in addition to the superintendent or principal, may, subject to the approval of the state superintendent, maintain a normal training department, provided it shall teach a normal training class of not less than ten students and shall supply a sufficient normal training library and adequate equipment. Under the provisions of this act, sixty-eight high schools and six academies were recognized by the state superintendent of public instruction to do normal training dur - ing the school year 1907-8. In these schools 640 seniors and 573 juniors entered the normal training course. Four hundred forty-eight of the seniors completed the normal training work and at the opening of the present school year the greater part of these had completed all of the examinations required for county first grade teachers' certificates. There Is no data at hand to indicate the actual number of those who took the normal training last y*ar who are actually teaching this year, but there is good reason to believe that there are more teaching than completed the entire course. Many of the seniors were unable to carry all of the normal training work, but those who did all of the required work in didactics, professional training, and took the the required review in one or more of the five essentials, were declared -eligible to receive county second grade teachers' certificates when they had earned grades in state examinations In all subjects required for such certificates. This ruling was temporary and was made neces - sary ( 1 ) because these senior students had previously arranged their course, and (2), because they were needed to teach during the present school year. Approximately the total expense of giving the full course to 4 48 students and at least one-half of the course to 800 other students was $28,000. This was an average of $23 per capita. If we leave out of consideration the training given to the juniors and to the 192 seniors who did not complete the course, the average per capita expense of giving the entire course to 448 seniors was $62.50. During the present year the same expenditure will finish about 750 students and advance as many more to the half way mark. Therefore, during the first biennium the high schools will turn out 1,200 trained teachers at an average per capita expense of $47. In addition to this there will be a class of about 800 juniors who will have done a part of the work. I Granting that this training is elementary and inadequate, which it yet all who were acquainted with the nature of the work done have been able to observe the results of the examinations which these student teachers have been subjected are agreed that a long stride in the right direction. It is safe to say that normal training In the high schools of Ne- braska is the most universally popular educational movement In the </seg>
            <seg id="p125">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 84 hUtory of the state.. The enthusiasm manifested by the training students is something remarkable. In a paper read before the super - intendents aDd principals' meeting one year ago, the author made use of the following language: "Normal training work in our high schools must succeed. It has been successfully done in the state of New York for seventy-five years and it ran be done in Nebraska. It can be done, too, without weakening the high school course. On the contrary, it will in time strengthen the course and bring it to the same recognition in higher institutions that it has heretofore enjoyed. In addition to this, it will ultimately, not only increase the attendance at the state normal schools, colleges and universities and exalt and dignify the work of those schools, but it will also increase the attendance and raise the standard of fflciency of the students in these higher institutions. This will be true because of the fact that these teacher-preparing schools In the future will be instructing students instead of pupils, thus raising the course from an academic to a collegiate one. The funds received and the experience obtained by those who enter the teaching profession direct from the high schools, will at once make it possible for these n ing teachers to enter higher institutions and make of themselves the highest type of students. " , The considerable cumber .of student teachers who have already asked permission to enter directly upon an advance course of training in higher institutions, together with the large number who have signified their intention to take additional training at the earliest convenient confirm me in the belief that the above prophecy is to be fulfilled. The new certification law which went into effect October 1, 1905, caused many teachers to take certificates of a lower grade than they had previously held and made it necessary for county superintendents to issue many emergency certificates This adverse showing has, because of th? splendid and varied facilities offered and because of the hard work done by a large and loyal corps of teaehers, been almost wholly over - come. The teachers of today are successfully meeting far more rigid certification requirements than were the teachers of three years ago. The material offered in the examinations for teachers' certificates is fifty per cent better than that presented in 1905. Normal training in our high schools has been a factor in bringing this about. Many good county superintendents are very desirous of securing the services of graduates from the high school normal training course. This course was presented last year with greater success than we had reason to expect, and it is now being presented with even greater efficiency to a class of one thousand five hundred students. I We have now passed a mile stone in the history of normal training e high schools of Nebraska. During this time we have been blazing way through forests, guided only by the accumulated moss of neces - and the ever shining star of hope. That we would make mistakes expected. That we have made them is now certain, but we are grat - to know that to a certain degree we have reached the clearings of mplishment and fruition. There are many problems yet to be solved with the contiued hearty co-operation of all the educational forces of </seg>
            <seg id="p126">85 I state we confidently believe that we will soon be able to put high ol normal training upon such a basis as to make it a permanent part ur educational system. It is patent to those who nuderstand the &gt;ose, appreciate the popularity and have watched the progress of this ement that it has come to stay. It should no longer be regarded temporary makeshift but rather as a useful and necessary depart - t of the educational system which is making such marked progress in commonwealth. The 'Training of Teachers for thz Public Schools of Nebraska. It is my purpose to discuss briefly three fundamental questions: First, Why does the state provide special technical education for her teachers; second. Can the preparation of public school teachers be satisfactorily accomplished in any other institutions than those estab - lished by the state for that specific purpose; and third, What should now be done to unify all of the agencies co-operating in this work in Ne - braska? State education is constructive government. In its public schools the state gives rational direction to its own life by cultivating the lives of its citizens. The ideal in this "education for citizenship" is not to subordinate the individual to the state, but to advance the state's welfare by promoting the welfare of the individuals composing it. The state educates its citizens as the natural expression of its own i hood; in building up the lives of the individuals composing it, it deter - mines affirmatively from within its development in the line of its ideals. Public schools are governmental institutions, whose function it Is to create good citizenship by making the individuals composing the state positive factors in its organized community life. Public school teach - ers are government officials who serve the state in developing right ideals and promoting healthy growth in power and skill in its yen. members. They are, in the highest conception of government, the most important of all state officers, since to them is assigned the duty of purposely controlling the vital forces upon which the character of the state organism depends. Whatever the state would consciously become in essence and form, it must live into its own being in its public schools under the stimulation and direction of its teachers. In order to provide Its schools with efficient teachers the state has established special auxiliary educational institutions called State Normal Schools. These schools are a vital part of the state educational system, evolved by the same organic laws that hav? produced the common public schools. They originate In the state's striving for fuller life and her conscious need of efficient service in her common schools. In a truer sense than Plato conceived of, the public school is the state in miniature; and the public school teacher should be educated as a state "guardian" with all the qualifications that Plato proposed for "guardians" In his ideal "educational state." In America Dr. W. A. Clark, K army State Normal School. </seg>
            <seg id="p127">86 what the state really is will depend more aDd more upon the life which the children live in the public schools, and the importance of appointing to leadership in that life only those who are adequately equipped will become year by year more manifest. The technical school for the education of teachers is of far greater concern to the btate than her West Point or Annapolis, since it deals with her very life blood. What her teachers are is what her children become; and what her children become is what the state herself becomes cumulatively through the suc - cessive generations. Public education has been significantly called "conscious evolution;" and the central organ in this rationally controlled development is the State Normal School. As a heart organ it distributes throughout the body politic the ideals and the formative materials of its structure. The ideal and the organization of the State Normal School have developed with the growing conception of the state and of state educa - tion. From America's first State Normal School opened at Lexington, Massachusetts, sixty-nine years ago with 3 pupils to the State Normal School at Kearney matriculating 2,100 different students in its first three years is a long step upward. From its meager curriculum of knowledge of the elementary school branches with a still more meager adjunct of professional training in methods and devices have come the technical school with its four-year course above college entrance require - ments and the well equipped Teachers' College of the University. The development of these special schools has been as rapid as the gradually evolving conception of state education would permit. It is not to their discredit that they have met conditions in low requirements of scholar - ship and technical skill; they have their own ideals which they are real - izing as rapidly as conventional restrictions and limited equipments will permit. In the creed of the normal school man of today is expressed the growing conviction that the professional education of teachers should comprise both broad general scholarship in the various arts and sciences of human interest and achievement and the specialist's critical and practical knowledge of his own field. On the academic side these schools should be colleges, and on the professional side they should be technical schools of the highest rank. It was evident to all who were connected with the training of teachers in Nebraska ten years ago that the single State Normal School, aided by existing private normal schools, was not able to meet the rap - idly growing demand for professionally qualified teachers. There was an unanswered call from all over the state for teachers of greater or less professional equipment. The State University established a Department of Education, and later the state gave official recognition to similar departments in denominational colleges and other private schools, qualifying them to co-operate with the state schools in this work. Still later another State Normal School was created, and the Department of Education of the University was developed into a Teachers' College; also Junior Normal Schools and Normal Training </seg>
            <seg id="p128">87 Classes in High Schools were added. But even this greatly enlarged equipment has not proved adequate to meet the demands due to the stringent legislation concerning the licensing of teachers in the last two years. Nebraska's three strictly professional schools which she has, established for the educating of her teachers are developing rapidly in ideal, equipment, and organization, and they promise excellent service for the state in the future. All of the various other institutions officially recognized as having part in this work are rendering good service in accordance with the demands made upon them, These auxiliaries came into being in the course of the state's educational evolution; and they will continue to function as a part of our loosely organized educational system as long as there is need of them. That they are performing in a very saisfactory manner the work delegated to them cannot be denied by even the most strenuous advocate of stat? schools; and as a normal school man I gladly accept the present conditions as a natural and healthy stage of development. Our third question is, What should now be done in Nebraska toward a more complete organization of all of these forces under one unified head? There are three co-ordinate authorities in the training of public school teachers in this state: the Board of Regents of the State University, the Board of Education of the State Normal Schools, and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. The first two bodies control the state professional schools proper, leaving to the State Superintendent the management of all the auxiliary work delegated to the various other institutions. The organized plans for the supervision of this work have been gradually evolved during the last eight years, and they show a systematic progress paralleling the evolution of the State Normal Schools and the College of Teachers in the University in the same period. It is difficult to see how more satis - factory results could have been reached; but have we not mow reached a point where decisive steps should be taken to bring all of this work more completely under the control of those institutions whose work they supplement? All of the supervision of the professional education of teachers that is now exercised independently by the State Superin - tendent of Public Instruction could be placed under the St'ite Board of Education of Normal Schools of which he is ex-offlcio a member thus giving this work more organic connection with the great work of which it is now but loosely a part. Specifically what I mean is this, all the Instruction in the Junior Normal Schools and in ihe Normal Training Classes in the High Schools should be treated as Normal Extension Work of the State Normal Schools, to be carried on by them as a constituent part of their regular work. Similarly all of the professional work done In the denominational colleges could be placed under the control of the Board of Regents of the State University, or the Board of Educa - tion of the State Normal Schools, as thought best for the professional standards of teachers, and accorded full /alue in the licensing of teach - ers for the public schools. Such a readjustment would greatly simplify </seg>
            <seg id="p129">88 the whole matter of the provisions for the education of teachers in our state. It would place the technical preparation for this important state service where it properly belongs; it would relieve the state depart - ment, already overcrowded with more legitimate functions, of an unnecessarily heavy burden; and it would work no hardship to the Institutions concerned, rather it would accord them still greater recogni - tion and assistance in their work. Under such an arrangement all professional instruction, whether given in the three state schools estab - lished for that purpose or in private schools qualified to do equivalent •»ork, would be judged by the same authority and by the sam standards. The whole question of the licensing of teachers is urgently claiming «.ur thoughtful attention. I wish to offer here some suggestions on this important subject, not that I expect them to receive your unanimous assent nor to see them speedily enacted into a law. Would it not be vise to recognize in Nebraska but two grades of certificates: professional ertiflcates and provisional certificates good for five years under prescribed conditions? The professional life certificate should be issued under the authority of the State Board of Education of the State Normal Schools or the Board of Regents of the State University to persons completing a prescribed course of study in schools controlled by these boards or approved by them. Such certificate should be given only to persons of broad general scholarship to which is added thorough ilized study in the science and art of education; and the two boards named should be concerned in the issuing of no other form of certificates. All provisional or temporary certificates should be issued only by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction in co-opera - tion with county superintendents or local city boards of education, and they should be valid from one to five years according to profes - sional progress made. Such certificates should be issued only upon examination and should be extendible from year to year to a maximum of five years by the county superintendent on satisfactory evidence of professional progress, but in default of such progress the certificate to expire at the close of any year from date of issue. What I recommend is to take away from all schools, state or private, the authority to issue the so-called Elementary Certificate, re - serving such authority to the State Department only; and similarly to tmke away from the State Department the authority to issue, on exam - ination or otherwise, any certificate except the provisional elementary certificate. The professional certificate should be granted only on the completion of four years of collegiate work above the High School, Including professional study; the course leading to it should be a full equivalent for the conventional course leading to the bachelor's degree to our American colleges. The purpose of such a restriction of certifi - cation is to distinguish the professional teacher, qualified in scholarship and professional knowledge and training, from the temporary apprentice to the business. No hardship is done to the teacher of lower scholastic and professional attainments, since he can still be licensed in the usual </seg>
            <seg id="p130">89 way; besides he is relieved of the burden of repeated unnecessary examinations by the longer tenure of certificate made possible through proper professional study while teaching. For such probationary teachers the County Superintendent should provide systematic study In institute and association meetings. In my answers to the three questions propounded I have had always in view Nebraska's need of professionally qualified teachers, ani the right of the professional teacher to legal protection in the business to which he has devoted his life. I have said that the state provides special technical education for her teachers because of the vital relation of their work to her statehood; that the special function cf State Normal Schools may be successfully performed by other institutions, public and private, under proper supervision; and that all of the work of the professional education of teachers should be placed under the governing boards of the State University and the State Normal Schools. I am much interested in all that has said here this afternoon; and I speak as a professional teacher to many who are professional teachers, urging further progress on the ba - the good work accomplished in the past few years. W« are In a common work; and can we not unite with high ideals of profes - sional qualifications and service in a common purpose to give Nebraska year by year better teachers? General Obsfoitions on fh» Development of Professional Training. Professor J. W. Searson, Peru State Normal School. I The most striking feature of the American system of eiucation. minted out by members of the Mosely Commission, is rapii prog - in professional training. One member of that commission in - through professional training as a means, "the teaching proft - merica is rapidly acquiring a dignity and force that must make great source of national power." To the unthinking mind, the term, "professional training." in a mass of skillfully related methods and devices apart from the mind of the teacher. To others, "professional training" is regarded as a lc&lt; 1 wielded at will by the teacher. To the really thoughtful \» "professional training" is a second nature through which is breathed the warmth and charm of personality, the conquering spirit of mind, and the heroic in soul. These three views indicate three stages of professional training — the methodical, the instrumental, and the organic. When a teacher is filled with devices without intelligence, ■be is "methodical," and superficially trained. The public is likely to say of her, "She is in the work for the money." She is over-paid at any price. When a teacher uses methods and devices as tools merely, as a means of getting so many facts taught, with no warm appreciation of the force of those facts in character growth, she is in the "instrumen - tal" stage of development. She is called "a hard worker," "a hustler." "an up-to-date teacher." but the gr#at public finds it comapratively easy </seg>
            <seg id="p131">90 Ill Ler place when she resigns her position. But when to the teacher, essional training has become a second nature, when she organizes finest products of thought in an Inspired soul, and presents this nized product with the aroma of device called tact, the great heart le public, touched and warmed by her power, throbs quicker with and gratitude made vocal in the words "born teacher." Such • tier has reached the organic stage of professional development, natter how. or where she has enlarged and glorified the God-given. iathies and capacities of her soul. There is no longer any dispute concerning the need for profes - sional training. What constitutes the best training, and how best to fit the teacher for her work, is the vital problem. There are three fundamental theories of professional training. The first theory assumes that if an individual knows anything he can teach it. that the same quality of mind that acquires knowledge, imparts knowledge. On this theory, teachers were first tested by examinations of fact and teachers were prepared in regular public school, college and university courses. The second theory assumes that the teacher must know both facts and the mind's necessary way of acquiring facts. On this theory, teachers' method circles, teachers' institutes, and special round tables were established for rural teachers, ard departments of educational psychology were organized in all the leading colleges and universities. Examinations then became tests both of facts and of methods. The third theory insists that the teacher must have a thorough knowledge of facts must know how to impart such knowledge and must actually posaeGb the skill to impart those facts in a school of practice. Upon this theory, the pupil-teacher, or apprentice system of England and the practice-observation plan of the Swedish govermnent are based. On this same principle, normal training schools and colleges, insisting on actual teaching practice, were established. Twenty-our years ago, the International Congress of Education held in London commended the pupil-teacher training system of England very highly. A number of bright pupils showing special fitness for teaching were selected in each of the larger schools. Each pupil was placed under a trained teacher for a term of years. By this apprenticeship, he became familiar with every detail of school government and teaching practice. He grew up in the work. One member of that congress, having watched the workings of the pupil - teacher system, declared enthusiastically, "There are no teachers so good as those who have been devoted to the work from their early years." Nevertheless this apprentice system possesses the germs of ■elf-destruction. The pupil is set apart before his soul feels the call to teach, and the service he may later render is scarcely adequate to compensate for the dissipated energies of pupils and expert teachen during training years. The Swedish plan of government-directed training for college graduates provides that any college graduate desiring to teach in a </seg>

            <seg id="p134">EIGHT YEARS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 91 becondary school shall, as special preparation, spend one year in obser - vation and study in a high school under a government expert. H» thus becomes familiar with high school methods and courses. In the class, sometimes as practice teacher, sometimes as critic-listener, he comes into sympathy with high school boys and learns correct esti - of their powers. For two decades the educational world has watched, v.ith keenest interest, the workings or this system. The verdict is that the system is one of the most effective in the world to train the untrained college graduate for work in the high schools. The system Involves two serious defects. First the strictly professional training comes long after the psychological period for such training, thus involv - ing irreparable loss of energy. Second, the system is clumsy and almost unworkable. r?quiring government experts for every ten teach - ers so trained. The normal schools of America have avoided both these extremes. They take the pupil when he has reached the age of spiritual discre - tion, when his soul is white-hot with enthusiasm for service, and in - spire him to organize his forces for successful work. In the earlier educational development of our country, the public that employed teachers became the first and severest critic of the output of colleges and universities. Those who hired teachers year after year began to complain. The Association of Boards of Education of Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin declared in substance that the university graduate has no just conception of what a high school ought to do; that he has little sympathy at first with what a high school must do; that he is likely to over-emphasize his own specialty; that he is Inclined to be over-technical; and that his tendency is to talk too much, to lecture rather than to question and discuss. About this same time, prominent educators, leading college men in the National Educa - tional Association and in the Internationl Congresses at Chicago and at Liege, were declaring that the training that best prepares for college best fits for life; and that none but college graduates shoul' be employed in the secondary schools. College men were thus valiantly defending in theory what the great teacher-employing public, through its official representatives, was condemning in practice. In response to this insistent demand of the teacher-employing public, the Normal Schools enlarged their facilities and lengthened their courses of study. Previously the normal schools hai only aspired to train teachers for the elementary grades. Here ani there, strikingly successful normal graduates with training for elementary work, were forced by school boards and patrons into high school positions. The normal schools, quick to respond to reasonable popular demand, r their entrance requirements, still further enriched their courses of study, and added special training and practice departments for secondary teachers. Similarly, the great colle?es and universities have been forced either to provide specialized training and practice In their Teachers' Colleges or to abandon one of the most fruitful field* H </seg>
            <seg id="p135">92 of public education. With this more effective entry into the field of secondary education, the colleges aDd universities are being compelled to provide trained specialists for supervision work in the elementary grades. In like manner, the spirit of professional training has so Infused itself into the popular mind that high schools have been compelled to introduce training courses to prepare their graduates to do effective work in the rural schools. The high school has seemed to trespass upon the normal school, the normal school upon that of the university, and in return the university Is accused of reaching down into the special fields of the high schools and normal schools. What at first seemed "overlapping" and as such threatened some conflict, appears less serious with closer thought. The work of the high school must continue to appeal to its special class of pupils. The work must be more or less formal, or "methodic." The high school graduate must get only his own meas - ure's worth of training, and hence devices rather than fundamental principles will have the strongest appeal to him. As a distinctively research school, the university must lead in advanced educational thought revealed in close experiments in its Teachers' College lab - oratory. As a school of exemplification, the normal school must main - tain laboratories, or "shops," where the accepted educational reveal - ments of the university may be given personal force through the actual practice-training of teachers. But to say that any one elurational institution has exclusive* rights In any particular field, is wildest heresy, for educational work cannot be assigned like work on the railroad section. The doctrine that the education that best fits for college best p.-epares for life swept thousands into our high schools and acadamies. To unify this heterogeneous mass of high schools, university and state :ns of inspection were Instituted. Three immediate results fol - lowed. The high school courses were shaped to meet university demands. University graduates were then required for high schools. In return the high schools sent their graduates to the university. A on to this movement was inevitable. In Wisconsin, a bitter war was openly waged against the university as a "Gigantic Monopoly," it&amp; Inspector was called a "Traveling solicitor," and the general educatfonal policy of the university was denounced. In Iowa, the high schools, through representatives, held conferences declaring that the high schools in return ought to inspect the universities and colleges to mine which of these higher institutions were best fitted to carry forward the education and training of their high school graduates. The public continued to demand trained teachers in larger numbers. Meanwhile, the number of normal schools was increased to seven in Wisconsin, and Iowa Normals, public and private, were filled to overflowing. Nebraska University, with closer response to popular demands, has avoided such a reaction both because of its liberality to high schools and because of its readiness to respond to the demand </seg>
            <seg id="p136">93 ■ professionally trained teachers. A steady, permanent growth is certain result. We are going to keep our Junior Normals, our Normal Training in High Schools, and our variety of Summer School expedients until such time as the state or private institutions can provide adequate professional training for all of its teachers. But we are all agreed upon the need for^special training, just so It Is genuine, no matter whose school has provided It. The public insists upon trained teachers no matter where they are fitted for their work. It is more important that a teacher have scholarship, broad culture, and knowledge of the bcience, and skill in the art, of teaching than that he be prepared at Peru, Kearney, Wesleyan, or at the State University. Our next step in professional training must be to Improve and render more effective the means now provided. Two lines of improve - ment are suggested by two growing demands of the public. The first demand is, that no teacher be licensed to teach merely because he has « ■&lt; mplett-d a formal course. He must possess special fitness for the work, and even for the particular kind of work he is to do. To this end. some sifting process at the beginning of the course, and some higher professional test at the close, must be employed. The Normal School President or Dean of the Teachers' College must refuse admit - tance to those disqualified physically, mentally, or morally for the work of teaching. They must also refuse to confer diplomas and degrees upon those who, at graduation, are not worthy of such high credentials. The second demand is that the training of teachers shall be directed with such insight and skill as not to make the teachers self* conscious of processes which should be automatic. We need hearts, fcouls, personalities, not machines. Spontaneity, bouyancy, bubbling spirits, hope, cheer, and love of service must be preserved or the finest fruits of professional training are lost. There is a wealth of pedagogic thought in this anonymous classic of the toad and the centipede: "The centipede was happy quite Until the toad In fun Asked, 'Pray which leg comes after which? Which worked her mind to such a pitch She lay distracted in a ditch Considering how to run." The professional training of tomorrow, whether it be in the high school, junior normal, state or private normal, or in the State Univer - sity must not be such as to distract and to disable with non-essentials or with needless technicalities but must inspire every teacher of Ne - braska to put forth her best energies to work out the spirit of her God-given call to teach. </seg>

Science and Art of Education, University of Wisconsin. tThe committee was selected from all sections of the United States represents high schools, normal schools, colleges, universities, late schools and public school administration. The majority been high school teachers. Three have been high school in - ors. Seven who are now college men were formerly high school actors. Two are now connected with normal schools, and several formerly held this relation. It would be difficult to select a aitte better prepared by training and experience at first hand, to der this most important question. Each member of the committee prepared a paper dealing with some phase of the subject. A preliminary executive committee consist - ing of Principal Kalleck, Superintendent Brooks, Professor Dexter and Professor DeGarmo studied these papers to find cardinal points upon which a substantial agreement could be secured. Conferences of the - committee were held at Chicago early in 1907. attended by all but three - members, at which the conflicting opinions were harmonized, and those important principles that could be accepted by all and that seemed of first importance were incorporated in a report to be known as the "Recommendations of the Committee of Seventeen on the Professional Preparation of High School Teachers." This was signed by all of the members of the committee present at the conferences. The three mem - bers not present dissented on minor points, to be noted later. This report is as followi: </seg>
            <seg id="p138">95 ■ I. That the academic preparation of high school teachers include following elements: 1A detailed and specialized study of the subjects to be taught. One or more subjects from a group including history, amics and sociology which will give the teacher a proper out-look the social aspect of education. KA course in general psychology and at least one from a group ubjects including history of philosophy, logic, and ethics, which give the teacher a proper out-look upon education' as the develop - t of the individual. KII. That definite study be given to each of the following subjects, r in separate courses or in such combination as convenience or isity demands: ■ History of Education. (General and Secondary.) Educational Psychology with emphasis on adolescence. ■The principles of education including the study of educational , values and process. Courses in general method are included r this heading. B Special methods in the secondary school on subjects that the ent expects to teach. ■ Organization and management of schools and school systems. School hygiene. III. That opportunity for observation and practice teaching with secondary pupils be giveD. Each of the folowing plans has proved successful in some instances: ■ The maintenance of a school of secondary school grade that be used for observation and practice. B Affiliation with public or private high schools so situated raphically that practice teaching may be done without Interfering the other work of the college courses. IV. That the minimum requirement for a secondary school teacher be graduation from a college maintaining a four-year course and requiring four years' high school work for admission, or from an insti - tution having equivalent requirements for admission and giving equiv - alent academic scholarship. BV. That the study of subjects mentioned under "II" be distrib - through the last two years of the college.course. The propor - ,1 amount of time given to these subjects will vary with local itions, but an irreducible minimum is one-eighth of the college This, in brief, is the report of the committee. It is accompanied by a clear exposition of its Intent and meaning, by Principal Reuben Post Halleck, chairman, by a short course of professional reading for high school teachers, by eleven special papers by Individual members with reference index, throwing side lights on points of agreement, as well as suggesting Ideals upon which agreement could not be secured, and by six special reports in topics related to the subject under consider- </seg>

It was presented to the Department of Secondary Education he National Educational Association at Los Angeles in July, 1907, on account of its importance aDd evident worth it was ordered ted by the National Association as a part of the proceedings of body, and so was given a permanent place in educational literature, f with the famous reports that have preceded it. In the consideration of the subject of academic training it is recommended that that there be "a detailed and specialized study of the subjects to He taught." Accompanying this is the caution that the curriculum should be wide enough to insure a fair degree of general knowledge and to avoid danger of over-specialization. Throughout the discussions runs the idea, in terms most emphatic and without dissent, that a prime element in the preparation of a high school teacher is adequate scholarship. The exact degree will vary with the character of the subject. It is difficult to express It in terms of years. It is convenient to indicate four years beyond a high school course as the minimum general preparation. On this point there is little difference of opinion. It is also agreed that general preparation Is not suffi - cient. Because a teacher has taken a college course, it does not follow that he is fitted to teach many or even any of the subjects in the high school program. There should be special preparation to teach sp«e4flc subjects. No general rule is attempted as to the amount of special training. The chief consideration is that the prospective teacher should have mastered the subject he 1b to teach, this mastery to consist of a vital grasp of the subject as determined by its under - lying principles, and not mere memory knowledge of the terms by which the subject Is defined. There is a vital relation between the conditions of the certifica - tion of teachers and standards of teaching. Investigations carried on by individual members of the committee show that the present pro - feuloral status of high school teachers is lacking in uniformity and is generally very unsatisfactory. As regards statutory provisions, few of the states differentiate secondary teachers from elementary teachers. It Is true that in states that attempt no division, many of the larger cities have special requirements for high school teachers, but in the great majority of high schools throughout the land, a teacher holding any elementary certificate is qualified to Instruct in any high school branch. Even where a high school certificate is required, it is usually of a "blanket" rature. and in no way Insures that the teacher has ever studied the subject in which he Is to give instruction. This is the case even in Nebraska, although It is one of the most progressive states, and Is especially commended in the report for the high standard it has established for the professional and academic preparation of high school teachers. Tet a candidate for a professional certificate in Nebraska Is examined, for Instance, In Geology, which Is taught in only eight high schools Id the state, to see If he is qualified to teach Latin — subject carried in over four hundred schools, large and small; for, ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p140">EIGHT 7BARS OF EDUCATIONAL t'ROURE8S 97 cept in a few of the large cities, there is no teacher's examination In Latin. Another candidate graduates from a two-year high school, attends a private or state normal school for three years — one year beyond a good high school course — and returns home legally qualified, in the absence of local rules to the contrary, to teach four years of history, four years of science, four years of mathematics, or four years of Latin in any high school in the state. Another candidate graduating from an accredited school, having studied Chemistry for one semester, takes a classical course at the University of Nebraska, or other institution of college grade, is given a University Teacher's Certificate in Latin and Greek, and on reporting to the local school authorities, may be assigned to teach a year of Chemistry, although having had but one semester of instruction in the subject, and that in a high school so long ago that it has become a matter of ancient history. These are extreme cases, but they are possible today even in Nebraska. It is only since last September that any special requirements have been made of high school teachers. Before that time a local school board could turn over to a teacher holding a third grade county certificate the matter of instructing in any or all the high school branches. It is true that local interests and public opinion usually make standards higher in most places than the minimum for certification, but the needs of secondary instruction are now so well recognized that general public sentiment should prevent by statute the possibility that careless or indifferent local authorities may offend in this respect, to the great injury of the young people who have no power to protect themselves. In connection with the recommendations in the report requiring special training for high school teachers is a provision for breadth of study and a caution against over-specialization. It is noticeable that the latter danger is dwelt upon by the members of the committee that are closest in touch with high school work. Again and again is found the suggestion that the extreme specialist has a wrong view of the limits of his subject, and is trying to develop scholars rather than men. He knows his subject as a scholar and sees with too (Treat mairnihV.-ttion the few points that are of the utmost importance to those who live in the field of research, but that have little application to the great underlying principles which must be the plane of secondary work. I The second requirement in the academic preparation — the study of or more subjects from a group including history, economics, and ilogy — is intended to make the teacher a broader man, with a ;r conception of the relation of this field of labor to the great e of human activities. It would make for truer perspection and d give a dignity and a seriousness to his position that would be esome In every respect.

From the latter part of this section — the mandatory inclusion of the history of philosophy, logic, and ethics — Prof. E. P. Cubberly, of Iceland Stanford, Jr., Universtiy. mildly dissents. The argument of those favoring this feature is that it will add to the independence of the teacher, enabling him to found his methods on basic principles Instead of following the numerous flitting theories that permeate all educational literature. The second division of the report concerns the purely professional training of the high school teacher. The first topic is the history of «dncatlon, general and secondary. It is not claimed that this is necessary to help in the solution of particular problems in training pupils, but it is cultural and inspirational, and widens the horizon of the teacher. It enables him to build upon the experience of others, those favoripg this feature is that it will add to the independance of and prevents the loss from attempting to work out all principles by experiments. Educational psychology is believed by some of the members of the committee to be of general rather than of particular value. It will bring the. teacher into a more appreciative attitude toward the pupil and bis point of view. The recommendation would emphasize the psychol - ogy of adolescence. The high school age is peculiar to Itself and can be best served by those who have an appreciation of its problems and ideals, and who can understand the difficulties in the road of the youth who would continue the processes of education. tin the list of professional subjects is included a study of "educa - aal aims values and processes." This is general in its nature, 1 is of great importance, coming, as it does, in the latter part of a lege course. It gives the point of view, and aids in establishing safe alb. The aim will determine the line of procedure, and will lead sane groups of subjects in the program, to a well-balanced curric - im. and to well-established courses of study. I In addition to the course in general methods, the committee ommends courses in special methods of the subjects the candidate Is ■paring to teach. It establishes a high standard. For the more ;hly organized subjects it calls for several years beyond the work which the teacher is to give instruction. In this respect the report ns with the most insistent specialist in the demand that there be ep scholarship, the deeper the better, providing it be recast from the pit's point of view. This working over of knowledge so that it can readily communicated to the pupil and made his own is the problem the special training in methods of specific subjects. This will change ? attitude of the specialist toward the subject. He will study it th reference to the parts most valuable for the growth of the young nd, and will not be troubled with demands of completeness as </seg>
            <seg id="p142">99 Irds the subject as a whole. He will be big enough to omit that •h is unwholesome for the individual, even to the neglect of some of ideals of scholarship. He will consider order of presentation and e of approach, carefully In kind, but different in degree, from the ber of elementary grades. He will realize that there is little ;er from over-specialization so long as there is not under profes - al preparation. The organization and management of schools and school systems is the fifth subdivision of the plan of professional training. This might be omitted for the teacher, ever if required for the executive, If teachers were isolated and were tutoring a few individuals, but the work of the teacher is conditioned by the fact that she is a unit in a system, and is directly responsible for a complex part of an exceed - ingly complicated whole. There must be modifications and adaptations of ideal conditions because of the influence of numbers. System is necessary in an organization, ard it is economical to study this before attempting the work, rather than to blunder upon it by experience. »A study of school hygiene is required. The state is establishing iulsory education. This fact makes it incumbent upon those agents te state that are charged with the responsibility for the young I thus engaged, that proper moral, mental and physical progress aintained. Hence the preparation of all teachers should include irse in school hygiene. tProf. Paul H. Hanus, of Harvard University, dissents from the ingly unqualified opinion that professional study indicated above Id necessarily form a part of the prospective teacher's under - uate work. Secretary George H. Martin, of the Massachusetts State Board of Education, questions the wisdom of assigning this professional study to the last two years of the college course. A studv of a paper pre - pared by him and printed to accompany the report of the committee shows that his reasons for differing are diametrically opposed to those of Prof. Hanus. The latter would give this professional work as post - graduate study in connection with a university or a college of education. Secretary Martin would make the atmosphere in which the prepara - tion is given more- important than the academic standing of the institution or the years in the course assigned to purely professional study. He desires the thoroughness of strong collegiate training but would prefer the atmosphere of the normal school, with reasonably high academic courses, to the college that over-magnifies academic training and is lacking in sympathy with the professional view of the secondary school subjects. It is evident from a study of the special papers that several mem - bers of the committee feel that the professional work should be graduate, rather than undergraduate. This is a good ideal and will prevail in most large city schools, but it is impossible of early realization for the schools of the country at large. </seg>
            <seg id="p143">100 The arguments for extreme specialization based on the secondary schools of Germany do not appear conclusive. The conditions are so different that little of value can be obtained from such comparisons. In the first place, the corresponding school to which comparison is made extends two years into the college course in America. In Germany from fifteen to eighteen years are required ir preparation — nine in the Gymnasium, three to six in the University, one in examinations, one in the seminary, and one in trial teaching, before the candidate is given a place on the public pay-roll; but when once admitted he has a position for life. A study of the conditions leads one to suspect that this long process is not so much for the sake of the schools as it is for the pro - tection of those who survive. It is the only way that a monopoly of the secondary teaching profession can be maintained. Whenever there is danger that there may still be too many applicants for the jobs in sight, no doubt another year or two will be added on some pretext or other. German education is class education, and has its own ideals. Democratic America must work out its own salvation according to its own needs. • This report was prepared by men engaged in high school work or in the professional side of preparing high school teachers. It sug - gests a change from present general standards and the establishment of new ideals. As one iterested in both the academic and the professional view, it seemed to the writer best to appeal, not to those 'ring teachers, whether in academic or in professional lines, but to those who must deal with the teacher as a product. The opinion of the men who are responsible for the work of the teachers, who direct and observe their labors day by day, should be heard upon this most vital question. Whatever may be the theories, the touchstone of experience will determine their value. In order to learn the local atti - tude toward this subject, the following questions were submitted to the city superintendents and high school principals in the large schools of Nebraska: ■L In your experience, what is the greatest deficiency in the ration of high school teachers, (a) general academic training, pecial academic training, or (c) professional training? , II. What should be the minimum training of high school teachers, (a) general academic, (b) special academic, (c) professional? III. What can be done for prospective high school teachers in advance of their entering upon regular high school Instruction, to make for the development of skill in teaching? Replies were received from 70 persons. Of these, 41 place profes - sional training as the element of greatest deficiency, while 16 combined professional training as one of the two great deficiencies. Five believed the great lack is general academic training, while 6 place special academic training first. Two failed to answer this question. It is interesting to note that those failing to place emphasis on professional training are about equally divided between uni- </seg>

            <seg id="p146">101 versity or college graduates and those of lesser ac&amp;edmic preparation. With one exception they are relatively of less than average experience. Among those declaring that in their experience the greatest deficiency in high school teachers is the lack of professional preparation, are superintendents and principals of wide experience and large responsibility, men whose word is law in their respective local fields, and whose opinions must be considered by all engaged in the preparation of teachers, if those teachers are to meet with recognition by those to whom they must look for positions. A well-known city superintendent writes: "As a rule teachers know enough about the subject matter, but know practically nothing about methods and school management. Scores of high school boys and girls drop out of school every year from the professional weai - of teachers and their lack of knowledge how to manage pupils of high school age." i Another of high scholarship remarks: "There is frequently a lack neral ability from a too restricted special preparation, and a I ofessional training." One of wide experience states, "By far the most serious weakness is the want of good professional training. The academic training may be ample, but if there is a lack of pedagogical training it means either failure, or that the teacher lacking this training must obtain it at the expense of the pupils she is attempting to teach." ■ Another writes: "Many high school teachers are unable to view subject from the pupil's standpoint." BA principal of a large high school writes: "Prom our experience mploying only college graduates who .have had special work along line they are to teach, the greatest deficiency is in professional Another high school principal of wide experience writes: my observation of high schools in the country at large I would say that the greatest deficiency is in general academic training. But this is less true in Nebraska than in many other sections, and it is not at all true In the school with which I am connected. In the country at large the lack of special academic training is second only to that of special academic training, and the lack of professional training, though great, is proportionately the least defect. In large city schools, manned (or alas womanned) almost wholly by college graduates, it is the lack of professional preparation that constitutes the greatest deficiency." * The only comment made by one holding the other opinion Is by a city superintendent who is a graduate of a normal school. He writes: "In my experience, the professional side Is not neglected, as is broad scholarship." Aa to the amount of preparation, two superintendents would re - quire a four-years' course In a good high school, to be followed by from one to two years of normal training. Ten would expect at least normal school graduation. Two would require normal graduation, fol- </seg>
            <seg id="p147">102 Id by a year in a teachers' college. Six would have two-years' ge work, followed oy a year in a normal school. Two would have years of college training, one of professional-school training, and two to four years of grade experience. Two would have a four - i' college course, Including r pecial preparation along lines of inter - and one year of normal-school training. Thirty-two would have years of college training beyond a four-year high school course, ding special academic study and professional training. Four would four years of academic training, with from two to four years of al training and one year or more of professional training, or ralent experience. KOne superintendent defines professional work as "actual work in a ing high school, with an appreciation of high school, not college, ems and ideals." Another says: "This professional trainiDg should be practical, not theoretical, with actual teaching under competent critics. Theoretical work is valuable, but without the 'doing' many are spoiled for teaching. University and college methods are often far from useful in the average high school." B Another writes: "There should be one year of practice teaching r critic teacher, with the study of education, historical and psy - igical, for at least two years." Another would give a "year of practice teaching in a professional training school before graduation from the university." ■ Another would have "a special study of high school boys and girls of the high school course and its relation to life." Another writes: "The ideal for us to work toward is that the high school teacher should have the training indicated by the master's degree, with special professional training in a university school of edu - cation or teachers' college, and with special preparation in the subject matter and method of teaching some one high school subject, as mathematics, or chemistry, or history. The would-be teacher's choice of minor studies should have a rational connection with his major. The student who devoted herself primarily to Botany or German or Latin, but who devotes no time to other sciences than Botany (not even elementary zoology), in the one case.. or to any second foreign language In the other cases, is Dot preparing herself intelligently for good work as a high school teacher." This ideal is, however, too high to constitute a minimum require - ment today."* However, in Nebraska, at least, where educational standards are already somewhat higher and educational facilities greater than in some older communities, we can require soon the bachelor's degree from a standard institution of collegiate rank and some knowl - edge of psychology, of the history of education, and of method in teaching. KThe third question was: "What can be done for prospective high &gt;1 teachers in advance of entering upon regular high school action to make for skill?" </seg>
            <seg id="p148">103 Ten suggested the establishment of teachers' colleges and depart - ments of education, to include practice teaching. Fourteen proposed practice teaching without indicating the character of the institution. Five would require observation work. Ten mentioned "professional training," without defirition. Seven would require a course at a normal school. Eight would require grade teaching before beginning high school work. BA superintendent of a large city school says: "Give them a vision e school and the subject matter from a teacher's standpoint. Es - sh a teachers' college at the university." "Give us more teachers who are pedagogical students and who know how to manage boys and girls." Make them sympathetic students of individual pupils. 1 'Require a study of high school conditions with special reference olescence. Teachers fail more frequently from lack of knowledge idem nature than of subject matter." ■ "Increase what Dr. White calls 'heart power.' Our trouble has been to find teachers qualified educationally, but to secure those could govern kindly, yet efficients I "There should be actual visitation and contact with high schools, work and conditions, and acquaintance with the peculiar prob - which are there to be solved. They should get the idea that work is with immature youths, not with college students. This be done in a university teachers' college, possibly in a model )1, certainly in near by high schools." K'A course dealing with the conditions as they now exist, their prob - and needs, given by a man of recognized ability, who has had a and successful experience in public school work, together with 1 work in some preparatory or high school, would be a great help "Encourage prospective high school teachers to teach in the grades. Establish a training school for teachers at the university. Head it with teachers of inspiration and good sense. Give opportunity for practice teaching. The high school teacher lacks experience more than anything else." "Our universities should have a teachers' college and our colleges should at least have a department of pedagogy. Every student pre - paring to teach should have some work in (a) psychology (not merely in 'normal,' or adult, but also in genetic psychology) ; (b) a course in the history of education, or the development of educational theory and practice, in which more attention should be devoted to recent and contemporaneous methods than to those of Aristotle and Pliny; and (c) a course in method of teaching, in which there should be both a. theoretical and an observational and, wherever practicable, also an exper - imental, study of the method of presenting at least one subject, and preferably a study of method of presentation of two different subjects. These courses in the pedagogy of different subjects should be given— 1» </seg>

There should be a school of observation and, if possible. (a practice school, connected with the teachers' college, so that the rersfty student would have the opportunity to observe under favor - &lt; conditions the teaching of youth of the age that he is expecting eal with later; and he should be able to try his own hand also, but school of observation and the practice school should be distinct — at t the classes should be distinct. The class in the hands of the lei.' or observation-school teacher should not during that term xperimented with by the beginner." It may be objected that, however valuable may be the observa - tions of these men. on the firing line as to the results, their theories as to remedies are of no more value than are those of any other class of persons. It should be remembered, however, that they have the opportunity of observing teachers in all degress of proficiency. They have assigned to their tender mercies teachers experienced and inex - perienced, trained and untrained, normal-school graduates and products of colleges and universities, "born" teachers, and those who should have remained unborn, those who have a divine call and those that have a "pull" with the board. It is their duty to take this assorted lot and organize a uniform system. They are compelled to do for many of these teachers what should have been done before their term of service began. Much of their time must be spent in training teachers. By the trials and tribulations they endure they have earned the right to a seat in the council. These supervisors have discovered that one untrained, inexperi - enced teacher to, on the average, as helpless as any other untrained. Inexperienced teacher. This is as true in the high school as in the grades. Ordinarily the higher the training the sooner the adaptation follows, but there must be a "breaking In" process. They have found that much time is saved in the grades by employing graduates of normal schools. They feel that it would be a great economy to the school if the high school teachers could have both the academic and the professional training. On the part of the public school men of Nebraska, there is no lowering of the standards of the strictest scholastic Idealist. They are overwhelmingly in favor of four or more ' years of preparation beyond the high-school course, providing it Includes m special study of the subjects to be taught, and preparation in school organization and methods of instruction. They are remarkably in line with the spirit of the report of the committee of seventeen. t Accompanying the report of the committee are two excellent dis - ons of the relative value of normal schools and colleges in the iratlon of secondary teachers. Pres. John W. Cook, of the hern Illinois State Normal School, maintains that "the normal &gt;I as generaly organised at present is not the beat possible agency </seg>
            <seg id="p150">105 I State Normal School, Kirksville, Missouri, holds that it is "unwise lassify prospective teachers at the beginning of their professional aration." He would have two or three years of the course of aal schools and teachers' colleges devoted to work of a general acter, permitting a differentiation into elementary and secondary tiers in the fourth year. Both these men assume that the normal ol that could give this higher training would need four years of The former would retain the present briefer term, in the interests le greater needs of the large number of grade teachers that must be ided. President Kirk would require all teachers to have four years aining beyond a high school course. I It would be admitted by nearly all who have studied the question two years of study beyond the high school is too limited prepara - for secondary teaching, especially if part of that time is given to essional aspects of the subject, as is the case in normal schools, that preparation is a considerable advance over former conditions le smaller schools of Nebraska, as well as in the country in general. Hereafter the only teachers receiving the professional certificate by examination will be those now engaged in high school instruction. Practically all recruits will come through normal schools, colleges, and the universities, as they must be graduates of such institutions, or hold a life certificate by examination. It will tax to the utmost every possible agency, university, college, and normal school, to supply the three hundred new teachers annually that will be needed to operate the high schools of the state. It is a condition, not a theory, that faces us. There must be no backward step. The law raising the stan - dard of high school teachers must be held among the statutes of Nebraska. It is a step in the right direction. Without the normal schools It would be impossible to provide a sufficient teaching force for Ne - braska high schools. For several years it will be necessary to add to the ranks of high-school teachers those of our normal-school gradu - ates who feel the call and who have made such preparation as the length of time permitted. They should begin in small schools, but they will reach places of greater responsibility as their experience and suc - cess may warrant. When the state has adjusted itself to the new higher standard, either the normal schools will need to add departments to provide the additional academic training required, or to establish rela - tions with colleges and universities that will offer these courses for them. The new law fixing the limit below which a school board may not So. requiring of teachers graduation from some educational institution or the possession of a professional certificate by examination, is a matter of the greatest importance, and reflects great credit upon all concerned in securing its enactment. However, if it is to be of the greatest possible valne, a slight change is needed In the manner of Issuing those certificates. Instead of the present "blanket" certificate, the subjects in which instruction may be given should be specified, as Is now done in the University Teachers' Certificate, and it should be </seg>
            <seg id="p151">106 II for those subjects only. When the certificate is issued by exam - on, the examining board should first satisfy itself that the candi - has reasonably broad general attainments. There should then be irching test of the fitness of the candidate to teach the one, two, lore subjects in which he is to give instruction. The examination Id be suited to the nature of the subject and to the extent hich the respective courses are to be carried. It should include * ideration of the time spent in preparation and of the methods pur- It should prevent any one from receiving recognition who has merely "coached" for the examination. The certificate should indicate not only the subjects in which m teacher is qualified to give instruction, but also the number of yean that may be taught, if hie preparation does not justify his teaching the full high school course in the subject. This plan would settle - satisfactorily many vexatious quesctions. It would permit teachers to - specialize wisely and then would protect them in their specialty. The school that could prepare teachers well to teach first and second-year subjects would not feel called upon to spread itself out so as to enter the class that prepares for advanced academic work. The teacher who could teach well one year of Latin would be permitted to do so, but would not be allowed to stagger through third year labors. KThis would protect the children by insuring that their instructors made at least a limited study of the subjects they attempt to i. It would prevent the teacher who is unable to set up and adjust Impound microscope from offering a laboratory course in Botany, principal who refuses to use an elementary algebra without a key, d seek more fruitful fields of labor. The teacher who has studied i one year would cease his "blufl" at teaching Caesar. It would ve the danger to life and limb where the teacher without training i a course in laboratory Chemistry. These things cannot be pre - •d under the present laws. This form of certificate would be a protection to the institution Issuing it. When a college or normal school certified a candidate to teach Botany, there would not be the danger of discovering shortly that he hal been assigned to the chair of Greek. This plan of certification would make for better scholarship. One vice of the high school curriculum today is the large number of short, inarticulated courses that are carried. Most of these have their demand in the wide requirements of our examinations for certificates of different grades. Reduce the number of subjects and require better preparation, and many of these minor courses would disappear to the incalculable increase in truer ideals of the proper end of student effort. 80 long as a general examination over a wide range of subjects, regard - less of methods of preparation, is required for a teacher's certificate, "cramming" for an examination will condition all procesbes In teaching.

One thousand teachers, principals and city superintendents are now under the provisions of the law requiring graduation from a college or the advanced course of a normal school or the possession of a professional life certificate in order to retain their positions. Many of these are teaching upon certificates that cannot be renewed. Those who are able to advance iDto the legal grade at the expiration of their present certificate, may continue. The weak cannot survive. Meanwhile, all educational agencies must prepare to do their share in filling the ranks. The establishment of a teachers' college by the University of Nebraska and of strong departments of education by the colleges will be a necessity, if Nebraska is to hold its present position or to move near the ideal now in the consciousness of those closely concerned with the control of her splendid system of public •chools. State Superintendent' 's Position. »I stating my position on this question, I cannot introduce my rks better than to quote from a letter written April 29. 1908. to J. W. Crabtree of the Peru State Normal School: I "I note what you have to say relative to the advisability of recom - ding to the board of education or to the committee that we abandoD training class certificate after this year, and that the state second le certlflicate be issued only to those who have taken one year's work ddition to a twelfth grade high school preparation. "I am not ready to vote for the abandonment of the elementary state certificate or the second grade state certificate. I am ready to vote to raise the standard on which said certificate shall be issued. The minimum now is a two-year high school education plus twenty-four weeks' attendance and creditabl? work at the state normal or private normal recognized on the basis of the state normals. This is more than a year short of the requirements we are making of our normal training students in our normal training hUh schools for a first graie county certificate, and it is left with the discretion of the county superintendent whether to issue graduates of our normal training high schools a first grade county certificate, or a second grade county certifie?" &lt; until they had actual experience as teachers. I would make a f "jr-year high school education or its equivalent and one year's residert attendance the minimum requirement on which the second grade state certificate shall be issued on and after September I, 1908. "Surely the second grade state certificate granted by the state normal schools and by institutions recognized on said standard ought to be in its minimum requirements at least one year in advance of what is demanded of graduates from our normal training high schools, and said certificate should be renewed, without examination, by the board of education of the state normal schools on further attendance at such school or so long as the holder thereof keeps abreast the times and possesses the proper student and professional spirit. This class of certificate holders will b? in great demand in the best positions of our grammar, intermediate and primary grades, though they would not be eligible as high school instructors. "Then for the first grade state certificate, which is converted Into a life certificate on the required experience in teaching;, I would make the minimum requirement two years of college work above a four year high school education, one year of which shall be in actual 9 </seg>
            <seg id="p155">108 attendance at the school granting such certificate. I understand this is what we claim to do at the state normals, but I cannot see how we can demand it or require it of any graduate of a four year high school course who is an applicant for such certificate, provided said applicant is shrewd enough to take advantage of the published require - ments in our last official catalogue. It is understood that all private and denominational schools recognized on the basis of the state normal schools should be required to meet these same conditions. This will ■ o years short of the requirements made at the University of Ne - braska for the first grade state certificate aDd at all institutions recog - nized on the basis of the state university. We must not forget that the teachers' course at the University of Nebraska is the most rigid course required for graduation from said institution. Our excuse heretofore for granting a life certificate on scholarship two years' short of the requirements at the University of Nebraska is, I suppose, that the graduate of the state normal school possesses a superior skill in the art of tf aching, gained from the training given in the practice school; whereas, at the university it has not been practical but theoretical pedagogy. But now comes the Teachers' College there with its well equipped practice school, where practice teaching will be actually red of all students. The regents have just set aside $6,000 with which to furnish and equip the practice school at the University Temple, so we can no longer make the argument for superior skill in teaching for the normal school graduates as compared with the university graduates. "You have heard me say at the Schoolmasters' Club and on various other occasions that so far we have just been running the scale under the new certification law and have not yet come under its most rigid requirements. 1 have in mind now the requirements for the qualifica - tions of Mgh school instructors. The appeal from those who have not yet met these requirements is becoming almost pathetic. Nearly every day some one is being professionally beheaded by the requirements of t*e law. an&lt;i as the year passes the situation will become still more dee - i erate. as so many teachers have put off the day of preparation until tt is too late. "In order that we may take no backward step. I propose for the state normal schools to enter the field of college work and qualify as a colleee nn^er section 6. subdivision 9. school laws, for granting the same kind of a first grade state certificate as is now granted by the rsity of Nebraska. I realize that at first the uinversity will look with some suspicion on this plan if aloptel by the state normal schools. • is a condition and not a theory that confronts us, and like Banquo's ghost, it will never down. "On the other hand, I propose that the Teachers College of the University of Nebraska enter the field of elementary education. I realize that we of the normal schools will look with some doubt upon this policy, but again it is a condition and not a theory that confronts as. The Dew certification law and the high qualifications now de - man^ei bv boards of education throughout the state will give every state and private institution all and more than it can do running at full blast on the plan I have here suggested to supply the demand for better qualified teachers in every field of instruction." Bellevue College and the Nebraska Wesleyan University are the only institutions in the state, either public or private, that have heretofore met the full requirements for certification on the standard of the state normals as well as the University of Nebraska. Under date of November 20, 1908, President Schell made application for the </seg>
            <seg id="p156">109 recognition of York College on the basis of the state university and the state normal schools. If private schools can work both fields, meeting every requirement therein, is it not absurd to argue that the state normal schools and the state university cannot and should not attempt it? The best state normal schools of the United States have already entered upon a full college course in the preparation of teachers for secondary schools. Let the Nebraska state normal schools do likewise for the service it is possible for them to render the state by. And, so far as the University of Nebraska is concerned, no intelligent person can question its right or ability to cover all fields in the professional training of teachers. It will be observed from the quotation from Professor Strong already given in our discussion on the Teachers College that he attributes the signal success of the Ttachers College at Columbia University to the fact that it covers all fields of this great work. I quote his words again relative to the field of work covered by the Teachers College at Columbia University: K "Experienced teachers, administrative officers and representatives 1 all the ranks of education are to be found among its students, success is largely due to its early recognition of the necessity of training of teachers for all grades of work from the kindergarten he university; for the training of the elementary teacher and that le highest specialist and educational expert." The Teachers College at the University of Nebraska has already organized a two year modtl-practice high school. It is the intention of the authorities there to have in operation for the school year 1909-10 a four year model-practice high school. This is as it should be. Then there is opportunity for obsarvation work in real high schools of all grades in and near Lincoln. This opportunity for observation of real high schools launched on the public and under the management and instruction of hunun beings gives the student-teacher a better conception in many respects than any model-practice school can, which at best is more artificial than the real high school, which at worst has a considerable degree of the natural In it. Thus we see that for the model-practice high school as well as for the observation of real high schools, no teachers college in the whole country is surrounded with better advantages than that at the University of Nebraska. It follows also that there are some superior advantages in the Teachers College at the University of Nebraska for the model-practice grammar, intermediate, primary and kindergarten schools, as well as for the observation of real grammar, intermediate, primary and kindergarten schools in the suburbs of Bethany, College View, Have - lock, Normal and University Place, and in the splendid grade schools of Lincoln. It will be hard to find equal opportunities for model-prac - tice grade schools and observation of real grade schools anywhere in the United States than can be found at the Teachers College of the University of Nebraska when it enters this field of wo«-k. Whether the private or denominational schools recognized on the basis of the University of Nebraska or the state normal schools or both </seg>
            <seg id="p157">110 can afford to meet the high standard of certification now required at the state institutions is a question for the private and denominational schools to decide for themselves, on the distinct understanding that each and every private or denominational school must meet every requirement of the law. When private and denominational schools find it impossible to meet the high standard of certification maintained at the Teachers College of the University of Nebraska, I would rec - ommend that 6uch private or denominational schools qualify to meet the requirements for first grade county certificates, which upon college graduation, legally qualifies the holder thereof for any position in the public schools of Nebraska, and entitles such person to a state professional certificate good for life after three years' successful experience as a teacher. In accordance with section 11, subdivision 9a. school laws of Nebraska for 1907, the following requirements have been prescribed by the state superintendent governing the issuance, without examination, of a first grade county certificate to the graduates of a college or university. First — One year's successful experience in teaching', or Second — Four hours of school management; four hours in general methodology; and four hours of elective work in history of education, child study, school hygiene, educational psychology, or other pedago - gical subjects. Where the application of the above rule requires that the county superintendent supply grades, such supplied grades should come within the "With Honor" requirement. KI quote further from my letter of April 29, 1908, to President tree, in order to show the opportunity and responsibility resting all agencies of certification in this state: "I propose also for the state normal schools a special county - certificate course, something as follows: "(a) The third grade county certificate course of eight weeks during the summer term for pupils with less than a two year high school education. The Randall law does not bar such pupils from attending your summer term. These students should complete their examinations In all subjects required for a third grade county certifi - cate, except the five essentials, before coming to Peru. Then during - the summer term of eight weeks give them a thorough review in the itials. Such students will be required to pass the r gular teachers' examination in each and every subject. No credits earned at any school will b? accepted. While no professional training or method 1 work is required for the third grade certificate, the teaching given them by your instructors at the summer school will in and of itsslf mean much to the holder of a third grade county certificate who goes out to&gt; tench Id addition to this rvvip" nf thf five es&lt;-i'nii«ls there shruld be Iund table period at least three times per week where these pro - ive third grade teacher* mi»v he piven »ime idea of *eho&lt;&gt;l manasre - t and the problems that will confront them as teachers in the I schools. Any ninth grade student who attends the eight weeks summer and then returns home and finishes the tenth grade would, assing the examination in all subjects, at the end of the school year me, 1909, be entitled to a second grade county certificate. </seg>

            <seg id="p160">111 |"(b) In order to prepare the graduates of two and three high schools for the second grade county certificate, it seems to that you ought to plan at least one semester during the regular ol year for such pupils. To be sure, if they can pass the examina - in all subjects required for a second grade county certificate and ad your summer term of eight weeks wherein you would give i more of methodology, school management and pedagogy than to third grade teachers, the requirements of the law for eight weeks' nal training for a second grade county certificate would be met. "(c) We have nearly 100 three year and four year high schools that cannot qualify as normal training high schools. We must not forget the graduates of these first class three year and second class four year high schools. We need them in the business of school teaching. Practically the same course should be planned for them as for the schools under (b) just given, except they will be stronger students and can do more advanced work and must have at least twelve weeks of normal training for a first grade county certificate which would be met by one semester of work properly planned during the regular school year or by two summers' attendance." ' Kin the matter of attendance so as to meet the normal training ired by law, it seems to me that the rule required at junior normal sis should be at least the minimum for such credit at the state .als. "In determining the final junior normal credit for six weeks' at - tendance, the final examination grade as given by the state board of ex - aminers shall be counted as one-third: the class instructor's daily mark - ings and occasional tests, averaged, shall be counted as one-third; and the class instructor's judgment of the worthfulness of the student-teacher's endeavors and capacity to instruct shall be counted as one-third. 1'B:fore a student is entitled to a junior normal credit in in any sub - he must pass with an average of at least 70 per cent in these three ts, and he must be in attendance upon instruction in that subject it least thirty days. I "A student who has been In attendance at a junior normal school ' sessions of not less than six weeks each may be granted an ele - tary state certificate upon the completion of the entrance require - its as provided by law at the state normal schools, and the completion &gt;rovided by law at the state normal schools, and the completion the junior normal training course together with reviews of iches included in the entrance requirements. In case the entrance lirement subjects are taken at the junior normal school, additional will be required for graduation." I In my opinion the junior normal schools should do away with the nee of the elementary state certificate and plan their future work r for county certificates, thus making it possible to give more ssional training by doing away with instruction in the subjects red for a life certificate. Let those who want life certificates or ts in life certificate subjects attend the state normals, private &gt;ls, or the University of Nebraska. Therefore, I recommend such irse in the future in the interest of economy and efficiency. Since the minimum for certification in our normal training high schools is now one year in advance of the minimum required by the state normals for the elementary state certificate as well as the minimum required by tbe private normals for the second, grade state </seg>
            <seg id="p161">112 certificate, it seems to me that the time is at hand when the state normals may do away with the elementary state certificate and give their time entirely to college work. It is too expensive for the state to grant elementary state certificates. For example, the state normal school at Kearney granted twenty-nine elementary state certificates in June, 1908, while there were twenty-nine normal training graduates who finished the course in the Lexington high school, only thirty-five miles from the state normal school at Kearney, in June, 1908, on a minimum standard of certification one year in advance of that required at Kearney. Had the requirements at Kearney been as high as the re - quirements at Lexington, I doubt if we would have had over six elementary state certificates granted at Kearney in said year. It cost the state at least $120 per capita, or $3,480, to certificate the elementary class at Kearney for the school year just closed, while it coat the state $350 for the twenty-nine student-teachers who finished the normal training course in the Lexington high school for the same When the state normals do away with the elementary state certificate, it follows that the junior normals must do likewise. The same is true of the private normals, so far as the second grade state certificate is concerned. This would place the certification of all teachers who have not finished the advanced course at the state or private normals or who are not graduates from a college or university under the rules ani regulations governing the issuance of county cer - tificates. This is in line with the demand made by a great majority of the 1 county superintendents, as evidenced by the following "round robin" signed by twelve county superintendents of the Central Ne - braska Educational Association: I "On and after May 1, 1908, all applicants for the elementary • certificate granted by the state normal schools and the ar normal schools, and all applicants for the second graie state ficate granted by private and denominational schools shall be ired to pass the regular teachers' examination in theory and art 'aching, arithmetic, geography, grammar, history, reading, orthog - y. penmanship, mental arithmetic, blackboard drawing, bookkeep - and in such other subjects as are required for the certificate desired pt those subjects in which the applicant has graies accepted and edited by the University of Nebraska." I No school in the state can equal the School of Agriculture of the ersity of Nebraska in its equipment for training teachers for the schools, and in connection with the Teachers College of the Uni - ty of Nebraska the School of Agriculture should furnish our one red normal training high schools with science teachers and teachers criculture. The summer session of the School of Agriculture in ectlon with the University of Nebraska offers matchless opportuni - for both rural teachers and teachers of science, agriculture and lal training for our strongest high schools. As an official representative of the state, it gives me great pleasure to testify to the efficient work done by the private and denominational </seg>
            <seg id="p162">113 schools iD the professional training of teachers and in promoting the cause of higher education in Nebraska. The teachers' certificates granted by these private and denominational schools are of the same tenor and effect and give the holders thereof the same rights and privileges under the laws of the state as those that are granted by the University of Nebraska and by the state Dormal schools to their graduates. The ultra public school enthusiast sometimes crit. the state for the recognition it has given the private and church scl. and asks, "Why do we need the private and church school?" In the field of higher education we have three state institutions, the University of Nebraska and the state normal schools at Peru and at Kearney. In these three institutions there are now in attendance nearly students. All of these schools are taxed to their utmost capacity in buildings, equipment and faculty to properly care for their stu:' The state has gone as far as the friends of the public schools can induce it to go in the privileges offered for higher education to the young men and women of Nebraska. We have twelve church and private schools recognizei on the basis of the University of Nebraska and the state normal schools with authority to grant certificates. In these twelve schools there are now in attendance over 4,000 students. It is evident, therefore, that through the missionary spirit of the church schools and the business enterprise of the private schools as much is being done for higher education as the state is doing. In the face of this record would any friend of the public school system be so blind as to wish to do away with the church and private school in the field of higher education? While religion, morals and character are, not forgotten in the public - schools, most of the time of these schools is devoted to the building of scholarship, and it must be admitted that religion, morality and char - acter are too often neglected. On the other hand, in the church schools while high scholarship is always one of the principal aims, more atten - tion can be paid to religion, morality and character than is possible to give in the public or state schools. There is great work for each of these classes of schools to do iD our commonwealth. Let them work harmoniously together for the cause of education among all our The standard of certification now required by law and public opinion in Nebraska will give every state, private and denominational institution all and more than it can do in the professional training of teachers. The function of the Teachers College of the University of Nebraska as now organized and of all the institutions recognized on that basis is primarily to prepare teachers for secondary schools. In the near future I believe the Teachers College of the University of Nebraska will recognize the necessity of training teachers for all grades of work as the Teachers College of Columbia University is now doing. The function of the advanced courses of the state normal schools and all institutions recognized on the basis of those schools Is. </seg>
            <seg id="p163">114 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT In my opinion, to prepare high school teachers for the n on-accredited high schools and grade teachers in the leading town and city schools. When the time comes for the advanced courses of the state normal schools and all institutions recognized on that basis to do full four years of college work, then they may aspire to prepare teachers for our strongest high schools. While they maintain their elementary courses they may aspire to prepare such teachers for the grades in our Tillage and rural schools. Our junior normal schools and normal train - ing high schools should continue to prepare teachers for the grades in village schools and for the rural schools. The School of Agriculture in connection with the Teachers College of the Uuiversity of Nebraska should prepare teachers for the rural schools and also teachers of science, agriculture and manual training for the high schools of the state. The fact that these agencies may overlap and duplicate in a certain degree the functions I have prescribed for them Is no argument against my policy for the reason that throughout the United States the most reliable statistics show that teachers as a rule do not attend an institution more than one hundred miles from their homes. Making the best use possible of all the agencies in Nebraska for the professional training of teachers — the state university, the state normal schools, the junior normal schools, the private and denominational schools, colleges and universities, and the normal training high schools — each year we are forced to permit at least 1,000 third grade teachers without any professional training to take upon themselves the respon - sible work of instructing the youth. This is absolutely necessary in order to supply the weak rural schools in the remote sections of the state with teachers. It is evident, therefore, that an additional agency should be employed for giving some training to this class of teachers who must be used for many years to come in these weak rural districts. Several facts must be kept in mind in the solution of this problem: First, a large proportion of these teachers cannot afford the expense of attending school a great distance from home; second, the wages from employment In these weak rural districts do not remunerate one for the expense of taking even an elementary normal course or normal training high school &lt;&lt;; and third, these teachers come from the eighth graie in the rural schools and from non-accredited high schools. iTo meet these conditions there are needed several teachers' ling schools with a short course of study in connection with the larly established high schools, so situated as to accommodate this i of teachers. In my opinion, the logical locations for such train - schools would be at the places where the eight junior normal ols are now located. These schools should be maintained at the nse of the state during the regular school year, and placed under management of the state superintendent of public instruction. At t one competent instructor should be employed to devote all of his i to this work. Some may say, let this class of teachers get their training at the Junior n orni al schools tncn But th€ junior norm sis &amp;i*£ rnainta I nod </seg>

A great number of this class of teachers are not lly qualified to enter the state normal schools or the normal training schools. If it is argued that they could attend the private normals lenominational schools maintaining preparatory departments, my rer is that the distance and expense are so great as to make it wt prohibitory for a large majority. There should be two one-year courses of study — one to prepare the student for a third grade county certificate, the other to prepare the student for a second grade county certificate. The third grade cer - tificate course should provide instruction in the following subjects: (a) First semester, reading 5, orthography 3, penmanship 2, arith - metic 5, grammar 5, history 5; (b) second semester, geography 5. physiology and hygiene 5, English composition 5, mental arithmetic 5, theory and practice of teaching 5. The second grade certificate course should comprise the following subjects: (a) first semester, reading 5, arithmetic 5, civics 5, drawing 3, mental arithmetic 2, grammar 5; (b) second semester, agriculture 5, bookkeeping 5, geography 5, history 5, theory and practice of teaching 5. I The minimum qualifications of candidates for entrance to the grade certificate course in these teachers' training schools should s follows: First, they must be at least fifteen years old at time ltrance; second, they must subscribe to the following declaration: , the undersigned, hereby declare that our object In asking admis - to the teachers' training school is to prepare ourselves for teaching; that it is our purpose to engage in teaching in the public schools ebraska op the completion of such preparation;" third, they must j ss an eighth grade education or the equivalent. The minimum qualifications of candidates for entrance to the second grade certificate course in these teachers' training schools should be as follows: First, they must be at least sixteen years old at the time of entrance; second, they must subscribe to the following declaration: "We, the undersigned, hereby declare that our object In asking admission to the teachers' training school is to prepare our - selves for teaching in the public schools of Nebraska on the completion of such preparation;" third, they must possess a one year high school education or the equivalent. The school year should be divided Into two semesters of eighteen •weeks each. It is very important that the study of methods in these schools should not be merely theoretical. Teachers should be trained not only to observe carefully, but to interpret intelligently the principles of teaching as exemplified by actual work in the instruction of pupils In the grades. To afford this training, the class should at least once a week during the semester in which theory and practice of teaching cornea, be given an opportunity to witness skilful teaching in the grades. For practice work, each student should be required to teach at least five practice lessons in a class composed of his fellow students, trader the direct supervision of the Instructor in charge. Due attention </seg>
            <seg id="p165">116 Kd also be given to school organization, school management, and a ul study of actual school conditions in the weak rural school cts of the state. On an average, at each of these schools there would be twenty-five prospective teachers taking the work of each course, making a total ii annually, or 800 for the biennium, who would receive this training in the eight schools. In the aggregate this gives us one great state training school. For the support and maintenance of this work, the state should appropriate not lets than $20,000 for the ensuing biennium. It is impossible for the state to train this class of teachers mm economically under any other plan. It will be impossible to supply these weak rural school districts with better qualified teachers for many years to come, for the reason that these districts cannot pay a sufficient salary to secure a higher standard of qualifications in their teachers. This is a simple matter of business and sentiment will not change the facts. Certification of Teachers. (By Professor Joseph Sparks, President of the State Examining Board for County Certificates.) While it is not desirable to make an extended historical study of the present certification law, yet it may be worth while to make a few statements with regard to the reasons which led to its enactment, its and its accomplishments; and to make some comparisons with systems in operation in other states. Prior to October 1, 1905, examinations for county certificates based upon questions sent from the office of the state super - intendent. Answer papers were marked by the county superintendent, In his office. He was subject to constant interruptions; for the county ntendent is possibly the busiest officer in the court house. He deals directly with the teachers, school officers, and the excited patrons of the public schools of the county, who come to him for advice and direction. Thus the average county superintendent is the immediate adviser of some four hundred school officers and teachers. Add to this the legal requirement that he personally visit each of the hundred or more country schools, hold educational meetings and act as educa - tional leader of his county, it is plain that the old plan of teachers' examinations placed a load of work on an already overburdened officer. It is no reflection upon the county superintendent to say that he could not give the needed time to the examination of his teachers. Examinations were given hastily and loosely; answer papers were marked without proper and careful consideration of their merits; for the county superintendent was, and still is, constantly driven by the amount of work he must perform. The examination of teachers, in itself one of the most important of his duties, was yet the easiest put aside or slighted, and therefore suffered most Add to this the further </seg>
            <seg id="p166">117 E&gt;us facts that with ninety county superintendents examining teach - and working under the disadvantages I have named, without any rtunity for conference with each other, it is apparent that we had lany different standards of certification as there were different ties. tit frequently happened that adjacent superintendents used very rent methods in determining the fitness of their teachers. One Id rely chiefly upon personal inspection of the school as a basis, e the other would over-emphasize the examination, and each would, just caiu edit or refuse the certificate issued by other. A teacher going from one county to the other would be pelled to take the entire examination aii,-w to secure her certificate he second county, and charges of partiality and prejudice were uent and annoying, even though unfounded. , I Hut possibly the most annoying feature of the old law, especially le teacher, was the fact that an incoming county superintendent 1 and often did require all teachers to pass an examination, no er what the educational standing of the teacher was. Thus the ing fortunes of a county election might involve the entire teaching &gt; of a county. Honest and fearless officers were sometimes assailed owerful but unscrupulous persons, because of the refusal of polit - favors. These are briefly some of the evils and annoyances that the present certification law sought to remedy. The law itself was drawn by a committee of county superintendents who knew the needs of the situa - tion and had given years of study to finding the proper remedies. Kvery step in the drafting of the law was raised above a partisan basis. There were at least three members from each of the two leading political parties. ' The chairman of the committee had been the candi - date of the democratic party for the office of state superintendent, and was placed on the committee by motion of his political opponent-elect of the republican party. The law was framed by a committee of seven county superintendents appointed by the County Superintendents' Section of the Nebraska State Teachers' Association at Omaha Decem - ber, 1904. The following county superintendents comprised this com - mittee: Supt. A. Softley of Perkins county; Supt. Charles Arnot of Dodge county, Supt. A. E. Ward of Cedar county, Supt. J. A. Stahl of Cuming county, Supt. R. C. King of Otoe county, Supt. Etta Brown of Cherry county, and Supt. Eugene Brookings of Burt county. I This committee proposed, and the legislature of 1905 enacted a placing the academic examination of teachers in the hands of a com - ee which is governed by Civil Service rules. They wisely left to the ity superintendent the power to judge of the candidate's personal m to teach and govern a school. A survey of the workings of the new law, now that it has been in force for more than three years, shows that the committee wrought wisely in framing the law. </seg>
            <seg id="p167">118 The harmonizing of the various standards which had prevailed, the withdrawal of all possibility of favoritism or discrimination by the adoption of civil service rules, and the re-certification of the 6,000 teachers passing from the former law to the present were carefully considered, and events have proved, were wisely thought out. It was provided that all answer papers should be marked by one committee, appointed by the state superintendent, and, as I have said, working under rules similar to the United States Civil Service Com - mission. Questions for the examination are prepared in the office of the state superintendent, and sent to all county superintendents. Tbe examination is given on a uniform program, all over the state. Candidates for certificates register with the county superintendent, receive a number, which number is used to identify tbe answer papers. Immediately at tbe close of the examination all answer papers are sent to the office of the state superintendent for marking and valuation. All papers are read and checked and a tabulation of results is made before the teacher's name is revealed. I will quote from the Nineteenth Biennial Report of this department to show the methods of valuation of answer papers. "We have had two specialists for the examination of the answer papers in each of the five essentials. For example, two different examiners have graded the reading papers of all teachers, two different examiners have graded the arithmetic papers, two different ones the grammar papers, and so on. In addition thereto, the president of the examining board has reviewed every paper of every teacher. This means that those who have taken the examination in nothing more than the five essentials have had their papers carefully examined by ten different persons and carefully reviewed by the president of the committee. The consensus of opinion of these eleven examiners is safer for the teacher and the public than the opinion of any one per - son. Our examining committee is absolutely non-partisan and non - sectarian — Republicans, Democrats, Populisits, Prohibitionists, Cath - olics and Protestants have been represented thereon." This plan has given most gratifying results. A minimum standard was agreed upon to apply to all counties of the state. No grade below this minimum can be used for certification in any county; but county superintendents are permitted to establish a higher standard for their particular county than the minimum for the state, and five counties have reported that they can meet higher requirements than the state minimum. This in no way interferes with the uniformity which the law sought to establish. To secure a third grade county certificate • n applicant must have an average of at least 70 per cent, with no grade below 60 per cent in any one subject; to secure a second grade county certificate an applicant must have an average of at least 75 per cent, with no grade below 65 per cent in any one subject; to secure a first grade county certificate an applicant must have an average of at least 80 per cent, with no grade below 70 per cent in any one subject. However, the county superintendent has authority to require a higher minimum average and minimum grade for his county, but in no case has he authority to lower tbe standard fixed by the state examining </seg>

Thus we have reached a uniform standard of grading, without imposing burdensome conditions on any locality. I One of the most beneficial provisions of the law is the clause ting to renewals. For this purpose, certificates of the first and nd grade are divided into three classes, according to th? standing e by the teacher. A teacher making an average grade of 90 with grade below 85 is entitled to a certificate having the statement th Honor." An average grade of 85 with no grade below 80 gives teacher a "With Credit" distinction. Teachers holding these cer - ates are entitled to the renewal of the same anywhere in the state lout examination. I Those teachers who fail to reach the above classes are require I ass examination in those subjects below 80 "^ provided there are more than three subjects below that grade. If more than three ects are below 80, the teacher takes the examination in not less three nor more than five subjects, as directed by the county rintendent. {The provision for renewal of "Honor" and "Credit" certificates aut examination is giving to the state a large body of well trained &gt;ermanently certificated teachers entirely free from all examinations, requirements for these permanent certificates were purposely id low enough that the teacher with but ordinary training may hope tain them, by the exercise of such industry as is certainly a duty, ought to be a pleasure. I From March 1, 1908, to October 1, 1908, there were issued in the ? "Honor" first grade certificates, 127; "Credit" first grade certifl - s, 132; plain first grade certificates, 324; a total of 583 first grade Ificates. "Honor" second grade certificates, 175; "Credit" second le certificates, 585; plain second grade certificates, 2,631; a total of 1 second grade certificates: third grade certificates, 890; total num - of regular certificates issued, 4,864. I In addition to these regular certificates, there were Issued orary permits authorized under section 11, subdivision 9a, school of Nebraska. These temporary certificates are only Issued to&gt; idates who in the judgment of the county superintendent, will b» to pass the regular examination. Experience has proved that the ty superintendents are exercising a reasonable caution in the nee of these certificates. Occasionally the recipient of such certifl - fails in the examination, but the occasions are so rare as'not to neect </seg>
            <seg id="p169">120 t special attention, particularly when we consider that the permit ly valid until the results of the next succeeding examination after isuance are announced by the state superintendent. The greater of these 540 emergency certificates have already been superseded ■gular certificates. A study of the above record of certificates shows that 1,019 certificates were issued during the seven months' period which come within the provision of the rules governing permanent certification. These 1,019 teachers need take examinations in the future only as they desire to increase their standings in some branch. Their certificates are renewable anywhere in the state without further examination, at the option of the teacher. There is only one check upon this process of renewal. This is found in the requirement for reading circle and professional work, set forth in section 12, subdivision 9a. So long as these teachers give reasonable attention to the professional require - ments of their calling, that long their certificates will be re-issued to them without question. tit is worthy of consideration also that the tabulation which I have ? covers but seven months, and hence does not include half of the flcates in the state that come within this beneficial provision, e are now engaged in the public schools of Nebraska not less than ) teachers whose certificates are renewable without examination, there are fully that many more who can now see the way clearly d of them for earning a certificate which places them beyond leeds of the examinations. The relatively small number of third grade certificates is most gratifying. These certificates are justly limited in duration to one year or less, and further limited in that but one certificate of this class may be issued to a given applicant. They are, therefore merely a stepping stone provided in law by which teachers who have not had the advantage of normal training required by sections 7 and 8 of subdivision ■9a. may yet hope to enter the teaching profession. The provision for normal training in the high schools and the state appropriation for the aid of such normal training will in time do away with the need of this third grade certificate. At no far distant day the teaching force of our state can be completely recruited by drawing upon these normal training high schools and the excellent normal schools, both public and private, within our borders. l&amp;wa. And Minnrsqf* Plans. I Iowa and Minnesota have plans of examination somewhat similar ebraska. There are, however, two conspicuous differences between Minnesota law and the Nebraska law, first, that in Minnesota ee is charged the teacher for the examination, and second, that » are offered but two examinations a year. All charges for the lination are borne by direct appropriation from the state treasury. absence of any fee leads to numbers of candidates taking the </seg>
            <seg id="p170">121 Initiation merely for the sake of testing their knowledge. These ents have no desire and no intention of entering the teaching pro - on. The grades earned in the teachers' examination are honored nost schools, hence, a high school student or a normal school ent will enter the state examination and take his report from this I examination when he desires to advance in the school he is attend - or to transfer his attendance to some other school. The work of lining these students is, therefore, a source of expense to the state i which there comes no return in the shape of teaching. ISupt. Olson reports that in the counties where normal schools other schools of like nature are located, the work of examination consequent expense is very materially increased from this cause. KThe second difference, namely, that but two examinations are ed in Minnesota each year, requires that the answer papers sub - ■d in these examinations be read and valued by persons who are ted at the time of the examination. The work of examining papers requires only about fifteen days after each examination. There is. therefore, no possibility of creating and maintaining a trained force of examiners, hence, not as great accuracy of valuation can be reached under this system as under ours where there are twelve examinations. The second objection to so few exam - inations is based upon the fact that, should a teacher fail in one exam - ination, too great an interval of time elapses before the teacher has an opportunity to reestablish herself by another examination. Good teachers and those whose academic knowledge is ample, are thus frequently forced out of teaching temporarily, if not permanently. 1 Iowa's examination system gives four examinations in a year. The ter pays a fee of 50c for participating in one of these examinations then if she earns a certificate must pay one dollar each year for tering such certificate in the county where she teaches. (The greater number of examinations in Iowa as contrasted with esota offers appreciable relief to the teacher who fails in an exam - jn. In an established community like Iowa, it is quite possible four examinations in the year would accommodate the teaching and give to the one who fails an opportunity to redeem hersflf e damage would result by loss of employment. There is, how - the same objection with regard to reading and valuing the er papers, that exists under the Minnesota law, namely, that the of grading papers is not of sufficient duration to justify an attempt tablishing a trained examining force. The charge of fees in Iowa appears to be unnecessarily large. The examination fee of 50c, it is true, is the same as the examination fee In Nebraska. There is, however, this striking difference. A fee paid In Towa permits the teacher to participate only in one examination, while the fe« of 50c in Nebraska gives the teacher a right to one trial on each subject required for a certificate. She may write on all subjects at </seg>

The charge of one dollar a year for register - the certificate in the office of the county superintendent, together the examination fee of 50c for each examination entered would ar to make the fees of the Iowa law burdensome to their Sen,. Our own certification law and rules do not involve the evils of a. ■xamination such as exists in Minnesota, ror do they tax our teachers so heavily as are the Iowa teachers taxed. It, therefore, is evident that our statute is more favorable to the teacher in that it oflers a greater number of- opportunities for the examination, that the fees exacted are sufficient to cull out from the examination those who are not even prospective teachers, and yet are not enough to «ork an appreciable burden upon the examined. We have the fur - ther advantage of monthly examinations allowing us to establish and maintain a trained examining force whose valuation of answer papers Is far more equitable than could be obtained by a constantly changing Volume of Wo&gt;k. IFrom October 1, 1905, to November 1. 1908, a period of three s and one month, ther? have been assigned in the examinations 28 numbers to teachers and prospective teachers. It would be rult to reach any conclusion as to how many different teachers have icipated in the examination, from the fact that one teacher may ' enrolled in the examination In two or three different counties while it would seem that we had as many different persons as I were numbers assigned to that teacher, yet actually there would be one teacher. There Is always this difficulty in attempting to esti- I the number of teachers in a state. BWe have received, all told, sinct the present law went into effect, 640 answer papers, or more than a million pages of written man - !pt. As outlined in the Nineteenth Biennial Report of this depart - t, these manuscripts are all read, reviewed, checked, recorded and rt?d to the county superintendent. tOur system of receiving and accounting for papers has been so sys - zed that we can at any time tell when any one of the 233,640 ■ er papers was received at this office, who read it and who checked r viewed the readings. This information can be obtained without appreciable delay. By a most careful and thorough system of re - king all of our work, we have practically eliminated errors, have reduced the proportion of mistakes to less than one-tenth of per cent. In other words, we find not more than one mistake in 0 operations. Summary of Certification Laiv Superintendent McBrien. In addition to the excellent paper by Prof. Sparks in his review of our present certification law, I wish to make a few summary remarks </seg>
            <seg id="p172">EIGHT YEARS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 123 I eon, and to propose the following amendment thereto. The me of work, as reviewed by Prof. Sparks, gives some evidence he herculean task which has confronted our examination com - ee in the inauguration and administration of this law. I do not tate to say that the efficiency of this committee will equal that of United States Civil Service Commission. The work of this committee under this law places the certification of teachers solely upon their merits. Under this law the qualifications of teachers have been raised and their salaries increased. During the past three years over 6,000 teachers each year have attended the summer schools of our state in order to meet the higher standard of certification required by the law. The aggregate increase in teach - ers' salaries in Nebraska for the school years of 1906-7, 1907-8, and 1908-9 will be over $1,250,000. Great credit is due the teachers for the heroic efforts they have put forth to fit themselves for better work and thereby to be entitled to this substantial increase in wages, but the benefit to the public, while not in dollars and cents, is far greater and far superior to that which has come to the teachers themselves. One evidence of this reward which has come to the people of the state is the fact that over 5,000 boys and girls completed the rural school course during the past year and within five years, if this policy is maintained and these good efforts are continued, over 10,000 boys and girls will complete the rural school course each year. There - fore, I want to join Colonel Bryan and Chancellor Andrews in their crusade for better wages and for better qualified teachers. Propcsed Amendment- In section 16 of the original bill as drafted by the committee of county superintendents a fee of $2.00 was required from each appli - cant for each examination, one dollar of which was to go to the insti - tute fund and one dollar to be remitted to the office of the state super - intendent to defray the expenses of the examiantion. But as the law did not go into effect until October 1, 1905, and as soni of the mem - bers of the legislature favored a direct appropriation by the state to cover the necessary expenses of the examination and the cancellation of all fees so far as the teachers were concerned, a compromise was made for a fee of $1.50, one dollar of which goes to the institute fund of the proper county and fifty cents of which is remitted to the office of the state superintendent to defray in part the expenses of the exam - ination. This makes it necessary, as was understood by the legisla - ture which passed this law, for an appropriation to be made each biennium sufficient to meet the deficit in expenses on account of the small fee of fifty cents which comes to this office and the great amount of work to be done here. BSaid section requires that the state superintendent of public uction shall make a semi-annual statement to the governor of </seg>
            <seg id="p173">124 all moneys received by him for such fund and of all moneys disbursed by him from such funds, and also a statement of how much money, if any, he shall have found necessary to use from the appropriation for his office expenses in carrying out the provisions of this act. Every provision of the law has been met by me in duly accounting for every dollar received and every dollar disbursed. The semi-annual reports on file with the governor, as well as the receipts and redeemed checks on file in the office of the state superintendent answer for the use made by me of said fees, and yet it would have been more satisfactory to me to have been permitted by law to account for all of said fees through the regular channels of the offices of the state auditor and the state treasurer. Therefore, in the Interest of the public and as a protection to the state superintendent himself, I propose that said section be so amended as to require the state superintendent to turn over all examination fees re - ceived by him each month to the state treasurer. Said fees, when rceived by the state treasurer, shall be set aside by him and shall be known as the "Teachers' Certification Fund," all money in said fund to toe appropriated and used for the payment of any legitimate expenses in - curred in carrying out the certification law as provided in the original act. Said fees shall be paid out by the state treasurer upon warrants issued by the auditor, provided that the auditor shall not Issue warrants on any of said fund except upon a voucher duly sworn to by the claimant and approved by the state superintendent of public instruction. State Aid to Weak School Districts. By Assistant W. D. Redmond. An appropriation for weak rural school districts is an experiment In Nebraska. Sessions of the State Legislature met year after year and wisely provided for higher education in our normal schools and university, made ample provision for the support of reformatory and penal institutions, but the cause of the boy and the girl in western Nebraska had been seemingly overlooked or entirely neglected. The residents of these less favored districts pay their proportional share of tax to bring the advantages of a college education to young men and young women who complete a high school course, yet it has not been possible for their own children to receive even an eighth grade educa - tion. Nearly all the weak districts of the state vote annually the maximum tax allowed by law for school purposes, but in many cases the assessed valuation of the district is so low that the amount of revenue derived from a levy of twenty-five mills is not sufficient to hold even a three months' term of school. For the school year 1906-07, before any special assistance was allowed, school was held for less than three months in each of 330 school districts of the state. The constitution of Nebraska expressly declares that no part of the regular state school fund shall be allowed to any district for the year in which school is </seg>
            <seg id="p174">125 K-icts have repeatedly lost their share in the regular state apportion - t aDd their only source of revenue for school purposes has been tax derived from the mill levy upon the assessed valuation of the let. In 1907-08 every district in McPherson county except two voted a school tax of twenty-five mills, but notwithstanding this, the average .length of term held by all the districts of the county for the same year was less than five months. Superintendent Ora E. Phillips, speaking of conditions in Box Butte county, says: "There is not a district in this county that would not gladly vote a higher tax for school purposes If the law permitted them to do so." It was to meet such conditions as these that a request was made two years ago asking the legislature lor an appropriation "For the purpose of providing at least seven months of school in the first eight grades for all the youth of the state whose parents or guardians live in public school districts whose funds are not sufficient to maintain school for at least seven months." The urgent need of such special appropriation appealed strongly to the members of the session of 1907, and, as a result, an act was passed appropriating $50,000 to aid weak school districts. This appropriation was made to cover a biennium, or an allowance of $25,000 for each year. On January 20, 1908, when the first distribution of the state aid fund ■was made there were on file in the office of superintendent of public instruction applications for state aid amounting to $89,821, but to meet this demand only $25,000 could be apportioned. While the law con - templated helping each district toward a seven months' term, it was fouud that many districts even by receiving the maximum amount of state aid could not hold more than three months. We invite a careful consideration of the facts shown by the tabulated statement given at the close of this discussion. In preparing this statistical table one district was selected from each of the thirty counties that received the largest share of the state aid fund. The figures used for each district are taken from the certified report made to this department by the county superintendents of the various counties represented. In studying this table, it must be remembered that the law provides that no state aid shall be given any school district unless It voted the limit of taxation at the last annual meeting and until the accounts of such district are audited and approved by the county super - intendent of the proper county. The law further provides that no district shall receive in any one year any state aid in excess of one hundred and twenty dollars, which amount shall be applied exclusively In the payment of teachers' wages. Reference will be made to the financial condition of only a few of the districts included in this list. Take, for example, the first district given in the table, No. 17 of Banner county. This district has an assessed valuation of $6,504, which, with a school tax of 25 mills, would produce annually a revenue of $163 for school purposes. The amount of state apportionment that would be received </seg>
            <seg id="p175">126 by a district having a school census of fifteen pupils is $22, making the total estimated income of district Xo. 17, $185. The expenditures of each district have been grouped under three heads; unbonded indebt - edness, current expenses and teachers' salaries. It was recommended to every district applying for state aid that provision be made for payment of 20 per cent of their unbonded indebtedness each year until paid. Following this plan, the total expenses of district Xo. 17 exclusive of teachers' salaries is the sum of $85 and $25 or $110. As the total resources of the district are $185 the estimated amount of local funds available for the payment of teachers' salaries is $75. Two hundred tighty dollars is a conservative estimate of the amount of money required for the payment of teachers' salaries to hold a seven months' term of school. District Xo. 17 with only $75 local funds available must necessarily receive $205 of state aid in order to main - tain school the full term of seven months as contemplated by the law. I The last column of the table shows the amount of state aid ally received by each district for the year 1907-08, $50 being amount awarded to district Xo. 17 of Banner county. Figures for district in each of the other counties included in this table are ined in the manner explained by the Banner county district. District Xo. 51 of Boyd county has a still more difficult problem to solve. Without state aid the total revenue from all sources is $130, unbonded indebtedness $500. By continuing to vote the maximum 25 mills tax and holding no school whatever would require four years for this district even to get out of debt. Distirct Xo. 12 of Logan county has no outstanding warrants but its total annual income is only $41 including a proportionate share of the regular state apportionment. This district must also look to the state for special assistance if it maintains school for more than one month each year, yet in these two districts there are thirty children who have a right to expect from the state free public school education in the elementary grades. Of the districts referred to and of all the districts given in the table, the aim is not to show exceptional conditions that may be found in only a few weak school districts, but rather to show a con - dition that prevails in hundreds of districts throughout the state. Had we considered only exceptional cases selections would have been made from such districts as Xo. 18 of McPherson county. While not included in the the table this is one of the school districts making application for state aid for the year 1908-09. From the statement of the county superintendent on file in this office it is shown that district Xo. 18 of McPherson county has an assessed valuation of $491; amount of outstanding warrants $163. By voting the limit of tax - ation the total revenue of the district for school purposes is $12.15 a year. Should school be closed and all revenue be applied annually on the indebtedness it will require nearly 14 years for this district to get out of debt. In the meantime there are 15 children of school age living In the district, against whom the door of hope for even a common - school education will have been closed forever. </seg>
            <seg id="p176">127 The appropriation of $50,000 for weak school districts was awarded to the districts entitled to a share in the state aid fund in two pay - ments. The first payment of $24,996 was made in January, 1908, and the second payment of $25,004 will be made before the close of this biennum. No special appropriation ever before made in Nebraska has given school advantages that have been shared in by so large a number of school children of the state. The money was apportioned to forty - five counties, containing 711 school districts entitled to state aid and with a school census of 14,351. This means that during the biennium over 15,000 boys and girls received increased school privileges under the provisions of this act. Although forty-five counties are represented ii- the distribution of this fund, more than 85 per cent of the total amount will be received by twenty-five counties, the larger payment in every instance going to the northern and western counties and the greatest benefits being derived by districts showing the greatest need of special assistance. The good resulting from the enactment of this law has already been written into the official records of the state. Mention has already been made of the fact that in 1906-07 there were 330 school districts in the state that held less than three months' school. In 1907-08, the year following the act, only 238 districts held less than a three moDths' term of school. A start has been made in the right direction, but upon future legislatures rests the responsibility of carrying forward effectively the good work that was begun two years ago. A condition that compels 238 school districts in Nebraska to hold less than three months' school each year is a menace to the welfare of our state and a crime against every child of school age residing in such districts. I The best evidence of the successful operation of this law is shown he very strong endorsements given it by county superintendents school district officers. The following is an extract from the reso - ns unanimously adopted by the West?rn Nebraska Educational Asso - on at the close of its annual session held at Ogalalla in April, 1908: K 'Whereas, the last state legislature wisely considered the needs e frontier portion of this great state, in the appropriation of 00 for the aid of weak districts, and K Whereas, thousands of children have for the first time received nefits of more than three months of school each year, and I "Whereas, this noble attempt to give a fair and square deal to the Iren of the pioneers whose lives are dedicated to the gaining of frontier from a primeval wild to civilization and settlement, has ght to light the pressing need for larger effort in this direction; efore, be it K 'Resolved, by the teachers of the.

            <seg id="p177">128 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT fairness and justice of our petition, we appeal to the great heart of all Nebraska, for their continued, active support in the solution of this, one of the greatest of educational problems." Superintendent 's Conclusion. From the foregoing facts as brought out by Mr. Redmond's report, I am confident that future legislatures will follow the departure made by the session of 1907, and that Nebraska will continue not only to deal generously with her university, normal schools and high schools but will also continue to appropriate sufficient money to be used in giving better free school privileges to the boy and the girl in the weak rural district. Such a policy will make it possible for all boys and Sirls in the state living in these exceptionally weak districts, to which attention has already been called, to receive at least twice the amount of schooling they are now getting. This law should be so amended as to give these exceptionally weak and yet deserving public school districts at least $240 per year. Even by giving each of these districts $240 per year, yet there will still be a considerable number unable to maintain seven months of school, as will be evident from a careful study of the following table showing the Decessary estimated amount of state aid required for seven months of school. The legis - lature of 1909 should not stop short of an appropriation of $100,000 state aid to weak districts for the next biennium. There was not sufficient data for the legislature of 1907 to make an appropriation commensurate with the needs of these districts. Any reasonable person who makes a careful study of this question must admit that $100,000 for the next biennium is absolutely necessary. This is not an attempt to build society. It is an attempt by society to build the individual. Such a policy holds that the state is strong in the proportion in which every individual in the state is free, large, educated, independent. The policy too long pursued may have given ut a finer educated upper class, nobler and deeper thinkers in greater numbers than we would have were we to bend our efforts along this new line, but we have educated the top long enough at the expense of the bottom. Let us unite to educate society from the bottom to the top. "We are not attempting to lift the favored classes higher; we are not attempting to give to those that already have; we are at - tempting to put our hands under the foundations of human society and lift everybody up. That is a slower work; but when it is done and its fruits are ripe you will never doubt again which is the wisest and best </seg>

            <seg id="p185">134 &gt;e and deliver such report to the county clerk whose duty it is to e the required levy the same as though the tax had been voted at annual school district meeting. 15. To see that an approved course of study is in use in the county. Illinois Course of study, published by Hammond &amp; Stephens Co., nont, Nebraska, is approved for the entire state for all grades below ninth grade. 1!. To make necessary regulations for county examinations, so all pupils desiring may be properly tested as to their fitness :eive certificates admitting them to free high school attendance. 7. To grant certificates to pupils entitled thereto for ninth, tenth, eleventh and twelfth grad« work as each case merits. 8. The graduate of a ninth, tenth or eleventh grade high school who wishes to attend another high school which maintains one or more grades higher than the high school in the district of his residence, in order to take advantage of the free high school attendance law, must btve a certificate signed by the county superintendent. This certifi - cate must state that the pupil has completed the course of study for a specified high school grade. This "course of study for high school grades shall be the Nebraska High School Manual issued jointly by the University of Nebraska and th,e State Superintendent of Public Instruction or a course of study approved by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction." 9. It becomes the duty of the county superintendent to give such notice of the requirements of the law that teachers, school officers and patrons may acquaint themselves with the provisions of the law and be prepared to perform their respective parts in meeting its require - nacsnts. He should see that the parents of every pupil qualified for non - resident work make application before the annual school district meet - ing, for free high school privileges for such children th? ensuing year as set forth in Section 7, Subdivision 6, School Laws for 1907. He should also se; that the required free high school tax is levied in order that sufficient funds may be on hand to pay the free high school tuition when the same has been earned by any high school qualified to receive non-resident pupils under the frse high school law. 110. The making and announcing of regulations for the county inations are in the hands of the county superintendent. With )rivileges'of free high school attendance before him, the county h grade examination now means more to the eighth grade pupil fver before. In making regulations for the county eighth grade ination the following named conditions should be kept in mind: (a) All eighth grade pupils in the county should be given a fair chance to take the 'examination. (bl The integrity of the examination should be carefully guarded, wise inefficient pupils may receive passing grades and be per - i to enter the high school to the detriment of both themselves and th? high school entered. </seg>
            <seg id="p186">135 |(c) In many rural schools some members of the eighth grade must leave school about April 1st. An examination in March or in April will accommodate these pupils and at th? same time allow pupils to take a part of the examination, thus avoiding a part e rush of a single final examination at the close of th ■ school t(d) In regular nine month rural schools and in town schools, of the pupils will not be fully prepared for examination in all ubjects until the clos? of th« school year. A second examination as late in May as consistent with the grading of the papers and lg reports to pupils as early as necessary to meet r?quirements of ig exercises and filing of applications by parents for free high il attendance for the ensuing year, will accommodate those who the lull time for completing their work, or such part of it as may e completed at the time of the first examination. tThus, th? county superintendent, in this capacity, becomes the ty inspector of high schools for all high schools of the county which ;ot accredited to the university. Before issuing a free high school Icate to any high school pupil for any grad? of high school work &gt;leted the county superintendent will need to satisfy himself by ction and such oth=r m;ans as he may desire on the following (a) That the high school course of study includes the proper amount and kind of work for the grade completed. (b) That efficient teachers, proper apparatus and other necessary equipment have been provided. K(ct That the work outlined in the course of study has b : ?n car - out, that the pupil has done efficient work, and that he has cora - d all th? work in a manner which entitles him to receive the ty certificate. BThis means that some one, two and three year high school earn udy will have to be revised before their graduates may r* :nition for free high school attendance at another high school are grades. I Each county establishes its own percentage for passing grades in ounty eighth grade examination. A number of counties require a ral average of seventy-five per cent with nothing below sixty-five ent. The required per cent depends a great deal upon the mark - •f the papers. If papers are marked closely ths required average ; should be lower than where liberality in grading is practiced. tr as possible a uniform and impartial system of examination and ading a pupil's examination papers should be adopted and followed r ery county. The county superintendent who issues a certificate declaring that the pupil has completed the course of study in the eighth, ninth, tenth or eleventh grade is the sole judge as to the fitness of the pupil for the high school grade of work he desires to enter. </seg>
            <seg id="p187">136 Eighth grade graduates of a previous year, who have not continued their 'high school education, but who wish to do so, will not be re - quired to take the eighth grade exemination, provided they have cer - tificates from the county superintendent showing that they have com - pleted the work of the eighth grade. Parents. — The Deglect of the parent to discharge his duty may mean the loss of free high school privileges for his children for the ensuing year. Section 3 reads: "The parent or guardian of any pupil desiring to take advantage of the provisions of this act for free high school education shall make application, in writing, to the county superintendent of the proper county on or before the second Monday in June of each year. Such application must show the number of the public school district in which such parent or guardian maintains his legal residence, the number of pupils for whom free high school educa - tion is desired, and the high school grade which each pupil is to KA11 the parent needs to decide is that free high school privileges lesired for the ensuing year. If proper application is made, the it or guardian may later make choice of place of attendance. S Pupil. — The purpose of this law is to provide for four years of free c high school education for all of the youth of this state whose its or guardians live in public school districts wbich maintain less a four year high school course of study. The required conditions on the part of the non-resid€nt pupil are: ( 1 ) For entrance to the ninth grade, that the pupil must have completed the course of study for the first eight grades. For en - trance to the tenth, eleventh, or twelfth grade, that the pupil must have completed the work of the preceding grade. (2) That the pupil is unable to secure in the district of his resi - dence the high school work for which he is prepared and desires. 3. The pupil must have a certificate signed by the county su - perintendent that he has completed the work of the required grade and Is unable to secure the work of the desired grade in the district of his residence. ■ He should have it in tim-e to allow the parent to make applica - to the county superintendent for free high school attendance. Teacher's duties.— The teacher may do these things: 1. See that pupils and interested patrons have a proper under - standing of the requirements of the law. 2. See that pupils are properly applying themselves to an approved course of study. 3. Become well acquainted with all regulations made by the county superintendent relative to county examinations and the issuance of ■county pupil's certificate. 4. See that pupils understand all regulations relative to county •examinations; that they appear at the proper time and place for ex - amination and that they take examinations in all required subjects. </seg>
            <seg id="p188">137 ■ 5. See that parents or guardians make proper application for high school attendance. t Transfer. — When transfer for school privileges is in force under ion 4a, Subdivision 5, School Laws of Nebraska for 1907, the legal lence of the parent or guardian for school privileges is the school •let to which the transfer has been made. Where transfer for school ileges is in force, hiig-h school tutition under the free high school shall be paid by the district to which the transfer has been made. The parent or guardian of the pupil desiring free high school attendance should make application in writing to the county super - intendent of the county embracing the school district in which said parent or guardian maintains his legal residence for school privileges. The transfer law as amended by the legislature of 1907, makes the parent or guardian who is transferred for school privileges a legal Toter in the district to which he is transferred. This amendment actually makes the parent or guardian a legal resident of the district to ■which he is transferred. Where transfer for school privileges is made across the county line, the application for free high school privileges should be made to the county superintendent of the county to which the transfer has been nrade. Free High School Tax The fre*e hign school tax levy is entirely independent of the maximum levy of twenty-five mills for maintenance of school, and is known as the "Free High School Fund," and as such is to be placed to the credit of each public school district in which such free high school tax is levied. It follows, therefore, that a school dis - trict voting twenty-five mills tax for maintaining school must vote in addition thereto the necessary tax for payment of tuition of all pupils of such district entitled to free high school privileges. In all school districts of Nebraska voting the limit of twenty-live mills taxation, whether such districts are able to maintain three months, six months or nine months of school in the home district, the state levies one mill in addition thereto on every dollar of assessed valuation in such district for the support and maintenance of the Uni - versity of Nebraska. Bear in mind also for whom the University tax Is levied. It is made for those more fortunate boys and girls who have finished a three or four year high school course of study before they are entitled to enter the university. I The object of the new free high school law is to give to the boy the girl in the weak rural school district or in the short course ge school district a free and open educational road from the first le in such district through our strongest four year high schools, ugh the state university, and until they shall have profited by all privileges and opportunities offered by that institution. BOn an average there will never be more than one pupil from each I school in any county in attendance at th.e high schools of such ty or at the high schools of a neighboring county or counties. </seg>
            <seg id="p189">138 It the free high school law. It Is true that some rural school districts me counties some years may have as high as three, and some - five or more pupils in attendance at some high school under the free high school law, but in such cases, it will nearly always be I that such districts had sufficient funds to hold seven to nine hs of school each year in the home district. Some have maintained that this ruling places too great a burden upon weak rural school districts voting twenty-five mills, the limit of taxation for school privileges in such districts. It is v.?ry difficult to frame any law that will give equal privileges with equal burdens of taxation to all. Granted for the sake of argument that such a rule will impose a burden on some weak rural school districts, still it is a less burden for all the tax payers of such districts than it would be for but one parent, or at best only a few parents or guardians, to go down in - to their pockets and pay the free high school tuition for their children. We can hardly imagine a court decision that will compel a weak rural school district to levy a one mill tax for a free university edu - cation for those boys and girls coming from our strongest high schools and yet refuse the right of such weak rural districts to tax themselves for the free high school education of their own pupils. In the case of the university, the tax must be paid by the weak rural districts though they may have no students in attendance at the uni - versity. Kin the weak rural district or the strong rural district, as the case be, the free high school tuition is not paid unless there are one ore pupils in actual attendance at some high school. KThen in the cae.? of the weak rural district we must not forget the &gt;f the last legislature appropriating $50,000 to assist them in taining a longer term of school. Payment of Free HiRh School Tuition. — In the payment of th.9 free high school tuition by the county treasurer to any district, the spirit of the law is to be followed as given in the latter part of Section 7, Sub - division 6, School Laws. Where any pupil from the eighth ninth, tenth, or eleventh grade in any public school district is qualified to do the next higher grade of work as evidenced by a certificate to that effect from the county superintendent of the proper county in Nebraska and buch grade of work cannot be given in the district wherein the parent or guardian of such pupil maintains his legal residence, such pupil is entitled to fr.;e high school privileges at the expense of such district, so long as the parent or guardian maintains bis legal residence therein, at the high school of his choice. RThe fact that for any r ason no tax was voted or levied for ree high school tuition of such pupil must not deprive him of free school privileges nor will such fact relieve the district of liability ■for. Cooley, the highest authority on taxation, says: "Technical defects and irregularities should be overlooked, for the obvious reason that local business is largely and of necessity in the hands of plain people who are unskilled in the technicalities of law and un- </seg>
            <seg id="p190">EIGHT YEARS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 139 accustomed to critical or even accurate use of language. A strict con - struction of their doings would Inevitably be mischievous, and would defeat the collection of revenue in very many cases." The new free high school law was ushered in so near the time of the last annual school meeting that the people did not have an op - portunity to inform themselves fully on all the directions given in said law, and a "strict construction of their doings" would defeat the purpose of the law, and deprive pupils of their rights under its pro - visions. Klf ip any district or districts no free high school tax was voted vied to pay the free high school tuition of pupils entitled thereto ch district or districts, the rights of such pupil or pupils must still ■otected by such district or districts being holden for suoh tuition. ;ting upon these matters there are only three things to be deter- ■ (1) Is the pupil qualified to do the grade of work applied for and he a certificate from the proper county superintendent to that t? (2) Can he get such grade of work in his home district? ■ (3) Has the high school where such pupil attended been officially oved as meeting th.? requirements of the free high school law, and the pupil received the proper instruction? I On these questions the county superintendent is the authority upon him rests the responsibility for protecting the rights of all s entitled to free 'high school privileges by giving all pupils of his ty the proper certificate upon which boards of education in high )1 districts entitled to collect free high school tuition for non - ent pupils must base their claim under oath when applying there - o the respective county treasurers of Nebraska. I In the event that no tax was levied for free high school tuition sat no fund has been set aside as the free high school fund, it is ruling of this department that free high school tuition legally any high school district may be paid out of tb? general fund of the ic school district liable therefor. Forfeits Free High School Tuition. (a) Removal from District. — When a parent or guardian moves from a school district holden for the free high school tuition of his child or children, that district is no longer liable for th? payment of the high school tuition for such child or children. t(b) Failure to do Satisfactory Work. — The importance of making trough examination of eighth, ninth, tenth and .eleventh grade s is imperative. Every pupil who is given a certificate for free school privileges should be able to do the work in the grade to 1 the certificate admits ihim. If at the end of nine weeks the pu - innot do the work of the grade to which the certificate admits him, 11 be the duty of the secretary of the board of the school district e the non-resident pupil Is attending, to notify the county super- H </seg>
            <seg id="p191">140 fdent of the proper county. After suoh notice the home district ch pupil will no longer be holden fur the tuition of such pupil in grade. "At the Knd of Each School Term." — The phrase "at the end of each school term" found in the latter part of Section 7, Subdivision 6, school laws, U construed by this department to mean at the end of each semester. You will observe under "First" Section 5, Subdivision 6, School Laws, that the course of study for the high school grades of all high schools entitled to collect tuition for non-resident pupils under this act shall be the Nebraska High School Manual Issued jointly by the University of Nebraska and the state superintendent of public instruction, or a course of study approved by the state superintendent of public instruction. I have approved the Nebraska High School Manual as the course of study for all high schools entitled to col - lect free high school tuition for non-resident pupils. This manual divides the school year into two terms or semesters. In most high schools the tuition for the first term or semester is due in January or February and should be paid when warrants are properly presented therefor. What Constitutes a Week's Attendance. — When a pupil is absent three consecutive days he is dropped from the list of pupils belong - ing to the school. That is, at the end of the fourth day of his absence be is no longer counted as belonging to the school. I know this was the precedent set by State Superintendent Corbe-tt in 'his teachers' class book and record of pupils' attendance. Under this plan a pupil could be present Monday, absent Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, re - turn to school Friday and be counted as a pupil belonging to the school for that week. I shall hold, however, that if a pupil is in at - tendance but one day in any on? week, he shall be counted as be - longing to the school for that week, and that on such non-resident attendance the public school district, where such pupil so attends, will be entitled to draw the seventy-five cents per week high school tui - tion therefor as provided by law. On the other hand, I shall hold that ■ a non-resMent pupil fails to attend a single day in any one week the public school district will not be entitled to any tuition for that week's non-attendance. This Law Is Equitable. — When we remember that on the average there will not be more than one pupil in attendance from any weak rural district for any one year at any high school under the new free high school law, the fact that such districts must pay only $27.00 free high school tuition each year, and receive back from the state $120.00 State Aid in addition to the state apportionment of public school moneys, it is evident that our legislators gave us as nearly an equitable free high school law as it is possible for human genius to frame. The uew high school law is a reciprocal proposition which will bring great benefit to both town and country schools. It places the burden of free high school privileges for non-resident pupils where it be- </seg>

The average school tax levy for the rural school districts of the state Is fourteen mills and for high sohool and city districts, nine - teen mills. This shows that school districts which enjoy free high school privileges are the ones that should pay for it. IKr&lt; &lt;■ High School Certificates. —By provision made in the free . school law, the county superintendent is the sole authority for ing free high school certificates. This applies to pupils of the th, ninth, tenth and eleventh grades who have completed the work d in the home district and who desire free high school privileges ensuing year in a public high school in Nebraska. The following litions should be kept in mind: 1. Only those high schools approved by the state superintendent of public instruction are entitled to collect high school tuition from the home district for the attendance of non-resident pupils under the free high school law. 2. Only those pupils who hav- completed all the grades of work maintained by the home district and who secure free high school cer - tificates to that effect from the county superintendent are eligible to free high school attendance in another school district at the expense of the home district. 13. The recognized number of high school grades maintained by high school is the number of grades designated in the official ap - il given by the state superintendent. 4. High schools are approved only for one school year at a time. The required report for the school year 1908-9 must be made to the state superintendent before approval is given any high school for the school year 1908-9. All high schools now approved are approved only for the present school year. 5. The Nebraska High School Manual is the standard by which all high schools are measured. ■ 6. The following directions and recommendations are made for guidance of the county superintendents in the issuance of free school certificates: I (a) All eighth grade pupils desiring free high school privileges ensuing yiear should take the regular county eighth grade exami - sn. This applies to non-resid'ent pupils attending town and city oLs as well as to those attending rural schools. Some confusion has aristen from the practice in some counties cf granting to eighth grade graduates what is known as a Common School Diploma, without reference to the eligibility of the pupil for school work under the free high school law. Each pupil graduating from the eighth grade should receive a free high school certificate. This should be sufficient recognition for the completion of the eighth grade work. K(b) Each ninth, tenth and eleventh grade pupil desiring free high 1 privileges for the ensuing year should secure a free high school y certificate from the county superintendent of the county in i th« resident district of such pupil is located. </seg>
            <seg id="p195">142 K(c) The following recommendations are made to the county su - itendent for the issuance of fre? high school certificates to pupils complete the eighth, ninth, tenth or eleventh grades and desire free school privileges the ensuing year. (1) In high schools approved by the state superintendent as high schools of the "First Class" it is recommended that the county superintendent may grant to pupils completing the regular work of the ninth, tenth and eleventh grades the required free high school cer - tificates, on evidence of work completed and recommendation of the principal of the high school giving such instruction; Provided, That if he have reason to believe that any part of the required work has not been properly completed by any pupil, the county superintendent should require such pupil to take such examination as will properly test th.e scholarship of such pupil. (2) In high schools of the "Second Class" and all high schools other than those approved by the state superintendent as high schools of the "First Class," it is recommended that the county superintend - ent shall eet such dates and places of examination as he may choose, at which examinations he shall examine all applicants for free high school certificates far entrance to the tenth, eleventh and twelfth grades. The county superintendent has full power to provide exami - nation questions and make all regulations for conducting the exami - nation, grading the answer papers, and issuing certificates; Pro - vided, That on strong evidence that the work in any particular branch has been done in extent and thoroughness equal to the requirements of the Nebraska High School Manual, and on recommendation of the principal of the high school giving the instruction, the county superin - tendent may excuse pupils from examination in such subject; Pro - vided further, That fra all other than high schools of the "First Class" the county superintendent shall require of each pupil applying for a free high school certificate a written examination in not less than two of the following divisions of work as designated in the course of study for the grade of work completed: English, science, mathematics, history, Latin. In no case should any pupil be excused from any ex - amination by the county superintendent unless there Is satisfactory evidence that the work done has been equal in extent and in quality to the requirements of the regular work outlined in the Nebraska High School Manual. Constitutionality Tested. IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF RICHARDSON COUNTY, NEBRASKA. Thomas Wilkinson, Plaintiff, v. Joshua S. Lord, Treasurer, Defendant. Brief of J. L. McBrien, State Superintendent </seg>
            <seg id="p196">143 This brief is filed by permission of the District Court and deals solely with the constitutionality aDd reasonableness of the Free High School Act passed by the Legislature of 1907, the same constituting Chapter 121 of the Session Laws of 1907, and Sections 5494 to 5497b inclusive, Chapter 79, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska (Wheeler), 1907. The author of this brief is interested in the determination of the questions at issue by reason of his being the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. One of the most important duties imposed upon him by statute la that "he shall seek to advance the cause of education in the state." It is in obedience to this command that he pleads with the court to hold the free High School Act of 1907 con - stitutional and reasonable in all of its provisions. The following. lines of attack are made by the attorney for the plaintiff against the act: 11. Inasmuch as the Supreme Court declared the Free High School of 1899 unconstitutional, it follows that this court must declare Free High School Act of 1907 null and void, as the same principle ivolved and the two cases are exactly alike in facts. 12. That the act of 1907 is void because it is an attempt by the lature to delegate its power of legislation to a public officer of the ty — the county superintendent. t3. That the mode of levying the tax is roundabout, but in the mandatory. 4. That the power to impose a tax is sovereign and not legislative. 5. That the act of 1907 is broader than its title and therefore unconstitutional. 6. That the act of 1907 seeks to amend by rnpf 11»I certain sec - tions of law without containing the repealed sections. tl. That the Free High School Act of 1907 charges the arbitrary l of seventy-five cents per week, while the County High School Act 1907 provides that the board may admit pupils from without the nty upon the payment of such tuition as the board may prescribe. J8. The Free High School Act of 1907 charges the arbitrary sum seventy-five cents per week for each non-resident pupil, while the &gt;e High School Act of 1895 charged only fifty cents per week for h pupil, except when it could be shown that the actual cost of edu - ion per pupil in any high school was greater than such sum. 9. That under the act of 1907 the county superintendent may certify enough taxes on account of high school pupils to absorb the maximum levy of twenty-five mills for district school purposes, and not only wipe this old statute out of existence but also put an end to the common schools of ths country. These nine propositions will now be considered in their order. 1. The principles of taxation in tlie acts of 1809 and 19O7 are di - ametrically opposed to each other. The act of 1899 made the county the unit of taxation, and thus forced a tax upon some outside districts which had no pupils eligible for free high school privileges in any given high school district. On </seg>
            <seg id="p197">144 hav« gone so far as to place a treble tax. First, there was the tax for the support of the local high school imposed upon the property of all tax payers living in that high school district for the education of the children living within such district. Second, there was the propor - tionate tax for the tuition of the pupils from the- outside district who were educated in the given high school, to be paid out of the general fund of the county. Third, od the assumption that the seventy - flre cents per week allowed to be collected by the act from the gen - eral fund of the county was insufficient to meet the expenses ot edu - cating the non-resident pupils in a given high school district, it is evi - dent that this difference had to be made good by levying and collecting taxes on the property of the tax payers resident in such high school district, for this difference could not be collected from the tax payers of the whole county, as the act of 1899 failed to properly protect a high school district against educating non-resident pupils at leas than cost. Then the tax payers within such high school dis - trict paid a greater proportion of the free high school tax than did those residing within the county but outside such high school district, and while the valuation of the property of those within such high school district and those without it might have been uniform, yet the rate of taxation for the same purpose would be higher on the property within than upon that without such high school district. Therefore, it is admitted that the act of 1899 clearly violated sections 1 4, and 6, of Article IX of the Constitution. The act of 1907 makes the district the unit of taxation. It places the burden of taxation where it belongs, and that is upon the dis - trict which has the pupils entitled to and receiving the free high school education. No district is taxed more than once for free high school privileges. "Money remaining in the free high school fund of any district at the end of each school year after the purpose for -which it was raised has been accomplished and after all debts for which said fund is liable have been discharged shall be transferred by the county treasurer to the general fund of such district." See the last provision in section 3 of the act of 1907. "In a public school district in which in any year there are no pupils entitled to and desiring free high school education as in this act provided, no tax shall be levied for such pur - pose in that year." See section 6 of said act. By a careful examination of the act of 1907 it will be observed that the rule of uniformity prescribed by the Constitution of the state in levying a tax by valuation so that every person and corporation shall pay a tax in proportion to the value of his, her or its property and franchise, has not been violated even in the most infinitesimal degree. A tax that will produce seventy-five cents per week to provide free public high school education for all the youth in a given district which does not offer such advantages is equally uniform on the taxpayers of suoh district with the tax levied by themselves and upon themselves for the </seg>
            <seg id="p198">145 notwithstanding such free high school education is obtained outside the district imposing the tax therefor. Therefore, on this point said act Is in strict accord with the rule of the Constitution which requires that all taxes for municipal purposes shall be uniform in respect to persons and property within the jurisdiction of the body imposing the same. The act of 1899 was annulled on the assumption that the arbi - trary sum of seventy-five cents per week for the tuition of each non - resident pupil might fall below or exceed the cost of such tuition. In his conclusion Judge Norval said: "The cases stated are, of c&lt; only assumptions, but they are the natural result of the system sought to be inaugurated by the act in question." It is easy to make an as - sumption that this arbitrary sum might fall below or exceed the cost of tuition for non-resident pupils. Suppose the court had assumed such arbitrary sum to be the actual cost, as did the members of the legislature when they passed the free high school measure of 1899. It would have been just as reasonable for the court to make such an assumption and to have reached the ultimate conclusion that said act was constitutional. Therefor?, the act of 1907 should not be dei unconstitutional on a mere assumption. A much safer principle is laid down by the court in the case of Pleuler v. State, 11 Xeb. 54 6; "To justify a court in pronouncing an act of the legislature unconstitu - tional, it must be clear and free from reasonable doubt that it is so." I From a careful reading of the last provision of section 1 of the of 1899, it is evident that sufficient protection was not given a school district against possible loss by reason of educating non - lent pupils at less than cost. Said provision reads: I "When any high school shall be unable to furnish accommodations on-residents without constructing or renting additional buil board of education may refuse admission to such non-resident pu- It will be observed that the law specified but two vali » 9. board of education of a high school district to refuse admi on-resident pupils, viz., the necessity of "constructing or renting tional buildings." I Under the act of 1907 no high school district is forced to take any whatsoever on educating non-resident pupils at less than actual The last sentence of Sixth, section 1 of said act reads: "Any pub - ichool district unable to furnish accommodations to non-resident Is without constructing or renting additional buildings, hiring ex - teachers, or for other reasonable cause may refuse admission to or all such non-resident pupils." The right of the board of educa - under said act to refuse admission to any or all non-resident pupils iny "reasonable cause" is sufficient guarantee to such district against •ating non-resident pupils at less than cost as to place that ques - b-eyond debate. The act of 1907 places such requirements upon a high school dis - trict in educating non-resident pupils as to make it physically impos - sible for such district to qualify for a less sum than seventy-five cents a week for each non-reeWent pupil. These requirements are given </seg>
            <seg id="p199">146 under First, section 1 of said act: "The course of study for the high school grades shall be the Nebraska High School Manual issued joint - ly by the University of Nebraska and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, or a course of study approved by the State Super - intendent of Public Instruction." The first official act of the State Su - perintendent in the administration of this law was to approve the Ne - braska High School Manual as the prescribed course of study in all high schools qualifying under said act. Said manual sets forth definite requirements in courses of study, books, apparatus, and teaching force both as to number and qualifications. Professional school men who knew from a personal knowledge the actual cost of high school edu - cation and boards of education, who from long years of service in such capacity had a practical knowledge of the cost of conducting a high school as well as other lines of business, were unanimous in their opinion at the time the act was pending before the legislature that no high school qualifying under this act could educate non-resident pupils at less than seventy-five cents a week for each pupil. Many mem - bers of the legislature were themselves or 'had been members of boards of education in high school districts, and the expert testimony of such men was at the command of the legislature when the act of 1907 was passed by that body. "It is presumed that the legislature acted with full knowledge of the facts upon which the legislation is based." (C. M. &amp; St. P. Ry. Co. v. Tompkins, 176 U. S. 173.) The same session of the Nebraska legislature that passed the Free High School Act of 1907 passed the Maximum Passenger Rate Act, and state and federal courts have time and again sustained the reasonable - seal and the constitutional validity of railroad legislation fixing an arbi - trary rate for the transportation of passengers. "Under previous decisions of the court the legislative rate is to be taken as presumptively reasonable." (Hukk'&lt;' s v - Illinois, 108 U. S. 541.1 Kirislature has power to fix rates for the transportation of igers by railways, and the extent of judicial interference is pro - n against unreasonable rates. • • • B Courts should be careful not to declare legislative acts unconstitu - upon agreed and general statements, and without the fullest 3ure of all material facts." (Chicago &amp; Grand Trunk Railway Co. llnian, 143 U. S. 339.) I 'In approaching the consideration of a case of this kind (a rate we start with the presumption that the act of the legislature id, and upon any company seeking to challenge its validity rests the n of proving that it infringes the constitutional guarantee of etion to property. The case must be a clear one in behalf of the ad company or the legislation of the state must be upheld." I. * St. P. Ry. Co v Tompkins, 176 U. S. 173.) "It is not to be supposed that the legislature of any state * • • will engage in a deliberate attempt to cripple or destroy institutions of such great value to the community as the railroads, but will always act with the sincere purpose of doing justice to the owners of railroad property, as well as to other individuals. • » • And if the rates established • * • are not conclusive, they are at least prima facie </seg>
            <seg id="p200">147 evidence of what is reasonable and just." (Reagan v. Farmers' Loan Jk Trust Co., 154 U. S. 395.) I Therefore in accordance with the oft-repeated principle of the reme Court of Nebraska, as well as that of the Supreme Court of United States, the free high school act of 1907 is surrounded with presumption of its reasonableness and constitutional validity. II. The act of 19O7 by requiring the county superintendent t&lt;» certify to the county clerk the necessary amount to be levied does not violate any constitutional provision. I This principle of taxation is found throughout the school laws of state and has been sustained time and again by the Supreme Court, board of education of every city school district shall annually dur - the month of June report to the county commissioners an estimate le amount of funds required for the support of the schools during fiscal year next ensuing, without any vote of the people authoriz - &amp;uch a tax levy. See section 5617, Chapter 79, Compiled Statutes Cebraska (Wheeler) for 1907. This same principle of taxation is found in the act relative to public schools in cities of the first class (in 1878, while Omaha was st.il! a city of the first class), where the board of education, without any vote of the people, was required to report to the city council the estimate of funds required for the ensuing fiscal year, and it was the duty of the city council to levy and collect the necessary amount of taxes for school purposes the same as other taxes. This statute gov - erned Omaha before it passed under the act relative to schools in quired for that purpose. See State of Nebraska ex rel. School District of Omaha, 7 Neb. 267. t Again the same principle of taxation at issue is found in the act ive to schools in metropolitan cities, which requires the board of ation, without any vote of the people, to report to the city council stimate of the total amount of funds required for school purposes, leaves with the city council ths power to determine what propor - of this amount will bs realized from sources other than taxation, the amount it is necessary to raise by taxation, and the levy "re - id for that purpose. See State of Nebraska ex rel. School District malm v. Mayor and City Council of the City of Omaha, 39 Neb. 746. KA specific example of the principle of taxation at issue is found ie statute governing the division of school property and the pro - n made for district school indebtedness, as is evident from Sec - 5408, Chapter 79, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska (Wheeler) for , which reads: I "Sec. 5408. The amount of such proportion, when so ascertained determined, shall be certified by the county superintendent to the ty clerk, who shall present the said amount to the county board ie session next succeeding, whose duty it shall be at the proper or times to assess the same upon the taxable property of the let retaining the schoolhouse or other property of the former let in the same manner as If the same had been authorized by a </seg>
            <seg id="p201">148 Bof such district, and the money so assessed shall be placed to the t of the new district." The Supreme Court sustained this principle of taxation in the following positive language: "A certificate from the county superintendent of schools to the county clerk, of fin amount found by him to be due as between school districts, upon a&gt; division thereof, is sufficient to authorize the levy of a tax upon the property of the district or districts from which the amount is found due." (Burlington &amp; M. R. R. Oo. v. Lancaster County, 12 Neb. 324, 11 N. W. 332.) III. In the last analysis the levying of any or all taxes is man da - The attorney for the plaintiff in this case alleges the act of 1907 is void because the statute requiring the county superintendent to report to the county clerk the necessary tax is mandatory. A de - cision of the court holding said act to be void on these grounds would endanger the very foundation of our public school system. To carry such a contention to its ultimate conclusion would give the enemies of our public schools the key whereby they could lock the doors even of the elementary schools against thousands of our youth. The voice of the people speaking to the legislature through the Constitution made it mandatory upon that body to make it mandatory upon all school districts to vote a tax on the property therein sufficient to main - tain public schools free and open for the time provided by law to all the youth of this state. Section 6, Article VIII of the Constitution of Nebraska reads: "The legislature shall provide for the free instruction, in the common schools of this state, of all persons between the ages of five and twenty-one yean." Bin obedience to this mandatory voice, the legislature, speaking er 6,000 school districts, said in section 5437, Chapter 79, Com- Statutes of Nebraska (Wheeler) for 1907: "The legal voters at the annual meeting each year shall deter - mine the amount of money required for school maintenance during the coming school year, which shall be an amount sufficient to main - tain school in the manner and for the time provided in section 5440 of the act, and the amount of money so required shall be levied as a tax upon all the taxable property of the school district." Some years ago enemies of the public schools in certain rural school districts of Nebraska made it a common custom at the annual school district meeting to vote no levy for school purposes or else to take no action at the annual meeting to provide for school, and even in some cases deliberatsly voted to have no school. This custom was so prevalent in several counties that the legislature of 1905, in obedience to the mandatory voice of the people speaking through the Constitu - tion, enacted the following amendment to section 5437, Chapter 79, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska (Wheeler) for 1907, as the proper remedy: "Sec. 5437a. Where no levy is voted at th« annual school district Yntkctf in v or w \\ f*Yf* t Vip A is t t\c t vot €*s to h sv^ no so tiool or wh6T6 no </seg>

It shall be the duty of the county clerk to ■ such taxes on the taxable property of the district, to be collected the county treasurer at the same time and in the same manner as state and county taxes are collected; and when collected to be I to the treasurer of the proper district on the order of the director atersigned by the moderator of said district." IThe act of 1907 for secondary education first gives the legal s in all the public school districts of Nebraska the opportunity te this tax, as it did in the act for elementary education. I "The legal voters at the annual school district meeting each year determine the amount of money required for free high school ation during the coming school year as in this act provided, h shall be an amount sufficient to provide free high school educa - in accordance with the estimate furnished the annual school dis - meeting by the the director or secretary of the board of education erein required, and the amount of money so required shall be d as a tax upon all of the taxable property of the school district." ion 5496, Chapter 79, Compiled Statues of Nebraska (Wh&gt; • 1907. In case the annual school meeting of any public school district fails to vote the free high school tax, the act of 1907 gives the voters of such district through their chosen representatives, the school dis - trict officers, an additional opportunity to comply with the law before requiring the county superintendent to certify to the county clerk the necessary tax therefor. Said section reads: "Sec. 5497. If the annual school meeting in any public school district wherein there are pupils entitled to and desiring fre? high school education as in this act provided neglect or refuse to vote the necessary tax therefor, the school district board or the board of edu - cation of such public school district shall make and deliver to the county superintendent and the county clerk of each county in which any part of the school district is situated, not later than th? first Monday in July, an itemized estimate of the amount necessary to *&gt;e expended during the ensuing school year for free high school educa - tion by such public school district. It shall be the duty of the county clerk to levy such tax on all taxable property of such public school district the same as thoug&gt;h safd tax had been voted by the annual school district meeting, to be collected and disbursed by the county treasurer as provided in section 3 of this act." If the school district board fails to perform this duty then "the county superintendent of the proper county shall make and deliver to the county clerk of each county in which any part of such public school district is situated, not later than the first Monday in August following the annual school district meeting, an itemized estimate of the amount necessary to be expended by such public school dis - trict during the ensuing year for free high school education. It shall be the duty of the county clerk to levy such tax on all the taxable property of such school district the same as though such tax </seg>
            <seg id="p203">150 had been voted by the annual school district meeting, to be collected by the county treasurer at the same time and in the same manner Ee state and county taxes are collected, and when collected to id out as provided in section 3 of this act." Sec. 5497a, chapter ompiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1907. It Is alleged in the petition of the plaintiff that the taxpayers hool district No. 42, Richardson county, Nebraska, in which sides, at the annual school meeting in 1907, neglected or re - to vote the tax certified to them as necessary to pay the n of certain pupils of that district for their high school edu - l in another district. It is further alleged that the board ucatlon of said district also failed or refused to make the cer - e of the necessary tax to the county clerk, and because of such e and in obedience to the commands in said statute, the county intendent made the necessary certificate to said officer, and Ix sufficient to pay the cost of educating said pupils outside district of their residence was levied on all the taxable prop - of said district, and thus became a charge against the property he taxpayers of said district, and upon the property of this tiff, and that the action of the county superintendent forms &gt;asis of this action to annul the act in question. It matters not whether the principle of taxation requires the people to first vote the tax before it is certified to the proper levy- Ing and collecting authority, or whether It be certified without a vote of the people by the proper public officer or officers, the nec - essary vote or required certification of the tax may be enforced by writ of mandamus. The Attorney General of Nebraska, under date of January 10, 1902, held that the legal voters of a rural school district in a proper case could be compelled by mandamus to vote the revenue for school purposes, and cited in support of his opinion the cue of Carothers v. Beard of Education, 16 W. Va. 527; Haines t. People, 19 III. App. 354. This is the view taken by the Supreme Court of this state in a case involving the same principle. State v. mb, 4 6 Neb. 623; West Point Waterpower Co. v. State, 49 Neb.

            <seg id="p206">151 cation of the children therein, even in the first eight grades, the legislature knew that to insure four years of fre? high school edu - cation for all the youth of this state whose parents or guardians live in public school districts which maintain less than a four-year •high school course of study, it was necsss-ary as a method of last resort to give the same official, the county superintendent, authority to certify the required tax for the secondary education of all the youth of this state as contemplated in the act, as had been found necessary in providing funds for their elementary education. Therefore, the reasons which prompted the legislature to use the county superintendent as the agency of last resort in certifying the tax for both elementary and secondary education of rural school pupils were those of expediency and economy. As there are over 6,000 rural school districts in this state from which there will likely - come one or more pupils from time to time to take advantage of this high school act, it is quite probable that it would become a physical impossibility to enforce the law under the old method of procedure by a writ of mandamus from the court. Our district and supreme courts would soon be overwhelmed with applications for writs of mandamus to compel legal school voters or school district officers to perform a plain and specific duty. Or else the people whose children are entitled to such free high school instruction would soon become wearied and discouraged and would give up their fight for secondary education under such a cumbersome, expensive and dilatory policy as would prevail under the method by writ of mandamus. In fact, such a policy would be so expensive as to make secondary education prohibitive for the children of the poor man who lives in a public school district which refuses to provide such instruction. The poor man would be forced at his own expense to fight for his rights under the law, while the district would bear the expense in all cases where it is a party to the suit. Or as in the present case the poor man would be over-matched when forced to fight for his rights against as wealthy a taxpayer as this plaintiff. IV.

            <seg id="p207">152 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT It is alleged by the attorney for the plaintiff that this act makes Iiuliar process for the raising of revenue not provided for by the Said title reads: "An act to provide four years free public high il education for all the youth of this state whose parents or lians live in public school districts which maintain less than a four high school course of study, and to repeal all acts and parts of In conflict herewith." I This title is as comprehensive relative to free public high school ation contemplated therein as section 6, Article VIII of the Con - tion: "The legislature shall provide for the free instruction in the uon schools of this state of all persons between the ages of five twenty-one years, it is evident that if said section of the Con - tion gave the legislature the authority to provide the means of nue for the support of the common schools of this state, the title le act in question likewise contains sufficient authority for raising revenue called for by the act. The Supreme Court passed upon the same principle here involved wnen the title of the act providing for free text books was attacked. Said title reads: "An act to provide cheaper text books and for district ownership of the same." See Session Laws for 1891, Chapter 46, p. 334. See also 51 Neb. 91. I The question at issue here is whether the words "Provide four s of free public high school education" included the means for ng revenue therefor. There is no more comprehensive word in the English language than the word "provide." According to Web - s. dictionary, it it is defined: "to make ready for future use; to fur - ; to supply." This is the construction placed upon this word in e t. Gary, 28 Mass. (11 Pick.) 106, 109. The title of the act establishing free schools in Nebraska, which pum) and took effect February 15, 1869, reads: "An act to establish a system of public instruction for the state of Nebraska." See Session Law* 1869, page 115. Under this title that act gave authority for the establishment of the school district, the election of officers, the lo - cation, purchase and sale of a site, the voting of school district bonds to obtain money with which to erect buildings, the hiring of teachers, and the levying and collecting of all necessary taxes required for the support and maintenance of public schools. , I It would be just as reasonable to attack the constitutionality of the establishing public schools on account of a defective title as it is ttack the constitutionality of the free high school act of 1907 he charge of a defective title. The word "establish" as used in former act is no more comprehensive than the word "provide" in latter act. "Establish" is defined by Webstsr's dictionary as "to e stable or firm; to fix immovably or firmly; to set (a thing) in a e and make it stable there; to settle; to confirm." ■ Therefore, the act under consideration, which seeks to provide years of free public high school education is not broader than its </seg>

VI. It is not an amendatory act nur subject to the constitutional requirements as to amendments. K While the last clause of the title and the last section of the act reference to the repealing of all acts and parts of acts in con - therewith, there is not a single act nor a single section of the ing statute repealed, amended, or in conflict with the act itself. Were it admitted, however, for the sake of argument that some acts or parts of the existing statute have been repealed by the act of 1907, or that some acts or parts of acts are in conflict therewith, since the act is complete in itself, it is safe from attack on this point by the Supreme Court decision in the case of State of Nebraska ex rel. K. -I. Carey v. John F. Cornell, Auditor of Public Accounts: "An act complete in itself is not inimical to the constitutional requirement that no law shall be amended unless the new act contains the section or sections so amended, although such complete act may be repugnant to, or in conflict with, a prior law, not refprred to nor in express terms repealed by the later act." (50 Xtb. 526.) Kill. The county high school art is entirely foreign to the ques - at issue relative to the constitutionality and reasonable in-*** mi ree high school act of 1907. The unit of taxation under the free high school act is the dis - trict which has pupils entitled to and desiring free high school in - struction. The unit of taxation under the county high school act Is the county, exempting those districts maintaining school above the eighth grade. Under this act the tax is levied upon all districts not maintaining more than eight grades, although there may be many districts which do not have any pupils entitled to and desiring such instruction. No doubt the cost of instruction under the county high school act will be much more than the arbitrary rate of seventy-five cents per week under the free high school act. The county high school act will require the purchase of a building site, the erection of new buildings, the employment of a new teaching force, the pur - chase of books, apparatus and supplies, and the expenditure- of mon-y for other expenses unavoidable in the inauguration of a new enter- There can be but one county high school in any county. It will usually be located near the geographical center of the county or else at the center of population in the county where established. At the present writing there has been but one county high school established In the state, and that is in a county which had no legal high school. There are a dozen or more counties in the northwest one-half of the state which have no high school. Such counties may find the county high school act the only way to provide free high school privi - leges for their youth. In Richardson county, where the attack Is now made on th« free high school act, there are at least eight first </seg>
            <seg id="p209">154 class high schools that can qualify in whole or in part for four years of free high school education. In Adams county there are eight such high schools; in Butler, twelve; Cass, fifteen; Custer, ten; Dodge, seven; Douglas, fourteen; Fillmore, eight; Furnas, eight; Gage, thirteen; Jefferson, eleven; Lancaster, nineteen; Nemaha, eight; Pawn«e, ■even; Saunders, fourteen; Seward, fourteen; York, ten; and so the number would continue in a like ratio in a majority of the coun - ties in the eastern half of the state. These high schools are already established. The local districts have purchased the sites, erected buildings, hired the teachers and made all necessary arrangements for support and maintenance. These high schools are well distributed in all parts of the county. A ma - jority of the non-resident pupils can attend these schools by coming from home each morning and returning thereto each night, and all may return to their homes at least once a week. The opportunity for the non-resident high school pupils to be at home with their parents all or much of the time during the school year is one of the best features of the free high school act. It saves their parents a great expense for board and lodging, and best of all, it allows the children to re - main at home under its wholesome influence, where all children ought to be during their high school life. Were the people of Richardson county to establish a county high school, only a small majority of the pupils would have the opportunity of attending high school and living at home, and many children entitled to free high school education would never attend a county high school because of the distance from horn?, the expense, and the inconvenience. I When these two acts are compared as to economy, convenience the home influence, there Is not a county in the eastern half of state that will establish a county high school in the next one lred years. K Therefore, the county high school act is entirely foreign to the tion at issue relative to the constitutionality and reasonableness e free high school act of 1907. KVIII. The free high school act of 1895 was enacted on principles under renditions so different from those governing the free school act of 19O7 that it has no material bearing upon the real tion at issue. The principles of taxation in these two acts are diametrically opposed to each other. In the act of 1907, as already indicated, the district is the unit of taxation and only those districts are taxed which have pupils entitled to .and desiring free high school education. Under the act of 1895, the county was the unit of taxation, taxing all the property of the county, including high school districts as well as rural school districts. The defects in this method have already been noted in the discussion of the principles of taxation under the act of 1899 and need not be repeated here. It is true that in the act of 1895, the rate of tuition was fifty cents </seg>
            <seg id="p210">EIGHT YEARS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGI 155 pupil wm In attendance, provided that when it could ha shown that the actual cost of education per pupil in any high school was gr than that sum, the county board could in its discretion allow a greater sum, not exceeding the actual cost of education per pupil in such high school. But this argues nothing for or against the rate in the act of 1907, when we take Into consideration the conditions under which the two acts were passed. In 1895 the state and country were in the midst of an awful panic that prevailed from 1893 to 1897. As has been truly said by an eminent authority regarding the conditions that prevailed during that period, "Idleness and its consequent poverty and distress were the rewards of labor; distress and bankruptcy over - took business; shrunken values dissipated fortunes; deficient rev - enues impoverished the government and scandalized the nation." Dur - ing that period teachers' wages were low, the exigencies of the times made it impossible to properly equip schools. The rate of tuition es - tablished at such a time and under such conditions would necessarily fall below the rate of tuition required in the act of 1907, when the the state and the county had passed through ten years of unparalleled prosperity. During these prosperous years the high school districts have made more improvement in buildings, apparatus and equipment than during any like period in the history of the state. During the past four years the aggregate increase in teacfoers' salaries alone has been over $1, - 000,000. The cost of every commodity in the commercial world was considerably higher at the time the 1907 law was passed than when the 1895 law was passed. Therefore, it follows, as the night the day, that the cost of education in Nebraska is higher now than it was in 1895. The reasonableness of the rate in the act of 1907 has already been discussed at considerable length and need not be dwelt upon further here. IX. (a) The free high school act of 19O7 is complete in itself and therefore not inimical to the constitutional requiivnieiits relative to statutory amendments. KThis proposition is sustained by the court in the case State of Ne - ta ex rel. E. J. Carey v. John F. Cornell, Auditor of Public Ar- K'An act complete in itself is not inimical to the constitutional rement that no law shall be amended unless the new act contains action or sections so amended, although such complete act may be mant to, or in conflict with, a prior law, not referred to nor in ss terms repealed by the later act." (50 Neb. 526.) I The free high school levy is entirely independent of the mum levy of twenty-five mills for the maintenance of school e home district, and provides what is known as the "Free Higu i\ Fund," and as such is placed by the county treasurer to th-i t cf each public school district in which such free high school s levied. It follows, therefore, that a school district which must twenty-five mills for maintaining school in the home district is </seg>
            <seg id="p211">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 156 must vote in addition thereto the necessary tax for the payment of tuition of all pupils of such school district entitled to free high bcliool privileges at any high school. In all school districts of Nebraska, even those voting the I'm it of twenty -five mills, whether such districts are able to maintain three months, six months, or nine months of school in the home district, the state levies one mill in addition thereto on every dollar of assessed valuation in such district for the support and main - tenance of the University of Nebraska. The university tax is levied for those more fortunate boys and girls who have finished a three year or a four year high school course of study before they are en - titled to enter the university. The object of the free high school act of 1907 is to give to the boy and the girl in the weak rural school district or in the short course village school district, a free and open educational highway from the first grade in such district through our strongest four year high schools, thus bridging the gulf between the rural and village school and the state university. To hold that the free high school act of 1907 is unconstitutional because it compels public school districts that maintain less than a (our year high school course of study to levy a free high school tax in addition to the tax required for the maintenance of school in the borne district, even though the maximum limit of twenty-five mills has been reached for the Instruction of pupils in the home district, if carried to its ultimate conclusion would make the one mill levy for the University of Nebraska null and void. It matters not whether the fund for the university is raised by the one mill levy or by direct appropriation. It takes a tax to produce this fund under either sys - tem. It would be no less disastrous to the general welfare of the state to deprive the rural school boys and girls of free high school education than it would be to deprive the graduates of three or four years high schools of a free university education. To deprive either class of students of these inalienable rights is un-American, unjust and criminal. t(b) . .The words "common schools" as used in Section 6, Article of the Constitution, include high schools as well as schools ing mere elementary branches. I The attorney for the plaintiff in this case expresses the fear the free high school tax will put an end to the common schools lie state. It ie evident that he is laboring under a fatal delusion o the meaning of the words "common schools" as used in the rtitution. It is, therefore, altogether fitting and proper to note opinion of judicial tribunals on this question: " 'Common schools' are such as are organized by law, and are not confined to any class of pupils, but are open to all. • • • The word 'common' as applied to our schools bears the broadest and most comprehensive significance, it being equivalent to 'common,' 'universal,' 'open to all,' and they are common to all children in the •ease that public highways are common to all persons who may chance to ride or drive thereon." (People v. Board of Education, 13 Barb. 400, 410 ) </seg>

(Itellinger's Ann. Codes ft i'ash. 1897, Section 2337.) I In the light of these various state Supreme Court decisions, it is nperative a duty for the legislature to provide ways and means eby all of the youth of this state whose parents or guardians live nblic school districts which maintain less than a four year high i\ course of study may be able to obtain such instruction, as it provide for the free high school education of all the youth of state whose parents or guardians live within high school districts. The free high school act of 1907 will promote the cause of edu - cation in all districts which are forced to levy a free high school tax to educate their youth in high schools beyond the boundaries of their districts. Supt. James Pelley of Greeley county says in a letter of recent date: "The free high school law has induced many to continue In school to finish the eighth grade in the rural districts of my county." This is the opinion held by all progressive county superin - tendents in Nebraska. That they are correct in their opinion is evi - denced from the large number of pupils from the various counties seeking free high school privileges under the act of 1907 for the school year of 1908-9. The following table shows the thirty counties having the greatest number of pupils making application for free high school educa - tion under this act, according to reports received up to September 15, 1908. This table also shows the number of rural districts in each county; the average tax voted by rural districts; the average tax voted by high school districts; the number of rural school districts voting the maximum tax; the number of high school districts voting the maximum tax; the number of rural school districts with one or more pupils making application for free high school instruction; num - ber of pupils making application for free high school instruction in each county; the greatest number of pupils making application for free high school education from any one district in each of the thirty counties; the maximum tax voted by any district sending pupils to a given high school, including the tax voted for education in the home district and the free high school education outside of the home district. It will be observed from a careful study of this table that the av - erage school tax voted by the rural school districts, including the free high school tax, in these thirty counties is eleven mills, and that the average tax voted by the higti school districts in the same counties is twenty mills. This clearly shows that all districts providing free high school education must pay for it. It clearly shows that the free high school act of 1907 places the burden of taxation for free </seg>

The maximum tax voted by any district paying free high school tuition in any of the thirty counties is twenty-nine mills, by one district in Custer county.

            <seg id="p214">159 It may be ■well to note the number of applications for free high school privileges for the year 1908-9 under this act from the other forty-one counties reporting on this question. Up to September 15, 1908, nineteen of the ninety counties had not reported. The report from these other forty-one counties shows the following number of applications for free high school education: Antelope, 4; Blaine, 3; Box Butte, 31; Boyd, 16; Chase, 11; Cherry, 39; Cheyenne, 71; Clay, 74; Colfax, 38; Dawes, 9; Deuel, 10; Dixon, 37; Dundy, 15; Frontier, 22; Gar - fleld, 10; Gosper, 54; Greeley, 35; Hall, 65; Hitchcock, 44; Holt, 54; Hooker, 4; Howard, 9; Kearney, 77; Keith, 12; Keya Paha, 21; Lin - coln, 61; Logan, 6; Loup, 2; McPherson, 3; Merrick, 52; Perkins, 12; Pierce, 36; Polk, 75; Red Willow, 53; Rock, 18; Sherman, 80; Stanton, 15; Thurston, 16; Valley, 83; Wayne, 44; Wheeler, 3. Total It is gratifying to note the splendid showing made by some of the western counties, such as Box Butte, Cheyenne, Red Willow and Scotts Bluff. The total number of applications from the thirty counties in the foregoing table and the forty-one given herewith is 4736. It is safe to say that when the other nineteen counties report, the total number of pupils making application for free high schools privileges under the act of 1907 for the school year 1908-9 will be over 5,000. The highest amount of school tax voted by any district in the seventy-one counties reporting is forty-four mills for a district in Holt county. In the table already given attention was called to the fact that one district in Custer county voted twenty-nine mills. These were rural districts in both cases. It is not likely that the total taxes for all purposes, including school, township, county and state, in the Custer county district will be more than forty-five mills, and the Holt county district for all of these purposes not more than sixty mills. The total tax for all purposes, including school, city, county, state, and all other taxes of whatever nature, on each dollar of assessed valua - tion in the school district of the City of Lincoln for the year 1908-9 is seventy and three-fourths mills. It is evident, therefore, that the total tax on each dollar of assessed valuation in the Holt county district is still far below the total tax on each dollar of assessed valuation in the school district City of Lincoln. It may be argued that the total tax in the school district City of Lincoln brings many more conveniences and luxuries than does the total tax in the Holt county district, but it cannot be successfully argued that it brings greater necessities. This exceptional district in Holt county does not show the average burden of taxation for free high school privileges, though this particular district has six pupils who have made application for free high school privileges. It is to the credit of such a district, so remotely located from educational opportunities, that it has six pu - pils who thirst for a higher education. The district having the second highest number of applications </seg>

I Coming directly now to district No. 42 of Richardson county, ein a wealthy, taxpayer, Thos. Wilkinson, the plaintiff in this seeks to have the free high school act of 1907 declared null and the total tax for all purposes of whatever nature is twenty-three thirteen-twentieths milte. The school tax for the instruction of upils in the home district is only six mills, and the free high &gt;1 tax for the instruction of the two pupils making application for is only nine-tenths of one mill. If it were admitted for the sake of argument that the tax in the Holt county district is so burdensome as to make the law as regards that district unreasonable and unconstitutional, it cannot be argued that the law has been violated pn this point in district No. 42 of Richardson county. Chief Justice Sullivan, in his noted decision rela - tive to the Reading of the Bible in the Public Schools of Nebraska, ■aid: "It will not be presumed in any case that the law has been Tiolated; every alleged violation must be established by competent proof." In the light of this decision, it must not be presumed or assum-d in any case that the law has been violated. Every alleged unreason - ableness and unconstitutionality of the free high school act of 1907 must be established by competent proof. It has not been so estab - lished in the case now before this court. Further, if it were ad - mitted for the sake of argument, that any school district is compelled to vote more than the maximum levy of twenty-five mills in order to provide free high school instruction under this act. it must follow, in accordance with Chief Justice Sullivan's ruling, that this act would be inoperative only in such districts. As already argued several Mints herein, if the one mill levy for the university to provide college edu - cation is constitutional, it likewise follows that the necessary tax may be levied for free high school instruction in the outside district in ex - cess of the twenty-five mill levy for elementary education in the home district. There are at least 1,000 public school districts in the state that vote the maximum limit of twenty-five mills for instruction in the home district, and on each dollar of assessed valuation in each of theae 1,000 districts there is levied in excess the one mill university tax for collegiate education. To hold that either the tax for secondary education under the free high school act of 1907 or the one mill levy for collegiate education in excess of the twenty-five mills tax for in - struction in the home district is unreasonable and unconstitutional would turn back the wheels of educational progress in Nebraska fifty The real danger to the common schools of the state, and espe - cially in Richardson county, lies not in the free high school act, but in the sentiment expressed in the second resolution adopted by the </seg>

            <seg id="p218">EIGHT YEARS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 161 This resolution reads: "We are in favor of the repeal of the law known as the high school law that taxes all the citizens of the com - mon school district to put the finishing touches to the &lt; ducat von of the more fortunate of its children." The fifth resolution adopted by that convention pledges the candidates for the legislature of the Democratic party of Richardson county to use every effort to secure the repeal of said law. This is the most unpatriotic, un-Democratic, and un-American utterance against the public school system ever made in the United States since the fight was made for the repeal of the free public school system of Pennsylvania as late as 1835. For many years the, system had prevailed in Pennsylvania of furnishing public education, as of providing public subsistence, only to self-confessed paupers. McCall says in his life of Thaddeus Stevens that in order to get his children educated at the public expense, It was necessary for the father or guardian to make it appear that he was not able to furnish them the means of education, and in such case instruction would be doled out as meat or bread would be doled out if he were unable to buy food. This system provided for the edu - cation of "the rich at reasonable rates, the poor to be maintained in school for nothing." Rather than permit poor children to be edu - cated under conditions so fatal to their self-respect, their parents kept them at home. Free public schools were made state-wide in Pennsylvania under the act of 1834 which with many defects in details recognized the grand principle of free public schools for all, and was passed with only a single dissenting vote. "But like most noble things this principle involved some cost. There w^re the taxes, and there is no more certain method of stirring up the public opinion of a virtuous, thrifty and frugal people, such as then inhabited Pennsylvania, than by pricking their pocketbooks. They were willing to have reform pro - vided it did not come high or they were not compelled to pay for it. A violent reaction arose. Nearly half the districts in the State re - jected the act or contemptuously ignored it. They were ready to do sweet charity and furnish schooling for the children of paupers, but they could not consent to a system which took by taxation the money of those who had no children and devoted it to the education of the children of the well-to-do. Thus it came to pass that the good Com - monwealth, through all her rich valleys and across her noble mountains, was shaken from the Delaware to the Ohio, and a legislature of stern Spartans was sent to Harrisburg to wipe out the law. "The Senate made short work of it. That body summarily voted to repeal the essential parts of the act by a bill which bore the in - spiring title, 'An act making provision for the education of the poor gratis/ This bill passed the Senate by a vote of nearly two to one, and among its supporters were found thirteen senators who had voted for free schools at the preceding session. It then went to the House. </seg>

The legislature wae inundated by peti - tions for repeal. A committee favorable to the law reported that the number of signers was 'deplorably large,' and that 32,000 had peti - tioned for repeal, while only 2,500 remonstrated against It. The Democratic members passed a vote at a caucus, requesting the Democratic governor, who wae a friend of the law, not to oppose its repeal, since a veto of the bill, which seemed sure to pass, would defeat him for re-election. During a considerable portion of the time while this tempest was raging, Stevens was absent from Harrisburg. Upon his return, his colleague from Adams county, who was a warm friend of the law, informed him that the bill repealing the act had passed the Senate with only eight dissenting votes; that the test vote of reference in the House showed a majority of thirty in its favor, and that the friends of the law had consulted together and decided that it was useless to oppose the repeal. He also advised him that they were bound to vote for the repeal, as three-quarters of their constitu - ents had petitioned for it. 1"The situation was desperate, and the cause of the law seemed The Senate bill to repeal came up in the House on April 10 11, 1835. Up to that hour the popular excitement, which is so the precursor of an opposite ultimate popular opinion, had gone on unchecked and carried everything before it. One obstacle, how - ever, stood in the path of repeal. There was one representative who would no more pander to a popular passion, of which he believed the people would repent as soon as their eyes were opened, than he would pander to a mob. The people might reject him. hut so long as he was their representative he would follow his convictions of duty. He braved the storm when it was at its fiercest pitch, and boldly moved to strike out all the Senate bill after the enacting clause, and to substitute for it a bill strengthening the law which it proposed to repeal. Upon that motion he made his speeoh, which, even from the imperfect reports, must be regarded as a powerful argument, and from the uniform accounts of those who heard it must rank with the great parliamentary speeches. Certainly it produced an effect second to no speech ever uttered in an American legislative assembly. "The House immediately voted, when Stevens sat down; the victory so confidently anticipated by the friends of repeal was sud - denly turned into defeat, and the motion of Stevens was carried by a nearly two-thirds vote. Most remarkable of all, the Senate, which but a short time before had so decisively voted for repeal, returned to its chamber, thrilled and delighted with the great effort, converted at. no Senate had ever been converted before, and immediately con - curred, with a few unimportant amendments, in the House substitute K 'Governor Wolf was a loyal friend of free schools. Politically, as opposed to Stevens. But he immediately sent for him after and unexepected triumph in the House, and, throwing his about his neck, warmly thanked him for the great service he rendered to our common humanity.' Some of the enthusiastic Is of the system he had saved had portions of his speech beau - r printed on silk and presented it to Stevens. E Although the speech itself was only imperfectly reported, enough is to show its wonderful vigor and its condensed and weighty In denouncing the former .law, which afforded education at iblic expense for those alone who acknowledged that they were ►or to educate themselves, he said: 'Hereditary distinctions of </seg>
            <seg id="p220">163 rank are sufficiently odious; but that which is founded upon poverty Is infinitely more so. Such a law should be entitled, "An act for Brand- Ing and Marking the Poor." ' " On several occasions he had said many bitter things about Governor Wolf, who was a Democrat, but this official was a loyal friend to free schools which Stevens was advocating, and this ex - plains why the Governor was defended by him in one of the most effective passages of the speech. Mr. Stevens said: "I have seen the present chief magistrate of this commonwealth violently assailed as the projector and father of this law. I am not the eulogist of that gentleman; he has been guilty of many deep political sins. But he deserves the undying gratitude of the people for the steady, untiring zeal which he has manifested in favor of com - mon schools. I will not say that his exertions in that cause have covered all, but they have atoned for many of his errors. I trust that the people of this State will never be called upon to choose between a supporter and opposer of free schools. But if it should come to that — if that should be made the turning point on which we are to cast our suffrages — if the opponent of education were my most intimate personal and political friend, and the free school candidate my most obnoxious enemy, I should deem it my duty as a patriot, at this moment of our intellectual crisis, to forget all other considerations, and I should place myself unhesitatingly and cordially in the ranks of him whose banner streams in light." He very ingeniously answered the argument that those who had no children and paid the tax received no benefit from it. It was di - rectly for their benefit, "inasmuch as it perpetuates the government and insures the due administration of the laws under which they live, and by which their lives and property are protected." The indus - trious and wealthy farmer paid a heavy tax to support criminal courts and jails, but "he never gets the worth of his money by being tried for a crime before the court, allowed the privilege of a jail on convic - tion, or receiving an equivalent from the sheriff or his hangmen of - ficers. He cheerfully pays the tax which is necessary to support and punish convicts, but loudly complains of that which goes to prevent his fellow being from becoming a criminal, and to obviate the necessi - ty of those humiliating Institutions." I He regretted that any member should have consented to receive lection upon a platform of hostility to popular education.

This speech of Stevens as quoted and paraphrased herein will tthe court to reason from a correct premise and thereby to reach ect conclusion on the real principles at issue in the case under eration. It will point out to the voters of Richardson county th of duty in which they should walk when they go to the bal - x, November 3, 1908, and cast their votes for members of the ture. The free high school act of 1907 is not a partisan or sec - measure. It is of the people, by the people and for the people, for Democrats and Republicans. Populists and Prohibitionists, Catholics and Protestants, Atheist and Jew. This act when put upon its passage in the senate received thirty votes — men of all political parties supporting it with equal earnestness. Those voting against it — none; absent and not voting — 3, two Repub - licans and one Democrat. When read the third time in the House and put upon its passage there, it received 81 votes, Democrats, Re - publicans and Populists voted for it. Neither a Democrat nor a Populist voted against it and only two Republicans voted in the negative. Absent, excused and not voting — 17, fourteen of whom were Republicans, two Fusionists and one a Democrat. Surely there is not much comfort in a study of the vote in the legislature on this measure for these Rich- ardson county Democrats — only two members voted against it, and they were Republicans. In Ian Maclaren's sketches of Scotch life among the country people of old Drumtochty, he says: "There was just a single ambition in those humble homes, to have one of its members at college, and if Domsie approved a lad, then his brothers and sisters would give their wages, and the family would live on skim milk and oatcake to let him have his chance." But here are men in Richardson county who, when their own ohildren ask bread, would give them a stone; when their own children ask fish, would give them a serpent; when th^ir own children &amp;sk m oduc&amp;tion would closp ths doors ot. sac* </seg>

The mandatory provision of the constitution which declares that the legislature shall provide for the free instruction in the common schools of this state of all persons between the ages of five and twenty - one years means beyond all reasonable doubt that such instruction shall include both elementary and secondary education. It is absurd to think that the framers of the constitution intended to give Nebraska farmer boys and farmer girls only an elementary education, and at the same time to provide free secondary education, and in addition thereto a free university education, for the town boy and the town girl. There is a four-year gulf between the last year in the rural schools and the first year in the university. A free university edu - cation, therefore, means nothing to the farmer boy and the farmer girl unless that gulf is bridged. But for more than half a century the town boy and town girl have enjoyed the privileges of free high school education by a tax levied under a law which makes the high school district the unit of taxation and, in addition thereto, opens the doors free and wide at the university for the graduates of the three - year and four-year high schools. And yet, during all this time the university tax has been levied on the property of each and every school district in the state. This, in the Rooseveltian tongue, is not a square deal. tThe court must not be misled by the assumption that a property t in the common (rural) school district would have to pay the s over the cost of educating the pupils in the high school district ae benefit of any given high school district. It is a physical impos - ty for any high school district qualifying under the act of 1907 to ite any non-resident pupil at less than seventy-five cents per week, eg of the court not to overlook this argument in the brief. The court must constantly keep in mind the fact that the prin - ciples of taxation in the act of 1899, on which Judge Norval passed, and the act of 1907, upon which this court must decide, are di rically opposed to each other. Therefore, the ruling of the Court of Appeals in Kentucky In the case of Town of Bellepoint v. Pence et al., while having a direct bearing upon the free high school act of 1899 is absolutely foreign to the question at issue in the Nebraska Free High School Act of 1907. If this court reasons from the same premise relative to the act of 1907 that Judge Norval did relative to the act of 1899, a false conclusion will be reached. The act of 1907 is In strict accord with the principles of taxation laid down by Cooley, Vol. 1, p. 227, third edition, and can stand every test governing taxation laid down by that eminent authority. A </seg>
            <seg id="p223">166 careful reading of the act of 1907 places this contention beyond the shadow of a reasonable doubt. Nowhere in the brief of the plaintiff in this case do we find that the question has been raised as to whether the taxation in the act of 1907 is for public or private ends, but since this question has been raised by the court, permit me to say that if there is a single law upon our statute books that subserves public and not private ends more than the act of 1907 does, I have been unable to find it. Surely the field of secondary education is as important in the Nebraska public school system as either elementary or collegiate education. It takes the three to make the scheme complete and perfect. If we pull down any one of these pillars, like a blind Sampson we shall be buried in the (The high school in our scheme of public education is the poor b college — the people's college. We must keep it so as provided in ict of 1907. That the free high school act subserves public and &gt;rlvate ends is evident from a careful reading of the title of the f 1907. Said title reads: "An act to provide four years of free c high school education for all the youth of this state whose parents lardians live in public school districts which maintain less than a year high school course of study, and to repeal all acts and parts ts in conflict herewith." ■Therefore, the free high school act of 1907 subserves public and Nivate ends&lt; The legislature has made four attempts to pass a law that would give free high school privileges to the farmer boy and the farmer girl. The 1895 and 1899 free high school acts were declared un - constitutional by the supreme court for the reason already noted herein. The free high school act of 1901 was declared unconstitutional in the district court of Cass county. This law placed all of the dis - tricts outside of the high school districts in any county into one district for taxing purposes so far as concerned free high school privileges for rural school pupils, and was known as the "adjunct district." The case was never appealed to the Supreme Court. The free high school act of 1907, as stated several times in this discus - sion, makes, the district the unit of taxation, placing the tax only upon a rural school district which has pupils entitled to and desiring free high school education in any given high school outside of the home dibtrict. The rate of taxation is 75 cents per week for each week's actual attendance. Any money remaining in the free high school fund at the end of the school year is transferred to the general fund in the school district on which the tax was levied. If there are no pupils in any rural district in any one year entitled to and desiring free high school education, no tax is levied. And as to the uniformity of the tax placed on any rural school district for the free high school educa - tion of any of its pupils, In a high school outside of the home district. It is equally uniform with the tax levied on such rural school dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p224">167 trict for the education of Ha pupils In the home district. It gives these pupils the best education at the lowest cost possible. The average number of pupils entitled to free high school educa - tion under this act in the 6,000 rural school districts will not, for many years to come, be more than two from each district. On this basis it is probable that at some time in the future Nebraska would have 12,000 boys and girls seeking free high school education under this act. It is true that many rural school districts will some years have ten or more pupils entitled' to and desiring free high school education outside of the home district. Some village and town schools with only one, two or three year high school courses of study will each have some year as many as twenty or thirty pupils entitled to free high school education outside the home district, but even in such dis - tricts the free high school act in most cases will be the cheaper plan for the high school education of such pupils. These village and town schools, while sending their own graduates to a more advanced high school, will be receiving rural pupils from neighboring districts who will find it more convenient to obtain their one, two or three year high school education in the high school district nearest to them. Such districts can provide more free high school education for their own pupils in the home district whenever it becomes the cheaper plan. Good business judgment will say when this point is reached. I The time will come when rural school districts will consolidate thus establish a rural high school with provisions for the trans - ition of their pupils to and from school. This is the proper ion of the rural school problem in many sections of the state, be meantime the best and cheapest plan possible for the rural sis to provide free high school education for their pupils entitled sto under the free high school act of 1907. If this act is unconstitutional because of the arbitrary rate of seven - ty-five cents per wpek for the instruction of the non-resident pupils, as provided therein, it follows that the maximum passenger rate act, fix - ing two cents per mile as the legal rate in Nebraska, is unconstitu - tional. It is a physical impossibility for any high school, qualifying under the free high school act of 1907, to educate non-resident pupils at less than seventy-five cents per week for each pupil. That provi - sion of the aot which gives the board of education the right to re - fuse admission to non-resident pupils for any "reasonable rause" pro - tects any and all high schools against educating non-resident pupils at less than actual cost. And who is better qualified to say whether a high school district can undertake to educate non-resident pupils without running any risk of educating them at less than cost than the board of education of such high school district? If this act is unconstitutional because some rural school districts are forced to levy a free high school tax in excess of the twenty-five mill limit allowed by law for the education of their pupils in the home </seg>

There are at least &gt; school districts in the state that levy the limit of twenty-five for the education of pupils in the home districts. In either no more fatal conclusion could ever be reached than to hold either ull and void. It is as reasonable in one case as the other. Before a nefarious blow is administered to the cause of education iu state the disastrous and evil effects of such a conclusion should irefully weighed by this court. ' It is very difficult to frame any law that will give equal privi - leges with equal burdens of taxation to all. There are some rural school districts in Nebraska that contain an entire township within their boundaries, and even in some cases two entire townships are Included within their boundaries. The principal of taxation in each case is absolutely uniform but the opportunities offered thereunder are far from being equal. For example, take the man in one of these largest rural school districts, who lives just across the road from the schoolhouse, and then take the man who lives, in some instances, six, nine or twelve miles from the schoolhouse. Which man's children have the better opportunities for obtaining an education? Take an - other example under the existing statute, entirely beyond the provi - sions nf the free high school act. There are four public school dis - tricU in Platte county that voted no school tax whatsoever for the school year 1907-8, for the reason that the state school apportionment, as given to all districts of the state, and the amount obtained from li - ceMcs were sufficient to mainain six months of school Id one dis - trict, nine months of school in two districts and nine and one-half months of school in one district. tin Douglas county, five public school districts for the «auie school voted no school tax whatsoever, four of them maintaining nint - hs of school and one seven months. This comes from the fact le case of most of these Douglas county school districts that the &gt;I census of that county draws such a large sum from the state rtionment of public school moneys, one-fourth of which is divided lly among all the public school districts in the county. But a more serious case than any of these in Platte or Douglas counties comes from McPherson county, where one rural school dis - trict with an assessed valuation of $617.37, by voting the limit of twenty-five mills, raised $15.43 for the support and maintenance of school in said district for the school year 1907-8. The public school districts in Douglas and Platte counties which did not find it necessary to vote any school tax whatsoever, are all rich districts, with many thousands of dollars of assessed valuation ir each district, and in one case at least, the assessed valuation passes the $100,000 mark, while the poor, weak district in McPherson county has an assessed valuation of less than $1,000. Here is a legislative parable which could b? measured by the scriptural rule without much </seg>
            <seg id="p226">EIGHT YEARS OP EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 169 R:h of the imagination: "For he that hath, to him shall be given he that hath not, from him shall be taken even that which h It is evident from these examples that if there is to be a leveling down and a leveling up of the things unequal and unjust in our public school system, with more nearly equal opportunities for all, there is something for the legislature and the courts to do outside of the free high school act of 1907. It is true that the last legislature took the first step in the history of the state to render better justice to the weak rural school districts in the northwest one-half of the state. Fifty thousand dollars were appropriated to carry these weak rural school districts as nearly to a seven months' term of school each year as possible. Seven hundred rural school districts have shared Id this appropriation. A condition precedent for sharing there - in is that the district shall vote the maximum limit of twenty-five mills and that its business methods shall be approved by the county superintendent of the proper county. The maximum amount allowed any district under the law is $120, but the next legislature should make an appropriation of at least $100,000, so that such districts as the McPherson county district would receive at least $300. This would make the total for local school purposes for such district, when it votes the limit of taxation, only $315. In the case of the Holt county district already discussed herein, where the total tax for local school purposes and the free high school tax reached forty-four mills, the $120 state aid over and above the Btate school apportionment to all districts, which will be given said district for the school year 1908-9, will materially lower the forty - four mill school tax levied for instruction at the home district and the free high school tax for the education of six of its pupils at the high school in some other district. The free high school tuition for the six pupils will amount to $162 if each and every one attends full time. Deducting the $120 state aid from the $162 free high school tuition, it would leave $42 for said district to raise by tax in excess of the twenty - five mill levy, the limit for school purposes in the home district. This is a school district composed entirely of settlers under the Kinkaid home - stead act and, as already stated, does not represent the general conditions prevailing under the free high school act in Holt county. It received no state aid last year. With the state aid it would vote less than five mills for the free high school Instruction of six of its pupils outside of the home district, in addition to the twenty-five mills voted for local school purposes. This would make the total school tax of said district less than thirty mills, and the total tax for all purposes of whatsoever nature in said district, would not be over forty-four mills as compared with the total tax for all purposes of whatsoever nature in the school district of the city of Lincoln of seventy and three-fourths mills. Therefore, it cannot be contended that even in districts like that in Holt county the free high school act of 1907 is unreasonable and unconstitutional. </seg>
            <seg id="p227">170 On a conservative estimate there were at least 3,000 country boys and girls who took advantage of this act for the school year 1907-8, and at least 5,000 rural pupils will take advantage of this act for the school year of 1908-9. Before the act has been in operation five years there will be at least 10,000 farmer boys and farmer girls knocking at the doors of the five hundred high schools in Nebraska. These boys and girls will be under the instruction of over 1,000 trained teachers. It will place at the disposal of the state over two million dollars in school buildings, grounds, apparatus, books and libraries for the education of this great army of young people in the higher duties of American citizenship. It must be evident to all, therefore, that the legislators in the thirtieth session of the Nebraska legislature gave the people as reasonable a free high school law as it is possible for human genius to frame. This free high school law is a reciprocal proposition which will bring great benefit to both town and country schools. Never in the history of the state has there been such an inspiration given to boys and girls in the rural school to com - plete the course therein, marching on to the high school with aspira - tions for the state university as has come to them under this act. Therefore, the free high school act of 1907 is respectfully submitted as being constitutional and reasonable in all its provisions. J. L. McBRIEN, State Superintendent. Amicus Curiae.

            <seg id="p230">way of settling the constitutional question. The proposition is not that the law would be valid if it can be shown as a fact that seventy-five cents is the exact cost of educating a non-resident pupil in any high school in the state, but that such cost might exceed or fall below that sum, and the fixing of that arbitrary amount in the statute renders it unconstitutional, no matter if that sum would be the cost in some one or more high school districts in the state. Now, when the learned gentleman at the head of the educational department of the Btate will digest this proposition as we state it, he will have a better understand - ing (of) what there is in the case." This quotation is conclusive proof that attorneys for plaintiff hang their whole faith in this case solely on hypothetical and speculative philosophy and hair-splitting technicalities far more dangerous to the general welfare of the state than any application of Procrustian phil - osophy could possibly be. The superintendent wants an affidavit from each high school desiring recognition as a legal free school under the free high school act of 1907 for three purposes, namely: First. To guard him against recognizing any high school under said act that is not actually giving non-resident pupils instruction worth at least seventy-five cents per week for each non-resident pupil instructed in any given high school. Acting on this precaution, he withheld his approval from forty-four public school districts giving instruction above the eighth grade for the school year 1907-8. K Second. To guard him against recognizing any high school that ot afford to educate non-resident pupils at seventy-five cents per each. Third. To know exactly what high school districts can educate non-resident pupils at seventy-five cents per week for each non-res - ident pupil without financial loss or without financial profit to such districts and that in so doing value is given for value received in each and every case. I Therefore, the affidavit requested by the superintendent is for purpose of arriving at the facts in the case. The case under con - •ation should not be decided on the presumption of the at t&lt; ■ the plaintiff, that the cost of educating non-resident pupils in ■ high school district somewhere in the state of Nebraska might pd seventy-five cents per week for each non-rsident pupil so in - :ted or it might fall below that sum. It should be decided on the :iple of law as laid down by Chief Justice Sullivan in the case. ■ of Nebraska, ex rel. Daniel Freeman v. John Srheve «'t al.. aska, 877. Chief Justice Sullivan said: B"The courts have no right to declare its (the Bible's) use to be wful because it is possible or probable that those who are privi se it will misuse the privilege by attempting to propogate their peculiar theological or ecclesiastical views and opinions. It will be presumed in any case that the law has been violated; every ;i &lt;l violation must be established by competent proof." Kit follows from Chief Justice Sullivan's reasoning that the courts no right to assume, presume, or declare that the free high school f 1907 is unconstitutional because it is possible or even pr»babl» U </seg>
            <seg id="p231">172 that tb« cost of educating non-resident pupils might exceed or fall below the arbitrary amount named in the statute. It must be established by ■competent proof that the actual cost of educating non-resident pupils in the high school district where the non-resident pupils from district No. 42 of Richardson county attend actually exceeds or falls below seventy - five oents per week for each non-resident pupil instructed in such high school before the act of 1907 should be declared unconstitutional. According to official reports on file with the state superintendent the non-resident pupils from said district No. 42 of Richardson county attend the Dawson high school in said county. The secretary of the board of education in said high school district declared under oath made September 28, 1908, that the Dawson high school district is willing to educate non-resident pupils for the school year 1908-9 at •eventy-flve cents per week for each non-resident pupil, believing that it can be done without financial loss or financial profit to said district, and that in so doing value is given for value received. This affidavit is now on file in the office of the state superintendent of public instruction, Lincoln, Nebraska. No better evidence as to the actual cost of educating non-residua pupils in said high school district can be given. Its correctness baffles the legal legerdemain of these most erudite attorneys for the plaintiff. Therefore, the free high school act of 1907 must be accepted as reasonable and constitutional so far as it concerns the case under consideration. Respectfully submitted J. L.

Kin an official letter of February 7, 1908, addressed to county •intendents relative to the free high school law, the following tnsnt is found: I "The county superintendent's office is the clearing house for each lty in carrying out the provisions of the free high school law. issuance of county free high school certificates, the inspection of high schools, the Settlement of questions relative to the attendance on-resident pupils and the payment of tuition therefor, are impor - matters which require careful adjustment and well kept records, ;h will not only enable the county superintendent to have a complete wleige of the record of each non-resident pupil of the county and of work being done for such pupils by the free high school districts, which will enable school districts paying free high school tuition to w that the high school education for which they pay has been prop - given to the proper persons." Kin an official letter under date of September 14, 1908, addressed ■incipals and secretaries of boards of education of non-accredited schools and county superintendents of Nebraska, the following ments are found: I 'The county superintendent is recognized as ex-offlcio county ctor of non-accredited high schools.

The foregoing statements had reference to high schools not accred - ited to the University of Nebraska. Forty-four such high schools in the state were not aproved by me under said act for the reason that they could not give instruction to non-resident pupils worth seventy-five cents per week. I did not knowingly approve any non - accredited high school wherein the actual cost of instruction for non - resident pupils was more or less than seventy-five cents per week.

I believe also you will agree with me that they cannot educate non-resident pupils at seventy-five cents per week with profit to the district. Such high schools are not compelled to admit non-resident pupils. As stated on page 4 of my brief, "The right of the board of f duration under said act to refuse admission to any or all non-resident pupils for 'any reasonable cause' is sufficient guaranty to such district against educating non-resident pupils at less than cost as to place that question beyond debate." I enclose herewith a copy of my letter of this date addressed to all high schools in the state, with a form of application that must b? signed under oath before any high school will be recognized by me as qualified to give instruction to non-resident pupils as contemplated in the act of 1907. With such a precaution I do not see how any court can assume in the face of such a statement by a board of education braska that the free high school act has been violated because the cost of instructing non-resident pupils may be more or less than seventy-five cents per week each.

Joshua Lord, Defendant, to make explanation of our od of procedure in the recognition of high schools under the free school act of 1907, I believe you will be given one of the strongest nents yet made in behalf of the constitutionality and reasonableness II have already given you my reason for this form of application recognition of high schools under this act. Some have asked me Ite my authority for such a form of application. I have quoted in y section 5, subdivision 8, school laws of Nebraska for 1907, which •: "He (the state superintendent) shall prescribe forms for making all pfi'(rts and regulations for all proceedings under the general school laws of the state." I take the position that it can be demonstrated that no high school recognized by this department as being able to give instruction worth 75c per week can afford to educate non-resident pupils at less than that price. The most competent authority to pass upon the question as to whether any high school so approved can afford to edu - cate non-resident pupils at the arbitrary rate fixed by the statute is the board of education of such high school district. When the question is brought within these limits, I cat: not understand where, under the reasoning of Chief Justice Sullivan, to which your attention has already been called, there is even the shadow of unconstitutionallty in the free high school act of 1907. Very truly yours. J. L. McBRIEN, Superintendent. A Square 1)el Decision. IJulg? Pemberton's ruling, which holds th? Free High School of 1907 constitutional and reasonable in all its provisions, is a re deal decision. Judge Pemberton will live in the educational ry of Nebraska as Thaddeus Stevens lives in the educational ry of Pennsylvania. Both hav? rendered a great service to our non humanity. Generation after generation of farm;r boys and er girls will thank Judge Pemberton for bridging the four-year between them and the University of Nebraska and all other higher ntions cf lraming. The opponents of this law will appeal the case to the Supreme • in all probability. I hop? it will, so the question will be setf.ed permanently. The hang their whole faith in defeating this !aw en the hair-splitting philosophy that the cost of educating noc-resi - r'ent pupils might fall below or might exceed the arbitrary rate of 75 cents per week fixed by the statute. In approving high schools as fre schools under this act I have taken every possible precaution against recognizing any high school that cannot give instruction worth at least 75 cents per week. Over forty of the 509 high schools of the </seg>
            <seg id="p235">176 state failed to qualify last year. At least fifty high schools will not qualify this year — some for the reason that they cannot give instruc - tion worth 75 cents per week, and some for the reason that they cannot afford to educate non-resident pupils at that price. The law gives this latter class of districts the right to refuse admission to non - resident pupils. In no case will this office recognize any high school under this act that cannot give instruction worth at least 75 cents per week. The question has arisen in the case of a pupil from the Scotia public school district who desires to attend the Lincoln high school, where the board of education has fixed the rate of tuition for non-res - ident pupils at $1.00 per week, whether such district may charge a non-resident pupil more than 75 cents per week, collecting the extra 25 cents per week from the parent or guardian of such pupil, and at the same time legally hold the district from which such pupil comes for the 75 cents per week. I have ruled that where the parent or guardian in such a case elects to send his child or ward to a high school that cannot afford to educate non-resident pupils at 75 cents per week, that such parent or guardian and not the public school district from which suoh pupil comes is holden for all of the tuition, and the public school district is liable for none of it. There is no necessity for such a pupil coming to Lincoln in order to obtain a first-class free high school education. This pupil can obtain a free high school education muir nearer home than by coming to Lincoln for it. In fact, there will not be one pupil in 1,000 passing by first-class high schools and traveling suoh a distance for a high school education. He was within fifteen miles of a four-year high school at his home county seat — Oreeley. He was within twenty miles of a first-class four-year high school at Ord, and instead of coming to Lincoln he could have gone to St. Paul, Central City, Grand Island, Aurora, Kearney, York or Seward, all of which schools are educating non-resident pupils at 75 cents per week, extending to them a hearty welcome, and making a statement under oath to this department that the are doing this with - out financial loss or financial profit and that in so doing value is given for value received. Without any disparagement to the high standard of education maintained in the Lincoln high school, I maintain that high school instruction equal in every respect to that given in the Lincoln high school is given in Aurora, Beatrice, Hastings, Kearney, York, and ■cores of other high schools in the state. No high school approved by this department can afford to educate non-resident pupils at less than 75 cents per week. The question as to whether * first-class high school can afford to educate non-resident pupils at 75 cents per week each is a problem solely under the juris - diction of the board of education of such high school district. No other authority is qualified to pass upon this question. It follows that when the case recently at issue is held within </seg>

Judge Pemberton's Decision KIE DISTRICT COURT OF RICHARDSON 1 COUNTY, NEBRASKA, as Wilkinson, Plaintiff, v. Joshua S. Lord, Defendant. OPINION. Ihis action is brought to have the law passed in 1907 providing - the education of pupils in a high school outside of their district, re there is no such school in the district, declared uncon - itional and to enjoin the collection of a tax amounting to seventy - cents levied under said law for the education of three pupils in gh school outside of the district of their residence. The grounds 1 which plaintiff relies to show the unconstitutionality of said law as follows: 1. That said law violates the constitutional requirement of uniformity and equality of taxation. 2. That the law delegates the taxing power to the county super - intendent. 3. That the subject of the act is not clearly expressed in its title. K4. That the act is amendatory of an older law which, as amended. t included in the new act. I think it will be conceded that the legislature has the power to pass a law that would accomplish the object sought to be accom - plished by this act; that is, to authorize a school district, having no high school, in which the parents of the pupil reside, to raise money by taxation to educate said pupil in a high school outside of said district. Such taxation would be for a public purpose and for the benefit of the school district levying the tax, and would, therefore,, comply with every condition of a legitimate tax upon said district.

            <seg id="p237">178 I If the tuition provided by the statute, namely, seventy-five cents reek or three dollars a month, is the reasonable cost of educating pupil in the high school to which he is sent, then no one can &gt;lain, no injustice is done, the district is only paying for what it and no constitutional provision is violated. But it is contended that as it might cost more or less than three dollars a month to educate a pupil in the high school, therefore the tax might not be uniform as required by the constitution. I do not see how this could be. The only uniformity inquired by the constitution is that "the taxes shall be uniform in respect to persons and property within the jurisdiction of the body imposing the same." Section 6 of Article 9. In this case the only body imposing the tax complained of is school district No. 42 in Richardson county, wherein plaintiff resides, and he alleges in his petition that the tax is one and one-half mills on the dollar on all taxable property in said school district. Therefore his property is taxed exactly the same as all other property in the school district. If the tax levied be uniform throughout the district making the levy, whether it be a state, county, township or school district, the constitutional requirement as to uniformity is complied with. Pleuler v. State, 11 Nebr. 547; 1 Cooley on taxation 21) 0, and cases cited; 25 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. ofLaw, 57, first edition. I It is contended, however, that in this respect the present case is Tied by the case of High School District of Haw lock v. Lancaster ty, 60 Nebr. 147. But. under the law held unconstitutional in case, the whole county was made to bear the expense of educating tupil in the high school district, so that the tax there in question i. county tax levisd upon the whole county. And the court there that as it might cost more than the three dollars a month for * 'mating a pupil in the high school the excess would fall upon those ifrtM in the high school district. So that in addition to the county tax which everybody in the county, including themselves, would have to pay, they would also be required to pay the excess of the cost of edu - cating each pupil, and therefore the tax for such education would not be the same upon them as upon the rest of the county. In other words the tax would not be uniform upon all property within the county as required by the constitution. Kin the present case there is no such condition. The only tax is upon the school district furnishing the pupil to be educated, tax Is admitted to be uniform throughout said district. The the school tax might, and no doubt would, be different in the to which the pupil is sent would not affect the question that would be in a different jurisdiction, and the that district would no doubt be uniform throughout the dis - there would be no lack of uniformity there. The consti - tes not require that the taxes be uniform throughout any two </seg>
            <seg id="p238">179 Kate districts. Whatever other constitutional defects there may i said statute, there is certaiDly none with reference to the rmity clause. But it is insisted that as the three dollars a month p r pupil required to be levied by the act in question might be more or less than the amount necessary for the purpose of educating such pupil in the high school the excess or deficit might be for the benefit of the one school district or the other as the case might be. That is if the thr-e dollars a month were more than was necessary to educate the pupil in the high school, then the home school district of the pupil would be taxed for the benefit of the high school district, and vice versa. But if such the case it would not be a violation of the uniformity clause of the constitution, but of another or other clauses of said instrument. It might be a violation of the clause releasing or discharging any municipal corporation or the inhabitants thereof from their or its proportionate share of taxes to be levied for state purposes, or due to any municipal corporation, or for the commutation of such taxes. Section 4, Article 9. Or it might not be taxation at all but mere spoliation. But it it seems to me a sufficient answer to such an assumption is that the court has-no right to assume anything of the kind. Whether the cost of educating a pup.il in a high school is more or less than seventy-five cents a week is a question of fact depending upon a variety of other facts to be proved by evidence upon the trial of the case. The only thing the court has a right to assume or presume is that the legisla - ture bad investigated the matter and knew what it was doing when It passed the act, and that the sum fixed by it was, under all the cir - cumstances, just and right. For "it is not to be presumed that the 'egislatur? has assumed the existence of a fact upon which an act of legislation is based, without evidence. On the contrary, courts are bound to presume that it acted upon good and sufficient evidence, and that presumption is conclusive on the question of the validity of the act." Sutherland on Statutory Construction, Section 331, first edition. In fact every presumption is in favor of a legislative act, and until it is shown to be plainly and manifestly in conflict with the constitu - tion the presumption of its validity will hold good, and all doubts must be resolved in its favor. Ibid. Such is the universal holdings of the courts. Therefore I do not see what right the court has to assum? that the legislature acted inadvisedly and without sufficient evidence iD adopting the seventy-five cents per week as the amount to be paid for high school education. Especially is this the case when the court knows, of its own knowledge, that such amount is the sum voluntarily charged by some of the best high schools in the state for the education of non-resident pupils. But on account of the importance of the question I will consider it further. Id order to sustain. the plaintiff's contention in this rc«p«ct it mast be made clear to the court that such must necessarily be the </seg>
            <seg id="p239">180 E: of the law In question. That Is, it must appear that one of the &gt;1 districts must necessarily be taxed for the benefit of the other ch a way as to be violatlve of the constitution. Whether or not the cost of educating a pupil in a high school, io any given case exceeds or falls short of seventy-five cents a week, or three dollars a month, depends upon several matters which the court must consider upon the evidence to be produced. Thus the whole theory of the law is that it will cost a school district having no high school less to send a pupil, or several pupils, into a district having a high school, than to undertake to give them a high school education at home; and, on the other hand, that it will cost a school district which already has and maintains a high school, less to educate one or a few pupils than it would if if it did not already have the facilities for so doing. The cost of educating a pupil in the high school under the law Id question therefore presents the double aspect of what it would cost the district sending the pupil to be educated, to educate him. at home, and what it would cost the high school district to which he la tent, to educate him. It is plain that although It might cost the home district more than three dollars a month to give the pupil a high school education at home, and that it might be a great saving for it to ■end the pupil to another district having a high school to be edu - cated, such facts would afford its tax payers no cause for complaint; because, in that case they would certainly not be taxed for more than the actual cost to their district of educating such pupil in the high school; and such would be the case even though the high school district might make a small profit on the education of such pupil at three dollars per month. Because in that case the home school district would be taxed for a lawful purpose, strictly for Its own benefit, and for a lets sum than it could educate its pupils at home. The fact that the other school district might incidentally derive a little benefit from such taxation would not make it illegal or void. Stelner v. Sullivan, 74 Minn. 498, 77 N. W. 286, where it is said: "If the purpose (for which the tax is levied) be one which primarily benefits particular subdi - visions of the state, the whole burden may be placed upon them, al - though the state at large may be incidentally benefited thereby." Quoted in 1st. Cooley on Taxation, 226, note 2. And see Ingersoll on Public Corporations 469, where it is said: I In many cases taxation has been upheld which would result in te benefit because the purpose of the taxation was public, and in s taxation which would confer public benefit has been annulled ise the obvious purpose of the levy was private. The rule govern - he courts in all these cases seems to be that Incidental benefits ot to decide the fate of a tax levy, but the obvious purpose of the Ion is to form the basis of the decision." This certainly is the common sense of the matter. No better illustration of this principle can be found than our educational sys - tem wherein everybody who has property Is taxed for school purposes </seg>
            <seg id="p240"/>
            <seg id="p241"/>
            <seg id="p242">181 taxes levied for a public purpose and are therefore valid notwithstanding immense incidental benefits result to the children of parents who pay no taxes, and whose children are educated at the public expense. Such taxes are upheld because they are for the public good, although indi - viduals derive invaluable benfits from them. In this respect school taxes are almost unique and meet much opposition so that legislatures sometimes have to adopt compulsory measures to enforce their levy and collection. 2 Cooley on Taxation, 1295, 1299, and see quotation from last page, infra. But in any event the home school district could not complain unless it could be shown that the high school district was getting more for educating the pupil than under all the circumstances it was reason - ably worth. This brings up the side of the question pertaining to high school districts. If such district with all its facilities in the shape of building, equipment and corps of teachers, coud afford to educate outside pupils at three dollars per month without loss, then it is plain that its tax payers could not complain on account of taxation, since their property would not be taxed at all for the education of such pupils. Suppose that it even cost the high school district a little more than three dollars a month to educate such outside pupils, yet if by reason of having such pupils it could build up a better and larger school, employ more and better teachers, procure a better equipment, and thus increase the reputation and efficiency of its school, the advantages thus gained might more than offset the extra cost, so that the district would get full value received for such extra cost. In that event its tax payers would have no cause for complaint. In short, this matter pre - sents the familiar question of cost of dealing at wholesale or retail, in quantities or by the piece. It costs less per capita to educate from one - hundred to three hundred pupils than it does to educate from one to three pupils. A school district having a high school plant In full operation to educate its own pupils might take a few more and educate - them at a trifle of what it would cost the school district having no high school to educate them at home. If by such transaction both school districts can profit, it seems that, on common sense business princi - ples, they should be permitted to do so. See Merrick v. Amherst, 12 Allen, 500, 504, quoted from in 1 Cooley on Taxation, 243. Gorden v. Cornes, 47 N. Y. 608, 614; 1 Cooley op Taxation, 235, and cases cited. I have no doubt that plaintiff believes that he individually wilt not get value received for the taxes assessed against his property and that it is unjust to tax him to give a high school education to other people's children; but that is a matter the court cannot now consider. The law is well settled that taxation for common school education is for the public good, and that each tax payer, as one of the public, gets full value for his taxes in the general benefits received.

E. 441 I And one child is as much entitled to a high school education at public expense as another. The law in question is merely for the lose of carrying out that just and equitable principle. In enacting legislation the legislature is only putting in force the constitu - il injunction which says, "The legislature shall provide for the instruction in the common schools of this state of all persons een the ages of five and twenty-one. Section 6 of Article 8 of Constitution. I If there was a high school in plaintiff's district he would pay a to educate th-e pupils therein without murmuring. Why should &gt;ot pay a tax for the same purpose to a high school not- in his let if that is the only way in which the pupils in said district can i high school education? ■On its face it would seem that the statute is for the public good, that it might be mutually beneficial to the school district sending tupil and the one receiving it. Such being the case, and without any showing to the contrary, I think that no court can say but what it would have some doubt, at least, about such a law being unconstitutional; and if it has a doubt, it should be resolved in favor of the law. In the face of the fact that many of the best high schools of the state are voluntarily aimit - ing outside pupils at three dollaars a month, it would be assuming a good deal for a court to say, as a nmttt r of law, that any such sum was leu than the cost of educating such pupils therein. On the other hand, it would be an equally violent assumption for the court to presume, aa a matter of law, that a school district having no high school, in paying three dollars a month each for the education of three pupils in an outside high school, was paying more than the reasonable cost of educating such pupils. These are questions of fact which must be determined from proof, and until such proof is before the court in some shape it cannot hold that as a matter of law, the cost of educat - ing a pupil in a particular high school so much exceeds or falls below three dollars a month as to render the statute in question unconstitu - tional and void. It is argued by counsel for plaintiff that if the statute in question had merely fixed a maximum sum to be paid per week by the district sending a pupil to a high school, as in the Wisconsin case where the limit was fixed at fifty cents per week, (Columbus v. Fountain Prairie, V W. Ill) it would not be open to the objections urged against it. But what if it should actually cost the high school district more than fifty cents per week? What protection would its tax payers havr in that event? The limitation contained in our statute is more rea - sonable so far as the high school is concerned because it prevents it from having to accept non-resident pupils when it is unable to accommodate </seg>
            <seg id="p244">EIGHT YEARS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 183 them without constructing or renting additional buildings, hiring extra teachers, or where it has other just cause for refusing to do so. (Last sentence of first section.) This amply protects the high school district, because if it could not afford to take pupils at seventy-five cents per week that would be just cause for refusing th m. The other district is protected by the fact that its tax payers could not be compelled to pay more than the reasonable cost of educating its pupils in the high school. If seventy-five cents per week should be shown to be more than such reasonable cost, then it could not be collected. But whether or not it is more than such cost is a question of fact to be determined by all the circumstances of the cas?, as I have heretofore shown. KAs above stated it might be that it would not be unreasonable for district to pay a little more than the actual cost to the high school, lse it might then be getting the service for much less than it : get it in any other way. But if it be contended and admitted that the cost contemplated by the statute is what it actually costs each high school in each particular case, it might not be unreasonable to say that it would cost all high school districts in the state, having the qualifications required by the statute, substantially the same sum per capita for educating non-resi - dent pupils. The same service ought to be worth substantially the same amount, although such service may be rendered by diffreDt persons or different institutions, provided that all such p?rsons or institutions are required to have substantially the same qualifications. And this law requires that all high schools qualifying un !• r it shall have the course of study prescribed by the Nebraska High School Manual issued jointly by the University of Nebraska and the state superintendent, or a course of study approved by the latter. Thus they must all have the same qualifications and perform the same service and it might not be unreasonable that they should receive the same It costs mor? to educate some pupils than others because of the difference in ability and industry of the various pupils. It costs much leu in actual money to educate a quick, bright and industrious pupil than a dull and listless or lazy one. It might be contended that, for such reason, it would be illegal for any high school to fix an arbitrary sum for educating each individual pupil. And such contention would not be devoid of merit; but to sustain it would be wholly impracticable because of the impossibility of ascertaining the exact cost of educating each individual pupil. But it would be little if any more impossible than it would be to ascertain the difference in cost of educating pupils in the different high schools of the state, or of ascertaining the exact cost of educating a pupil in any particular high school. Shall differ - ence in the original cost of the plant and interest thereon be taken into consideration In any case? Each district already has this and will not be put to any extra expense on that account; so that Omaha and Odell would be equal in that respect. </seg>
            <seg id="p245">184 Shall difference In the pay of teachers be considered? The classes In the large schools might be so much larger than those in the small -schools that the cost of each teacher per pupil might be the same in both schools. I How can it be shown that it will not cost all high schools in state, eligible under this law, substantially the same amount to ate a non-resident pupil, and how can the exact amount of that be ascertained in any given case? t These considerations show that if the legislature had not fixed the to be paid by each pupil, it might be practically impossible to e at the just amount to be paid in any case, and that there might uch more injustice and inequality if each high school was allowed large what it could figure out that it was entitled to receive, les there might be a chance for litigation in every case before the could be settled. Exact equality in matters of taxation is everywhere conceded to be impossible and chimerical. As Cooley says, "There is no imperative requirement that taxes shall be equal. If there were, the operations of government must come to a stop from the absolute impossibility of fulfilling it." 1 Cooley on Taxation, 254. I An approximation toward equality is all that can be attained in case. And in a case of this kind where it would be almost, if not e. impossible to get at the exact cost to each high school district ducating a non-resident pupil, the legislative finding as to such might well be conclusive unless it can be shown to be unreasonable njust. II. It is further contended that said law is unconstitutional for the reason that it is an attempt on the part of the legislature to delegate its power of taxation to a public officer of the county, namely, the county superintendent. I think this is a clear misinter - pretation of tHe law. It does not authorize the county superintendent to levy the tax, but at most only authorizes him to make and deliver to the county clerk an estimate of the amount necessary to be ex - pended by such public school district during the ensuing year for free high school education. The county superintendent has nothing to do with determining the amount of the tax or making the levy, and he makes and certifies the estimate only in case the voters and directors both refuse to do so. The scheme for estimating the amount necessary to be raised for the education of high school pupils in the district is very simple and substantially the same as in case of ordinary school taxes, except as to the method of fixing the amount of such tax. Parents in the school district having pupils to be educated in the high school must inform the county superintendent of that fact in the man - ner provided by the statute.

This must be included in the estimate of other school taxes furnished the annual meeting, and certified to the county board by whom the levy must be made, as in the case of ordinary school taxes. Cobbey's Statute for 1907, Sec. 11619. tThe next section provides that if the annual meeting neglects •fuses to vote the necessary taxes as provided in the previous sec - then the school district board shall make and deliver the esti - ■ to the county clerk and county superintendent. In that case county clerk is authorized to make the levy; but in that respect no different from ordinary school taxes. See sections 11540 and 11583 of Cobbey's Statutes If the district board fails or refuses to make and certify the •estimate, then it is made the duty of the county superintendent to do so. Section 11621; and such is the exact procedure required in case of ordinary school taxes. Section 11548 of Cobbey's Statutes. And the levy is made by the county clerk in one case as in the other. The -county superintendent thus has no discretion in the matter and does not determine the amount of the tax or make the levy, so that in that respect plaintiff's contention is without support to stand upon. I The case of McCabe v. Carpenter, 102 Cal. 469, 36 Pac. 836, cited ilaintiff, holds, as stated in plaintiff's brief, that a law "vesting in county superintendent power to levy such tax for high school &gt;oses as he might deem desirable without control by the inhabitants ny local board" is unconstitutional. But the Nebraska statute in ;tion does not attempt to confer any such power upon the county rintendent. It merely authorizes him to make and certify the nate when the other proper officers fail to do so, just as is done ase of ordinary school taxes, as I have shown. The object in cases is to see that the law is not evaded, and the legislature has undoubted right to say how it shall be enforced. On this subject ey says: "Wherever a system of public instruction is established by law, to be administered by local boards, who levy taxes, build school houses, and employ teachers for the purpose, it can hardly be ques - tioned that the state, in establishing the system, reserves to itself the means of giving it complete effect and full efficiency in every township and district of the state, even though a majority of the people of such township or district, deficient in proper appreciation of its advantages, should refuse to take upon themselves the expense necessary to give them a participation in its benefits. Possibly judicial proceedings might be available in some such cases, where a state law for the levy of local taxes for educational purposes had been disobeyed; but the legis - lature would be at liberty to choose Its own method for compelling the performance of the local duty. And ht re again the state has the same power to apportion the moneys raised for the general purpose that it has to apportion moneys raised for police purposes or for roads." — 2 Cooley on Taxation, 1299.

(1st ei. ) KIngersoll on Public Corporations, Chap. 18, p. 460, where will be 1 a brief but comprehensive statement of the law of taxation, with on of authorities. (Even the Illinois cases cited and relied upon by plaintiff recognize tower of the legislature itself to levy taxes when the good of the c demands it. Thus, in the case of the People v. Mayor of Chicago, Is. 17, 2 Am. Rep. 279, 284, the court, speaking of the limitation ie constitution of the right of a legislature to delegate the power irporate or local taxation to any but the "corporate authorities" "To what extent it (the section of the constitution) is to be con - strued as a limitation on the power of local taxation directly by the legislature itself, it was not necessary in that case, nor is it in this to decide. However strong the argument in favor of so construing it, there nevertheless may be cases where the legislature, without the consent of the corporate authorities, might impose taxes, local in their character, if required by the general good government of the state, because such taxes would not be merely and only for corporate purposes." School taxes are local taxes but they are levied for the good govern - ment and welfare of the state and are not merely and only local munic - ipal taxes. It is therefore clearly within the power of th:- legislature to raise them in any manDer and by any agency it sees fit, and enforce their payment. 2 Cooley on Taxation, 1295, 1299. (But the construction put upon its constitution by the state of lis, in the case above cited and similar cases, has been expressly Hated by our supreme court. State v. Dodge County, 8 Nebr. 125, e it was squarely held that section 6 of article 9 of the constitution not limit the right of taxation to "the corporate authorities" msn - d In the constitution, but that the legislature may choose such - officer or officers as it sees fit to make a levy and assessment e taxes. See also State v. Lancaster County, 4 Nebr. 537, and Shaw v.

That question therefore is settled in this state against the contention of plain - tiff. The California constitution moreover contains an express inhibi - tion against the legislature imposing taxes on municipalities, and is therefore very different from ours. KCooley, after citing the Illinois cases, says: "A conclusion dlf - it from that of Illinois was reached in Nebraska under a like itutional provision." 2 Cooley on Taxation 1238. IAn instance of the levy of a tax by the legislature for educational oses is contained in the act of 1899, which provides that the tem - ry university fund shall consist, among other things, of "a tax of mill on the dollar of valuation of the grand assessment roll of state, which tax shall be levied in the yrar 1899 and annually •after." Cobbey's Statutes, Section 11764. The tax so levied now jnts to more than three hundred thousand dollars annually. It seems to me that there can be no question that the legislature had the power to fix the amount of the high school tax and require the estimate and levy to be made as required in the statute under consideration. As the supreme court of Wisconsin in State v. Thorn, 112 Wis. 81, 87 N. W. 798, 799, says: "The legislature has plenary power over the whole subject of taxation within constitutional limita - tions. It may select the objects of taxation, determine the amount of taxes that shall be levied, and the particular purpose or purposes the same shall be devoted to, and the manner in which property shall be valued for taxation. It may establish the necessary taxing districts and provide for the selection of all the public agencies for the collection, return and expenditure of the public revenue." The legislature having plenary power in the matter, its action is conclusive on the court, there being no constitutional limitation in the III I think the title of the act fairly covers its object and purpose. The only criticism I could offer would be the use of the words "four yeans of" in the first line. Leaving out said words th« remainder of the title expresses the object and purpose of the statute with clear - ness and accuracy. The title as used applies with accuracy to all pupils .entering the ninth grade, for then they will get the full four years instruction under the statute. Those entering higher grades would get less than four years under the statute, so that the title in that respect is broader than the statute. But the evidsnt meaning of the title is that the act is to make such provision that, taken in connection with existing laws and conditions, all pupils in the state, residing in districts having less than a four year high school course, may have four years of free high school education. And this object the statute accomplishes. AiThoIder v. State, II Nebr. 91, \1 phono*, v. Whalen, 7 4 Nebr. 680. it </seg>
            <seg id="p249">188 The contention of plaintiff that the act is broader than its title is not well founded; because there is nothing in the body of the act that does not pertain to the subject expressed in the title. If the title of chapter 18 of the laws of 1881, being chapter 51 of Cobbey's Statutes, and chapter 79 of the Compiled Statutes, which reads as follows: "An Act to establish a system of public instruction for the state of Nebraska," is sufficient upon which to build our whole educa - tional structure, surely the title of the act in question is broad enough to cover everything contained in it. 23 Am. &amp; Eng. Ency. of Law, 257, first edition. A court should not be hypercritical in judging of the sufficiency of the title of a legislative act. A strained or technical construction should be avoided and doubtful cases should be resolved in favor of the act. It is sufficient if the title states the object of the act according to the understanding of reasonable men or so as to be Intelligible to^the ordinary reader. The title need not index the details of the act nor give a synopsis of the means by which the object of the statute is to be effectuated by the provisions of the body of the act. 23 Am. £ Eng. Ency. of Law, 234, 1st ed Sutherland on Statutory Construction, sec. 88, 1st ed. IV. It is finally contended that this act is amendatory of a section (11543 of Cobbey's Statutes for 1907) of the old law limiting the amount of the aggregate of taxes voted at annual meetings to twenty - five mills. I think this act is an independent act providing for mat - ters not mentioned or contemplated in the old act. It makes provisions for education of pupils entirely outside of the district and has nothing to do with building school houses, hiring teachers and running the schools of the district, to which objects alone the old law applied. It makes no alteration or change whatever in the old law. The tax provided for in it has no relation to taxes provided for in the old law and was not intended to be included therein. The limitation of the old law was not a limitation on the power of the legislature to authorize the levy of other taxes for additional purposes of education. 1 Cooley on Taxation, 587, 588. If, however, I should be mistaken in this, still the new act and the old act should be read together and effect be given to both acts. When this is done it is plain that the school district may legally levy a high school tax as provided in the new act; but such tax including t&gt;o»e levied for all other purposes shall not aggregate more than twenty-five mills on the doHar. This was the construction put upon two statutes, CDe providing for school tax, and the other for a judgment tax, in Dawson Count)- v. Clark, 58 Nebr. 757, 79 N. W. 822, and both acts held valid. But it is very doubtful if the limitation of twenty-five mills made in said section 11543 of Cobbey's Statutes for 1907 applies to any tax other than the school house tax mentioned Id said section. Up to 1903 the preceding section contained a limita - tion to twenty-five mills on school taxes for all purposes except for the </seg>
            <seg id="p250">189 Eent of bonded indebtedness, and section 11543 was merely in - d to carry out that limitation. Comp. Stat. 1901, Chap. 79, iv. 2, sec. 11. But said section 11 has beeD so amended that it now provides (11540 Cobbey) that the legal voters shall determine the amount of money required for school maintenance during the coming year which shall be an amount sufficient to maintain a school in the manner and for the time provided in section 5440 (11545 Cobbey) and the amount of money so required shall be levied as a tax upon all the taxable property of the school district; provided that the amount so levied shall not exceed, in any one year, two and one-half dollars on a hundred dollars valuation. It will be seen at once that the limitation therein contained is not to twenty-five mills for all school purposes, but only for the purposes mentioned in said section, which certainly do not include the taxes levied for high school pur - poses in the act we are now considering. But it is unnecessary to determine that question now as, under any theory, the limitation would not make the new act amendatory of the old. They can both stand notwithstanding the limitation for all school purposes may be twenty - five mills on the dollar, as I have already shown. k.My conclusion therefore is that, so far as it appears from the on, the law attacked in this case is not unconstitutional, but is id law, and that the facts stated in the petition do not constitute ise of action. The demurrer will therefore be sustained L. M. PEMBERTON. Judge. Beatrice, Oct. 12, 1908. Importance of Eighth Grade Work, Deputy Superintendent E. C. Bishop. ■ In recent years, in Nebraska especially, the eighth grade has a subject of greater concern than any other grade of work from of the first year to the completion of the high school course. KThe importance attached to the eighth grade comes largely from causes: First, courses of study for the public schools are so iged that the work of nearly all of the so called common branches, nerally completed in the eighth grade; second, a large percentage ipils continue their education no further than the eighth grade. For the two reasons given, it is very important that the work of the eighth grade be thoroughly done. Those pupils who continue In the high school are handicapped in their high school work unless the work in the grades has been thoroughly done. For those pupils who do not continue their education further than the eighth grade, it Is especially important that the work in the . common branches be thorough and that every pupil who receives a certificate or diploma certifying that he has completed the work, receives such certificate </seg>
            <seg id="p251">190 K after he has so 'mastered th? subjects that he leaves ol with a ground work of education which will enable him to make best possible use of his time and energy when he shall meet the 1 requirements of busines and social life. A third reason for the special attention given to the eighth graie, comes from the fact that the completion of the work of the eighth grade marks a division point, or a goal to which many boys and girls inclined to drop out of school earlier, may be induced to direct their efforts until they have received at least this most necessary part of In too many counties in our state there are scores of boys and girls in rural communities and in town and city communities who let pass the opportune time until it is too late to round out an eighth grade education in their home districts. Many of these boys and girls of school age are not in school at all after the compulsory education law has exhausted its force, or, in districts wli re the law is not enforced, are not in school until the compulsory age limit has been reached. Many other of the larger boys and girls attend the horse dis - trict school in an irregular, desultory way, having no definite end in view and doing very little effective work, until they become too old to go to school, ashamed to enter classes of younger pupils where their scholarship places them, or from lack of interest quit school altogether without what is now considered most important and what will in the future be considered yet more important — a common school education. (Many such young people after reaching the age of eighteen or twenty ue conscious of their need of better education, and bravely ter school, or attend some preparatory school where they make their deficiencies and often continue and secure a higher educa- But it is much better for the individual to first take advantage e educational opportunity offered in his own community to do this, le time when he may work on an equality with his neighbor, it a time when the cost in time, money and effort will bring best It is for these reasons that superintendents and teachers urge - pupils to enter school, to remain in school, to master first the work of the eighth grade and of all grades below. Hundreds of boys and girls braska every year, not only remain in school to complete the eighth grade, but from the encouragement and the indefinable desire which conies to them from successful effort in doing the required work, continue their education in high school or college, because some teacher, some superintendent, some parent, induces them to stick to it until at least the first recognition is given at the end of the eighth grade work. It is because we recogDize for every boy and girl the importance of securing in season the essential ground work of an education that we are earnest and persistent in our efforts to bring to the attention </seg>

Thus it is that the work of the public schools has been systematized, by the use of the course of study, the daily program, the test examinations, the final county eighth grade examinations, and the eighth grade graduating exercises. Superintendents are planning more systematically; teachers are teaching more systematically; pupils are studying more systemat - ically; parents are co-operating with more united efrort, all tox-xrd reaching a definite result. Tie County Elimination. The county eighth grade examination is recognized as a uniform test of the pupil's qualifications to leave the work of the grades. These tests are designed to be general enough in charactsr to cover tfce work; lenient enough that the pupil properly educated may have a passing grade, and thorough enough that the pupil who is not yet prep rly prepared will exhibit his deficiencies and be given opportunity to make strong the weak points by remaining in the grade another year. The examination is often of greatest good in revealing to the pupil his weakness; it helps him to properly balance his accomplish - ments, and aids him in a better direction of his effort. I In short term districts, the pupil may have to sp;nd more than eight years in completing the work of the first eight grades of public school course. Pupils who are unable to attend school the re school year, must often oomplet; one or more subjects each until the entire examination has been successfully passed. But successful completion of the work is worth all the continued effort sacrifice. A failure to pass an examination should be considered a !y notice that further work is necessary for the good of the pupil, ther h? be planning to leave school or to continue his work for a er education. Eighth G'*d&gt; Graduating Extra rs. Tb? rapid increase each year in the number of eighth grade graduating exercises held is an open testimony of the popularity of tte movement for public recognition of the completion of what is I'dowd as the common school course by the pupils of rural, town and "hcols. In some counties eighth grade graduting exercises are n ach school where there are one or more eighth grade graduates, ■imes two or more schools combine. In some cour.ties the exer - rre held by towjiships or by larger subdivisions of the county accrrding to transportation facilities and the location of buildings buitable for such occasions. Where such exercises have been held a few years in succession in any county, generally county eighth grade graduating exercises are now held at a central point. Some counties hold only the general central county exercises, others have various combinations, all of which stand for the same principle, — the recog - nition of what has been accomplished by the pupil and encouragement to such pupil to continue his education. </seg>
            <seg id="p255">192 These «ighth grade graduating exercises have become popular largely for the following reasons. First. — They are enjoyable occa - sions. This is especially true of the district and of the township ex - exercises whf re a large number of the patrons of the school attend. It has many of the good features of the closing picnic with the additional benefit of emphasizing the real work of the school. Second. — The eighth grade graduating exercise is popular because it encourages the pupils of lower grades and offers a helpful incentive which stimulates them to a desire for completion of the eighth grade course of study. Third. — The eighth grade graduating exercises stimulate the whole school district or districts represented. Tire fact that they have been able to maintain a course of study and provide such a teacher and such equipment that their school can turn out graduates, develops a local pride Id the district which brings good things for the school. Although the rural school is the one generally most benefited, the effect on the town and city school is often equally good. Too many town schools have maintained top-heavy courses of study, adding too many high school grades for the teaching force employed and putting the greater stress upon the high school work to the neglect of the work of the grades. Where the eighth grade pupils of town and city schools have been required to take the county examination it has resulted in many cases Id strengthening the work of the town school. Fourth. — When the eighth grade graduate has contributed to the good of his school as a whole by his example of persistence in keeping at his work until it was completed, he finds that the encouragement coming from having done some things well, the enlightenment received in going thus far with his education, and the inspiration that comes with the graduating exercise where he meets other eighth grade pupils who expect to go on through the high school, where he hears words of commendation for what he has done and earnest words urging him to continue his education — all these combined, cause him to plan more definitely and more persistently than before for more education. Thirty per cent of the pupils who enter the first grade complete the eighth grade. Ten per cent enter the high school. There is need to encourage the pupil, not only to remain in school until he finishes the eighth grade, but to enter the high school. When the supervising authority has done all that be can in a general way toward encouraging the pupil to complete the eighth grade work and then to continue his education, it remains largely for those more closely asso - ciated with the pupil to do their part. The influence of the teacher is often greater than that of any other person in helping the youth to plan for the future. What can the teacher do? The teacher can lead the pupil to see the present need of a higher education. A high school education is now a require - ment in many places where heretofore an eighth grade education was acceptable. Our state normal schools are now required by law to refuse admittance to the regular course of instruction to applicants </seg>
            <seg id="p256">EIGHT YEARS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 193 who have less than a tenth grade education. Many professional and technical institutions heretofore without entrance requirements are now requiring one or more years of high school preparation for entrance. Business men are searching for stenographers and book - keepers who have at least a high school education back of their special training. The high school course is a part of the common school system. The eighth grade pupil should be caused to think seriously of all these things before deciding to leave the public school either to enter business or to specialize in any particular line of work. City superintendents and principals, recognizing the influences of a visit to the state university bring their seniors to Lincoln for a day at the capital city. These high school students are given an opportunity to see the workings of the university and to breathe the atmosphere of higher education. It means to many a student the beginning of a desire for a college or university education. The rural school teacher owes as much to his pupil. A visit to a near by high school may mean much to the rural eighth grade pupil. The modern school building, the atmosphere of a busy high school, the apparatus and equipment provided for special work, the always attractive work of the laboratory, the library, the athletic work, — all these are more or lets new to the average rural student. An insight into the social life of the high school and attendance at some of the high school functions combined with the irresistible desire of youth to know, to learn and to do, and a breath of the high school spirit which is ever catching — all these combine to urge the eighth grade graduate on to a higher education. (The teacher may have the opportunity to introduce lur eighth i graduate to the principal of the high school who is generally lg to explain the course of study, acquaint the pupil with just should be done to enter and continue the work of the high &gt;1. The teacher is the strongest factor in influencing the parent ovide for the continuation of the pupil's education and is generally to suggest some means of overcoming the dificulties which may to be in the way of the studeDt or of the parent. A personal interest in the plan of the student and parent, should it accomplish nothing more, at least opens the way for consultation and advice when it is desired. The teacher can at least leave a hopeful spirit which in the end is bound to triumph if both student and parent have a desire for the continued education of the eighth grade graduate. A good teacher does not lose interest in a pupil after graduation, but utilizes the acquaintance and friendship formed by remaining the adviser, teacher and friend so long as association and communication may last. This is the real reward of the teacher. This is the opportu - nity of the teacher. This is the sacred responsibility of the teacher. </seg>

The model rural school building, the Sutherland school in minature one-tsnth actual size, was viewed with as great interest as was the the interior of the model rural school building with modern equipment. Many school officers consulted the plans of these buildings and expressed themselves as agitators for modern rural school buildings. Miss Nellie Schlee was in charge of the model school room. The grass school teacher, made by Miss Florence Zink of Bassett, from sixty-three varieties of Rock county grasses, stood at the entrance to the school room, while the •corn boy,' made by Miss May Harris of York, stood before the open dictionary diligently searching for the things a model school boy should know. I "So many counties have already asked for space for next year an attempt to have a state exhibit in the crowded space used year would result in utter confusion and failure. Nebraska should '. an Educational Building for the school exhibits. The horses, the e, the sheep, the hogs, and the chickens of the state each have Portable quarters in buildings set aside for their own use. Should school children of the state have less? "Members of the State Board of Agriculture have expressed them - selves as highly pkased with the results of the educational exhibit this year, and promise us the best they can provide for next year.

Tree Planting on Nebraska School Grounds. Frank T. Miller, Department of Forestry, University of Nebraska. There is the greatest need for improving Nebraska school grounds. While not infrequently in traveling about the state does one note school yards that have been s-?t to ornamental trees, and otherwise give evidence of some care, yet such grounds either in the city or country are the exception. The vast majority are without any pro - tection or ornamentation whatever. Instead of being the bright - est and most inviting spots in the community, as they should be, they are, too often, quite the dullest. The lack of care of public school grounds is not due to a want of interest on the part of the patrons of the schools In general. They meet the expense of procuring the land, building school hous s, and providing free instruction, in all of which they are cordial and generous in their support of public education. May it not be that the explanation lies in the fact that environment as a factor in education has not been duly emphasized? Hence it is that in communities where the private lawns are well kept and beautiful, school grounds are as bare as when a part of the public domain. The public needs to be aroused to an appre - ciation of the aesthetic in education, and to this end there should be a </seg>

Once the people are awakened to the real Importance ot question, they will rise to meet it with both their means and their Provision will then be made to pay the cost of such work from school treasury in the same way that the expense of any other ovemnt Is met. Planting Time. If a working interest is once secured, the next step will b; the preparation of a plan for planting and ornamenting the grounds. Sim - ply to plant something is not enough. There should be syst;m and purpose in the work. The plan should include a sketch of the grounds, showing the location of the buildings, together with the exact position of the walks, trees, shrubs, flower beds, and play grounds. This plan need not be elaborate, but should b; adapted to the needs and tastes of the community in question. tlf the grounds are small, consisting of an acre or less, the improve - s will of necessity have to be quite formal, and straight lines will to be the rule; but, if larger, comprising two, three, or several , the style of decorations may be more natural, as there will then e greater opportunity for variety in landscape composition. In this ■ it is assumed that the school grounds are rather limited, contain - ay one acre. Where to Plant. Just what part of the school ground may be devoted to planting will depend on its shape, location with reference to public highways, relative position of buildings, etc. More or less planting may usually be done on all th? borders. The position of the school house should be •uch as to permit considerable planting in the foreground. It should not be planted up solidly as is so often the case, but the' trees should be placed singly or in groups at considerable distances apart. Placing of tne trees will depend quite largely on the position of the walks, and in laying these out straight lines may usually be avoided, except where the area is small, in which case the walks and drives should b? direct. In addition to planting trees in the foreground, shrubs also may be used with good effect, and usually, one or more flowsr beds may be located here. This portion should be well set with lawn grasses, which should be kept neatly mowed during the growing s ason, in fact the entire school ground should be well sodded with grasses so far as poMlble. Along the sides, planting in rows can hardly be avoided, esprcially if the ground space is limited. At least a single row should be placed here, and two will be better if space will permit. If one side happens to be on the north or weet, it may b&lt;? 'ound desirable to group the trees quite closely so as to form a narrow shelter belt. In the rear ground, quite generally a belt of considerable width, often several rodr, may be planted. The planting here should b? in a solid block, unless desirable views would thus be shut out, an 1 the tree* should be scattered irregularly either singly or in groups </seg>
            <seg id="p262">199 Ier than in straight rows. Frequently objectionable objects such utbuildings may be screened in this way. In front of th : groups of low shrubs may be used with good effect. KSuch an arrangement cf planting as has been describe 1 s a large portion of the school yard for play grounds, which is essential to every well organized school. What to 1'Iunt. So far as possible everything that is planted should be permanent. To this end the hardier aDd longer-lived species of trees and shrubs should be given the prefers nee, and the herbaceous plants should be of the perennial type. It is not intended in this paper to suggest plants that would be suitable or adapted for planting under all condi - tions. Soils and situations vary so much that but few, if any plants either woody or herbaceous, could be planted with safety in all. One of the safest guides in any work of this sort is first to find out what ornamental plants in the way of shade trees and shrubs, or flowers thrive best in a given locality and select largely from these. A com - munity will nearly always find itself richer in suitable plants than at first seemed apparent. K Among the trees that may be recommended for general planting e white elm. It should have the first place as a street and lawn in Nebraska. It Is hardy, grows fairly rapidly, holds its leaves igh a long period, 3nd is one of the most graceful trees of the ■ican forest. IHackberry, closely related to the elm, has a wide natural dis - tion in this state, is of beautiful form and may be widely planted safety. Several of the oaks, such as bur, white, and red oak may be men - tioned as suitable for planting on Nebraska school grounds. Their symmetrical, spreading, rugged habit, the variety in the shapes of the leaves, and the coloring of the foliage in autumn make them especially - able for ornamental planting. K American linden or basswood is another valuable lawn tree. Its ntss, large broad leaves, singular fruiting habit, clean limbs and [, and elegant form are characteristics which commend it highly rnamental purposes. It should be more widely planted than it is. KThe rapid growth of the ashes, good form, and clean foliages, lend them for lawn planting. Green ash may be planted through - he state, but white ash is adapted only to the eastern portion. &gt; Hardy catalpa is a good tree to use where variety is desired. Its ually broad leaves, and large white flowers give it a highly orna - :al value. It should be used sparingly in lawn planting, however, is adapted only to the southeastern part of the state. Russian wild olive and mountain ash are two other excellent trees to add to give the planting soul and character. They should always be planted in the open. Where rapid-growing trees are desired, cottonwood, silver maple, and various species of willow may be recommended. It would b? an </seg>

Only the deciduous trees have been mentioned thus far, since in this state they will naturally constitute the bulk of the planting. A limited use of evergreens, however, may be recommended as an inter - mingling of evergreen and broad leaved trees produces a desirable «ffect. Of the evergreens, red cedar may be recommended for any part of the state. Some of the pines, such as Scotch, Austrian and white pine may be used on the heavier soils in the eastern portion. Colorado blue spruce, on account of its symmetrical form and beautiful blue foliage, is being widely planted as an ornamental tree. tNo attempt has been made to exhaust the list of trees that would uitable for planting on the school grounds of the state. I have ided rather to mention the more common ones, and those that most available. The general list could be considerably increased, it should be appreciated that when it comes to the matter of plant - on a particular site in a given locality the selection of trees should iade with great care. Size of Plants and Sparing. (The size of trees to plant is important. They should not be too &gt; as is&gt; the tendency in ornamental planting. Deciduous trees should be over three or four feet high, and evergreens should be much ler. They should be planted sixteen to twenty-four feet apart pt In belts, and there the spacing should average six to eight apart. Prrparation of the Ground. The ground wherever possible should be put in a thorough state of cultivation before the trees are put out; where planted in belts, the ground may be plowed, then disked and harrowed. If trees are planted singly or in groups several feet apart, it may not be best to plow all the ground. In which case it can be prepare! with a spade by digging a good roomy hole where each tree is to be placed. Care and Cultivation. Once planted the trees should receive thorough cultivation for at least several years, and should be pruned and trained in order to Insure a straight and symmetrical form. It is needless to say that flres and live stock should be rigidly excluded. II have said nothing in detail in regard to selecting and planting irubs and flowers. Suffice it to say that when the ground is once out and the trees planted, the major part of the work is done, further decoration of the grounds by the use of shrubs, flowers, climbing vines will follow as a matter of course. </seg>

            <seg id="p266">201 The Planting of Rural School Grounds. Chas. A. Scott, Bureau of Forestry, WashiDgtoc. BThe need of planting trees on our rural school grounds is obvious 1 who have given the proposition a serious thought. Suffice it to that the objects for planting are threefold: first, plant for pro - on; second, plant to educate; third, plant to beautify. I The first and urgent need is some one possessing some knowledge ees, who has time, and is willing to take in hand and superin - planting the school grounds. Such a person should be appn ■intendent of planting, by the school board. The duties of such "son would be to secure suitable trees and shrubs, direct the plant - nd care for the trees after plant In some instances it may be necessary to purchase the trees. The planting should be performed by the patrons of the school and the school children. The cultivation should also be volunteer work. Let Mr. Smith, who lives near the school, volunteer to cultivate them the first year under the direction of the superintendent of planting. Mr. Jones the second and Mr. Brown the third. Let this service be volun - teered at the school meeting, then the entire community will know to whom credit is due for the splendid condition of the trees on ths school grounds. Naturally there will be some expense connected with planting and keeping the grounds in proper condition. A small sum should be appropriated each year for this purpose. t After thoroughly organizing for tree planting the next nee planting plan. This includes an accurate map of the school grounds ling the location of the school house, outbuildings and the loca - of each tree to be planted. A few general rules for planting a ol ground will enable the superintendent of planting to make a very I plan. In the first place, keep the objects of the planting in view. Bret object is protection. Plant a dense belt or group of trees g the north and west sides of the school house for this purpose. The second object is to educate. This is attained in every step of the work; first, In having a variety of trees. The characteristics of each species is a distinct study. The operation of planting, cultivating and trimming the trees is a source of education to the boys and girls. A study of the plan interests the little folks. KThe third object is to beautify the grounds. After planting the er belts, plant an open row along one or both of the remaining , using care not to shut off the view too completely. Arrange a few tic groups in the corners and between the divides of the walk. KThe main body of the school grounds should be left unplanted he play ground. The outhouses should be screened by a clump iee, and a nicely arranged group near the school house is advisable. What to Plant. In all instances the hardy species of native trees should be </seg>
            <seg id="p267">202 KLUStrian and Banksiana Pines are among the hardiest of trees. In containing considerable moisture the cottonwood and white willow - be added to the hardy list. These are all common species with the ition of the pines. For ornamental planting there is nothing more hardy or more suitable for the purpose than many of our wild shrubs. The wild plum will grow any place and servee admirably for a screen or to fill in some corner, and it yields a profusion of flowers and fragrance every spring time. The wild currant will fill in a group or a corner; it is a mass of yellow with the first indication of spring. The false indigo or lead plant is another hardy shrub that tosses its tassels of purple and gold in the early spring breezes. The red haw and choke cherry are others which will grow if given a chance. KSome flowers are not out of place on the school grounds. Try v of the hardy perennials that can bs secured from some of the i in the neighborhood. Make the path broad that leads from the to the school house and plant a hedge of wolfberry along either and see the effect. How to Plant. Upon the proper planting depends the successful growth of the trees. Before planting the soil should be as thoroughly prepared as it would be for a field of corn. Trees should never be planted until the grass sod has been thoroughly subdued. The proposed planting site should be plowed in the fall; this subjects the soil to the pulverizing influence of freezing and thawing. In the spring it should be thor - oughly worked over with a disk harrow. For the allignment of the rows draw furrows six feet apart and set the trees six feet apart in the furrows. Their exact location can be determined by using a cord with a knot tied at each eight-foot point. Uuless the soil of the planting site is a tenaceous clay the holes for the trees should not be dug until the trees are on the ground ready for planting. Dig the holes deep enough and wide enough to receive the roots without crowding or cramping. Always set the trees two or three inches deeper in the •oil than they formerly grew. When filling in always throw fresh moist earth next the roots and pack it firmly. It is a good plan to tramp the soil about the tree roots as you would in setting a fence post, exercising care not to injure the roots. An inch or two of the surface ■oil should be left lying loosely. The character of the day on which the planting is done will also affect the success of the planting. Trees should always be planted on a cloudy, cool day. Their roots should always be protected as much as possible from the drying influences of the sun and wind by keeping them covered with wet gunny sacks or similar material. If the trees are received several days before the planting is to be done they should be heeled in a cool, moist place. It is a good ilea to dip the roots in a bath or puddle just -before planting. A puddle consists of clay and </seg>
            <seg id="p268">EIGHT YEARS OF EDUCATIONAL Pi: 203 The practice of pouring a bucket of water about a tree immediately - after planting is a questionable treatment. When trees more than six or eight feet in height are used fully one-half of their tops should be cut out in order to reduce their leaf surface and prevent exhausting the supply of moisture furnished by the roots. Arrangement of Trees. The general rules governing artistic planting that should be ob - served for school ground planting are briefly: Plant the taller growing trees in the outer row, the lower growing trees being panted in the inner rows and gradually decreasing in size in the clumps until they blend into shrubbery. When planting single rows of trees use one species only and select trees of uniform size as far as possible. Cultivation. Wherever it is possible planted trees should receive thorough culti - vation as long as a team and cultivator can be used in the plantation. In the case of individual trees and groups the spade is the best imple - ment for general use. The soil should be spaded up and thoroughly pulverized to a depth of five or six inches three or four times each summer for a distance of four feet on either side of the tree. Whatever may be the method of cultivation it must be thorough, keeping the surface soil loose and well stirred to prevent excessive evaporation of soil moisture and keep the ground free from weeds. Trees require cultivation in every respect as much as our field crops, and they respond to good treatment just as readily. ■ It should not be expected that all the planting can be done in season, but rather it should be planned to continue over several In this way the planting will be more complete and a greater interest will be created in the work. I Arbor Day is one of our grand institutions and should be celebrated ippropriate exercises by every school in the state. If the day is rable planting the school grounds should be a part of the program, the school children should assist in the work. If Arbor Day should rtunately be a hot, windy day, the planting should be postponed ud - cool, cloudy day. Schoolroom 'Decoration.

Such things can have no result but to distract the attention and weaken the whole. Nothing misplaced is beautiful." If in the child a sense of artistic appreciation is acquired the possession will be with him always. Through no means can this be better accomplished than by sur - rounding him with reproductions of works of art. tNo scheme for the decoration of the schoolroom should ever be rtaken apart from the education of the child. The pictures hung the walls and the color of the walls should be determined after ul consideration of the direct effect upon him. tThe teacher of the present is fortunate as compared with his ecessor. Not only is the range of pictures much greater than as, but processes have been invented which make it possible for lool to possess satisfactory pictures at a cost far less than a few t ago. No school need be without some pictures of sufficient size excellence to make them worth hanging upon its walls. »For the primary rooms, pictures showing maternal love, pictures of ren and their games, animals especially in their relation to man, pictures of nature should be selected. For the higher grades, portraits of the nation's founders and otnefactors. historical scenes, etc., should be used. K Among the most important decorations are selections from the ren's work. Wherever possible, provide a low picture rail a foot to above the wainscot upon which may be hung drawings, paint - and designs made by the children themselves. For background p, paper, cardboard or muslin is desirable. Casts may be used with advantage. These can be obtained in considerable variety, and are not very expensive. Let the children see all the good pictures you can, but remember that the influence of one good cast or picture, large enough to attract their attention, is worth more than any number of dozens of little things, by the very multiplication of which it is so easy to cheapen and dissipate the interest which we seek to cultivate. IThe Japanese, from whom we get such a wealth of decoration, use a few objects in a room, and if, as often happens, they have a large stion, they change them frequently. I am telling you nothing new when I say that we are inclined to have too many things. We might begin a work of decoration in our schoolrooms by putting away what does not help to make the room beautiful. Then, if we are able to add some good picture or cast, it will be much more effective, from the fact that there are fewer things In the room with which it must divide attention. </seg>
            <seg id="p270">205 The Superintendent on Higher Education. I Let every rural teacher Id Nebraska inspire her pupils with a desire a high school education. Let every high school teacher urge our ng people on to college, university and normal school. Let every ig man and every young woman know that the demand on them is efficiency. The questions are often asked, "Does education help one to suc - cess?" and "What amount of school training helps most?" The editors of Who's Who in America have rendered the country a service by inducing more than 10,000 of the men now living in the United States, who are most notable in all departments of usefulness and reputable endeavor, to report their education. These men have won enviable distinction, and the facts they give will help answer the questions, "Does education help one to success?" and "What amount of school training helps most?" It thus appears: 1. That from 1870 the uneducated boy in the United States failed entirely to become so notable in any department of usefulness and reputable endeavor as to attract the attention of the Who's Who •editors, and that only twenty-four self-taught men succeeded. ■ 2. That a boy with only a common school education had, in round bers, one chance in 9,000. 3. That a high school training increased this chance nearly twenty-two times. 14. That college education added gave the young man about ten i the chance of a high school boy and two hundred times the ;e of a boy whose training stopped with the common school. In a Sod Schoolhouse. In October, 1903, in company with Superintendent McLaughlin, we spent a week visiting schools in Boyd county. One day we came upon a sod EChool house. Neither the teacher nor the pupils knew we were coming. When we entered the schoolroom there was no staring at us, no laughing at us, no uncomplimentary remarks. Every pupil kept at bis work. Classes were called and dismissed in good order. There were fourteen pupils present. But the school house presented a tumble-down appearance. We could look out through the roof and see the sun and sky. We could see out of the door without opening It. Some of the window lights were out. There were holes in the floor which was laid almost on the earth — just two by two inch scantlings under it. We heard a spelling class recite. It wag composed of five little girls and one boy, — Dick, a red-haired, freckled-faced, shabbily dressed little fellow, who took his place at the head of the class. As he came to the recitation he pushed one foot along over the rough floor. At first we thought he was lame. But a glance told the cause and we looked the other way. He was wearing an old shoe that would hardly hang on his </seg>
            <seg id="p271">206 old shoe sole would have flapped, flapped, flapped as he walked. There was a hole in the floor where Dick stood. As a policy of double economy and yet with an art that would tempt the painter's brush, he let the foot on which he wore the paralyzed old shoe drop carelessly Into the hole in the floor, first, to hide the old shoe, and, second, to to cover the hole in the floor. But Dick held his place at the head of the class. The proud sparkle in bis e\es, the bright gleam on his face, his manly, heroic bearing as he saw thi teacher make a record of his victory and heard her say, "Dick wins the head mark today," told us that Dick had caught the soul-inspiring strains of Robert Burns, who was himself a son of toil: Though losses and crosses Be lessons right severe, There's wit there, you'll get there. You'll find no ither where. Never mind the crowd, lad, Or fancy life won't tell; The work's a work for a' that To him who doeth it well; Fancy the world a hill, lad. Look where the millions stop; You'll find the crowd at the base, lad. There's plenty of room at the top. MrKinley's Struggle for an Education All good costs. Strength is born of struggle "Each aspiration of our human earth Becomes an act through keenest pangs of birth Each force, to bless, must cease to be a dream. And conquers life through agony supreme." ■ A mother's toil, a sister's sacrifice, a father's denial, and his own efforts — all this — was the price paid for McKinley's education. KThe following story taken from the "Illustrious Life of William inley, " by Murat Halstead, tells us something of the trials and tions through whieh he made his way into public life. "Young McKinley grew into manhood in the village of Poland, Ohio, a town which possesed a seminary for boys and girls of the type of the New England academy. To Poland seminary came ambitious young men and young women from the neighboring farms, eager for the book-learning of the schools and believing that its possession would open broad highways to success in life. Some engaged rooms and board at the rate of $2 a week, and others reduoed this very modest cost of living by taking rooms alone and eating the victuals sent in to them weekly by their parents. None of these bright young people felt that th«y were poor. They were all accustomed to the close economies of the farm life of that period, and were not in the least ashamed of them. The richest man in Poland at that time was not worth ten thousand dollars. A man with five thousand dollars' worth of property and no </seg>
            <seg id="p272">207 debts was thought to be well off. Mrs. McKlnley helped out the narrow income of the family by taking boarders and herself did the cooking with the help of the girls. I "Young McKinley was an ardent student. It was his mother's ition as wsll as his own that he should go through college and study law, but whether this aim could be accomplished was always er doubtful. The father was frugal, industrious and self-denying, he had a large family to provide for and his earnings were small, iam did what he could to help out the family income by one sort of i or another in vacation times. At one time it was almost decided the plan for his education must be abandoned, but his elder sister, le, came to the rescue with the money she had saved as a school In Old Drumtochty. K While Domsie Jamieson was the schoolmaster in the good old :ry place of Drumtochty they always had a student at the univer - "Seven minlsUrs, four doctors, one professor and three civil M men had been sent out by the auli schule in Domsie's time, es many that 'had given themselves to mercantile pursuits." ' The last legislature gave us a free high school law. Practically every high school in Nebraska is free and open to th? boys and girls who complete the work of the rural schools. The high school is indeed tecoming the people's college. The boys and girls who come from the rural school to the high school are, as a rule, the cream of the country schools, and they not only maintain but raise the standards of the high school. There ar? many doubtless who do not attend the high school because they find it hard to pay their board. But where there is a will there is a way. Poverty may be inconvenient and sometimes intolerable but he who is born poor is often fortunate. Tell the stcry of Oarfleld's struggles and privations for a college education in every country school and in every high school of Nebraska, for it will be a source of inspiration to every one who hears it. It is more interesting than a novel, because it is true. It is the story of uncon - querable determination and sublime s?lf reliance, of lofty purpose and inflexible resolve, of incorruptible integrity and moral courage of the highest type, of noble effort and magnificent achievement, of pro - longed struggle, crowned by th? mest brilliant triumphs. He emerged from an obscurity as profound, and reached an elevation as lofty as is b l'!om the lot of man. His hardships and disadvantages were the wings wherewith he soared.

But after all is It not a lack of interest rather than a want of moD-ey keeps so many of our young men and young women out of the college and university? Would that our teachers could get a hold on their patrons like unto that Domsie Jamieeon had upon the people of old Drumtochty. It would solve both the interest and the money aide of this question of higher education. I "There was just a single ambition In those humble homes, to have of its members at college, and if Domsie approved a lad, then his hers and sisters would give their wages, and the family would live kimmilk and oat cake, to let him have his chance." K Hasten the day when there will be such a spirit of self-sacrifice ousands of homes in this great commonwealth, in both city and :ry, now negligent of their duty to their children in matters of ition. For every child that comes into this world has a right to an ition. I The reward of those teachers who strive for this ideal "is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine It is the gratitude of patrons and the eulogy of pupils. When lie Jamieson received that wonderful letter from his old pupil, die Hoo, it read: "Dear Mr. Jamieson: The class honor lists are out, and you will be pleased to know that I have got the medal In the humanity and Greek." There was something in this letter t telling his mother and his gratitude to his old teacher, "but &gt;ie heard no more. He tried to speak and could not for a rain its was on his hard old face." I When they carried the good news to Geordie's mother, and met it "the end of the house beside the brier bush," Domsie tried to the letter, but "between the shaking of his hands and his voice he I not." "It's nae use," he cried, "he's first in the humanity oot o' ndred and seventy lads, first o' them a', and he's the first In Greek, the like o' this is hardly known, and it has na been seen in atochty since there was a schule. That's the word he's sent, and ide me tell his mother without delay, and I am here as fast as my eet could carry me." "Margaret was silent for the space of five seconds. She took the Dominie's hand and said to him 'Under God this was your doing. Maister Jamieson, and for your reward ye'll get naither silver nor gold, but ye hae a mither's gratitude." Eloquent tribute Thomas Jefferson paid his old Scotch professor William Small: "He was the man who fixed the destinies of my life.' Garfield was attracted to Williams College by the fame of Mark Hopkins, who was then at the serene meridian of his great powers as a philosophic teacher. But in the fullness of time Garfield's day of greatness came. Did he forget to pronounce a fitting eulogy on his old </seg>

One of his first public acts after his inauguration was to receive in the east room of the executive mansion at Washington the venerable educator and a delegation of Williams alumni, to whose address of congratulation he made a feeling response. "For a quarter of a century," said President Garfleld, "Doctor Hopkins has seemed to me a man apart from other men, standing on an intellectual and moral mountain peak, embodying in himself much of the majesty of earth, and reflecting in his noble life something of the sunlight and glory of heaven." ■ Matchless, therefore, Is the opportunity of the true teacher. Match - also is the responsibility. cAgricultural Education and Industrial draining Deputy E. C.

The great force of scientists working under the national department of agriculture, and under the state departments of agriculture, are bringing develop - ments which promise more to the American people than any other national scientific movement. The benefits to be secured from the development of the science of agriculture should be enjoyed by a far greater number of communities and people than now enjoy them. The question naturally arises, why do not more people take advantage of the opportunities offered and utilize results of scientific research and suc - cessful experiment in matters pertinent to their welfare. We need more Edisons — men who search out and grasp the scientific principle, and devote their thought and energy to the adaptation of those prin - ciples to the utilization by the people in the affairs of life in which they are most concerned. I Our government through the Department of Agriculture employs rge force of experts in investigating and compiling in the field of itiflc agriculture. Some of our national legislators have withheld • support to bills providing for the enactment of laws by which itiflc agriculture may become better known and utilized and which Id extend to the mass of the people the benefits of such labor and stigation with the evasive reply that it is the function of the rnment to investigate and that there its obligations cease. But increasing demands made upon the department of agriculture for itance has resulted In a gradual breaking away from the old tradi - that the duty of the government is discharged altogether when have simply made Investigations. Although the science of agriculture as developed in our country is comparatively new, yet we have already great stores of information and valuable methods of procedure which mean much for the develop - ment of our social and business interests. But we are breaking away from the first established practice of confining the teaching of agri - culture to special Institutions only. Our schools of agriculture are do- </seg>
            <seg id="p275">210 ing a great work In educating the youth who attend them and who then either return to the farm and make better farmers or who continue their work in scientific investigation. The same statement may well be made of the work in domestic art and manual training. I Our special schools of agriculture and industrial education are lually reaching out and it is our part to encourage them in the great k they are doing, but we cannot hope to live until the time when special schools will directly reach the mass of the people who should eached. While we are encouraging the work of these special insti - ons we should at the same time avail ourselves of the means for liing the product. If we are to perform a service which will bring ?ral good to rural conditions in this generation, we must, while &gt;uraging the basic organizations, do those other things which can be ; now. Discussion of education in agriculture, manual training, and domestic art has been confined largely to special schools of agriculture, manual training and home economics, or to high schools provided with special courses of study, and necessary facilities for carrying on the work. But these schools are so few, and for several decades will be so few, that while one rural youth attends such a school, scores of his neighbors go no further with their education than that provided by the home school, where, from lack of prop r facilities, education for the home life is neglected. The schools provides with agricul - tural laboratories, manual-training and domestic art equipment, will con - to grow in favor and to increase in number. But for each one of such schools there are hundreds of rural, town and city schools where this work, however much desired, is not introduced because of lack of what is considered necessary funds and equipment and teachers especially trained for the work. I As in the consolidated school proposition, we can wait and watoh work for ideal conditions and thus aim to shift responsibility, but course is to work for ideal conditions and at the same tims I the best use of real present-day conditions. I Since the one-room rural school must for yet many years play nportant part in the education of the people of rural communities; since it must be the rural school and its co-op rathe agencies lgh which a desire for better things can be created and where desire will lead to action that will secure better things, our part is ring to the rural school those influences which will reach into ■nt actual conditions, do good along the way, and lead to better Ed long as the people are led to. cr are permitted to, cling tenaciously ( three R's to the exclusion of other educative influences, the school in its old form, will remain in the background of modern pment. The rural community can and will have as good a school rants. The splritualizaticn of the rural school has its beginning changing of the attitude of the people toward their need. To </seg>

            <seg id="p278">211 ■the way to supply such need is not only the battle begun, but th le won. The teaching of agriculture in rural schools has not brought the results hoped for and confidently expected. There are two strong general reasons for this. First, too many farmers do not feel the need of such instruction; se -ond, too many teachers are not prepared to properly teach agriculture. IA teacher properly supplied with knowltdge, and the power of t application can in one year make the study of agriculture the : popular educational work in the community. Another teacher in less than one year, by attempting to teach agriculture, cause it some unappreciated as an educative force, unpopular as a subject, despised as a task. The unsuccessful teacher of agriculture generally makes one or more of the following mistakes: ■ 1. He fails to have the pupil and the patron approach the subject the proper kind and degree of interest. B2. He falls to begin to teach and to continue to teach in proper \ the right sub-divisions of the subject as applied to the com - ty. 3. His lack of knowledge of the subject or his lack of skill in its ntaticn invite confusion and failure. ■ 4. He fails to utilize the means at hand for doing things that be done in the particular locality at the particular time. »What I have said and shall say applies as forcibly to domestic art to manual training as to agriculture, and recognizes general conii - i, the conditions of whdch must be considered in a general discus - of the subject. I Since the farmer is not interested in agricultural education we t awaken such interest, though it is not always necessary to call effort agricultural education, a term sometimes not popular with e people. Since teachers are not properly prepared to teach culture, we must take the teachers as they are and help them to he things which they can do. Since teachers and members of the niunity fail to utilize the means at hand for doing things that can lone, we must help the teachers and help the community to see to do. For reasons already mentioned, agriculture, domestic art, and manual training have not become generally established as recognized parts of public school work. Special schools of agriculture, home economics, and manual training, as now existing in university, college. and high school organizations, have, within their respective fields, done a good work. Well equipped departments in one or more of these arts are in successful operation in some high schools, some grade schools, and in some private schools. But such schools are too few, too little known, and too distant from the people whom they should serve. To reach more than a very small percentage of our young people we must in a measure bring these schools into the home if we would reach the great mass of the people. </seg>
            <seg id="p279">212 I Any new agency for doing good must show its power? for good before 1 be accepted and supported by the public. If we wait for Congress, ate legislatures, and for boards of education to make appropriations provide the means for doing this work where there is greatest for it to be done, this generation shall pass away without seeing i accomplished. In this democratic country of ours, before leg - re bodies take action and before boards of education establish ;e&amp; in courses of study and equipment for carrying out such es, there must come a desire from the homes of the people for Let us first enter the home. We must bring these industrial schools into the home if we would reach the people and through them establish public measures. Our young people are the entering wedge to the home. When we cannot lead the father and mother we can sometimes lead the child, who in turn leads the father and mother. Measures which lead the boy and girl to a keener interest in the home, to a better appreciation of home life, and to the cultivation of a greater degree of individual efficiency as a factor in the home and in the com - munity life — these are educative in the highest sense and represent a necessary part in the proper development of the civic, moral, and indus - trial life of the nation. The homes of which such boys and girls are members and the communities in which such homes are located will soon demand for all of the young people that kind of training which has been shown by actual demonstration to be truly educative. I The problem stated is this: Without funds, equipment, or suffl - state or community interest, what method of procedure will bring t the necessary interest in these lines of industrial education and action will lead to measures which will provide the necessary i and equipment for giving this work its proper place in the public &gt;ls? (With an appreciation of the value of industrial training as a ral supplement to the curricula of the various divisions of our ic school system, and feeling especially the need, in an agricultural ■, of training the youth to a knowledge of, familiarity with, respect and an interest in agriculture, we have encouraged industrial ling, especially in agriculture and in domestic science. i However worthy it may be, a new issue cannot be successfully alished by legislation alone. The value of a new issue must be before it can become a permanent factor in any enterprise subject to support and approval of the public. Domestic science, manual ting and agriculture cannot be successfully legislated into our ole, until our teachers, school officers and our people in general rec - ce the need of such training. An important step was made when our state university fixed the stamp of approval by offering courses of study in these Industrial </seg>
            <seg id="p280">213 justified increased facilities for instruction, yet the public is compar - atively slow in sending her charges to this work. Public sentiment muit receive a better insight than that afforded by a few young people who search out and go to this work; the work must come to the public, must enter the home; must command the attention of her peop.e. Operating under the influence of a strong, healthful sentiment from the leading educational factors in the state, we have en - deavored, to reach through the public schools of the state, the homes of our people, with some suggestions, some insight that will cause them to desire to know, to see and to possess that which will bring to the members of the home, a desired measure of knowledge, usefulness and happiness. With a desire in the home for training of the youth in domestic art, in manual training or in agriculture, provision for such training will come from the district school meeting, through boards of educa - tion, to the child enrolled in the public school. The attempt to reach the child through the home has too often resulted in failure because of the lack of interest, from the Indifference or even the opposition of the parent, who fails to recognize the value of such training to the child. Whether it be from the lack of knowledge or from conservatism which sayg, "What was good enough for me is good enough for my child," ex - perience has shown that we are too often unable to reach the home through the parent. We are more often successful in reaching the home through the child. The child, with mind unprejudiced by bygone expe - riences and associations, more often gives a ready ear to the new thought and more willingly lends a hand in the untried work. ■ Prom this point of view, we have sought to interest the youth, thus bring the attention of the parent to the value of industrial ing. What, so far, has been accomplished can be told in few words, yet it is all, even more, than expected. The sentiment that has been awakened is healthful; the interest that has been aroused is genuine; the results are satisfactory, the future seems full of opportunity, full of promise and full of work. Contrary to the opinion held by many, there is no law requiring the teaching of agriculture in the public schools of Nebraska. The Nebraska legislature of 1901 amended the existing law for the cer - tification of teachers by inserting the requirement for 1st and 2nd grade county teacher's certificates, that "The first and second grade certificates may be granted to any person who shall pass a satisfactory examination in the elements of agriculture Including a fair knowl - edge of the structure and habits of the common plants, insects, birds, and quadrupeds." The only subject required to be taught by law In the state of Nebraska is physiology and hygiene. The law on this point reads: "Provision shall be made by the proper local school author - ities for Instructing the pupils in all schools supported by public money. </seg>
            <seg id="p281">214 ■nder state control, in physiology and hygiene with special refer nre te effect of alcoholic drinks and other stimulants and narcotics upon human system." To require by law the teaching of agriculture in the public schools, before the public school teachers are prepared to give Instruc - tion in agriculture, would defeat the purpose of introducing the study of agriculture. Our legislators acted wisely when they first provided that teachers must prepare themselves to teach agriculture. The teachers' examinations in agriculture, to this time, have been conducted more on the principle of leading teachers to properly prepare themselves in the subject than as a test of such knowledge of the subject as should be expected of any teacher who teaches it. With six years of examina - tions and such other encouragement as could be given, Nebraska teachers are beginning to feel something of the breath of the subject and are preparing themselves to teach it. With teachers who have for six years been preparing themselves on this subject or who, having more recently entered the profession, have anticipated this requirement; with the examinations gradually requiring Increased comprehension of the subject on the part of the teacher; we are in a measure becoming prepared to handle the subject. Without a law requiring the teaching of agriculture, it has been introduced very largely into rural schools, into .the grades in town and city schools, into high schools and into normal schools, as a part of the course of study. The sentiment of the people has been cultivated to an appreciation of the suubject, aDd co-operation is now coming from sources where a few years ago there existed only oppositioq or indifference. The interest and activity in agriculture has been brought about largely by the following means: Ccurse of Studs ■ The Nebraska Commission on Course of Study is now preparing a course of study for use In the rural schools of Nebraska. The pro - posed course of study includes the teaching of agriculture and such work in domestic art and manual training as can be handled under existing conditions. This does not mean that agriculture will be taught in our rural schools as it should be taught in a school devoted to agriculture Dor as a special subject ranking with the five essentials, but rather a continuation of the primary work in nature study and geog - raphy with special application to the agricultural and geographic conditions in Nebraska. Agriculture means more than observation. It means that some - thing must be done as well as observed. It means an active interest on the part of the student that will in rural districts assist in forming the almost missing "connecting link" between' tha school and the home. Our teachers as a whole feel that they know but little of the science of agriculture. We cannot insist at this time that they shall know a gr- at deal about agriculture, but we do urge that they become inter- </seg>
            <seg id="p282">215 Ein the subject and that they add to this interest, such knowledge ey may secure, such means of gaining knowledge and such means eating interest among pupils as will cause them to become 1: )rs, and will bring them into touch with real life. In high schools, the subject is taken up and studied more as a special subject with the recommendation that laboratory work include objective work "out-of-doors;" that theories in agriculture be taught in relation to the facts as existing in the objective surroundings of the locality. Our best high schools must yet continue to contribute la to the supply of teachers for rural schools. Under the new law pro - viding for recognition by this department of normal training in high echools. the study of agriculture is given a proper place. The outline for the one year's course provides tor instruction in laboratory work in Farm Animals, Milk and Its Products, Soils, Field Crops and Garden and Orchard Crops. In the one year's course, one hundred and twelve periods are given to study and ninety-six periods to laboratory work. The laboratory work is designed to bring the student into a closer, broader, and intimate knowledge of the subject; for instance, in "Farm Animals," eight double practice periods are given to visits to nearby stock farms where the typical specimens of the different breeds of horses, cattle, sheep and swine are studied in the home environment. The laboratory work in Milk and Its Products, Soils, Field Crops, and Garden and Orchard Crops, is designed to bring the student into con - tact with problems which are commonly met in the home, or community. Kn the study of Field Crops, Garden and Orchard Crops, the student iected to deal directly with the object studied so far as possible, ltivating with his own hands, the plants studied. In &amp;Corm*l Schools. I In our state normal schools, special instructors are provided in ■ulture. School gardening provides outdoor laboratory work as pplement to carefullly arranged indoor laboratory exercises. In state junior normal schools, .school gardening has furnished an esting and favorite laboratory study for the summer school junior lal teachers. Teachers in these classes ar required to plan and for their own "little farms" and thus gain by actual experience the ns they would teach in their schools. University Aid. — For the 1906 session of the Junior Normals, the University of Nebraska provided special instructors from the Univer - sity School of Agriculture who spent two weeks at each of the various junior normals, instructing in his specialty. Field Crops, Soils, Farm Animals, and Horticulture were the subjects treated by these special - ists. The regular instructor in agriculture conducted the school garden and supplemented the work of the special instructors. The university also sent special lecturers who made the rounds of the. junior normals and lectured on various agricultural subjects. Thes-* lectures were so </seg>
            <seg id="p283">216 » received and created such interest in the subject that the result has evident not only in subsequent sessions of the junior normals in the work in schools throughout the state. (Agricultural And Domestic Science Clubs. With a view toward creating an interest throughout the state in the study of agriculture the first Nebraska Corn Contest was inaugurated in the spring of 1905. The five hundred boys who first forwarded nams and addresses to this department were furnished five hundred kernels of pure bred seed corn. The University of Nebraska School of Agriculture furnished the seed corn. The boys were notified that a re - port would be expected of them. During the summer it was decided that it would be well to ask each of the five hundred boys to send or bring to Lincoln with his written report, the best ten ears of corn raised from the seed furnished him. A prize list was arranged and a program prepared; the girls who had demanded that they be given an equal chance with the boys were admitted as corn cookers and the first Ne - braska corn contest was announced. This first state contest developed beyond the expectations of the organisers. In several counties where a large number of boys had entered the state contest, a local county contest was held preceding the state contest. In order that a large number of boys might partici - pate in th'Ese county contests a second division was offered in 'which fcoyt were permitted to enter ten ears of seed corn selected from the fields of their parents. Bulletins on corn selection were supplied di - rectly to the five hundred boys who first entered the state contest and through the county superintendents to others who became interested. The work of the cooking of bread and other edibles from corn products was generally added in the county contest. The five hundred boys were directed to keep careful notes during the season and fill out and smd to the state manager the following report blank: SHebrtski Boys' cAssccUtion. Class A.

"To organize the school boys and school girls of the state for d finite work along lines which will bring the home and the school into closer relation; to prepare young people for the fullest enjoyment of their environment; to dignify, by a better knowledge of its condi - tions and possibilities, the farm life of the twentieth century; to edu - cate the youth of the country, town and city to a knowledge of their dependence upon nature's resources, and to the value of the f self development of hand, head and heart; to stimulate activity that will give industrial training its due emphasis in our eciucat tern; to give to the state the services of her ambitious boys and girls in study and experiment in fields that will bring a better and gi development of the resources of our commonwealth. " tThe plan of the work of these associations as outlined in the ining, contemplated a state organization that won 1 prin - ly for the purpose of encouraging the work in county and school ict organizations. The following quotations from the state consti - n of both agricultural and domestic science associations, further e plan in mind. I "The state organization, while anticipating good results from the k of the individual state membership and the state meeting greater good from its office as an encouragement and assistance to ity organizations." "The county organization, reaching directly into every school district, from Its local position can organize more factors and can secure a greater personal interest in its work; it occupies a field more potent, and with more possible results than does the distant and more restricted state organization." The state constitution also expresses the relation of the school district organization to the state and county organization, as follows: "In such measure as the state organization exists largely for the encouragement and assistance it may be to the county organization. so is the relation of the county organization to the school district organ - ization. The county organization reaches to every school district in the county, the school district organization reaches to every home in th? district. Local conditions should regulate the scope ind the nature of the work in each district." </seg>
            <seg id="p287">220 The plan for the work of the state associations contemplated an annual yearly meeting and program, but on account of the great amount of work and the expense af conducting a state contest, it was expected that only the one state contest would be held, the one state contest being considered sufficient to give necessary impetus to the county work. However, in the business meeting at the state meeting, 1905, when It was announced that plans the next year Included holding a state meet - ing with a program but omitting the contest features, the members unanimously demanded a second state contest. Arrangements were accordingly perfected for holding the 1906 Corn Contest and Convention. The continued activity of the organization of the county and the school district clubs has justified the existence of the state orgainza - tion as a factor in unifying and encouraging the work in the county and school district. §The plans of the state organizations are expressed by the intro - &gt;ry letter of the state manager in the official publication of the two organizations, which was sent out to the state and county members: "Our organizations had their beginning in the spring of 1905, with a membership of five hundred Nebraska boys who entered the corn growing contest. At the first state meeting, December 14-16, 1905, we added "corn cooking" and initiated an equal number of girls. This year our work includes corn, wheat, potato and sugar beet growing; corn cooking and other branches of cooking; hand sewing, and manual training, with work in county clubs in other lines of agriculture, do - mestic science and manual training. Since our organizations had their beginning in the production and use of corn, and since corn is Nebraska's greatest and favorite crop, at the meeting of the executive committees held at York, July 27 and 28, when the questtion of the title of our 1906 "guide book" was presented, it was unanimously agreed that it should be named "The Nebraska Corn Book." Bin this booklet we have given liberal space to the discussion of , and have treated briefly other subjects of interest to our members, hope that brief mention here will lead to investigation and study, to profitable experimental work on the part of our membership. The object of our organization is to provide suggestion and direc - tion rather than instruction. The boy who carefully cultivates and studies the growth of a patch of corn, sugar beets, potatoes, wheat, or other plants, will gain a new interest and a better appreciation of the value of careful thought applied in the study and adaptation of seed selection, soil fertility, and the intelligent culture of plants. Further, he will become interested in the best methods of marketing, and of the use of these plants as food for man and animal. This will direct him to study, to discussion, and to investigation, leading to a knowledge of systematic feeding and caring for live stock, to a study of animal adaptation and needs, and to a careful consideration of the financial problems involved. This is educational. </seg>

            <seg id="p295">226 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT Headquarters were established at the Lindell Hotel. The exhibit was held in the City Auditorium. Twenty-three hundred exhibits were entered in corn, cooking, sewing and manual training. I At the business meeting held December 12, 1906, the plan for following year wag outlined. On account of the increased num - jntering the work it was decided that it would be no longer possible andle the work successfully from state headquarters. All young ile desiring to enter any of the contests were instructed to com - icate with their respective county superintendents, thus making rounty the strong unit of organization, the state organization confin - their work to direction and assistance in the county work, and to state meeting and contest. I Beginning with the first year of the work, the University of aska gave strong co-operation by furnishing speakers and judges he county and state me tings, and assisting in providing literature. he beginning of the work for 1907, arrangements were made with university to provide a series of bulletins writtn especially for work in corn, potatoes and domestic art. These bulletins have of much service in th? work in stimulating an interest by giving er direction for the work to the individual. I The corps of speakers and judges now provided by the university giving most excllent service to the state and by their assistance he county contests and conventions being held. Two judges and kers are provided for each county meeting, one for the work of boys and one for that of the girls. Schedules are arranged so speakers can go from one county to the next without loss of time, ty-three county contests are being held this year before the D&gt; meeting of the National Corn Exposition at Omaha. Other coun - will hold meetings after the first of the year. The 1907 contest and convention was held January 20-24, 1908, in connection with the meetings of the twenty associations of organ - ised agriculture which met at the University Farm. Exhibits in cooking and sewing were greater at this meeting than at any other state contest. The cooking exhibition was limited to bread only. This became necessary in the state contest on account of the lack of facilities to handle other departments. The work this year is a contin - uation of that of the past two years. Each county organization takes up the work which seems advisable in the particular county. The membership of both associations now numbers more than 20,000, and includes young people in &lt; very county in the state. (The 1908-9 annual meeting will be held at Omaha, December in connection with the National Corn Exposition. December 11. •lock P. M. is set for th? business meeting. Special excursions be run from all points where the attendance justifies. A one and ialf fare, round trip rate, has been granted. Indications are -able for an excellent meeting. Several counties will make special ty exhibits and a large number of rural, town and city schools make special collective exhibits. </seg>
            <seg id="p296">227 Saccess of Work. The increased support given to the county superintendents !n the various counties is one of the most encouraging indications of the recognition of the value of the work. In nearly all counties where the organizations have been perfected and the work carried on, the board has supported the work liberally by appropriations from $50 to $100. The county farmers' institute, the women's auxiliaries, commercial clubs, and other organizations have united in encouraging the work by giving financial support and other assistance. The attendance has varied from a small organization meeting to an attendance of Z The largest attendance recorded is that of the Dodge county meeting held at Fremont, December 13, 1907, where 2,000 pupils, teachers and parents were present at the afternoon im&gt;£ting. The co-operation and assistance given by the University of Ne - braska through the department of farmers' institutes has bfen of great value in carrying out the work. It is gratifying to note the active interest taken by the extreme outlying counties. Several hundred boys and girls are raising potatoes in Scotts Bluff, Cheyenne and Box Butte counties under the direction of the respective county superintend ■ The work of the boys and girls through these organizatim several communities has resulted in the establishment of regular !M ■ in doni' stic science and manual training in several town and schools, and agricultural education has become a live subject mghout the state. In the new county high school established this • at Kimball, domestic science, manual training and agriculture strong parts of the high school work. tTh:-se results have come from the efforts put forth to make the possible use of the means at hand. The problem of making use of existing conditions has been solved in a number of nunities. We give herewith the plan carried out in a few cases: The Bancroft 'PUn. The Bancroft school is an eighth-grade ward school of Lincoln, Nebraska. Courses in cooking and manual training have been main - tained for the past four years in some of the ward schools of Lincoln. In schools where such courses were established, efficient teachers and proper equipment have been provided for doing the work in a most satisfactory manner. As the funds and inclinations of the board of education have permitted, these courses were extended to different ward schools. The Bancroft school is so situated and equipped with building facilities that day seemed far distant when cooking and manual training departments could be added. The school grounds were too limited in extent to permit school gardening. Miss E. Ruth Pyrtle, principal of the school, had faith in the virtue of training in domestic art, manual training, and elementary agriculture. The Bancroft school building stands between the North Western and Burlington railway tracks on the west and north, the University </seg>
            <seg id="p297">228 of Nebraska on the east, and the crowded city on the south. The pupils come from homes as varied as the character of the surroundings in - dicate. There was no extra room, no funds and no equipment for this Work began in agriculture. In the study of seeds and of plants the pupils in all grades were led to a desire to know, by seeing and doing, the wonderful processes of germination, leaf and stalk develop - ment, budding, blooming, and ripening of the seed. A local seed firm •old, by request, small packages of flower and vegetable seeds for one cent each. Each pupil purchased such seed as he desired, spaded up his own back yard or front yard or neighboring vacant plot, planted bis seed, cultivated his plants, watched their development, reported results, brought samples of flowers or vegetables to his teacher, and escorted his teacher and other visitors out to his little experimental plot when occasion permitted. I The work in folding, paper cutting, sewing, moulding and water r in the primary grades, evolved into needle work, in making the tier forms of wearing apparel and house ornament, by the girls, in whittling out models of ladders, swings, tables, and chairs, in making of broom-holders, towel racks, coat-hangers, knife boxes, il-holders, match safes, spice boxes, and other articles for the e, schoolroom or business desk. This work was done at home with whatever tools or equipment the pupil could secure. Results were brought to school and showed to teacher and schoolmates. Originality and skillful workmanship were «Moaraged. The eighth grade had lessons in cooking. Once each week a recipe was written on the board or read to the pupils, who copied it. These recipes were secured from the School of Domestic Science at the Univer - sity. The teacher first tried the recipe and presented only what she had proven with her own hands to be practical with the beginner in cooking. During the week each pupil, unaided, in his own home, cooked the article, as many times as desired, and reported, with sample of cooking when practical, at the regular time of the lesson the fol - lowing week when free discussion was participated in by all members of the class. The cooking was done on stoves with fuel of gas, coal, wood, cobs, or trash, and with utensils varying from the most simple and undesirable to the most expensive and best adapted cooking-vessel. These varied conditions brought experiences interesting to hear and profitable to know. K Before the close of school in the spring, patron's day was observed. rt of the forenoon was spent in placing on the walls and on the across which boards had been laid, specimens of the work in each . This Included the various kinds of regular school-work and ts of work in the industrial lines before mentioned. In the afternoon the pupils of each room, in charge of their re - spective teachers, passed through the various rooms viewing the work </seg>
            <seg id="p298">229 of the other grades. Patrons were permitted to examine any of the work in any of the rooms at their leisure. While the results in the reg - ular schoolwork attracted the usual attention, it was the work in cook - ing, sewing, and manual training that excited the greater interest and attention of the visitors. tAt the noon hour a temporary table was arranged in one of the ary rooms and the eighth grade served luncheon to their teachers some invited guests, the cooking and serving being done entirely lembers of the eighth grade. Even the boys were proud to have nd in it. The lessons given in cooking had not been restricted rls. I This briefly is the plan of the Bancroft school. From this crude nning the work in these three lines has been systematized, and teach - pupils and patrons have become more confident in the possibility of Ing good results without the use of expensive equipment and means r than their own resources; homes have been reached; the school Iren appreciate the opportunities they have; the patrons recognize value of the work and feel that between the school and the home e is a relation which if properly sustained will make better homes, sr schools, and better citizens. The Crete Plan. Crete is a prosperous little town of 3,000 inhabitants in a fertile agricultural section of Nebraska. Superintendent G. A. Gregory has faith in industrial training as a healthful auxiliary to the regular school work. One corner of a basement room was cleared out, some common wood-working tools secured and the Crete school boys were given a chance to learn to do things. They were encouraged to establish workshops at home, make use of the old saw, chisel, plane, and ham - mer, and provide necessary articles for use or ornament about the home. The boys liked It. The patrons began to like it. I But there were the high school girls crowding their heads with olbook lore, and neglecting the training of the hand, the eye, and sense of weight, size and condition. There was no unused room could be cleared and fitted for a cooking class. There were no Is for providing equipment or teacher. But something must be k Mrs. Gregory is a good cook. She became interested. Another who belongs to a prominent family of the town and who is likewise od cook, became interested. A few other ladies from the best fam - in Crete joined the little circle and Superintendent Gregory's plan put on an operating basis. Each lady volunteered her services and her kitchen once a week. Not to exceed ten girls gathered at each of these homes under charge of the volunteer, free service, home teacher and demonstrator and took a lesson in cooking. At one place it was bread; at another, soups; at another, gravies; at another, cookies, etc. The school girls watched </seg>

The girls who attended the bread-making dem - onstration one week were invited to pass on to another division the following week until the complete rounds had been made once ,and oftener if necessary. tThis was a volunteer course not only on the part of the teachers on the part of the pupils. The second and third years found all school girls enlisted in the work. The cooking course has now added to the high school curriculum. The following conditions ill: 1. Any high school girl may take the work any year or years from freshman to senior inclusive. 2. The work when completed is counted as a regular high school credit. 3. The teacher of each special division and one other member of the teachers' club are judges who decide when satisfactory results have been attained in each respective division. 4. No fixed time is set for the completion of the work by any student. Ability to show satisfactory results in each division of the work is the measure of work completed. In the making of bread the pupil is required to bring to the judges samples of her work in each of the different kinds of bread required to be made. In the division of pies the pupil is required to submit samples of one and two-crust pies. In the cooking of meats the pupil is required to bring to the judge samples of meat cooked as required and also to show evidence of her ability to •elect meats and to properly serve them. This applies in other divis - ions of the work. On completion of the twenty different divisions of work outlined ir the course, the pupil is given high school credit for the same. In agriculture the work is likewise homework. Each pupil from the first grade up is encouraged to become acquainted with the growth of plant and animal life. Each pupil is encouraged to learn to do something worth being done, to learn to do the thing which his sur - roundings permit, and to learn to do well whatever he undertakes. Three years ago last spring before the closing of the school year Superintendent Gregory and his teachers left with the pupils of the school the feeling that during the summer vacation it would be well for ■each one to learn to do with his own hands something worth being done. In the fall after the opening of school, on inquiry by the teach - ers, It was learned that nearly all the pupils had accomplished some - thing. Some had raised flowers, some vegetables; some of those living In the country had cultivated quit? extensive plots of ground; some had raised and cared for different kinds of animals as pets; some had learned to sew, to cook, to can fruit, to make articles for use about the </seg>

In order that the pupils might each see what the other had accom - plished and that teachers and patrons might se ■ what had been done, one Friday afternoon was set apart for an industrial exhibition. School IH dismissed in all the grades. The lower rooms in the central school building w?re prepared for exhibiting by placing boards across lengthwise on the rows of feats and the walls were utilized for hanging exhibits of sewing. The children were asked to bring any article they had made or any pet they had raised during the summer. No p were offered. Entry cards were provided. Each article bore the name of the maker. One room was set aside for vegetables, one for flowers, one for sewing and manual training, one for cooking. The brought in boxes of variou I ith wire or wire screen froDts and arranged on benches strung arouni the outside of the school building.

The cooking Included several kinds of bread, cake. cookies, candies, canned fruits, and other household articles; sewing include! aprons, sofa-pillow covers, dusting caps, various articles of ordinary wear and house ornaments. The manual training work Included coat hangers, sleeve boards, broom-holders, match boxes. knife-holders, pen-holders, boxes of various descriptions, chairs, jar - diniere stands, tools, wheelbarrows, ladders and molelsof variou* K One boy exhibited a home-made ■engine with a coal car and coach at - tached. Among the vegetable exhibits were every common vegetable and several exhibits of peanuts. The flower department contained exhibits of potted plants and bouquets grown in the homes and ga: of the pupils. I No awards were made, each pupil getting his reward in the satis - lon of knowing that he had accomplished something, that what he done was worthy of the interest of others and that he had gained ability to do something worth doing. This industrial exhibition was repeated the next two years, con - tinuing to grow in interest. The last year the exhibit was made in the high school building where electric lights were available and the exhibit was open during the afternoon and evening thus giving the tm men a chance to view the exhibit. At nine o'clock in the evening a brief program of music and addresses was held in the high school auditorium. The people of Crete are now asking why they cannot have an up-to-date manual training and home economic department in their public schools. The way is easy now. </seg>
            <seg id="p301">232 The Brtdshaxu PUn In the village of Bradshaw, where a ten-grade, four-room school la maintained, the high school and grammar school girls organized a domestic science club under the direction of one of the teachers. They met once a week outside of school hours. Their first work was sewing. They got an instruction book and studied out what they wished to try first; all worked at the same thing and brought results to the next meeting. They made articles of clothing for themselves and for mem - bers of their family. They made raffia hats which they themselves delighted to wear during the summer. The boys of the high school and grammar school grades organized an agricultural club, had reg - ular meetings at stated times, on which occasions some members read papers or gave demonstrations concerning the subjects in which they had become interested. Sometimes the work included study of one of the different breeds of sheep, cattle, horses, hogs, or poultry; at other times, corn, potatoes, alfalfa, sugar beets, peanuts, or some other article in the grain or vegetable line received attention. The primary grades had a school and home improvement club, under the direction of the two primary grade teachers. This club in the spring time secured the use of some vacant lots on which they raised flowers and vegetables. Nearly all members of each of the three above mentioned clubs had home gardens in which they cultivated flowers and vegetables. Ihe P**»nee Fl*n- District No. 20, the lower West Branch School, is a rural school Id Pawnee county eight miles southwest of Pawnee City. From twenty to twenty-five pupils are enrolled and a class of from one to four pupils graduate from the eighth grade each year. The school building is the ordinary box-car form but kept in good repair. The school chil - dren collected stones and made borders for flower beds in front and at one side of the building. They also trained vines over the outbuild - ings and maintained a small experimental garden. At intermission periods the teachers and pupils talked over plans by which they might learn to cook and sew, to make various articles, and to cultivate certain plants. Recipes were sought and distributed, each girl experimenting in her own home. Results were reported at their little informal meetings, and when desired, samples were submitted. In this way the girls learned to make bread and other common articles of diet, to can fruit, to sew, and to cultivate flowers and vegetables. The boys took especial interest in corn and potato growing and other agricultural lines that especially appealed to the individual. At the county corn contests and at the state contests this school Is always represented by creditable exhibits in the various lines of work and by delegates sent by the school to attend the meeting. The teacher, Miss Lulu Wolford, was re-employed each year at an advanced salary. Her school </seg>

The school has been much benefited by the interest ened among the patrons of the school. The examples just cited give the work done in these particular ■city, town, village, and country schools. These results have been re - peated in other schools. I am led to believe that the results gained are in some instances better than results in this same work where funds, equipment, and trained teachers are provided for carrying on the work as an organized part of the school course. The work has this virtue: A child learns to make the best use of his opportunity; he learns that efficiency is the aim and that individual effort wins. In all the above mentioned instances the work has been encouraged by the existence of the school district, the county, and the state organizations of boys and girls, which have for their purpose the development of individual efficiency; the object being to provide suggestion and direc - tion rather than instruction. Departments of manual training and cooking have recently been •established in the high schools at York and Geneva as a result of the interest taken in the work of the county and state boys' and girls' Associations. In other localities, both rural and urban, through the activity of the young people, the communities have been lead to a higher appreciation of the value of education in agriculture, home ■economics, and manual training as encouraged by our 20,000 active members scattered over the state. B Agricultural and domestic science clubs are spreading the inspira - that comes from individual effort along lines of activity that bring school, the home, and the community into closer communion and gnize the necessity of all-round development. It is necessary to make use of the facilities at hand if within the present generation we see the establishment of the work in agriculture, manual training, and domestic science in our schools where most needed. The extension work in agriculture and home economics which is being rapidly developed now by many of our leading universities; the organizations of boys and girls working through the public school system; the reading courses made popular because of their adaptation to the real conditions as found in the homes of the people; the traveling schools of agriculture, which have brought traveling schools of home economics; all these movements which stimulate the activity of our young people in a simple, earnest, effective way are doing more for -creating a proper degree of respect for industrial efficiency ; are help - ing more to dignify the calling of the farmer and the home-maker than are textbooks, lectures, special schools, and others of the more dignified methods we have been using, yet in which we feel the need of more effective means of reaching the home and of extending the work. </seg>

The plan of the corn-growing contest will be about the same as that followed last year, the only additional requirement being that a written report on the growth of the corn, which was to be filled out from time to time during the year is to accompany the exhibit of ten ears when brought or sent to the contest. The boys who were furnished seed </seg>
            <seg id="p307">238 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT • Dd report blanks last spring, who have raise! corn from the five hundred kernel* sent them and also kept the corn report, will select ten of the bast ears and bring or send the same accompanied by the corn report, entry blank properly filled out containing counter-signature of parent, to this office on or before Thursday evening, December 12. All exhibits of corn must be in by that time, as the corn judge will then begin his work of judging. Entry blanks and directions for selecting the exhibit will be mailed directly to all boys enrolled in the contest. GIRLS' COOKING CONTEST. The cooking contest consists of two classes, namely, Class II — Corn Bread of any kind' Claw O — Wheat Bread (one loaf) »Any Dodge county school girl may enter this contest. Any con - st may enter one or both classes. The contestant may use what - reclpe or follow wnatever directions she desires. Each contestant shall make the bread that she exhibits, including all the work of mixing and baking, without assistance. This last re - requirement does not apply when contestants first begin, that is when they are practicing. Many of them will probably need assistance and instruction from their mothers and older sisters upon first beginning. We do not limit girls in the amount of practicing they may do. If they meet with failures at first they should be encouraged to try again. Our only requirement is that the loaf or loaves that &amp; contestant exhibits fchould be the result of her own efforts. Quality and appearance are of prime importance. The loaves should not be too large or too small, ami should be well formed. In preparing loaves of bread for the exhibit, they should be carefully wrapped, using clean wrappers, carefully adjusted, so that the loaf will not be damaged in appearance when it raachw the contest. Bread could be prepared about a week before the date of contest and yet be in quite good condition for exhibiting, but It will be the better plan for the girls to bake the bread they intend to exhibit a day or two before the meeting and it will then be in nice, fresh condition for exhibiting. Encourage the girls to begin practicing at once, as the date of our contest is not far distant. To become skilled la cookery should be the ambition of every girl. This can be acquired only by careful thought and patient, faithful application. GIRL'S SEWING CONTEST. The sewing contest will include the making of aprons, hand made and machine made. Following are the classes: Class C — Hand made- Class D — Machine made. Any girl enrolled in the schools of the county is eligible to enter, We thought at first of having four classes for the aprons, two for fancy and two for work aprons, but finally decided to have only the two elaaaea. hand made and machine made, allowing the contestant to choose aa to whether she would enter a fancy or work apron. A con - testant Bay avter an exhibit in both classes. Aprons will be judged not </seg>
            <seg id="p308">239 upon the material of which they are made or quantity of work, but upon quality of work. This gives the girl who cannot well afford to buy costly material the sam? chance as the one who can. Fancy aprons will compete against work aprons and vice versa in both classes. This is possible because they are scored upon workmanship. Each contestant should use her own taste in selecting the style and pattern of apron she will make. Each contestant will be expected to cut and make the apron she exhibits, without assistance. The same as in the cooking contest, she will not be limited In the amount of practicing she may do. Each contestant should be informed that the quality of work is more im - portant than the the quantity. A plain apron well made and neatly finished in every particular will be scored higher than one trimmed with ruffles, lace and embroidery, with crooked seams and careless finish. I As to size of apron I would suggest that each contestant make apron or aprons she is to exhibit to fit herself. They can then be 1 and made use of after the contest. No specific directions will be n as to how the aprons are to be made. Each girl is to make her n the way she sees fit. The sewing on hand-made aprons is to be s entirely by hand and that on machine-made entirely by use i machine. I am informed that our lady judge, Miss Lulu ford, will have no trouble in determining how each apron is made xamining it. GENERAL REMARKS- Girls may enter both the cooking aDd sewing contest if they desire. In districts where schools do not close for the day, teachers are requested not to mark pupils absent who attend the meeting. KOur corn judge, Prof. L. L. Zook of Lincoln, will conduct a boys' judging contest and those boys showing the most skill in the selec - of corn will be awarded premiums. Any school boy, whether in orn contest or not, may enter. Boys should be encouraged to learn esirable qualities of a good ear of corn. On the enclosed postal card, please send me the names of the girls in your district who wish to enter the cooking and sewing contests. Kindly return card at your very earlie&amp;t convenience. If your school is closed you possibly could make a trip to the homes of the girls whom you think would be likely to enter. Prize lists of the contestants and program of meeting will be announced in the local papers. A greater number of cash prizes will be offered this year and every boy and girl having a creditable exhibit will get something in the way of a premium. All sewing exhibits must be rn by Thursday evening, December 12th. Where there are a number of girls from the same school who wish to enter aprons all might go together and send them in one package by prepaid express. This will reduce the charges for each girl. Aprons could be sent in the same boxes with the boys' corn. They should be packed so as to prevent bad results from wrinkling. The name. </seg>

Friday, December , the red-letter day of the year for Dodge county boys and girls. Yours very truly, J. M. MATZEN, County Superintendent. Letter to School Directors. To Directors of Schools: Gentlemen: — You will note by reading the foregoing letter to teachers that a corn-growing, cooking and sewing contest and con - vention will be held in Fremont, Friday, December 13th. There are about 500 boys in the county who have raised corn from seed fur - ■tsnsrt them from this office. These boys will be asked to bring or Mad their exhibits of the ten best ears they have raised to this city and compete for prizes. Our object in conducting this contest is not merely to give the boys an opportunity to win a prize, but to stim - ulate corn-raising in Dodge county.

It is believed the cooking and sewing contests, will be an incentive to girls iarn by their own actual experience, valuable lessons that every should endeavor to familiarize herself with and thus become useful it the home. Our cooking contest had the effect last year of interesting a number of girls in cooking and leading them to see in it a worthy accomplishment. Let us continue this work that is linking the public schools to the homes in the county. These contests, we predict, if properly carried on, will turn the tide back towards the farm and home, because through them we can lead boys to appreciate the value and beauty of country life, and girls to realize that home-keep - ing is the highest of all womanly callings. tl wish to recommend that where there are a number of pupils wish to attend this meeting that school officers close school on day, not requiring the time to be made up, if teachers and Is attend. We believe that just as much of an educational value be derived by boys and girls who attend this meeting as would be ired by doing an ordinary day's work at school. ■ School officers are asked to lend us their hearty co-operation in work and we extend to them an invitation to attend this meeting. Yours very truly. J. M. MATZEX, County Superintendent. Le ter to 'Boys of Industrial Club. To the Members of the Dodge County Boys' Industrial Club: I Dear Contestant: — Last spring I mailed you 500 kernels of Reid's' ow Dent seed corn from which I hope you have raised a good ity of corn and also attained a better knowledge as to how to grow king of all Nebraska's products, corn. You were also furnished rn-report blank upon which you were to keep a record of the care growth of your corn from time to time during the season. I The plan of the contest this year will be the same as that followed year, the only additional requirement being that this report blank I out is to be sent in with the exhibit. Your best ten ears of corn to be brought or sent to this office on or before Thursday even- December 12th. We would much prefer to have you deliver or them so that they reach us Wednesday, December 11th, or Thurs - the 12th, but should it be more convenient for you to deliver them er than this, you may do so. Enclosed herewith you will find two entry blanks, one of which should be filled out, signed by yourself and parent or guardian, then sent to me before December 7th, so that I may know how many contestants for whom to prepare space. The other blank should also be properly filled out and accompany your exhibit of ten ears. If several exhibits are sent in one box, they should be wrapped separately </seg>
            <seg id="p313">242 In order not to become mixed. Transportation charges should be prepaid on all exhibits sent. Great care should be exercised in selecting your exhibit. Turn to the score card in the enclosed bulletin and select your ears accord - ing to this standard, also note the directions given therein on the •electing of exhibit. One mistake made by several boys last year was that they paid do attention to uniformity of ears in making their •election. Select ears that are uniform in length and in circumference, tboae that are cylindrical in shape, straight rows, uniform kernels, wedged shape and of good depth. The cob should not be large, as this indicates late maturity. The butt should be well filled out and the same is true of the tip. The kernels should be perfectly firm upon the cob so that when the ear is twisted in the fcf^t* it will remain rigid. Select ears that are true to type. There should be vtry little space between the rows of kernels. Consider the above points carefully, and also those given in the bulletin in making jour selection, and you will not be disappointed in the result. tProm the ten best ears you should remove all husks, silks and k, but do not mutilate the ear itself in any way. Do not remove bad kernels. The ears should be handled carefully, that no Bis be knocked off. Before bringing or sending your exhibit, it be well (or you to carefully wrap each ear in paper and see that are firmly packed. If you send your exhibit by express, select ht-weight box sufficiently strong, so that the express charges will i small as possible. We should like to have you send with your exhibit a photograph of yourself or relating to your exhibit, if you have one. This is not required, but we believe that photographs, large or small, will add much to the interest of the exhibit. I All boys exhibiting in the county contest, making a creditable lag, may have their exhibits sent from Fremont to the state &gt;st, free of charge. Deputy State Superintendent E. C. Bishop, iger of the State Boys' and Girls' Associations, will be with us tell us all about the state contest and convention to be held incoln in January.

The variety of articles this year in the cooking contest has been reduced, for the reason that we think that we can accomplish more by combining all effort on a few things than by giving but little time and attention to each of a number of things. In the beginning it was necessary to include a greater variety of articles so as to include what a greater number could be Induced to take part in and thus get their interest aroused.

Of all bodies of citizens that I have received here at the White House there is none which occupies a more important relation than yours. I am tempted to say none has come that has occupied as important a relation to the nation because you men ana women who deal with education, who represent the great American policy of education for all children, provided by the public as the prime duty of the public, bear a relation to the family, a relation to the future of our whole people, such as no other like number of individuals can bear. I own six of the children that you educate and I am pre - pared to extend cordial sympathy to some of you. Seriously, friends, it is idle for any man to talk of despairing of the future of this country, or feeling unduly alarmed about it, if he will come in contact with you here, and with the forces that you </seg>
            <seg id="p320">249 represent. Fundamentally this country Is sound morally no less than physically. Fundamentally, in its family life and in the outside activ - ities of its individuals, the country is better, and not -worse, than it formerly was. This does not mean that we are to be excused if we fail to war against rottenness and corruption, if we fail to contend effectively with the forces of evil, and they waste their time -vho ask me to withhold my hand from dealing therewith. But it is worth while to smite the wrong for the very reason that we are confident that the right will ultimately prevail. You who are training the next generation are training this country as it is to be a decade or two hence, and while your work in training the intellect is great it is not as great ae your work in training character. More than any - thing else I want to see the public school turn out the boy and the girl who, when man and woman, will add to the sum of good citizenship of the nation. It is not my province nor would it be within my capacity to speak about your pedagogic problems; you yourselves are far better able to discuss them, but as a layman, let me say one or two things about your work. Toward Farm and Workshop. In the first place I trust that more and more our people will see to it that the schools train toward and not away from the farm and the workshop. We have spoken a great deal about the dignity of labor in this country, but we have not acted up to our spoken words, for in our education we have tended to proceed upon the assumption that the educated man was to be educated away from and not toward labor. The great nations of mediaeval times who left such marvelous works of architecture and art behind them were able to do so because they educated alike the brain and hand of the craftsman. We, too, in our turn must show that we understand the law which decrees that a people which loses physical address invariably deteriorates, so that our people shall understand that the good carpenter, the good black - smith, the good mechanic, the good farmer, really do fill the most important positions in our land, and that it is an evil thing for them and for the nation to have their sons and daughters forsake the work which, if well and efficiently performed, means more than any other work for our people ae a whole. One thing that I would like to have you teach your pupils is that whether you call the money gained salary or wages does not make any real difference, and that if by working hard with your hands you get more than if you work with your head only, it does not atone for It to call the smaller amount The term 'dignity of labor' implies that manual labor is as dignified as mental labor, as of course it is. Indeed the highest kind of labor is that which makes demands upon the qualities of both head and hand, of heart, brain and body. Physical prowess, physical address, are necessities; they stand on a level with intellect and only below char- </seg>

We need to have a certain readjustment of values his country, which must primarily come through the efforts of just men and women here, aDd the men and women like you throughout land. No Impossible Ideals. I would not have you preach an impossible ideal; for if you preach an Ideal that is impossible you tend to make your pupils believe that no ideals are possible and, therefore, you tend to do them the worst of wrongs — to teach them to divorce preaching from practice, to divorce the ideal that they in the abstract admire from the practical good after which they strive. "Teach the boy and girl that their business is to earn their own livelihood. Teach the boy that he is to be the homemaker; the girl that she must ultimately be the home - keeper; that the work of the father Is to be the bread winner, and that of the mother the housekeeper; that their work is the most im - portant work by far in all the land; that the work of the statesman, the writer, the captain of industry and all the rest is conditioned first upon the work that finds its expression in the family, that supports the family. So teach the boy that he is expected to earn his own liveli - hood; that it is a shame and a scandal for bim not to be self dependent, not to be able to hold his own in the rough work of actual life; teach the girl that bo far from its being her duty to try to avoid all labor, all effort, it should be a matter of pride to her to be as good a house - wife as her mother was before her. The effort should be made to teach everyone that the first requisite of good citizenship ie doing the duties that are near at hand. But, of course, this does not excuse a man from doing the other duties too. It U no excuse if a man neglects his political duties to say that he is a good husband and father, still less is it an excuse if he is guilty of corruption in politics or business to say that his home life is all right. He ought to add to decency in home life, decency in politics, decency in public life. !So my plea is not that the homely duties are all sufficient, that they are a necessary base upon which to build the super - icture of the higher life. Our children should be trained to do the aely duties in the first place and then in addition to have it in m so to carry themselves that collectively we may well and fitly form the great and responsible tasks of American citizenship.

            <seg id="p324">EIGHT YEARS OF EDUCATIONAL ! 251 fellow citizens: I esteem It a great privilege to have been invited to talk with you for a few moments on a subject which your presence here proves is one of vital and genuine interest to you. It is not necessary for me to attempt to define "the new education" to this audience. That the teachers and students and the citizens of Ham - ilton county have caught the spirit of the new education is proved by the enrollment of over five hundred boys and girls in the corn - growing and sewing contests under the wise direction of your active and conscientious county superintendent, Mr. Stephenson. It is also proved by the enrollment of nearly fifty young men and young women in our great state university, twenty-five of whom have been pursuing courses in agriculture, the largest number from any single county in Nebraska, a record, fellow citizens, of which you have cause to feel proud; and it is proved by the honest effort that all you teachers are making to fit yourselves for the teaching of manual training, agriculture and domestic science in your schools. IIb short we have all come to believe in the education that we use on the farm, in the garden, in the orchard, in the kitchen; an ation that not only disciplines the mind to correct habits of thought, also at the same time helps directly toward the making of a liveli- I, dignifies the labor of the hands, unfolds new beauties in the gery of life and converts the toiler of the farm, the factory and the lehold into a contented, educated, useful citizen. The spirit of this new education was most forcibly presented recently by President Roosevelt in an address before the National Education Association. He said: "I trust that more and more our people will see to it that the schools train toward and not away from the farm and the workshop. We have spoken a great deal about the dignity of labor in this country, but we have not acted up to our spoken words, for in our education we have tended to proceed upon, the assumption that the educated man was to be educated away from and not toward labor. We mu&amp;t show that we understand the law which decrees that a people which loses physical address invariably deteriorates, so that people shall understand that the great carpenter, the good blacksmith, the good mechanic, the good farmer really do fill the most important positions in our land and that it is an evil thing for them and for the nation to have their sons and daughters for - sake the work which, if well and efficiently performed, means more than any other work for our people as a whole." Kin the few minutes which I shall detain you, I want to talk to you t the progress that has already been made in this great state of in the kind of education which President Roosevelt has pointed is most desirable, namely, industrial education. When I was a student in the university ten years ago, less than a half dozen boys were pursuing agricultural studies in a little group of shacks which would never have been taken for the buildings of a state school by a passing stranger and only one boy had the temerity i- </seg>
            <seg id="p325">252 to present himself for graduation that year. iDdeed half the students in the university did not know there was such a thing as a state farm or a school of agriculture. The present year fifty-one sons of Nebraska farmers were graduated from the school of agri - culture and five hundred youDg men and young women were enrolled pursuing the studies which will make better farmers, better home - keepers, better citizens. In place of the little group of shacks which disgraced a beautiful site in 1898 now stand $200,000 worth of mag - nificent buildings; the state has a farm of 320 acres in Lincoln and 1920 acres at North Platte, all used for experimentation in stock - feeding, stock-breeding, dairying, soil culture and the thousand and one things that enter into the life of the farmer. Through farm bulletins and farmers institutes; through the visits of the university's veterinarians to parts of the state infected by diseases of live stock; and more than all, by the establishment of model farms in all parts of the state by graduates of the school of agriculture, the leaven of scientific agriculture is spreading. And while scientific agriculture is teaching the farmer how to raise more and better stock; more and better grain; and to get more and more enjoyment from farm life, farm values are mounting higher and higher. BWhat doea the university cost? The total income of the ?rsity for 1908 was $506,500. Of this amount $332,500 was de- I from legislative appropriation, $75,000 from cash fees from stu - !, while from the federal government from the Morrill, Nelson, h and Adams funds was derived $59,000. ■Prom these various sources the university, since its establishment 369, has gradually built up until today it has a plant including dgs and buildings and endowment lands worth about $3,700,000. Some short-sighted people have criticised this large investment in university property and the large outlay for maintenance. At first glance it does look big. But let us see. In 1907 the value of ten of the leading Nebraska crops alone was over $170,000,000. For the same year the grand assessment roll of the state showed real and personal property worth $1,643,787,896. Compare this with the 0,000 which was the valuation of all the property of the state forty-six years ago. We even sometimes get frightened at our state debt of less than $1,000,000, which by the way is being rapidly wiped out. Why, in 1907 we raised almost enough speltz to pay our state debt, while our corn crop would have paid it seventy-five times and left enough over to pay for our total investment Id our university. No well-informed person in Nebraska will deny that the work done by the university in the matter of the selection of seed corn alone has resulted in raising the average yield throughout the state from one to five bushels per acre. With an acreage of six and one-half millions of corn in the state, an increase of one bushel per acre, at present priceB, would pay for the entire university plant in one year or Drovid° for its maintenance at Dresent cost for six vears. This is only </seg>
            <seg id="p326">EIGHT YEAKS OF EIHVATIOXAL PROGRESS 253 Kof a hundred ways of proving that Nebraska's investment in her ultural school alone, figured simply on the basis of a money invest - ., more than pays for the maintenance of the whole university plant. I Speaking on this subject in a most excellent paper read before Grand Island Commercial Club last winter, Regent Whitmore, one he farmer members of the board said: "It is not too much to say as a direct result of the scientific teaching and experimentation ur university in the last ten years, the profits to the farmers of raska have been enhanced ten times the cost of maintaining all irtments of the university during that time. We consider $3,700, - a fair present value of the university plant. Fellow citizens, when realize that this is a clear asset, without any incumbrance, and ng bigger dividends, of every sort, than any other possible invest - t, realizing that "The riches of the commonwealth ' Are free strong hands and hearts of health, And more to her than gold or grain, The cunning hand and cultured brain, Iy public citizen's heart should swell with pride and gratitude in spite of the paltry $1,000,000 of the state debt — a mere bagatelle pared with her magnificent resources — our people in every see - of the state should agree, that whatever else may come, the cause igher and deeper and broader education shall never languish here want of material aid." An historical review of the subject of agricultural education would be interesting, if there were time, showing how farmers' associ - ations and books and scientific investigation and invention and agri - cultural fairs have interacted on each other to bring about the present state of agriculture; it is interesting to note, for instance, that the exhibits of stock and farm products at fairs which have played so Important a part in the development of scientific agriculture had their beginning back in 1807 when one Elkanah Watson exhibited two Imported merino sheep on the public square in Pittsfleld, Mass. And it is possible better to appreciate the great benefits to mankind of the application of scientific methods to agriculture by comparing present conditions with those of former days. A writer measuring the price of labor in wheat and rye in Italy during the fourteenth century says that laborers boarding themselves could earn a bushel of wheat in two and one-half days and a bushel of rye in a day and a half. Writing on the same subject in 1896 G. K. Holmes of the department of agriculture said: "The amount of human labor now required to produce a bushel of wheat from begin - ning to end is on an average only ten minutes, whereas in 1830 the time was three hours and three minutes. During the interval between these years the cost of the human labor required to produce this bushel of wheat declined from 17% cents to 3 1-3 cents." </seg>
            <seg id="p327">254 KThus bag the new education, bringing science into the life of man - , been working to raise the standards of life of the common man i leveling up process which is giving more and more time for the lopment of the higher qualities in every individual and requiring less less of time in drudgery for the common necessities of life. I want to call your attention briefly to some of the advantages which it seems to me Nebraska has over her sister states in her educa - tional system. We have the most economical system of state university education possible. The university instead of having its colleges scat - tered aa does Iowa and most other states, having separate locations and different equipment and management for its agricultural school, has them all in one location and under the management of one board of regents, where there is no duplication of buildings or equipment or teaching force necessary and where every dollar of expenditure gets the very highest possible educational return. On the other hand is the ■till greater and immeasurable advantage of having the libraries and the courses offered in the classical, philosophical and general scientific departments in reach of those pursuing courses in agriculture or other of the industrial groups of studies. Another blessing that the university has always enjoyed and that I believe it always will enjoy, is the fact that it has been kept out of politics and that its doors have been standing even wider open for the poor boy or poor girl than for the rich. I like the sentiment expressed by our Chancellor at the recent graduating exercises of the school of agriculture. He said: "This university is yours and yours and every citizen's. If you are a republican this university belongs to you, not because you are a republican, but because you are a Nebraskan. If you are a democrat, it is yours, not because you are a democrat but because you are a Nebraskan. So if you are a populist or Iohibitlonist or have no party affllliations whatever. So long as ire a Nebraskan the university is your property. Its privileges are ou, for your children, for your neighbors. It is a sun that shines til. This means with much else that our university is and must er remain the people's school, near and dear to the common heart, ng truth through an unshackled throat, without truckling to the and great on the one hand, or to the mob on the other. It must r become the prey of any clique, class or set. Sooner than see that r I would blow up all our buildings and go to teach in tents or on streets." But, great as has been the progress of agricultural education In this state and elsewhere, the next ten years will see still greater advancement. Already you teachers are being urged to prepare your - selves to teach elementary agriculture and domestic science. Think of It. Young women being compelled to learn how to cook scientifically in order to get a certificate to teach. What a boon to the young men - of the present generation. And what does that mean? Simply that in a very few years, agriculture and domestic science will be taught in </seg>
            <seg id="p328">255 «very graded school and every high school in the country, and Chan - cellor Andrews is bold to predict that there will be from fifteen to flfty agricultural high schools, supported in part possibly from state or government aid, preparing for and leading up to the excellent work In the university school of agriculture. Indeed a start has already been made in that direction. The county high school law enacted by the last legislature was primarily a law providing for agricultural high schools. The law doubtless has some defects, but in a few years when people have had time to investigate its high purposes, that law or a similar one will be the means of bringing the benefits of agricultural education closer home and the names of the Hamilton county men as well as those from other parts of the state who worked for that law will stand high on the educational roll of honor. tin this connection it might be noted that the first Morrill Act, d by congress to extend government aid to industrial education e several states was vetoed by President Buchanan in 1857. But 62 Abraham Lincoln, the farm boy, the rail splitter, signed the bill gave the first great impetus to agricultural education in the d States. I am reminded right here of the recent consolidation of five country school districts in the northeastern part of this county into one large school district. Teachers, watch the development of this school. I hope the directors will be wise enough to provide a site of from five to ten acres. What an excellent beginning it would make for ele - mentary experimental work in agriculture. If the plan of consolidation succeeds in Hordville, as I have no doubt it will, it will be copied in other parts of the county to the great benefit of all the schools. While emphasizing the importance of industrial education, how - we must not get the impression that industrial education alone is the whole thing. As our commercial and industrial life grows more complex, the responsibilities of citizenship grow apace and there is more and more need for the broadest possible education to prepare each individual citizen to meet those responsibilities. While men and women engaged in the industrial pursuits never before received as great returns for a given expenditure of energy, still the just distribution of the wealth earned by the members of our indus - trial society, has never been more menaced by gr.-at combinations of capital and of labor; and consequently we are today confronted with grave problems of government the solution of which will require the bravest action of the best educated minds and the most patriotic hearts. To solve these questions, young men must be trained not only in their chosen line of industry, but they must study history and political science in order to bring lessons from the past to help them settle the problems of the present and the future. It will do a farming community little good for instance, to in - crease Its wealth by the application of science to the methods of pro - duction, if it is to sit idly down and permit those profits to slip away </seg>
            <seg id="p329">256 Kicessive transportation charges and other forms of tribute to -watered trusts. That all these questions will be solved and that society will move constantly forward to higher planes of living our excellent and progressive system of state education is an absolute guarantee. And the same honest clean educated men and women of the farms will be the chief factor in solving these questions as they have been in the past. Oar common schools, under your guidance, must continue to be the cradle of our common democracy, the bulwark of our free institutions. And the best thought that I can leave with you as teachers to help you carry out your mission, is to hold up as your ideal, the thought so beautifully expressed a few days ago by Secretary Taft in a public address: "The best of all is the pure joy of service. To do things that are worth while; to be in the thick of it; that is to live." Educative 'Values of Subjects for Instruction in Agriculture Professor A. E. Davisson, Principal School of Agriculture, University of Nebraska. tit would seem that Agricultural Education has found an abiding in the Schools and Colleges of America as well as in those of ■ countries. If its hold on the people is to remain firm and secure, ist have to the subjects of instruction vaiues beyond those that are ly material for no education can expect to have a permanent which does not offer, along with vocational training, a training is truly educative. Hence an inquiry into the- educative values e subjects considered in agricultural education is relevant. When agricultural education was first attempted in America, there was an absence both of teachers properly trained and of subject matter for instruction. With the advance of years, through the work of Experiment Stations, the subject matter of instruction has become not only ample but exceedingly abundant. Not so easily has the first difficulty been overcome. The training of teachers for agricultural education was for a number of years wholly in the hands of so-called agricultural colleges. The faculties of these colleges were usually composed of their own graduates or graduates of similar institutions of the same low grade as were the mother colleges. Hence, professors in Agriculture possessing only training of a limited sort were unable to Me anything in the subject except that which was related to Agricul - ture as a vocation. The result was inevitable. Men in other lines of educational work, men of broad and exact scholarship, looked upon agricultural education as merely vocational and therefore not entitled to stand upon the same plane as did the training given to those who pursued the branches of the so-called polite learning or the purely professional subjects. On the other hand many of the graduates sent out by agricultural colleges were highly successful in their chosen field of work. The members of agricultural college faculties grew into the habit of saying "We are educatine men for life. Our men </seg>
            <seg id="p330">EIGHT YEARS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 257 can go out prepared to do work in agriculture that is of extraordinary benefit to our country and therefore can command higher salaries than those who are educated in the so-called liberal institutions of learning." It cannot be denied that such utterances contained a large amount of truth because the ability to command a large salary is counted as one of the essential attributes of a successful man, if not the most essential. This argument on the part of those engaged in teaching agricultural subjects had great weight with the public. Thus it came to pass that the educational world was divided into two hostile camps, one crying "Agricultural education is the best because it is the most practical," and the other shouting back, "Your training is of the low grade because It is merely vocational, teaching men only how to make money without any regard for the spiritual values of life." In fact, it may be said that today comparatively f=w men engaged in the work of agricultural education appreciate their subject other than as one which is able to return to the recipient of its Instruction material values only. If this notion of agricultural education were in the end to prevail, Schools of Agriculture and Agricultural Colleges would be nothing but trade schools and should stand on the same plane as those schools which teach nothing except that which bears a direct relation to gaining a livelihood. Colleges offering training in the branches of the so called "polite learning" and in professional branches, however, have not beer tirely broad-minded in their criticisms of Schools and Colleges of Agriculture. It is quite possible that while polite learning is in valuable, both as a preparation for gaining a livelihood and for right living, too little attention has been paid by the institutions last named to the instruction of a kind that will contribute to the strength and efficiency of man not only as an intellectual and emotional b ; ing. but also as a moral being. The reader will understand that when man is spoken of as a moral being much more is meant than the term "moral" usually signifies. "Moral being" is applied to man in the sense of one who not only orders his life in accordance with the Christian prin - builded so deep, so broad, and so strong, that he is able to go forth among his fellows and gain a livelihood such that he can support his family in comfort and can successfully meet all the responsibilities with which men are confronted when waging the battles of life. So moral instruction of the kind to render its recipients able to have that will quality which enables one to work with the utmost energy and efficiency should characterize the training that is given by all branches of learning whether they belong to Colleges of Liberal Arts, Colleges of Science, Schools of Engineering, Professional Schools, or Colleges of Agriculture. Ks it not therefore the duty of the Colleges of Liberal Arts, and all ther schools except the last named in the preceding sentence, to re whether, along with the knowledge they impart, they have not measure failed to give right emotional values and right moral Should they not search themselves for an answer to this ques- </seg>
            <seg id="p331">258 tion, "Are the branches of learning taught by us sufficiently practical to enable our students to meet the responsibilities of life?" The duty of Schools and Colleges of Agriculture is just as plain. They must ask themselves the questions: "Is our work of merely vocational value?" "'Are we careful to give that sort of instruction that will make of those who receive it men of refined feelings, men of refined tastes, men whose moral force shall result not only in the winning of material things but also in elevating the tone of their own individual lives as well as that of the lives of men and women in their community?" It is the belief of the writer that Schools and Colleges of Agri - culture are becoming cognizant of their obligation to give, along with the material values that will enable the students to maintain and add to the fertility of the soil, to produce better crops making greater yields per acre, to produce live stock that will yield larger material rewards, to handle dairy herds in such a way as to cause the one who owns them to become rich in this world's goods, the spiritual values earned in the preceding paragraph. These truly educative values, if given, will entitle agricultural education to stand eide by side with the training along lines which for hundred of years have by the common consent of mankind been thought important. The result must inevitably be the assent of the educational world to the right of agricultural education to make this claim and to say, "Our education is not merely vocational but truly educative and will contribute in our field as much to giving men the ability to lead right lives as does yours in the field which belongs by common consent to you." In other words, the writer hopes to be able to show that the subjects for training in agricultural education have truly educative values; that therefore Schools and Colleges of Agriculture are not mere trade schools but schools complying with all the laws laid down for thos? institutions whose training is truly educational and which results not only in better preparation for the work of life but also better preparation for right living. To educate means to draw out. Therefore any subject is truly «"1ucative which develops the powers of the person to be educated. Hence, it is necessary to ask, "What are the powers possessed by ■every normal individual and then to propose the question whether the subjects for agricultural instruction have a tendency to develop these powers. All normal human beings have power to get knowledge through the senses. These are by common consent called the perceptive punufg. Hence the acquisition of facts or experience is thought of as being the first step in education. If men had merely the power to perceive facts but not to recall them the process would be of little account for mental life would then be merely a procession of things passing through the soul and vanishing as the "unsubstantial fabric of a dream." Thus, it is important to develop the memory in order that facts gained through the perceptive powers may be recalled. He who bas In mind the educative process sees that these facts must be recalled </seg>
            <seg id="p332">EIGHT YEARS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 259 If the person in training is to use them for the purpose of forming judgments, making inferences, and finally rising to the intricate process of inductive and deductive reasoning. Through the formation of judgments, the making of inferences, and engaging in inductive and deductive reasoning, men acquire the ability to form what is sometimes thought the highest mental product of the human mind — the concept. Certain it is that no scientific work can be entered on until men have acquired the habit of forming concepts for this leads both to definition and to classification, the power to do which is essential for all scientific work. There comes then to every person thus trained the power to form ideals by which is meant perfect types in both the natural and the scientific world. However, no one can do this except him who has had developed the constructive imagination but having developed this, he can form for himself a type of whatever he proposes to accomplish, whether it be to design a machine, to carve a statue, paint a picture, produce a perfeot corn, wheat, or oat plant, or any other plant which Nature in her wisdom and richness brings into existence. (One must not assume, however, that this is all the work of edu - n. There remains the work to be done with the emotions and the With the emotions, of course, the educational work is, in the place, the getting of right feelings on the part of the student — it la less to name these;in the second place, to lead the student to have taste not alone in a few things, but in all things. This, of le, implies as the result of an education an elementary knowledge esthetics. The crowning work is to seek to form in the person Kited to the educational process such habits of will as shall be itial to success in life. Here It may be well to specify. (1) The will should be so trained that persistence in right courses of thought and action shall become a habit. (2) That ability for a long effort in consecutive work be acquire!. ■ (3) That reach of moral purpose shall characterize the mind of person whose education is sought. It is safe to assert that more people are today suffering from &amp; lack of the three things named above than from any other one thing in the world. The last educative result cannot be called a training of any one power of the mind but a result of their all having been trained. In general this result may be defined as those qualities of a man or a woman which enable him or her to assume the right relations to other men and other women. These relations are as foilows: 1. Relations which every one must have to individuals. 2. Relations which every one must sustain to his own community. 3. Relations which every one must have to the state and to thp Nation. "» Clearly then, the next point to be discussed is, "What are the •subjects of agricultural instruction?" and "Does one who gets a thorough knowledge of these subjects have an opportunity to develop all of the powers named in the preceding paragraphs?" </seg>
            <seg id="p333">260 The subjects for purely agricultural instruction are: Animal Husbandry, including Types and Breeds of Live Stock; the Principle* of Feeding Live Stock and the Principles of Breeding Live Stock; Field Crops and Soils, known under the general name "Agronomy;" Dairy Husbandry; Horticulture; the Anatomy, Physiology and Pathol - ogy of Farm Animals; Farm Mechanics; Agricultural Botany; Agri - cultural Chemistry; Agricultural Economics; Rural Architecture; Agri - cultural Engineering. There are other subjects upon which a knowledge of the foregoing subjects depend and these also must be included in agricultural educa - tion: Physics, General and Phy&amp;iological Chemistry, Mathematics, Land - scape Gardening, a knowledge of French and German, Animal Nutrition, Political Economy, Bacteriology — especially the bacteriology of milk •nd its products and the bacteriology of soils — English, English Lit - erature, together with History and Political Science. The student of agricultural education can graduate without having studied these subjects but upon a knowledge of them will depend his efficiency to a great extent and hence such a knowledge is essential. Kit will easily be seen that agricultural education is, therefore, not a : standing by itself but that, in order to obtain a full mastery of its fullness, there must be included other subjects concerning whose itive value there can be no doubt. Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of Animal Husbandry will not question its educative value. The men from whose keen observations, high powers to compare and to contrast, whose intellectual keenness in the matter of making inferences and forming judgments, together with the inductive and deductive reasoning they practiced in bringijg the present types and breeds of live stock up to the high degree of excellence that characterizes them, ceTtainly attained to a high degree of education even though they did not have the advantages of schools. These same men practically worked out the principles of feeding live stock by the intellectual process mentioned in the preceding sentence. The principles of breeding live stock rest upon a knowledge of the laws of heredity. It is true that many of the men, who had much to do with bringing the present types of live stock into existence, used empirical methods. The fact that they accom - plished as much as has been accomplished by such methods makes us astounded when we behold the results. If these men could have had a knowledge of the laws of heredity, such as is possessed by the fore - most men in agricultural education today, their work would have been still more wonderful. t Turning to the subjects of Field Crops and Soils, one may again low keen and how accurate the students of these subjects must ne in the observation of facts; how careful must be the infer - i they make; with what care must all their judgments be ed; and how much work must be put upon inductive deductive reasoning in order to produce the perfect </seg>

The world has in recent years been amazed at the results obtained by Burbank. These results have come from the accumulation of facts by means of per - sistent and accurate observations until today the store of such facts is piled mountain high. They have been obtained by the breeder going through the processes of inductive and deductive reasoning as intricate as any process in mathematics. They have come because he has been able by means of these processes to get before his mind's eye type after type each requiring as great an exercise of the constructive imagination such as is required on the part of an inventor of a machine such as the Corliss Engine, or by the architect of some noble building which is to be the admiration and delight of the world for hundreds of years. Horticultural is all this and more. For, dealing with the plants over which horticulture holds sway, the student mind is led quite markedly into the dominion of aesthetics. When one gets into his consciousness the possibilities for beauty in flow&gt; and ornamental shrubs; when he considers what can be done in the arrangement of grounds about his buildings so as to make them more beautiful, there opens to him a realm of thought which holds him because of the many fascinating features which it possesses. A few years ago the University of Nebraska School of Agriculture sent out a young boy of eighteen over whom Horticulture had thrown its allurements and all the fascination of its influence. No one in school felt that he was a remarkable boy and yet, because of the mental awakening given him by the subject named, he has grown to a stature intellectually, emotionally, and volitionally, such as is rarely attained by young men. In the state of California he is a landscape gardener whose services are sought far and wide. His name will in a few years become known to all horticulturists in the state. Finan - cially he has had almost unmeasured success and as a man is credited with refined tastes. Ah a worker in his chosen field, he has no superior. The farmer boy who gets a knowledge of Horticulture in all of its ramifications becomes a missionary of beauty in his own community. Emphatically it must be said that Horticulture possesses educative values which every year become richer and more profoundly influence the lives of men and women. </seg>
            <seg id="p337">262 tNo discussion is needed to establish the claim of the Anatomy, iology, and Pathology of Farm Animals, of Agricultural Botany, p-icultural Chemistry, to possess educative values. It is patent to one that these are scientific subjects of a high order and that all ti has been said concerning educative values in other subjects of ultural instruction is just as true of the three last named. Farm Mechanics and Agricultural Engineering are subjects rather Dew in the Agricultural College curriculum. It may be well to speak of them in detail. Farm Mechanics is that subject of instruction which, in the first place, acquaints the student with the use of tools necessary for doing wood work; in the second place, with the tools necessary in iron work. It then proceeds to give instruction in various kinds of wood work and iron work for the purpose of enabling the student, when he assumes the active management of the farm to do the ordinary repair work. Therefore, it not only trains the hand and the eye but also gives dexterity in the manipulation of tools and the ability to plan and to construct in wood work and iron work so necessary on the ordinary farm. This ability having been given, the student finds great pleasure in using his powers and therefore begins to plan structures upon which his powers can be exercised. This naturally leads him to consider the problem of farm houses, barns, and other buildings. He* desires to get an elementary knowledge of rural archi - tecture and, though the last named subject is not in the curriculum of many Agricultural Schools and Colleges, it will soon find a place. No one can for a moment deny that all this knowledge which Farm Mechanics now gives with the additional knowledge of Farm Machinery is of truly educative value, for nothing is more needed In our country tbu a knowledge of the care and adjustment of Farm Machinery and of the principles which should guide one in selecting machinery as well as just how much work this machinery shall accomplish. Rural Architecture", not yet introduced into the curriculum of many Agricultural Schools and Colleges, will, when mastered by students, revolutionize farm life. The old ramshakle houses will disappear — in their places will come houses with modern conveniences, and built on high sightly ground so that their occupants may enjoy the best of health; barns where animals Uv« in filth will disappear —there will come modern barns, barns that can be kept as clean as a lady's parlor, barns that are so well built that the strongest blasts which old Boreas hurls upon them will have as little effect as the wind blowing against the rocky aides of the towering mountain. Other buildings will be planned with a view to giving not only comfort to the animals but beauty to the firmste*d. Agricultural Engineering will give such knowledge that, instead of being the exception, houses piped for water. as in the city residence, and lighted by acetylene gas or electric lights will become common. farm home will have a water plant and a sewage system. Thin can but result In there being greater beauty in the country, greater </seg>
            <seg id="p338">263 comfort, and therefore, better work. It can be asserted without any fear of successful contradiction that the subjects of instruction in Agriculture are truly educative; that they do require on the part of those who would master them observations of a wide range and exceed - ingly accurate; that they do cause inferences, inductive and deductive reasoning to be gone through with if the student shall actually obtain a mastery in the agricultural education; that there is developed to a high degree of excellency the constructive imagination; that there is an abundance of opportunities for the development of the finer feelings and for an appreciation of the beautiful everywhere. When it comes to a discussion of the will culture given to the student seeking an education in agriculture, it may be said that in no other sort of education is the will given in a higher degree those qualities desirable in the ideal man. The student in agriculture must work persistently; he must continue his efforts through long periods of time; he must come to possess that will fiber that will enable him to continue his labors until right results shall appear. K Hence it will be seen that the students of agriculture go forth iped to grapple with the responsibilities of life as the giants of rappled with the things that disputed their supremacy. I The country boy is often spoken of having greater possibilities development in him than the city boy. The fact cannot be dis - &gt;d. It is due to the country boy's having to bear responsibilities in age when other boys have nothing to do but play. He gets the habit of work and because of this when he enters upon life he juipped with an indomitable will that never lets go until something been accomplished. I The writer feels that the subjects for agricultural instruction a highly educative value and will enable those who obtain ap ultural education not only to reap material rewards as a result of ig gone to school but to have those high qualities which cause to be a blessing to all with whom they have relations — not only ndividuals with whom they associate but the community in which live. t There is this, however, that agricultural education must care - guard against. It must affirm the absolute necessity of its snts becoming acquainted with the liberal branches of learning. To - ne is literature more necessary than students in agricultural les; to no one does history bring greater values; no one has er need of a knowledge of political economy and political science. Finally then It may be said that agricultural education Id the past has been narrow in its view of life and as to what shall be accom - plished in the minds of agricultural students. It is now coming to appreciate the value of polite learning and, as a result of adding this to its courses, feels that rural communities living in tasteful, well built, and convenient houses, having about the farmstead trees, flowers and ornamental shrubs, with grounds adorned with beautiful </seg>
            <seg id="p339">264 t abundant grasses, may be confidently looked for. Rural life become richer. People of rural communities will recognize their ations to take part in all great movements which are today found ciety; will come to know that in order to live successfully there come greater intelligence, greater refinement of feelings, and er Interest In the life of the state and of the Nation. Agricultural education with the branches of polite learning which it feels like making a part of itself will do much to accomplish this. Culture will! be found in the rural communites in as great a measure as it is in the cities. When this happens, the country and the city will no longer scowl at each other but will unite in the great movements which the centuries have seen and which in this century have been strongly accentuated for the emancipation of mankind, for the attain - ment of that sort of freedom had in mind by the poet when he said: "Buili thee more stately mansions, O my soul! As the swift seasons roll Leave thy low vaulted past Let each new temple, nobler than the last Shut thee from Heaven with a dome more vast Until thou, at length, art free Leaving thine outgrown shell by Life's unresting sea." (Agricultural Education. Professor William R. Hart of Massaschusetts Agricultural College, Amherst, Massachusetts, formerly professor of psychology and pedagogy at the Peru, Nebraska, State Normal School. (An address delivered at the Twenty-Seventh Annual Session, Farmers' National Congress, Oklahoma, 1907.) Function of Scientific Knowledge. President Hoard of this Congress in his address at Ft. Worth, Tex., 1898, raised these questions: "What can we do to help emancipate this great business of farming from the lack of comprehension? What can we do to get the farmers of this continent to see the necessity of more intellect on the farms? How can we contribute as a force to help in the emancipation of the farm from the wasteful effects of igno - rance, and help put in its place the energizing and enriching influences of knowledge? In other words what can we do to promote wise legis - lation to this end? What can we do to arouse public opinion and the great educational forces of the country to the importance of teach - ing the elements of agriculture in the primary schools of the land?" B'Our present system of agricultural education is an image with a of brass, a body of iron, and feet of clay." (He might have said stem more nearly resembles an image with a head and body but g neither legs nor feet.) "Our common schools recruit the academy, the college and the university, and they in turn recruit every profession but farming. </seg>
            <seg id="p340">265 them to do so. Nearly every European country is putting forth strenuous efforts to stay this tendency by teaching the elements of scientific agriculture in common schools. It can be done as easily as the teaching of the elements of scientific arithmetic, or chemistry or philosophy. A great host of farmers who were deprived of such teaching now find themselves barred from an understanding of much agricultural literature. As a consequence they turn away from the agricultural college, the experiment station bulletin, and the farm paper, that is really worth anything to them. "Had these men been taught in the common schools the meaning of the terms used in agricultural chemistry, something of the principles of animal husbandry, something of the principles that underlie the preservation of fertility, they would be today in much more harmonious relation with all that constitutes agricultural progress. May we not hope that this Congress will create a sentiment that will greatly help along this needed educational reform." In the foregoing language President Hoard was giving voice to a feeling that has been vibrating in the hearts of a few men for at ■ hundred years of our country's history. It is the far call of a seer who has faith that sometime, somehow his cry will be heard and heeded. It is a summarized utterance of the pent up message of a burdened soul. It grows in significance when we reflect how feeble an impression it must have made upon the public ear, uttered as it was when the national mind was still absorbed in the exultant huzzas amid the receding •echoes of the clash of arms that closed a successful war. Growing dizzy with the thought of territorial aggrandizement, elated with the prospect of commercial expansion, flushed with the consciousness of being recognized as a peer of the proudest among the family of nations we were in no mind to listen to the voice of this apostle of the common schols, this prophet with his vision fixed on better things for rural life. It fell as a mere whisper in the surrounding din. These facts deepen the significance of President Hoard's utterance because of the parallelism between it and another event which took place just thirty-six years before. Abraham Lincoln surrounded by the clash of fratricidal arms, turned aside from his warlike duties and signed the greatest educational act in all our history — the bill establish - ing what are known as Land-grant colleges. The great emancipation proclamation unshackled the bodies of four millions of slaves. The Morrill act laid the foundation for freeing the minds of many more millions of farmers. It made possible the supplanting of tradition by reason, of haphazard by systematic work, of wasteful by economic methods. It stands as a national protest against the teaching of the mere symbols and formulas of knowledge. It is an attempt to turn at least a part of our educational effort towards the things in science that really make for all that we think of when trying to portray our civil - ization. Our clothing, our habitations, our means of sustenance, with their appropriate embellishments occupy a larger place in our attention </seg>
            <seg id="p341">266 when thinking of civilization than does culture of the mind merely. We refuse to recognize a high order of civilization clothed in rags, subsisting, by the chase, and -dwelling in huts or caves. It was this which led Herbert Spencer more than fifty years ago to bring against the English schools of his time the severest indictment that can be directed toward any educational system in any land. Mr. Spencer said: "The increas - ing acquaintance with the laws of phenomena which has through successive ages enabled us to subjugate Nature to our needs, and Id these days gives the common laborer comforts which a few centuries ago kings could not purchase, is scarcely in any degree owed to the appointed means of instructing our youth. The vital knowledge — that by which we have grown as a nation to what we are, and which now underlies our whole existence, is a knowledge that has got itself taught in Dooks and corners; while the ordained agencies for teaching have been mumbling little els? than dead formulas." Both these men were Imbued with the thought that the education which makes for the mastery of nature must also make for the betterment of man. Origin and Function of Schools. I would call your attention to one other significant factor in President Hoard's questions. He is in no sort of doubt as to the correctness of his diagnosis of the case. Farming is an intellectual as well as a manual pursuit. Ignorance stands as a bar to the farmer's progress, hence educate. He not only sees what the trouble is but has an abiding faith in the remedy proposed. And, as he looked back »t the organized agency for doing the work of education, the common school — and perceived how imperfectly it had fulfilled its function he exclaimed not without a note of despair iir his tone. "May we not hope that this Congress will create a sentiment that will help along this needed educational reform." He may not have known that the schools and many of the leaders in educational practice are always behind the times. Schoolmasters too, are usually a cautious crowd. Like other interests with fixed capital they are not the first to see the advantages of innovation. When they are asked, on a sudden, to supply a new brand of education it is much easier for them to argue that the old is better than the new, than to admit that they have none of the new on hand. But they will order some if you insist. Educationally as well as commercially you may have what you want if you will insist on it. When you wanted the three "R's" that is what you got. When you asked for more you got more even while you waited, if you waited long enough. Agricultural education may be had for the asking. It may not be of a very high order. But a good first class article is headed your way now. It may not reach your community, however, till too late to be of any service to you. A crudely organized form of society existed long before anything like an organized scheme of education was thought of. They educated, of course, but by means of the family and occupational life and not by wans of an institutionalized organism like the school. Furthermore </seg>
            <seg id="p342">EIGHT YEARS OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 267 we can account for the birth and growth of such an institution as a school as occurring only after and in response to severely felt needs, added to a clear recognition of the inadequacy of the home and occupational activities to fit the childhood life in their midst to take a worthy place in the adult life of the community. The more things a race knows and the greater number of things a race can do, the more strenuous must be the life of the child while becoming a mature unit fit for the adult life in which he must serve. When the history of the race was murmured by the mother over the child in the cradle, or related by old men at the fireside, or sung by the bards at tribal feasts, there was no worry about "readin' and writin." ' History •existed long before books were invented. Stories and songs are as old as human speech but literature is only a few thousand years old at most. As long as speech was iientical with story and song the home was quite equal to the task of putting the child in possession of the means of human intercourse. But when language became written the home was not able to instruct in the two forms of communication and the teacher was born to assume the added burden. The teacher, mind you, not the school, came first. It is conceiv - able that teaching in a haphazard, desultory, wasteful way could have existed many years before the organization ot a school as we understand the term. It is enough to say that when the need for the school was felt it came in response to that feeling. Can you think of an institution coming into existence and persisting among men on any other basis? Can you think of such an institution as doing anything in the beginning other than that for which it was created? Whatever the function of sohools may be today it seems reasonably clear both in the light of history and of reason that their early duty resided in the three R's. These are still the center of gravity around which all primary school work still revolves. They became such because In this way the school could render its best service. Following the three R's In due order have come all the isms, ologies, onomies, and osophies, making an array of things known and unknown appalling in their infinitude. Introduction of Agriculture, Agriculture is the last arrival seeking admission into the schools of the people. In what light is the appal of this new comer to be viewed? By what standards shall we interpret the cry of this new born demand? Is it the iridescent dream of the rhapsodist who can never see things in true proportion on account of the glimmer in his own heated imag - ination? Is it the blustering rant of the iconoclast who is willing to upset all that has been established because, forsooth, he had no part in laying the original foundation? Is it the siren song of the innovator and fadist eager to pose in the limelight of a transcient meteor, unable otherwise to become conspicuous among his fellows? Is it the whine of the sycophant who hopes to delude us to his own profit before the fraud Is detected? Is it the roar of jealousy in a pet because of a discovery 19 </seg>
            <seg id="p343">268 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT of some Injury growing out of inequality of opportunity? Or, finally. In your opinion, is it not the lusty shout of a young Hercules threaten - ing the very pillars of society if his voioe is not heeded, or, possibly, the subdued tones of a neglected Cinderella modest enough to stand and wait until others have been satisfied, and self-sufficient enough to serve for a hundred years without a word of complaint? It is a far cry from the Harvard of 1637 founded that an intelligent race of ministers of the Gospel might not become extinct, to the Harvard of 1907 opening its doors to students of agriculture. Whatever standard you adopt, whatever measure you use In giving meaning to this dream of a widespread teaching of agriculture, you must be able to see in this movement an effort by means of education to make one's own business more profitable, rather than to learn how to nto some other seemingly more profitable business. This, by the way, is no sordid aim, for the knowledge which renders your business more profitable renders you at the same time a more efficient member of the community. You must also be able to see that agriculture like other great human vocation has its educational side. With these two principles in mind you can say to your schoolmasters when they reply to your request to take up this topic, "The schools have no time for more." to say to them, "We ask not something more, but something better." For, mark you, the schoolmasters as a body will be the last to assent to make the needed changes. They are not to be blamed for this attitude, however, because what is in the school bears the stamp of their approval and to reject any part of it would be a sort of self impeachment for having given place for it in the first instance. These considerations may enable you to cay further to your school - masters: If you cannot make room for agriculture by displacing something else can you not at least make some of the work you now do, face the farms rather than the cities? Can you not draw some of your materials for arithmetic from the products of the garden, the Held and the herd as well as from the store, the bank, or the factory? Can you not make bookkeeping as a record of transactions on the farm fully as educational as to make it a record of mercantile trans - actions? Is it not possible to make language Ussons more nearly descriptive of what the children see and do in their dally lives writing up the episodes of vacation with less of the bookish work now done in the name of language? Will not an outline of the farm boundaries with the proper location of the buildings, roadways, gardens, orchards, pastures, meadows, grain fields, and groves, afford ample materials for elementary work in both drawing and geography? Is there not fully as much botar.y in rag-weeds and dog fennel as in ferns and m oaten, in corn and cabbage as in sea weeds and pond scum? Is there not some zoology in a brood of chickens as well as in the minute animals found in stagnant water? Is there not something about the winds, the rain, the heat, the cold, the light, the dark — this all pervading persistent outsideness against which every living creature must fight </seg>
            <seg id="p344">EIGHT YEARS OP EDUCATIONAL PROGRESS 269 P which no creature could live — quite as worthy of consid - he motions of the stars, or perchance the movements of ny in Gaul? Is not the chemistry of soil improvement farmward fully as educational as the chemistry of soap t which looks factory ward? These questions might be extended indefinitely. They are sug - gestive of the line of attack that agriculture can make in order to ►■cognition on the schools as now organized. If the educational range-finder can be so adjusted as to bring the farms, the country homes, and in fact the whole of rural life into the view of the sciences already well established in the school, a great stride will have been taken in the direction of a higher ideal for country life, a more efficient service by that greatest pride of all our people, the common schools, and result in a more perfect interpretation of the land-grant and experiment station acts which were designed by their framers to bring all useful knowledge of the arts and sciences within reach of all the people. Furthermore it will pave the way and make easy the return to the country of the coming generations when the exodus from the city begins. The eye of prophecy even now begins to see the dissatisfied denizen of the city turn towards the country to ne the simple life which was abandoned by his ancestors. It is yours and mine as interpreters of our own times as readers of the signs, to prepare the way so that he may not return ignorant of what rural life has in store. It is ours to conserve what we find in the land and pass It to the next generation better fitted to sustain life more abundantly. The greatest crime of industry in any line is to so deplete a generous land that the second or third generation of its occupants is driven to other fields for sustenance. Course of Study. The foregoing questions open the way for a discussion of the school program or course of study reorganized with a view of giving due consideration to the art and science of agriculture. In the minds of a large and rapidly increasing number of people the desirability of putting agricultural, instruction into the common schools needs no further discussion. Its educational value as a study, and its useful - new as an art with its accompanying sciences, furnish plenty of reasons for giving agriculture a prominent place in the course of study. A detailed statement of just what should be done in each year from the first primary to the closing year of the university would hardly be in place at this point. But a few general considerations giving the main features of the kind of work that may be done during groups of years rather than during individual years may be advanced with some profit. KThe man who formulates a course of study must keep in mind important principles. One relates to the stage of advancement te pupils and the sort of mental activity natural to children in ■ent stages of mental growth. It is an axiom as old as Aristotle </seg>
            <seg id="p345">270 that curiosity is the seed bed of mental growth. The form of this curiosity, however, changes from time to time as well as the things about which the mind is curious. These changes may be indicated roughly by the mind's own questions. The tireless and continuous "what is it" on the part of the four or five year-old boy and his per - fect satisfaction after finding out what "it is" shows clearly the mental attitude of the child towards the things of the world. Before the desire to know the names of things dies out, the desire to know what things will do and "how they are made" is beginning to flit the mind. This form of curiosity is soon followed by the desire to know the causes of things as well as the reasons why things behave - as they do. This leads the mind to seek relations among the things known in order to find harmony, purpose and a meaning for the things of the world about us. Thus have we in recent years allowed the children themselves to give us the cue not only to methods of arranging matter to be learned but to methods of learning. And the questions "what is it?" "what will it do?" "what is its cause and relation?" in company with "what is its worth?" are the factors of one of the guiding principles in formulating a course of study. The other prin - ciple relates to the selection and arrangement of the matter to be put into a course of study. Elementary- I Turning to the four main sources of supply, namely, the earth, air, the plants, and the animals, we find no trouble in arrang - a series of lessons running through five or six of the first s of school life. Some of this knowledge the child brings to si with him. It is a very natural function of the school to enlarge sope and make it more definite. This phase of the work has been % on for some years under the name of Nature Study. KA study of nature has been in the schools from time immemorial, bat the term Nature Study does not mean so much the adding sw things as it means a new way of learning some old things — Itural first-hand way as opposed to an artificial, second-hand, or , way. None of us can remember when our geographies didn't Lin description of islands, capes, plains, hills and streams, of J5, of animals, and of mineral. Neither can many of us remember being directed to learn about any of these things with our own our own ears, our own hands. Our school readers have always lined stories of nature's wonders, and poems descriptive of her ties; but it has been reserved to this and the coming generations achers to guide young minds into the discovery of nature's wonders to attune young souls to the enjoyment of her beauties. In the foregoing observations I have had in mind the primary and intermediate grades or what approximates the classes below the seventh grade in most schools. The only moral to be injected at this point is, Don't put a textbook on nature study or elementary agriculture </seg>
            <seg id="p346"/>
            <seg id="p347"/>
            <seg id="p348">271 with the earth, the air and sky by watching the changes in temper - ature and passing storms, the plant world by going to the garden and cultivated field, the animal world by going to the pastures, the poultry yard and the road side. Add to the pupil's fund of knowledge by natural rather than by artificial means, massively rather than sys - tematically Grammar Grades. In the seventh, eighth and ninth grades the study of nature may be turned directly into the study of agriculture, but agriculture in which there is practice in the art of doing things with the soil and plants and animals. Most all practical work of an illustrative sort like potted plants and window boxes for the earlier years should be done by or under the close direction of the teacher. The outdoor or school garden Id these grammar school years being done by the pupils furnishes the avenue for the exercise of physical strength, the assump - tion of individual responsibility and arouses a utilitarian motive, along with rapidly growing hunger for proprietorship. Wherever this work has been introduced it always reveals a surplus energy which over - flows in the form of home gardens. These become both ornamental and useful. In towns and cities these home gardens stimulate the dormant civic pride and the municipality finds its alleys, streets and parks more comely. This work with plants must be supplemented by the care of chickens, pigeons or other forms of domestic life. The domestication of animals was the greatest stride humanity has ever taken in the study of nature. This conquest over animals along with the domestication of certain plants is the base upon which man has raised the whole superstructure we call civilization. We seem to forget this when passing game laws giving freedom to kill. Why not give rewards to preserve, rather? The boy who can show the largest number of tame quails or prairie chickens is entitled to infinitely higher consideration than the sportsman who can exhibit the greatest number of dead ones after a day's hunt. In those ancient days when man lived largely by the chase it was cus - tomary to require of the lusty youth seeking a place by the council fires among the elders of the, tribe, to go to the haunts of the wild beast and bring in single handed and alone some trophy of the chase like a deer, a bear, or wild boar. This was his examination; and his certificate of fitness to take a place among men was written in the scars of the conflict upon the skin of his own body rather than upon the skin of a sheep. Furthermore, the domestication of so many animals and plants was done in those prehistoric times when the race was young and full of abounding energy characteristic of youth. The well grown boy whose development has been normal feels the throbbing lust of power and longs to taste the sweets of a glorious conquest. And the young Alexander subduing Bucephalus 1s quite as civilizing to a modern youth as is Leonidas holding the pass or Horatius guarding; </seg>
            <seg id="p349">272 II am led by these considerations among others to observe that horse and other domestic animals have in them that which is to contribute to the mental and normal development of the individ - aoy to the same if not to a greater degree than these same animals ! contributed to the development of the race. Can you see no ection between cows and good morals when the milkmen are idden to swear in the dairy barn on the penalty of their jobs? lack of horse sense so much complained of may be in great part to a lack of proper association with good horses at the proper time High School- During the tenth, eleventh and twelfth years of the high school some real scientific study of agriculture may be undertaken with profit. The mind has reached a plane of thinking wherein it desires to seek causes of events and the reasons for doing things. Relations between different groups of knowledge become better defined and the mass of knowledge gathered in earlier years takes more orderly arrangement in the mind and the student is not studying agriculture as a whole so much as he is studying the individual sciences which go to make up agri- The kind of thinking done at this time as compared with that done at lower stages may be illustrated by a few examples. Sup - pose a Babcock milk tester to be introduced as an object of study in the primary grades, intermediate grades, grammar grades, and high school grades respectively, what would be the mental attitude in the successive stages? As a primary pupil the mind would be largely satisfied by learning its name and seeing it turn around. As an intermediate pupil the mind would be occupied with how it is made and what it will do to the milk. As a grammar grade pupil the mind will be centered more fully upon what it will do to the milk and the economic value of such a performance. In all three of these the knowledge is immediate, specific and related to the individual personally. As a high school pupil the mind will turn from the machine itself to a study of why the milk behaves as it does under the influence of the machine. An inquiry into the laws of motion, of specific gravity, the molecular constitution of matter, the effect of motion on mixtures of different densities. All this and more will engage his thought before answering the simple question, why does the cream go to the top of the tube. This sort of thinking is abstract, non-personal, and relates to the milk tester only in an incidental way as an example of the application of what he sooner or later recognizes as a principle in physics. This is science. Again, present a stalk of corn to each of these four grades of pupils, and it stirs in each a group of thoughts resembling in kind the thoughts set going by the milk tester. The answer of the high school pupil as to how it grows will seek more fullness from the chemistry of fertilizers, the physics of osmosis, respiration, and cir - culation. In short his answer so far as it goes is a statement of some law in physiology. This is also science. </seg>
            <seg id="p350">273 Before the end of the high school course, the grand divisions of agricultural science should be seen as being mutually related to each other: for example, the soil with its problems some of which he is as yet unable to even attack, much less to solve; the realm of plants and their relation to the soil and meteorology as scientific problems and their relation to man as economic and social problems; the vast scope of animal life both useful and destructive — all presenting an array of material for study paralyzing in its immensity. These great groups of the subject should be seen not only in their totality or wholeness, but some few subdivisions of both animal and plant life should be made familiar to the student as a practical art. So that if he were asked "What can you do?" he ought to be able to answer "I can raise corn." "I can raise vegetables," "I can manage bees," "I can conduct a dairy." "I can raise fruit," "I can raise poultry," or some such specific form of activity as to prove himself in possession of a useful art as well as having knowledge of a little, science. The moral to this part of ray story is, "Don't lose sight of the art of agriculture in the study of the sciences, nor of the science of agriculture in the practice of t." The essential element of art is in the doing of something. The essential element of science is in the thinking of what it Coll. The course of study in agriculture in colleges is much more com - plicated. The mental attitude is intensely scientific, social an I nomic. The motive for demonstrating, testing and analyzing dominates all other motives. The three or four main divisions of th? subject, soils, field crops, forests and animals, furnish the material for the college they furnished for the high school. but in the college the mental quest is directed toward field science, plant science, and animal science, leaving the art or practice of the subject quite in the background. The chief function of these three ye;i school life — the thirteenth, fourteenth and fifteenth should be the fitting of the student to guide the work of others though not rendering him inefficient in the doing of it himself if need be. In a thorough going college of agriculture the studies bearing specifically and directly on agriculture both as a science and an art should not consume more than one-third of the student's time. This Is the school period best suited for giving the student that fellowship with the race, and that appreciation of human achievement in letters. in philosophy, in government, and in self socialization. Without this sympathetic touch, no man can rightfully claim to be liberally educated however much he may know. It is the period of all others when th? young man should be encouraged to see visions so that in age he may dream dreams. The college student has a right to expect that this racial heritage shall be allowed to have a part in the building of his own life. Not all culture, simply because that is good, nor yet all agriculture, but balanced ration of culture and agriculture should be the mixture. </seg>
            <seg id="p351">274 In what proportion the mixture shall be given will depend upon the product desired. The culture phase of a college course as opposed to its practical ■ide is usually approached through the study of language, of literature, of history, or of philosophy. Each of these lines has its recognized merits. And whatever may be done in the way of liberalizing the mind by any one of them can be done equally well by either of the others. More depends upon the method of approach and the motive back of the study than upon the subject matter to be studied. It may reasonably be questioned whether any foreign tongue should be taught in an industrial school with any cultural motive. The chief if not the sole function of a knowledge of modern language in such schools is to serve as an avenue to information in that language which has not been rendered in the mother tongue of the student. All the great humanizing messages of past as well as contemporary races must remain a sealed book to all students in technical and to most students in all other schools unless the message has been made intelligible in the language of the fireside. We recognize and act upon this homely truth In every day life but in our educational philosophy we shut our eyes upon it. Its application becomes apparent, however, when we ask our - selves how much of the message of Moses, of the psalm singers, of the prophets, or of Solomon would we now enjoy had those mes - sages remained in the Hebrew tongue. What comfort would ever have come to us from the sermoD on the mount had it remained in the language of the Greek? Luther set the pace for a Bible in the mother tongue. Does not the law of mental energy hold for philosophy, for politics, for poetry, or for science as well as for religion. The story of Christ in more than 400 languages and dialects is the contribution of the 1 9th century to the principle of giving a message of a foreign race in the mother tongue. This is no argument against the study of Hebrew, of Greek, of Latin, of German, of French, or of Spanish. On the contrary it is one of the strongest of arguments for the study of any and of every for - eign tongue that contains a message for humanity, and more thoroughly than ever before, but by a constantly decreasing number of scholars. The need for many scholarly linguists is growing less but the need for better ones is growing greater, just as in the industrial world there has been for several years a decreasing need for so many farmers and the number of farmers will continue to decrease until the remnant is not able to supply the nonfarming part of the community with the things the farm has a monopoly of. Hence the study of agriculture in the college should be more scientific than practical, and this scientific quest should be balanced by history and philosophy. University This is a further stage of student life to be considered. This is sometimes called post-graduate work. It may be done in the college </seg>
            <seg id="p352">275 point to keep in mind is this, that during his progress thus far the student has been subject to rather careful direction, but upon beginning his advanced work he must stand alone. Hitherto his problems have for the most part been set. by others and his answers partaking more of a process of verification of answers already known than of finding new or original ones. Upon entrance into higher work the student should be put to the same test as was the young man Daniel, "Tell both the dream and the interpretation thereof." He must be able to propound to himself problems in the science of agriculture and proceed towards the solution of them. His motive here is less the acquisition of knowledge for himeelf than it is the enlargement of the sum of human knowledge and making it available for others. The agricultural experi - ment stations are in some respects becoming such institutions. And these may in time fulfill the wish for a national university in a some - what restricted sense. Much of the six or seven millions of dollars devoted to the support of these stations may well be considered as a Kdy for study. Can steamship lines, railway lines, or infant Indus - present a more reasonable claim for government subsidy than can who devote their lives to study and research for other's good?

New Departure in Massachusetts. In the Massachusetts Agricultural College a departure from old landmarks in industrial schools is just being started under the title, agricultural education. The present plan of organization for this department has in view the historical and philosophical study of indus - trial education leading to a rational interpretation of the meaning of agriculture as a study in modern school life. It also has in view the study of the instrumentalities by which the teaching is done, such as the college of agriculture, the secondary, and the elementary schools. including their growth, methods, and the relation of the work of each to that of the other. The plan also contemplates a study of rural interests including the religious, social, industrial and educational activities with the purpose of enriching community life by means of the rural </seg>
            <seg id="p353">276 El. It Is, in short, the effort to interpret agriculture in terms of betterment rather than in terms of profit and loss, and the ry of making a living. The work of instruction will be partly within the college and partly without. The work done within will (-.insist of lectures, readings, and discussions upon such topics as Vocational Training, Methods in Nature Work, Meaning of Education. Courses in Agriculture, etc. It will be the aim to reach all students who contemplate teaching. Its value for them consists in the? attainment of a balanced judgment concerning the place of agriculture in an educational scheme. In order to extend Its influence in this direction a summer term for teachers for both theoretical and practical work will become a regular part of the college work. For those who may not become teachers agricultural education as a study will have a value similar to that of the history or philosophy, because of the necessary enlargement of view that comes from an effort to see different factors of civilization in the right rela - tion and in due proportions to each other. Then, too, is anyone really educated until he has made a rather serious study of what it means to be educated? The work outside of the college will be chiefly in the form of co - operation and guidance. Co-operation is to be established between the department and other educational agencies such as schools, societies, clubs, associations, and official boards. This will take the form of some interchange of service in the way of correspondence, lectures, bulletins, books, apparatus, and other supplies. In addition to direct co-operation with the above agencies the department may in some cases become the medium of co-operation between these agencies and other departments of the college. (Especially will this be feasible in the direction of the work among teachers, farmers and young people by means of bulletins, lectures and so on, connected with the work of the individual departments.) In the matter of guidance the work contemplates the organization and direction of nature study clubs, boys' experiment clubs and girls' home art clubs. KThe course of study for class work in the department of agri - ral education will be both theoretical and practical. The courses r planned are as follows: Vocational. In this course the aim is to trace the history of those movements In the education of the past in which some serviceable activity in life was the chief motive; to seek fundamental causes for such move - ments; to trace the effects of these movements upon the present state of industrial education, with agriculture as a specific form, emphasizing in some degree the educative, economic and social value of agriculture both as a science and an art.

Mr. Chubb owns a farm at Cent r Lo\ and possess a practical knowledge of farm life and the conditions governing it. §The plan in brief is to introduce manual training into the try school, but manual training of a practicable kind. Mr. Chubb d have every rural school house equipped with ground and appli - i for carrying on an elementary study of scientific agricultn: "Such manual training," said he, "is the only sort that is possible or that is actually needed in the ordinary district school. The city boy ought to have training of the hand in school because he gets so little of it at home. He is not likely to be handy unless he is made to be so. The boy in the backwoods, on the contrary, although he does not now have to turn his hand to so many things as his father was required to do, still acquires great readiness in the use of tools. He goes Into his life work much better prepared than the city boy to adapt himself to new and unexpected conditions. t'The country school therefore does not need manual training of jrt that we are accustomed to.

            <seg id="p356">279 tematic study. Such study time is among the golden privileges of life. There is nothing exactly like it. For a youth to withdraw himself through months and years from the stock and standard routine of life, to change for the time his air, place and surroundings and give up exclu - sively to the business of training and storing his mind — that is a bene - diction indeed! Pedagogy tells us that school and the life at large ought to blend, and as a general theory this is quite true. But it is equally true that the theory fails if strained. To make the whole of life a school it is indispensable to withdraw a few years of it from being exactly like the rest and to emphasize for the time the intellectual and moral aspects of our being. In graduating this evening you are joining a goodly company. This school has already acquired an enviable reputation, which you are charged to elevate still further. Hardly any speech could too favor - ably characterize the work that has been done for you here. I know of no other industrial education of similar compass which is so suc - cessful. As you are aware, nearly all of the graduates settle upon farms, not from necessity, but from preference. Their farming is profitable, their lives happy, their culture high and their citizenship exemplary. You are greatly honored in being admitted to the circle. I Gentlemen, your schooling must not end with your graduation. Go ifith your education. Carry it as far as you possibly can. And :her your special school time ends now or at some future day, t on being a learner and a scholar always. It would be a delight 11 who have had to do with your training so far should a large ber of this class find it possible to return to the university for a er and fuller career. Let me remind you all that the labors you finishing tonight were planned to gear on to the splendid and luable four year agricultural course in the industrial college. Such ou as can do so would be most wise to turn this ending into a lining and strike out for a new term of mental development. »If you feel obliged to put this chance by personally do so with t, resolving to make it a part of your life work as citizens of aska to point out the privilege to others.

Its privileges are for you, for your children, for your neighbors. And it is yours in the sense that no one else has now a better, higher or fuller sense than you. It is a sun that shines for all. This means, with much else, that our university is and must for - ever remain the people's school, near and dear to the common heart, voicing truth through an unshackled throat, without truckling to the rich and great on the one hand or to the mob on the other. It must never become the prey of any clique, class or set. Sooner than see that occur, rather than let teachers feel that to teach they must get license from this dictator or that censor, I would blow up all our buildings and go teach in tents or on the street. The value of university teaching reduces in last analysis to the candor and sincerity of your faculty — I say their candor and sincerity, which are of so much more importance than mere ability. Ability can be bought; the other qualities are not listed on change, there being no arable notation refined enough to express them. Kin an important sense the university is a national affair, a beau - partnership existing in and through it between Nebraska and the ■d States. It is a product of the two, and could not exist in its nt form or power if either factor wert absent. I The first Morrill bill, so named from its author, the late Justin S. •ill, of Vermont, introduced into the house of representatives mber 14, 1857, intended donations of land to the several states territories which may (might) provide colleges for the benefit of •ulture and the mechanic arts. Reported adversely and after ige vetoed by President Buchanan, on being amended, it again ii congress and was approved by President Lincoln July 2, 1862. is for "endowment, support and maintenance of at least one col - (per state) where the leading object shall (should) be • • • Ech such branches of learning as are related to agriculture and mic arts • • • in order to promote the liberal and practical tion of the industrial classes in the several pursuits and pro - ds of life." All the states and territories in the union, without ;le exception now have educational institutions on this basis. March 2, 1887, President Cleveland approved another piece of land-grant legislation, the Hatch act, specifically agricultural, "intended to diffuse useful and practical information on subjects connected with agriculture and to promote scientific investigation and experiment re - specting the principles and applications of agricultural science." This act procured from the United States for each state $15,000 a year to be expended or to be established (as a rule) at educational institutions receiving the benefit of the Morrill fund. By the Adams act, approved March 16, 1906, this experimentation fund will in a few years be BBy an act of congress approved August 30, 1890, entitled "an act jply a portion of the proceeds of the public lands to the more </seg>

I Two remarks go well with this sketch of the memorable land - its. One is that the university existed before any of these acts had me operative. The people of this state undertook the support he university alone and unaided. They were determined to have liversity, the best that their circumstances warranted, and they ched out boldly in this enterprise before there was any assurance the United States would aid. It was beyond doubt this attitude irly Nebraska toward higher education that made the university in time the recipient of the United States gifts as these one after an - r became available. Today, even, great as is the liberality of the federal government toward our work, vast as is our debt therefor, it is the state that leads in the alliance, the state still as resolute as it was at first to maintain and conserve its own higher life. This year, 1908, towards its total in - come of $506,500, the university will receive from legislative grant about $332,500, from land revenue $40,000; and from its own cash earnings about $75,000; while its revenues from the United States will be but $59,000 all told, viz., $35,000 from the Morrill and Nelson amendment funds and $24,000 from the Hatch and Adams funds. The other remark is that while the Hatch and Adams acts are exclusively agricultural in aim, the Morrill acts and the Nelson amend - ment, as you have noticed from the laws I have quoted, were never in - tended to be merely agricultural but are industrial in the broadest sense covering engineering and related branches' as well as agriculture. There has been a wide misapprehension upon this point, leading years ago to much unjust censure of our regents, who, I believe, have always administered this like every other part of their trust, with the Khe citations and statements above given, it is believed are perfectly accounts, so far as they go, of the land-grant donations up to </seg>
            <seg id="p361">282 most scrupulous fidelity It Is our eirire industrial college that is the child of the Morrill legislation, and not our agricultural education alone. All our engineering work, while state fuDds have enriched It at every point, had its bu»is in the Morrill gifts. It is — we cannot be too often reminded — the industrial college as a whole that forms the uDit for this review, the industrial college so long under the honored and honoring deanship of Head Dean Bessey, of which the agricultural work is one wing and engineering the other, while a splendid assortment of science disciplines, pure and applied, stand* between. KThis ingenioifs constitution of our industrial college should not rgotten. It is not outgrown and never will be. It is the fiDest bit ucational organization our university can show. Nothing superior e klrd is to be found in America. The Nebraska university vf course does not pretend to be dis - charging all the higher education duty now doing in our state. Worthy schools all about us, each in its sphere, each with its peculiar constituency, are contributing to the upper life of our commonwealth. We countenance no rivalry between them and ourselves. The uni - versity's policy, through its high school inspector and in all other ways, is to break down the sense of diverse interest and to ply the helping hand. When high school pupils are known to us as affiliated with denominations possessing colleges in our state, we encourage them to attend those colleges. In return we are glad when the patrons and authorities of denominational colleges reciprocate, as many of them more and more do, by sending to this university such of their pupils as seek educational chances which they cannot give them and we can. All such Nebraska students, so Car as our facilities apply to them, we gladly welcome here rather than have them go out of the state to school; nor does it seem to us improper to point out the large and constantly growing range of the educational facilities, rich and full, which this university stands alone or almost alone in offering, so far as our state is concerned. There is growing up in this commonwealth a more orderly system of higher education than exists in any other state. Overlapping of educational function is not encouraged in Nebraska as in most states, and such bulging as there unfortunately is will grow less with the yean. The university will more and more remand to the best denom - inational colleges a very large part of the freshman work it at present does, and also considerable of its sophomore teaching. The movement bids fair to render the university ere long mainly a college of juniors, seniors, graduates and technical students. What economy in mental privilege this would effect I need not point out. Each plant among us would have something to do in a line where its services would be uniquely valuable and the university would be left free for those larger educational enterprises too difficult or costly for private schools. Not a few aspiring pupils would still attend universities </seg>

Were these states their educational pioneering over again, they would probably pro - differently. Much is to be gained in every way by the unity of higher educa - tion within a state. It means saving at every turn. In administration this is patent at a glance. If you divide, each plant must have full engineering outfits in the various lines, which is costly almost beyond calculation. If you duplicate these it is certain that neither plant will be a credit to you, whereas with one such establishment a common - wealth of moderate resources may make sure of high grade appliances. A similar remark applies to physics and chemistry. Modern scientific education as compared with classical disciplines is costly at best. The wealthiest state must bear this in mind if it seeks for its schools the finest or aught like the finest scientific apparatus. Some of my colleagues seem to consider our provision for agri - cultural training excessively costly. Not so. Of course we need large sums for this and I must not create by any remark tonight a contrary impression. We need a larger farm, more buildings and more stock. Still, the common notion touching the cost of agricultural edu - cation is greatly exaggerated. Our dairy herd has cost money but will never cost much more, as it is now nearly self-supporting. So of the beef thoroughbreds. We need a fsw thousand dollars for choice horseflesh, but If we get this our stud will in a few years not only sup - port itself but be a source of revenue to the university, meantime fur - nishing our agricultural students year by year the rarest assortment of pedigred specimens. A good bull is a better text book than any bulletin or book. Unfortunately engineering and general scientific education is not productive in any such way as cattle are. It is costly with no imme - diate return. It must be had, however, it must be provided for all the same. It is naught against it that it costs heavily. The returns are sure though more direct and slow. (I have mentioned the saving a state effects by unity in its higher ation outfit.

He must have bread, but also thought, history, the ice. poetry, music, art, whatever is high, fine, spiritual, rational, uplifting, making for righteousness, sweetnes. light, appertains an and must be provided for in his higher education. Kin fact the distinction between theoretical and practical in relation ndies and sciences is easily overstated. No study is so theoretical has not a practical phase, and no study or science can be so letely "applied" as to be shorn of its theoretical aspects. We are often misled by the observation, which of course is true, that Nebraska is an agricultural state. This does not mean that we do nothing here but plow, plant and harvest. In our way of doing these very things we cease to be mere farmers in the sense of a hundred years ago. You cannot farm without machinery, and so far as you use this — reapers, mowers, engines and bo on you are machinists an 3 not mere farmers. One of our most important departments is that of farm engineering or farm machinery. Any farm education ignor - ing the many-sidedness of the modern farmer's life would be of no use. There is perhaps even now danger that in educating young men and young women for the farm we may develop in them certain undemo - cratic narrowness. Th? farmer must be the general citizen. If he it not, who shall take his place? What hints does our review afford us on educational integration in our state" I put the question thus because the problem of educa - tional integration differs with states. No other state is just like Nebraska in this matter. The educators, busy in "standardizing" col - leges and schools, need to be reminded that standardizing may be easily carried too far for the educational common weal. Community needs in respect to education are after all to a great degree local. ■The survey above presents to us two pointers, a negative and ive.

All this will cost. A liberal arts building worth $300,000 should in a few years stand in the place of the old University hall. For reasons too numerous to ment."3n here I do not think the university will ever move its central seat from the campus. New land close by will cost no more than the new farm you would need if you made the present farm your main campus. Meantime all your farm and as much more is needed for experimenta - tion and the school's work, which must in a very few years provide for 1,000 pupils and provide for that number more royally than we now provide for those we have. I look to see the magnificent school the state center for a large circle of from fifteen to fifty agricultural high schools flourishing up and down the state, supported perhaps in part by the general government, though, I hope, they will be state schools of the Morrill act type rather than the United States department of agri - culture schools, as proposed by some. Well, says James J. Hill, in a memorable address, "Now, as ever to the nation and race as to the individual, nature, the unrelenting task - mistress of the centuries, holds out in one hand her horn of plenty and in the other her scourge. This country has brought itself in reach of the thing while grasping at the satisfaction of present appetite and forgetting the primal relation between the earth and man. The path to prosperity is still open. The divinity of our earthly life at heart is kind. Under her rule there is work and abundant reward for all, but this must be won in her designated way and in none other. Her pointing finger, that has never varied since man came upon the earth, shows the old and only way to safety and honor. Upon the readiness with which this is understood, the sober dignity with which a whole nation rises to the winning of its broad and permanent prosperity will depend Individual well-being of millions of this and many genera - tions. Largely by this method will posterity, our fit and righteous judge, determine whether what issues from the crucible of thie twentieth century is a bit of rejected dross to be cast aside or a drop of golden metal to shiDe forever upon the rosary of the years." </seg>
            <seg id="p365">286 State Agricultural and Industrial High Schools, State Superintendent J. L. McBrien. The importance of agricultural education and Industrial training as evidenced by the addresses of President Roosevelt, Regent Abbott, Professor Davisson, Professor Hart, Professor Chubb and Chancellor Andrews, and the unparalleled success which has crowned the efforts of Superintendent Bishop in this new field of work — a success which has given him not only a national but an international reputation as an authority on agricultural and industrial education — impel me to recommend the establishment of not less than fifteen nor more than twenty state agricultural high schools, uDder the management and control of the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. The course of study should be the Nebraska High School Manual issued jointly by the University of Nebraska and the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, so modified as to provide for the theory and practice of the elements of agriculture, manual training and domestic science. Opportunity should also be given for work in the theory and practice of manual training and domestic science in the grades below the high school. These state agricultural high schools should be established as departments of the regular public high schools at the places designated therefor. For the support and maintenance of these schools there should be appropriated not less than $100,000. No state agricultural high school should be established as a department of any regular public high school unless there is given to the state the free use of a tract of land containing at least five acres conveniently situated to said high school, for actual practice by all students in the agricultural departments of said high schools under the direction of competent instructors for experimental work in agriculture. The appropriation made by the state should be sufficient to give each high school not less than two teachers for this work — one to teach the theory and practice of agriculture and its allied sciences, the other to teach the theory and practice of manual training and domes - tic science — such teachers to be selected or approved by the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska. The state appropriation should also be sufficient to provide the necessary equipment for all of this work. Since agriculture is a requirement for a teachers' certificate, there would be at least 500 prospective teachers preparing for the rural schools in these twenty agricultural high schools during the next blennium, who would be given opportunity for professional and practical training in this subject. In addition thereto there would be at least 500 students in attendance at these schools pursuing the theory and practice of agriculture for its commercial and practical value to them as twentieth century farmers.

I do not know of any other educational policy that would do so much to induce our boys and girls to complete the eighth grade and then to finish the high school course, and which would be of so much prac - tical value to them in solving the actual problems of everyday life and in meeting the everyday responsibilities of American citizens. "The people must needs take thought of what they shall eat and wherewithal they shall be clothed. And the' education that fits them best for this is, from necessity, the best; at least until they are so developed and im - proved that the people, the great longing, struggling, hungering, needing, hoping, despairing, and yet unyielding people, shall not need to take thought only of what they shall eat and wear." Moreover. It is the most economical plan possible for the state. One hundred thousand dollars appropriated for this purpose would do more to promote the general welfare of our great commonwealth than it is possible to do with five times this amount through any other channel. The first eduoator in Nebraska to emphasize this phase of educa - tion was State Superintendent S. R. Thompson. In his second biennial report, submitted December 31, 1880, he devotes sixteen pages to his arguments for agricultural and industrial education, in many para - graphs of which he grows eloquent as well as logical for industrial edu - cation in the common schools, agricultural and industrial education In the secondary schools, and higher agricultural and industrial edu - cation in the agricultural and industrial colleges. Let me quote one or two of his paragraphs: I "There are diminutive souls who think any kind of manual labor iding; there are others who by some kind of inconceivable logic convinced themselves that selling turnips is a much more dignified oyment than growing them, or that standing behind a counter uring oft ribbons is more refined and elevated employment than ling behind a loom and weaving them.

Vexing Problems of the School Census. ■ (Papers read before the School Board Section of the Superintend - and Principals' Association, Lincoln, October 24, 1907.) The School Census and the School Enrollment. Hon. C. E. Van Patten, President Board of Education, Hastings, Neb. When I received the communication from the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, requesting me to prepare a flfteeen minute paper to be read before this body of eiucators, on the subject "The Question of the School Census and the School Enrollment," I was loth to accept hi» kind invitation. First, because of my inability to present it to you Intelligently, as I desire, in the time allotted — 15 minutes. Second, because a statistical report or address is usually dry and not fully appreciated or understood. Had I the time to attend this meeting, I should have been glad to be present and address you. This question of Enumeration and Enrollment, is one of the hard problems which School Boards all over the state, have to contend with, especially those of cities. Some say that they cannot understand why this ques - tion should be of such importance as to command the attention of School Boards as well as county and state officials. First, let me say, that one of the reasons is, because it affects property holders and tax - payers all over the state and if any school district has a padded census, or enumeration, that district draws from the state public moneys that do not belong to it and Is doing so contrary to law. The ruling of the Department of Public Instruction, based upon the state law governing enumeration, is as follows: K'lt is the ruling of this department that only the students of the private and denominational schools whose parents or legal ians maintain their legal residence in the school district In </seg>
            <seg id="p368">289 which such state, private or denominational school is situated may legally be enumerated in such school district. Stating the proposition Inversely but concretely, all students of the University of Nebraska between the ages of five and twenty-one whose parents or legal guar - dians are legal residents of the state of Nebraska and of the city of Lincoln are entitled to be enumerated in the school district of the city of Lincoln. All other students of the University of Nebraska must be enumerated only in the school district where their parents or legal guardians maintain their legal residence, and not in the school di of the city of Lincoln. The same is true of the students in attendance at the state normal schools at Peru and Kearney, and at the colleges, private normal schools, and business colleges located at B llevue. Crete, Fremont, Grand Island, Hastings, University Place, Wayne, York and other places. Notice is hereby given that a strict compliance with the above ruling is demanded of every census enumerator and of • county superintendent in the state. This done, every person between the ages of five and twenty-one who may legally be enumerated in the school census of the state will be counted once and only once in the distribution of the state's school fund. This is law. It is right, and the law and the right must prevail in so sacred a matter as the distribu - tion of the state's common school fund." You will observe that the law is very explicit and defines what pupils are entitled to be enumerated in the district. PI fact that no pupil attending a business college, sectarian or military school whose parents reside outside of that district, should be enumer - ated. If they should be, it is a direct violation of the law, and should not be permitted. Some enumerators employed by school boards, to take the census are paid so much per capita and make it a point to get every pupil of school age enumerated, whether the law is violated or not. Then again, not all enumerators know fully what the law says regarding this matter and perhaps do not want to know. Ever. takes pride in having a large enumeration in order to make it appear that it is not a back number, but growing and keeping pace with other cities in the state. This, of itself is a factor which assists the enumerator in getting the name of every pupil of school age on his books. I am not saying that the enumerator violates the law wilfully, but I do say, that not all enumerators are conversant with the law before they start out upon their work of enumeration. I am of the opinion that not all memebrs of school boards know the the law fully in regard to this matter of taking the school census. That we may understand better how » padded school census works to the detriment of other schools who do not have a padded one, I wish to say this to illustrate this point. If a school district has a lawful census of 2,000 pupils, but it is padded to 3,000, it draws from the state one-third more public money than it is entitled to. To illustrate further. A school district in Nebraska drew public money for 1907 on an enumeration of 2,972 pupils and as a re - sult of agitation along the line of a legal and correct enumeration — It will draw next year public money on an enumeration of 1,902. A difference of 1,060 names which had been enumerated and which drew public money that they were not entitled t# draw. What applies in </seg>
            <seg id="p369">290 this particular case, applies to other school districts in the state. but perhaps not to so great an extent. I wish to give a list of a num- ber of school districts in Nebraska, their enumeration and enrollment for 1907. Also the per cent of enrollment to that of enumeration and I call your attention especially to the per cent of enrollment. Enumeration Enrollment Per Cent Beatrice 3,026 1,940 64 Blair 1,054 853 80 Columbus 1,815 922 50 Fairbury 1,232 1,120 90 Falls City 920 ' 725 78 Fremont 2,821 1,901 67 Grand Island 2,499 1,770 70 Hastings 2,640 2,246 85 Kearney 1,912 1,599 83 Lincoln 11,759 8,080 68 MeCook 1,121 973 86 Nebraska City 2,083 1,346 64 Norfolk 1,571 1,251 79 h Platte 1,229 1,006 81 Omaha 27.144 18,216 67 Plattsmouth 1.875 1,181 63 South Omaha 7,885 5,128 65 York 1,537 1,174 76 That you may more fully understand this comparison, I desire to call your attention to the fact that Columbus has the lowest per cent of ■enrollment of all in this list of schools named, only 50 per cent. Plattsmouth comes next with 63 per cent with Beatrice and Nebraska r ollowlng closely with 64 per cent, South Omaha 65, Omaha and Fremont 67, Lincoln 68, Grand Island 70, and so on down the list. The schools at Fairbury have the largest per cent of her pupils enrolled — 90 per cent — Hastings is in line with 85 per cent. Let us take a lock at the schools of Hastings. I use Hastings as a basis in these comparisons because of my knowledge of local facts and condi- tions. They have 2.640 pupils enumerated and 2,246 actually enrolled. or 85 per cent of her pupils of school age are attending the publlo schools. Why is it that these other cities named do not have 85 per cent of their pupils enrolled? I hear some say that Hastings has not -all of her pupils of school age enumerated, or else th«y have double enrollment. If any one present harbors such a thought, let me -dispel it from your minds. First, will say that the Board of Education of Hastings was very careful in selecting men to take the enumeration and also to instruct them as to the law regarding taking of the census and especially called their attention to the fact that they wanted enumerated every pupil of school age that the law said that Hastings was entitle! to have enumerated, for all schools drew public money on the number of pupils enumerated. Under these conditions, the cen- sus was taken and the board believes that it was taken correctly. One word about double enrollment. The books of the Hastings public schools are in the office of the Superintendent and are open for inspec- tion. No double enrollment will be found. I am unable to understand </seg>

            <seg id="p372">291 why some schools should have 85 per cent of their pupils enrolled and and others only 50, 60 or 70 per cent. Like conditions exist in other cities of the state as those of Hastings and it appears to us that they should have 85 per cent of their pupils enrolled and if not, there should be a reason for it. Where does the error exist, if such it be. and if so, how can it be corrected? The percentage of enrollment in the Hastings schools is regarded as a reasonable average. Assuming that the enumeration figures given above and which are taken from the re- ports of the County Superintendents from their respective counties and which are on file in the State Superintendent's office, are correct, then their enrollment on a basis of 85 per cent, which is the average in the Hastings schools, would be as follows: Reported On basis of enrollment 85 per cent Beatrice 1,940 S,l Blair 853 896 Columbus 922 1,1 Fairbury 1,120 1,047 Palls City 725 782 Fremont 1,901 2,297 Fremont 1,901 2.297 Grand Island 1,770 1,11 2.124 Hastings 2,246 2,246 2.246 Kearney 1,599 1,6 1,625 Lincoln 8,080 9,995 9.99.^ McCook 973 952 952 Nebraska City 1,346 1,7 Norfolk 1,251 1,335 Norfolk 1,251 1,335 North Platte 1,006 1,044 North Platte 1,006 1,044 Omaha 18,216 23,072 Plattsmouth 1,181 1,593 Plattsmouth 1,181 1,593 South Omaha 5,128 6,702 York 1.174 1,305 Taken as a basis that 85 per cent of the enumeration is a fair one. for the enrollment, these figures show that Beatrice ought to have 632 more pupils trolled than she has reported. Fremont, 396. Grand Island, 354. Lincoln, 1,915. Nebraska City, 424. Omaha, 4,856, and South Omaha, 1,574. Assuming that the cities may have made an error in their enumer- ation reports and that their percentage of enrollment is the same as Hastings, their enumeration on the basis of enrollment of 85 per cent, should be as follows. Comparison in this case being made with the enumeration as reported.

By carefully studying the figures given above and comparison made, one can see that something is wrong somewhere and should be changed. It is not the purpose of the writer to place any school in a false light, but to bring these facts before you that you may see for yourself and place the blame where it belongs. If any school has a padded enumer - ation, that schoool is drawing money from the state which it is not entitled to and steps should be taken to have the matter attended to with as little delay as possible. Right wrongs no one and any official of any school board who would object to the correcting of errors or who would not be willing to have the searchlight of an honest inves - tigation turned upon the public records placed within his keeping, would be unworthy of the confidence of the people who elected him. I leave this subject with you, hoping that what I have written will be in a measure, at least, helpful to you in solving one of the many problems which come before the different boards of education for a solution. factors Which Canst Differences in the Matter of School Enrollment as Compared With the School Census. Dr. R. S. Albright, Secretary Board of Education, Beatrice, Nebraska. Kin all computations, such as we have had before us for discussion, hould not jump at conclusions as shown by a single year or two cures, but we should take the average covering a period of many I For example, we have in our state census enumerations and llmfnts the following unaccountable variation: The 1900 enu - ition shows 5,000 more pupils in the state and that year there ■ 11,500 more pupils enrolled than the previous year (6,500 more lied than the increase in census). The following year there were lea enumerated and 2,500 less enrolled — just the opposite condition i the previous year: a loss of 1,800 as against a gain of 6,500 the before. The next year shows a loss of 1,700 in census enumeration and a gain of 4,000 in enrollment or with 1,700 less pupils of school age we enrolled 4,000 more than the previous year. The next year shows an increase of school census of 1,500 and an enormous loss in enroll - ment of 12,000 pupils. I am unable to explain the foregoing, but have </seg>
            <seg id="p374">293 Eed to the facts and submitted the figures to show the utter futility ing to prove anything about the correctness of census and enroll - by one year's figures. Bit is not my purpose to attempt to settle any squabble, but to lit to you factors which might make a wide difference in enrollm-ents 3ut meaning any vital differences between the cities compared. I A city with factories, where boys can secure employment, will re the per cent of enrollment materially, and yet be beyond the dy of the truant officer except as to night school, which does not the enrollment. Many boys from 14 to 16 years old will even quit &gt;1 and go to work, and attend the night school; so too with boys 16 years old — they have the inducement of earning money to them from school, while in the absence of factories the temptation d not exist. A good business or other college; a strong parochial school; a private kindergarten, all are factors in decreasing the public school's per cent of enrollment. To illustrate — we have in Beatrice about 4% in the parochial school, 2% in the business college and 1 % % in the night schools. On the other hand the public kindergarten is a factor in the increasing of the percentage of enrollment, as the kindergarten brings out a much larger per cent of the five year olds than the regular first grade would. For example — we have 97 five year olds enrolled in the first grade out of a census of 222 five year olds — a loss of 125 or about 56%. Our records show that only 37% of the first grade are under six years of age, showing clearly that parents do not usually send the five year olds, while where there is a kindergarten they frequently enroll them down to three years of age. Then again, the tuition pupils should be deducted before com - puting the percentage of enrollment, as they were not enumerated, and one city having a good high school and being so situated as to be quite far from other good high schools might and undoubtedly would have a much larger attendance of tuition pupils than other equally good high schools located near each other. It frequently happens that a small good high school has more tuition pupils than has a high school in a city much larger in size, thus making a large difference in the comparative per cents of enrollment and yet all the difference comes from the outside of the district and should therefore not be allowed to enter into a correct statement of the enrollment. ■ Peru with a normal school as a counter attraction enrolls only 35% the normal school enrolls only 40% of their enumerations. With the above factors in mind I wish to submit the following table covering the ten cities in Nebraska having the highest school census from the year 1899 to the present time (I had no statis - tics further back). The figures are from the Annuals issued by the State Superintendents, and are in the order of the per cents, beginning with the highest. </seg>
            <seg id="p375">294 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT Beatrice, 75.4; Plattsmouth, 69.7; South Omaha, 69.4; Grand Island, 68.7; Nebraska City, 67.9; Fremont, 67.7; Omaha, 64.3; Hastings, 61.2; Kearney, 59.7; Lincoln, 56.5. (The average for the state during the above period was 75.4.) t During three of the years of this period Kearney had only about of her enumeration enrolled — this looks bad, even a little clous.. Kearney with a population of 8,000 should enumerate about 2,000 pupils (her last census was 1,912), which would make a total enu - meration for the eight years of 16,000, and yet during the past eight years she has collected state money on 21,764 or 5,764 more than a liberal estimate would give her; amounting in apportionment funds at an average of $1.40 per pupil to over $8,000 more than she should have received, according to the above estimate. Hastings during this same period gained from 200 to 500 per year in her enumeration until about 1904 or '05, when she reached her maximum — 4,383 pupils, and that year enrolled only 51% of her enumeration and yet the very next year enrolled 86.3% and had lost 1,772 pupils — this too looks bad. Allowing an average annual enumeration of 2,900 for Hastings which is a little more than the average for Beatrice during that time (and the cities are about the same size), would give a total of 23,000 for the eight years and yet Hastings has collected state apportionment for 28,002 pupils during this same time or 5,000 more than a liberal estimate would give her — amounting to $7,000 which belongs to the state — according to the above estimate. It seems to me that the above amounts should be refunded or collected. The following table gives the difference between the highest and lowest school census of the same city during the past eight years: Grand Island, 204; Fremont, 320; Beatrice, 350; Nebraska City, 368; Kearney, 1,200; Hastings, 1,772. Omaha, South Omaha and Lincoln are omitted because not in the same class. The greatest difference in the school census between any two successive years in the same cities was as follows: Beatrice, 153; Nebraska City, 172; Fremont, 198; Grand Island, 204; Kearney, 1,000; Hastings, 1,772. Showing that Beatrice has the least annual difference — amounting in one instance to only one-twelfth as much as another city- Also showing that she has much the highest per cent of enrollment of any of the largest ten cities in the state. It seems almost incredible in the face of these facts any honorable person would stoop to publish such false statements and make the base insinuations as have recently appeared in a daily paper of a jealous rival city. KWith the above tables and the factors enumerated one can in cases account for the variations, but there are several cases given no explanation nor method of reasoning will properly account for mblished statements, as I believe there is absolutely no grounds be existence of the figures. </seg>
            <seg id="p376">295 Companies whose business is taking census for directories, etc., state that the school census multiplied by four will give very approxi - mately the population of the city. Polk &amp; Company have recently taken the census or population of Beatrice and placed it at 12,100, which divided by four gives, 3,025, while our census for the school children as taken is 3,026, within one of the above figure and it can therefore not be so very much too high. The school census of Hastings last year was 2,640 which multiplied by four gives only 10,560 as her population and yet her citizens proclaim loudly and positively that they have a popu - lation of over 12,000 and the recent directory census gives them 12,000 and I think they have them, and this would give them a school census of about 3,000 and would cut that 85% enrollment to about 73 — about the right figure. It seems plain to me that the census was carelessly taken and is too low, as no city of this class can show a bona fide enrollment of 85%; this is further shown by the fact that they would have had a loss of 1,743 pupils, representing a loss of approxi - mately 7,000 in population during the past two years, which was not the case at all. In the year 1902 we had at Beatrice an enrollment of 92% as based on the census enumeration. The census that year was several hundred below the average for the eight years quoted, and yet we enrolled 135 more pupils that year than we did the previous year, indi - cating that the census was not accurately taken, as that enrollment would leave only 8% margin for a flourishing business college; a parochial school; a private kindergarten school; notwithstanding the fact that we have 4% of graduates; about 6% of quituates; about 2% in institutions of learning elsewhere and 4% over five years and under six years not in school. I wish to say in this connection that our census was that year taken by a lazy fellow who got tired easy. The average enrollment of the state that year was 76%. During the past week I have ascertained the enrollments of near by states as follows: Kansas Ftate enrollment for the last biennium Id cities of the first class, 58.3; cities of the second class, 69.7; average 64 + . Iowa state average since 1899, 76.7; Nebraska as stated, 75.4. I In computing the per cents of enrollments it seems to me we should the enumeration of the June just past for the ensuing school as sis, and the enforcement of the Compulsory Attendance Law must ased on that report and we cannot get the new-comers until the year. The census reports of most of the live cities of Nebraska show an increase this year, owing no doubt to the influx of many families attracted by the general prosperity and good times of Nebraska; con - sequently our enrollment this year will be coneiderable higher — in fact we already have nearly 100 more pupils enrolled than at this time last year, and the parochial school has about 50 more and there are two night schools this year — one last year; these alone would raise the </seg>

Thus there was no inducement to as many names as possible — but rather the opposite, neither was e any opportunity for copying. Then too, owing to the necessity of addressing communications to parents on matters pertaining to the Compulsory Attendance Law, we have for years had the enumerator take the address (street and num - ber) of each family, and a list is then prepared by the secretary for «ach school buildiqg, said list containing the names of all pupils sub - ject to the attendance law belonging to that building. Two years ago this list, after deducting the names of persons having moved away, and the names of those who had entered school had dwindled down to 23 names — an impossible result with a padded census. 'Department Ruling on School Census Padding of Census. Notice that the CENSUS should be reported under the item • NTMBER OF CHILDREN IN THE DISTRICT BETWEEN 5 AND 21 YEARS OF AGE." The corresponding item in the annual report of the director should be verified by checking with the director's census report. Do not accept a director's report of census unless the same is made under oath. In spite of the care exercised in past years by county superintendents in protecting the integrity of the school census, some flagrant cases of school census padding have been brought to light. One school district was found to have padded its school census sixty - seven per cent, reporting over 1,700 more pupils of school age than were actually found residing therein, and receiving from the state school fund in one year over $3,000 to which it was not entitled. The matter was called to the attention of this department through the activities of the Commercial club of a rival city, with the result that the school district in question enumerated 1,700 fewer persons between the ages of five and twenty-one in 1906 than in 1905. County superin - tendents are hereby cautioned to accept no school census report from directors or others authorize! to make report of enumeration of persons of school age unless such report is made under oath, as provided by law; and school census enumerators are hereby warned that no cases of school census padding will be tolerated. When it is remembered that approximately $700,000 annually are distributed among the 7,000 school districts of the state on the basis of school population as sworn to by the respective census enumerators of said districts, and by the county superintendents of the ninety counties, in accordance with </seg>

The care - less omission of names is as grave an offense as is deliberate padding. Give to each district that to which it is entitled — no more, no less. Non-Residents in State, Private or Denominational Schools not Enumerated. It is the ruling of this department that only the students of state, private and denominational schools whose parents or legal guardians maintain their legal residence in the school district in which such private or denominational school Is situated may legally be enumerated in such school district. Stating the proposition inversely but concretely, all students of the University of Nebraska between the ages of five and twenty-one whose parents or legal guardians are legal residents of the state of Nebraska and of the city of LiDcoln are entitled to be enumer - ated in the school district of the City of Lincoln. All other students of the University of Nebraska must be enumerated only in the school dis - trict where there parents or legal guardians maintain their lega. dence, and not in the school district of the city of Lincoln. The same is true of the students In attendance at the state normal schools at Peru and Kearney, and at the colleges, private normal schools and business colleges located at Bellevue, Crete, Fremont, Grand Island, Hastings. University Place, Wayne, York and other places. Notice is hereby given that a strict compliance with the above ruling is demanded of census enumerator and of every county superintendent in the state. This done, every person between the ages of five an i twenty - one who may legally be enumerated in the school census of the state will be counted once and only once in the distribution of the state's school fund. This is law. It is right, and the law and the right must prevail in so sacred a matter as the distribution of the state's common school fund. Inmates of State Institutions Not Knumerated. No person of school age who is an inmate of a state industrial school or of any stat? institution providing for both the care -and edu - cation of its inmates may legally be enumerated in the school census of any school district. Such persons are wards of the state. Their parents or legal guardians having surrendered to the state all legal responsibility for their control, maintenance and education, the school districts where such parents or guardians reside are relieved from the burden of providing school privileges for them and therefore have no legal right to the benefits arising from enumerating them in their school census. County superintendents will require all census enumer - ators to eliminate the names of all such persons before accepting school census reports. Report Boys, Girls, Total.

Junior &amp;(pmuLl and &amp;(ormal Training, 1907. 7V«/immarv cAnnounctment. At the junior normal conference held in the office of the state superintendent, November 22, 1907, it was decided to hold a junior normal dinner at some time during the state teachers' association. Since that time it has seemed fitting and proper to include the normal training high schools. Accordingly arrangements have been completed for a Junior Normal and Normal Training Dinner to be given in the banquet hall, St. Paul's M. E. Church, Lincoln, Thursday, December 26, 1907, at 5:45 p. m. This will be an old fashioned dinner with thing od the table when we sit down — a sort of home coming at the Yule-tide. Former State Superintendent Wm. K. Fowler, father of the junior normal schools and the normal training idea in high schools, will act as toast master, and Mr. Irving S. Cutter as master of ceremonies. All principals, faculties and students of junior normal schools, past, present and prospective; all superintendents, instructors and student-teachers in normal training high schools; and all friends of these movements are extended a cordial invitation to attend the dinner. Governor Sheldon will be among those who respond to toasts. The junior normals and the normal training high schools have no more loyal friend than Governor Sheldon. Reserve plates at 75 cents each by addressing Mr. I. S. Cutter, 134 North Eleventh Street, Lincoln, Nebraska, not later than Tuesday, December 24, 1907.

E. church, Lincoln. Over three hundred of the leading school men and school women were present. Those who have known the toast master, Hon. W. K. Fowler, for many years, and have seen him acting in the capacity of toast master on various occasions never saw him in a happier or wittier mood than on this event. His Scotch brogue was never more musical. Those who re - sponded to toasts were at their best. There were six toasters of the teachers' profession and six were men of affairs. "Not a single incident happened to mar the pleasure, of the cele - bration. Everything had been so successfully planned and carried out by the master of ceremonies, Mr. Irving S. Cutter, that he was unan - imously voted the title of "The Little Corporal." K"The cause of education in its broad, comprehensive, minute, mgh, practical sense, was the theme uppermost in the mind of one present, but an especial emphasis was given the importance e jnior normal schools and normal training in high schools."

            <seg id="p381">300 are of more vital importance than even the much talked of course of study. One of these elements is the social atmosphere of the school. By the social atmosphere I mean all that takes place that falls without the round of the daily grind of the text book. The Junior Nor - mal offers a greater variety in the character and make up of its student than any other school organized and maintained at the expense of the state. Thus it has a more important mission than the mere academic training of its students. The work done there is, in many eases, the only opportunity offered a large number of the students for gaining that culture which is so essential to bring them out of the rut of "keeping school." I The social environment should be such as will develop the ethical aesthetic natures of those attending. It should arouse in the Terent high aspirations for success in the teaching art. The lal can ill afford to ignore any feature of its work that will be of aid in helping it to measure up to its responsibilities. The junior normal boarding hall, where it has been properly organ - ized and maintained, has proved itself an indespensible part of the school. It should be run on the co-operative plan, the students get - ting value received for every' dollar invested. A clean well kept dining hall with plenty of good wholesome food furnished at actual cost; a well furnished reception hall, accessible to all, cannot fail to produce a spirit of good fellowship so essential to the success of the school. Tables of convenient size so arranged as to permit the members of the faculty to mingle among the students at the mealtime hour, and the few minutes social converse in the reception hall at the close of each meal, affords the instructor an opportunity to become acquainted with his pupils, such as no other agency could do. Not only this, but it offers the student an opportunity to 'meet the instructor outside of the class room drudge. Tru?, this is a severe test of the instructor's ability as a true educator and leader, but if one cannot meet th? test he should give place to one who can.

It is good to participate in this meeting which gives such unmis - takable evidence of Nebraska's educational renanissance; and may I not first speak a wori concerning my own attitude toward the recent extension of the .forces engaged in the preparation of teachers for our public schools? I am a normal school man with definite ideas of the peculiar mission of such a school; and it is but natural that I should watch jealously any attempt to transfer the proper work of the normal school to any other institution. While I hold that there must b« no compromise of the distinctive work of the State Normal School, I frankly admit that there is a perfectly legitimate demand for important alii; d work by other educational instrumentalities. I believe sincerely in the earnest work that is being done in the Junior Normals and the High Schools, in the Colleges and the Private Schools, in the rsity, and in the constructively guided Reading Circle — for I »ee all these valuable factors in a great educational movement. The work of providing teachers for the public schools of the State is great— far more than is possible for the two State Normal Schools to do, and per - sonally I heartily welcome all the co-operating forces. All contriln: the desired end; ani even the most zealous advocate of complete professional education for teachers may well say in this great &lt;• tional awakening in Nebraska that "He that is not against us is fm But I am to speak for the school at Kearney as well as for my - self; and I speak carefully and, I think, with a full knowledge of the facts, when I bring to you an expression of cordial appreciation of good work. This school has had from its very opening a sympathetic attitude toward all movements for improving Nebraska's schn Us faculty were largely public school men and women in appreciative touch with public school needs and possibilities. It is a school of the highest ideals and most determined purpose in its mission as it sees Its mission in the state. While it aspires to be a great technical school for the education of professional teachers, it appreciates and values justify all of the contributing work of other institutions. The faculty see Nebraska's needs and recognize the necessity for many helping hands. They also acknowledge how wisely this rapidly i oping work has been carried on and gladly join hands with those assembled here in the heartiest approval of your enthusiastic services to the state. That I might speak with authority for the school, I went to the school office after receiving the invitation of Superintendent McBrien to take part on this program, to seek for some suitable expression of the spirit of goodfellow&amp;hip in the school toward our allies.

The movement will in no way t the Normal Schools, the High Schools, the Colleges, or the Univer - but for the better. It will intensify thoroughness and purpose he part of students who pursue the course. It will be a spur to ken the student's desire for professional training and for a broader more thorough knowledge of the subject he is to teach.

To this succinct statement of the attitude of the school toward your work the whole faculty give you a hearty second ; and what is said of the work in the High Schools we say of all co-operating agencies. It it all for Nebraska, and the Kearney school reaches out a friendly hand to all who join with us in the work to which the state has called us.

When th^re is no revolution to quell, a part of the army is detailed to hunt up the children and compel them to go to school. In Honduras the school houses in the small villages are also the hotels where travelers may put up for the night. There are no beds. but there are places to hang hammocks. The doors are open to trav - elers, and there is no charge. In Guatemala the same system prevails. In both places the small boys are taught the manual -of arms, wooden muskets being provided for the drill. In all these Spanish American countries th? boys' and girls' schools are separate except in the little vil - lages.

In the good old days, many of you recall with unpleasant remem - brance, the heartaches, the hardships and headaches you accumulated while boarding around. You remember the week you boarded at Bill Brown's when they assigned you to the northeast parlor bedroom — the room in which grandpa died, five years before, and which had not been aired since? You remember when you took a chair and climbed up to the top of the bed and turned back the covers how cold those theets were, and how you shivered with dread. You remember ice cream, Greenland's icy mountains, your pros - pective mother-in-law and thought how warm they were in comparison with those sheets. The fight you had with Morpheus, after you had retired, for fear you would freeze to death, if you fell asleep, and the dread of dying of insomnia if you did not. How you converted your - self into a sort of a combination right angle, scalene, isosceles triangle and just as you had fallen into your first fitful slumber, you were aroused by the words, "Git up and git ready for breakfast." How you wended your way to the woodshed and after your morning ablution was made in ice cold water and your face was dried with a wet towel, you went into the kitchen for your morning meal. How your aesthetic soul revolted when Jim Jackson, the hired man, almost swallowed his knife while eating with it and asked if you wouldn't have "some more sop on your pancake- KHow dirty and dusty the school room appeared and how painful .■indows in which there was not a full pane.

Union School Banquet, 1908 ■The following extracts, from The Nebraska Teacher for September October, 1908. are self-explanatory as to the reasons for holding ilon School Banquet: "It is proposed to hold a banquet during the Nebraska State Teachers' Association, on Wednesday evening, November 4. beginning at six o'clock, in the Lincoln City Auditorium, open to all members of t*"° association. </seg>

These banquets began after the even- Ing program of the second day and lasted until long into the night. The presidents of the normal schools interested frankly admit that these affairs have become burdensome, and they gladly welcome the plan proposed by Supt. J. L. MeBrien, who has been appointed toast - master for the annual banquet of the Superintendents and Principals' Association, which this year meets with the State Association, instead of in October as heretofore. The banquet will be a union one of the Peru and Kearney State Normals, the Fremont and Wayne Normals, the Nebras'ka Wesleyan University, the Junior Normal schools, and all other institutions that may desire to take part. There will be a central table for the speakers of the evening, and a table for each school making application for it. Dinner will be served from 6:00 to 7:30 p. m., and the speaking and other entertainment will cease at 11:00 o'clock. Presidents Crabtree, Thomas, Clemmops, and Pile have already given their hearty assent to the plan, and its success is assured. Superinten - dent Geo. D. Carrington, Jr., of Nemaha county, president of the Super - intendents and Principals' Association, will preside and introduce the toastmaster. Each institution desiring to take part will be represented on the program, and it is to be hoped that the speakers will all be In good voice, and able to make themselves heard in every corner of the big hall. They should be required to speak without notes or manuscript. Smoking will not be indulged in. The auditorium will Beat at tables about 800 persons, perhaps 1,000. Undoubtedly the decorous and exclusive table of the evening will be that of the bookmen. It will certainly be a jolly night, with rival songs and yells from the different tables when songs and yells are in order, and arrangements will be made for the announcement of returns from the regular fall election of the day before." "The union banquet to be held during the Nebraska State Teach- Assoeiation, mentioned in our S?ptember issue, promises to be a great success.

I'nder "Tomorrow" I laid strew on the more perfect union certain to issue from tbe dinner and the I ings of the sessions this year. My thought under the "The Day After" was better consideration and more adequate and equitable pay for the teachers of the state, and particularly of the public schools. In connec - tion with this I sought to broach a definition of adequate pay for ■■ ers, which I maintained would be such pay as would keep in the ranks and profession of teaching a fair share of the bright young people of both sexes now coming forward, and entering upon the business of life, instead of permitting our ranks to suffer, as everyon? knows they constantly do, by the drifting off of magnify i and women into other more lucrative callings.

But that reminds me of the spinster who, in defense of spinsterhood, declared that the argument favoring marriage on the ground that married women live longer than single ones to be untrue, and that the state - ment could not be proven — that they did not live longer — it only seemed So to those who argue that college days is a synonym for a path strewn with roses, I would not say it is not so — it only seems bo. But let me add that as every ray of sunshine does not cast a shadow — but only as relative position of objects warrant; and the dimensions and (tensity of the shadow depends on position and penetra - bility of the object, so, likewise, the sunshine and shadow of college days depends on the penetrability of the mental fabric of the student and the amount of happy, wholesome, vigorous rays that can penetrate; and the mind that can focus the largest per cent of these becomes self luminous, and as the modest daisy looks to the sun for strength and beauty, in like manner every student feels the power of such presence and the association of such an one 1 aves a fragrance that time itself cannot eliminate.

K Perhaps no atmosphere is so heterogeneous as that of the college rhaps no institution, not even the home, has to its credit the msibility of making turning points in the lives of individuals as that e college. It is the basic mission of education to find out where we are at and what we are good for — and the young man who completes a col - lege course without having learned this vital point usually fails to find it in after life. I Ambition and natural fitness are sometimes at right angles, and when such discovery is made that the shadows appear, deep and until thsy are lost in the gloom — and the youth bewails his fate imagines his grief a reality; but in after years, in happy retro - . he relates this impressive experience with a candor and a smile wonders when? he should be today had not a guiding hand ted his course.

A. 'BtAttie. K Since man is a complex being and sustains the relations which 9ur elements imply, his education, if it is to satisfy his nature, is to 'y the expense, and is to reward the effort, must take into account 1 the factors. Man is related to the natural and physical world, to the family and eocia 1 «rder into which h? is born, to himself as a being capable of growth and development, and to God in whose image he Is created. K[f we ask what is his relation to the world of nature, to his fellow - to himself and to God and how he can be made to know relationship th? answer is found in four words, namely: science, •y. literature and the Bible. I The question is, then, how can the human being during childhood youth be adjusted to the environment in which he is to live, be ared for the vocation he is to follow, be made ready for the avoca - to which he will be compelled to turn, be fitted for the social and strial order of which he is to be a part and for a place, life and in - ce in the household of faith? The answer is this: By a study of ce he finds his place in the unity of nature. By the study of history be finds his relation to his fellowmen. </seg>
            <seg id="p397">312 ■ By the study of literature he conies to realize himself and to know :elf as knowing, feeling and willing and to know, also, that these and processes are expressions of himself.

Courage, like gold, is a single or simple element and cannot on that account be analyzed. The elements in judgment which make it the greatest value in the personality of the teacher are knowledge and reason and the two which make patience a never failing source of supply and helpfulness are strength of character and sympathy of heart. Ideas are awakened and images are formed in the mind by contact with Dature and by the facts and incidents of history and experience but the ideals by which childhood, youth, young manhood and womanhood are inspired to larger and diviner things and to higher and holier ambition*, are embodied in the life, are manifested in the conduct. are cherished in the thoughts and are exhibited in the character of the teacher. Every child and youth admires the teacher and the personality of the teacher whose determining qualities are courage, judgment and patience and that which he really and constantly admires becomes that which he is hoping to be and is striving to do. Thus the personality of the teacher becomes the ideal of the learner and fixes for the learner the desires of his heart, the spirit of his life, the motive for his conduct, the reasons for his actions, the measure of his effort, the sum of his attainments, the usefulness of his day and the crown of his years.

At first he the ridicule of the boys but soon hits upon a plan. Ben comes by eating a particularly fine apple "Hi, you're up a stump, aint you?" ■Tom does not notice him but surveys his last stroke with the of an artist: his mouth waters for the apple but he sticks to rork. "Say. I'm going swimming. I am. Don't you wish you could? But of course you'd rather work, wouldn't you?" Tom looked at him for a moment. "What do you call work" " "Why, ain't that work?" ■ "Well, may be it is, and may be it ain't. All I know is, it suit* Sawyer." "O', come now you don't mean to let on that you like It?" </seg>

KThat put the thing in a new light. Ben stopped aibbling the i. Tom swept his brush daintily back and forth. Ben watched ' move getting more ani more interested. "Say, Ton, let me whitewash a little." BTom considered, — "No, no; I reckon !t wouldn't hardly do, Ben, Polly 1b awfully particular about this fence; its got to be done ■ "O, shucks, I'll be just as careful. Now lemme try. Say — I'll you the core of my apple." Well, here. — No, Ben; now don't; I'm afraid — 'I'll give you all of my apple." Tom gave up the brush with seeming reluctance but with alacrity in his heart. And while Ben worked and sweated in the sun, the retired artist sat on a barrel in the shade munching the apple, and planning the slaughter of more innocents. There was no lack of material; — boys happened along every little while; they came to jeer but they remained to whitewash. By the time Ben was fagged out, Tom had traded the next chance to Billy for a kite. And when the middle of the forenoon came, Tom was literally rolling in wealth — twelve marbles, part of a Jew's harp, a spool cannon, a key, a tin soldier, a couple of tadpoles, six fire crackers, a kitten with one eye, a dead rat, a dog collar, the handle of a knife, had all come into his poaMMion. He had had a nice, good, idle time with plenty of com - pany; and the fence had three coats of whitewash. If he hadn't run out of whitewash, he would have bankrupted every boy in the village. ■ One of the chief ends of education is to develop a habit of joyous - in work. To love one's work, to enjoy it in its doing should be a matter of common occurrence and not so uncommon as to be con - sidered a mark of genius. Every professional man, every business man, every person in whose occupation there is free competitive play for Intelligence and judgment takes pleasure or joy in his daily work. Can this satisfaction that comes from the higher employments be obtained in any degree from the lower employments so that the MIMmi of mankind, who must do much of the menial labor, can find satisfaction in their daily toil — a satisfaction independent of pecuniary returns? If the street-sweeper as he clears the street of disease - breeding filth, could realise that his work is saving the lives of hundreds, yes thousands, of children would he not have cause to rejoice In hte work? A child at play is developing habits of cheerfulness and of activity. The more a chili loves play the more he can be led to love work. Let not our aim to sugar-coat tasks but to sweeten work with a real joy in doing. With health, freedom, and absence of fatigue why should not the work of man be analogous to the play of the child? </seg>

To many of the ancients, games were of great importance. The Greeks developed their astonishing physical perfection by their devotion to the element of play in their education. Prom Plato's time down to Froebel's time no definite system of education by play was followed. Pestalozai's and Froebel's teaching have given us much that is best in our primary schools today — the principle of activity and of contact with nature. This influeri' extending through the grades and into all of our teaching. The past decade has given us much literature on the subject of play. No one now questions that play educates; the question is, can we engraft play successfully into our system of education and still have it play? The movement for larger playgrounds, so valiantly fought for by Jacob Riis, is on the lincrease. Supervised play all the year round on public play grounds is popular. The National Association of Public Play Grounds held recently in New York shows the present tendency. In time, this great movement must reach not only the children of the cities but every child in our great nation. While we are waiting for better things there are many golden opportunities in the rural schools as well as the village and city schools to supervise the recess period and make it as important a work for us as teachers as the language or the mathematics may be. tin one of his beautiiful short stories, Metcalfe tells us that, "He would seek rest from the toil and the anxiety of a busy life may it if he but cast dull dignity to the winds and cultivate the nintance of the little ones. The weary man of business renews ;ase upon life, and warms the cockles of his heart; he is brought r to nature, closer to truth, closer to God — as he strolls In the jams that dance among the trees and flowers thriving about the es of nature in the Kingdom of Never Grow Old."

However, I am fat trying situation; one of the largest halls in the state; a great audience made up of beautiful women, of the leading educators of this great commonwealth, and of her most eminent statesmen also, whose names are household words in every hom? from the sunrise coast to th« sun-set sea; a splendid subject — and just a few moments of time. It seems that rapid fire guns have come in vogue on land as well as on the sea. I am reminded tonight of an old veteran. He had stood in the very vanguard of two hundred battles, and one day he was ordered to feed coal into the furnace of an engine. He fled forthwith. It was his first retreat; and, on being asked the cause, he replied that he was not used to that kind of firing. Ladies and Gentlemen. I am not used to this kind of firing.

The great Jupiter of our educational system is wheel - in his orbit; his periodic time is just five minutes; and at the ination of his revolution, no man is able to stand; not even woman, the proverbial woman's tongue. Side Dights; lights in eontra-distinetiop from central lights. Their purpose is to supply light additional to that already given; to lend more light to the room, the avenue, the sea, or to whatever needs illumination. The side light may be circumscribed in its sphere of service by reason of its position, but not on this account is its service less honorable or less essential. Look upon this vast building with its strong pillars, well-set arches, and towering spire. These larger parts are important factors in its Architecture. But no less important in their places are the panes of glass, the slender mouldings, the beautiful frescoes, the light thin shingles or the single nails. I Let me ask you a question: Who fought our nation's battles in wars for freedom and for union? The men with the shoulder &gt;s, the great military lights, received the honors for the most part, they were well fed and well paid, and in the rear, out of danger, r portion of the time. Hut the men in the ranks waged the al warfare; they stood and fought in the face of fire and leaden and wounds and bloodshed and death. In the teaching profession we have our central lights — over at York, here at -Lincoln, up at Omaha, and in other cities and towns. Their work is important in mastering and marshalling the agencies of success, and in stimulating and guiding the larger affairs of our educational system. All honor to them. But over in the village, out in the rural district, hither and yon, throughout the state and the nation, are noble women and high-minded men, doing a work no less important to the rising race, no less potent for our well being as a peo - ple, really no less difficult, and requiring no less talent. Side lights you say, but I tell you. without them the world would be in gross darkness. The side light shines in its place the same as any other, and its light is of the same kind. It must possess the elements of light and use them h&gt; shedding forth its lustrous beams upon a benighted world. These facts, to my mind, suggest knowledge and service. Knowledge: Let education set up her banners; let science flour - ish and learning increase. For knowledge is a large element in char - and one of the foremost factors in human progress. The triumphs of the age are the triumphs of the mind. We have nothing to fear from knowledge. "The scholar," as Emerson says, "is the favorite of heaven, the hope and darling of our race." I urge you to be truth gath - «rers as long as you live — forever. The hardest work on earth is to think. It may be so in heaven, but I bid you do it.

I had hoped the head of the housp would respond to this toast, but after returning from church Sunday — where we listened to a thoughtful sermon by our good pastor from the text "An obedient son maketh a glad father" — I was told that this response would fall to me. A mild protest was my first thought but having had numerous duties and unusual responsibilties the past six months, no protest was made. Mother being in Europe, no appeal could be made in that direction.

We have one of the newer states and until within a score of years, one of the poorer states. However, now we are justly entitled to a pride nowhere else found. For 20 years our Nebraska has had a smaller per cent of illiteracy than any other state; pot only that, but the 1900 census showed illiteracy of children between 10 and 18 was less than found In any other state. The causes are few — the church, the home, the school. Progress of church and home must follow the leadership of the school, hence here the credit lies. Statistics show us to have the greatest number of high schools and higher educational institutions to our population than found elsewhere under the stars and stripes. What would many of the older states think of having 50 per cent of their teaching force attending summer schools? Such is our record for the past two years, followed with an average advance of $100 in annual salary. Last year and this year, we rank first as to percentage of young people in our university, various colleges and normal schools. We must admit that one per cent of the population in college looks small but it is more th&amp;n any other state. This attendance </seg>
            <seg id="p405">318 • cpppars large when we consider that twenty years ago but one-flfteentt of one per cent of our people were graduates above a high school. Forty years ago, a graduate from Ya!e or Harvard was not so well edu - cated as last year's graduate of the 12-grade Xebraska high school. What of our Christian work? Following the school house whic occupies the most prominent place, come the churches with spires reach ing toward the skies, occupied by earnest pastors laboring successfull for Christian manhood and womanhood. Go to Omaha, Lincoln, Fre mont, Hastings, Columbus and other cities and behold the splendi Christian Association buildings from which the people come forth wit higher ideals of life. Observe the grand work of Christian Associa tions in every higher educational institution of the state. What does it mean? My answer is that it is part of the produet of the teacher Are we not entitled to boast of the educated farmer and merchan ani banker — able to thoughtfully discuss questions pertaining to edu cation, religion, government, business and other social institutions — with good homes, good libraries and various luxuries?

We may lay claim to reform legislatures and better laws with outlook for practica temperance legislation from the session which begins in January nex1 You do not read of dishonesty in state, county or city affairs. Teach era, are you feeling proud of this record? A higher order of civilization can come only through education. Where belongs the credit? If sue a record is not sufficient to cause a "puff up."

Men and women in tfie true sense are those who mor Dearly approach Him who taught the great lessons of life as none othe has ever taught. Nebraska has a decidedly small percentage of he people in our jails and penitentiary. Can you find any place wit fewer people in poor houses and other institutions of charity? No our higher courts have but little litigation; we have able judges wit little to do. Even our county courts would be near useless if th matrimonial jurisdiction should be transferred to some other count official. Progressive Nebraskans, .even school teachers, will get married Nebraska education with her energy and her climate makes for Ion life, hence the probate matters in county courts do not furnish sufficien fees for official's livelihood.

Look at the bold letters "Men an A Women," worthy and well-prepared, deserving of great credit but needing do defense, producing a civilization beyood the most hopeful dream of only a few short years ago. Are we satisfied with this product? By no means, for satisfaction means stagnation first an 1 decay afterwards. Do we view the marvelous progress in making this product with a teacher's pride? Certainly, if we are possessed of the good red blood which should be a parcel of every educator. Our "Trade Mark" needs a brief analysis. It means character first — that established quality of being based upon the principle of absolute right, a living power with divine consciousness as its source, a life that thrills every atom with the force of justice, truth an.i righteousness, a permanent attainment which cannot be shaken or influenced from without. It means thinkers and thorough students — an original constructive thinker which makes the individual worth while as an intellectual being, a being who knows be knows and does not seek an excuse for unfavorable circumstances or failure. Character and ability backed with physical development, coupled with faith which unites man with the Infinite, which awakens high and mighty powers of the individual, which illumines the mind with light, truth and wisdom are our aims. ■As an optimist, I see great opportunities and great results as we r appreciate the making of nobler men and women than of the past ?at as it has been.

But as we love the children, the young men and the young women of our schools and colleges, as we love the good God that made and lcves us all, let us keep ever before them and us "the sweet vision of the Holy Grail," which alone can drive us "from all vain-glories, rivalries, and earthly heats that spring and sparkle out among us." "Let knowledge grow from more to more, But more of reverence in us dwell, That mind and soul, according well, May make one music as before But vaster." Such is the educational aim of the Greater Bellevue, — the Uni - versity of Omaha. 1)eAn Charles Fordyce. KWe should not boast of the educational privileges and achievements is country so long as the great majority of our youth have no open to our higher institutions of learning. In 1906 only one-third of one per cent of our students were in colleges and universities. Less than five per cent wrre in our high schools and ninety-five per cent were in the common schools. Nine - tentbs of the American people receive their only education in the ele - mentary schools, not by choice but because there is an impassable gap between the common schools and the university. This gap exists first because much of the instruction in our rural schools is so inferior it does not prepare the child to go on nor does it create a desire on the part of the pupil to pass over the breach; and secondly, the high schools are so r mote as to make them inaccessible to the majority. The chasm can be bridged over in two ways, — first by so improving the I ools as will enable them to give the students a thirst for something higher. This advancement in the quality of the rural schools probably come through the consolidation of districts, the exten - sion and enrichment of the curriculum, and the provisions for means of transporting the pupils to and from school. The second means of closing the gap must lie in the line of improving existing high schools and of increasing their number until they will be accessible to all. The secondary schools of our cities are good, but those of our smaller towns are weak and most of them without inspection and as a result poorly </seg>

These through proper Inspection may be brought to a plane of efficiency and the number increased by the establishment of rural high schools. This will entail a large expenditure of money but history shows that every dollar appro - priated for general education brings large financial returns. Germany's industrial supremacy dates from her establishment of universal educa - tion. Plato taught that the laboring classes need no education at all. but Germany has come to believe that a nation is strong in the degree in which its schools discover for and extend culture to the individual gifts of each of its children. "These personal gifts and facul - ties of its youth if discovered, trained and applied give that expert service upon which the greatness of a nation rests." This is well illus - trated in the nation mentioned, for Germany's strong public and technical schools have turned out a class of citizens that command the markets of the world. But while the Indus-trial life of a nation is the fundament of its strength this is only the superstructure upon which its higher life is erected. Our children must be trained not alone that they may earn bread and butter, but that they may develop into men and women with that strength and beauty of character that may blossom into the fullest manhood and womanhood possible. We should not as teachers boast of our educational system until our elementary schools are such as may inspire every child to a desire for something better, and until the great gap between the common schools and the university is so bridged over that every boy and girl in our commonwealth, not only the favored but those from the lowliest walks of life, may have an open path to that higher culture offered by our colleges and univer- Chancellor Wm.

Two -s I have sat here wrapped in mortal fear as I meditated upon the ue prayer offered by Doctor Bessey. He wisely prayed for abstem - ness in our speaking and asked the Lord to deliver us from ches that are dry. That was a remarkable prayer. An experience of other years comes to mind in this connection. A State Convention of some large fraternal order met in our city, and the Committee on Arrangements had asked me to open the fir.-t session with prayer. After I had offered the prayer to the best of my ability and had taken my seat, one of the bright lights of the local lodge leaned towards me and said: "That was a very good speech you made;" and he said it with all seriousness. But wait a moment: that was not the point I had in mind. I vowed then ana there that I would never make a remark about another man's prayer; but the unique fitness of our opening prayer tonight and the effect it has had upon me compels me to break my vow. I have had to remark upon this </seg>
            <seg id="p413">324 If there is any one on earth who should appreciate and preach the fitness of things it would seem to be the teacher. And how many mistakes, how many shortcomings in life are traceable to our ignorance of, or our indifference to, the fitness of things! I am reminded here of a story which perhaps first appeared in the Atlanta Constitution several years since. I hesitate to tell a story before a body of teachers lest it should prove to be a chestnut; yet this story illustrates my point, and I venture to tell it. Some years ago a country editor visited one of our great cities and observed that the meteropolitan newspapers had a habit of display - ing the most striking news of the world hourly in their window bulle - tins. He conceived the notion that such a plan would work well in the village where he lived and published his little sheet. Acting accord - ingly, the first item of news which he wrote on the blackboard placed in front of his print shop read as follows: "10:30 A. M. — Deacon Jones is sick." A half hour later he erased this and wrote, "11 A. M. — Doctors in consultation over Deacon Jones." Later he again erased what he had written and wrote, "11:30 A. M. — Deacon Jones critically ill." After the lapse of another half hour he wrote, "12 Noon. — Deacon Jones dead and gone to heaven." Then the editor went to dinner. But while he was at dinner a wag came slowly up the street and p«— d before the first bulletin board be 'had ever seen until he ■rasped its meaning, and then erasing the latest item written by the editor, he wrote, "1 P. M. — Great excitement in heaven; Deacon Jones not yet arrived; the worst is feared." Now, the only trouble with that bulletin board lay in its violation of the fitness of things. There is a special fitness in our saying in this magnificent presence that character is the chief qualification of the teacher, and the teacher should be the first to see and teach this truth. Character creates an atmosphere. I have had many teachers, but all who have made their influence live in my life could be numbered on the fingers of one band. The others were book and rote teachers. A teacher who tries to over-awe his students thereby bears witness to the fact that he is not sure of his own intellectual anchorage. Ability preaches. Character does not need to resort to the "over-awing" method. It does not need to do a great deal of preaching in words; it shines and creates a radiance wherever it is. It makes the teacher's desk a radiant spot for every student. It cannot be its best or do its best unless it is communicative; so communicativeness and sympathy are its natural functions. A teacher who has character has a mighty asset: for, other things being equal, he alone is equipped to perform the two chief functions of teaching, which are illumination and inspiration. Professor Gertrude H- Gardner.

Peculiarities in individuals attract attention, but not necessarily re - spect or admiration. Physical strength, beauty, technical knowledge, theories, all attract a passing notice, but none of them build a lasting impression. None of these is a detriment, but all of them are not sufficient for our subject. What then shall we require in this Man of the Hour? Strength of character, integrity, is a necessity. Judgment, gained from a practical knowledge of the world is a positive essential. Decision, with a keen regard for justice for all, is an absolute requisite. Execution must be there. Deeds and not words are required I The composite of all these is rpsponsibility, — Therefore the Man of Hour is one who accepts responsibility, individual responsibility, her that is found in the school room, the business world, the of congress, or in the guiding of our ship of state. B Where can we find a better type of the Man of the Hour, than ir own esteemed president, Theodore Roosevelt? I For the last few months, however, we have been far more inter - in two men who can truly be called "The Men of the Hour," r one of whom the American people believe to be competent of flll - he highest office in the land. I cannot better characterize these nen, thaD by quoting Edmund Vance Cooke in his little poem called "Oh he's big and broad and breezy! He's the hero of the hour, And his look is large and easy As a man who knows his power. He is sensible and smiling. He is genuine all thru, An there is no false beguiling In his steadfast look at you. He's as clear eyed as the eagle, and as fearless as the lion. And his name is Bill, — big Billy Taft! or maybe Big Bill Bryan. "He is masterful and ready; He's the champion of right; He's the only heir of Teddy And 'he'll carry on the fight. He was made to lead the nation And to meet a people's need; He was born to bring salvation From the grasping gods of Greed. </seg>
            <seg id="p415">326 And the day the good Lord made him all the angels looked and laughed: And his name is big Bill Bryan! or perhaps, it's big Bill Taft. "Oh, he's brainy and he's brawny, And in him all hopes are met; And his hair is black and tawny, And his eyes are blue as jet. Oh, he's wide and wise and wary, And a statesman to his toes, And he's from Nebraska's prairie.

"That's ing," replied the prisoner, "I have that in my pocket," and "six he in jail," added the judge. "Can you find that in your pocket?" when I was asked to speak on a subject having so much to do politics, I felt that I didn't have it anywhere about my clothes. The Schoolman as a Politician! Who is a politician? A little boy once asked his father this question and the old man who had been disappointed several times in his attempt to secure a political appoint - ment eaid, "My son, a politician is a man whose idea of Heaven is a place where the wicked cease from troubling and the weary are at rest." But ladies and gentlemen, I am going to assert and I stand ready to defend the assertion, that a politician is a whole lot like other e, only more so; and you and I know that a schoolman is a whole lot like other people for who ever heard of a schoolman refusing a raise in salary or neglecting to cash his monthly school order at the earliest possible convenience. I have proven that a schoolman is a whole lot like other people and I need not go further in proving that a politician is like other people for that is common talk. I therefore conclude In geometric reasoning that a schoolman is a politician. But eeriously, ladies and gentlemen, if it is the business of the </seg>

Our schools are the result of the labors of statesmen of old. Our government advances as the schools of this country develop higher I of men and women, and the schools in turn* progress as the gover: approaches its ideal. As the schools progress the government progresses; as the schools retrograde the government retrogrades. I do not think too much credit can be given any institution which has for its purpose the making of better citizens out of boys and girls and more especially do I refer to the public schools. The free schools because of the education of the masses are the greatest assurance we have of American stability and true progress and the school's house over which floats the stars and stripes is the greatest bulwark of national integrity. Here it is that the sons and daughters of the poor and the sons and daughters of the rich meet upon a common plane for a common purpose. Here it is that the boys and girls reared in ignorance meet with those of more or less refinement and culture and receive the same advantages. I The schoolman holds in his hand the destiny of our land, he holds is hands a responsibility so great that you may well shudder when think of the immensity of it. Look at the situation a moment, das a room full of young Americans and this means a heterogeneous ture, their parentage representing a great many of the nations of earth. He may be educating a teacher or a preacher, likely a poll - in, possibly a president. One-half of those in his charge will be - e electors having in their hands the destiny of our land and the r half will become the mothers of the children yet to come. We point with pride to men high on the scroll of public deeds but no higher should they be placed than the teacher who through noble Inspiration and example placed in the minds of the these men the ideals of civic righteousness. (That teacher who gives his life to the making of better men and en out of boys and girls is the greatest benefactor of mankind the nation's greatest asset.

There are nearly thirty millions of boys and girls of school age in the United States mad about five hundred thousand teachers employed in our public schools. The current expenses approximate four hundred million dollars annually. I In view of the Improved methods and enlarged facilities of the ;nt, what may we not reasonably anticipate with respect to the schol - ip of the future.

It is interesting to observe the influence of education manifested in the lives of men and women employed in the various pursuits of life, also its influence in national affairs. In the discharge of civic duties knowledge and intellectual power are essential qualifications. As I have studied the work of men in the House and Senate of the American Congress, on the bench of the Supreme Court of the United States, in the Cabinet and in the White House, intellectual strength and weakness have been forced into irresist - ible contrast. Those who possess the mastery of their intellectual powers, know how to think and reason from sound premises to logical conclusions, are always the men who lead the way and control the confidence of their associates and of the country. As we review our educational system we must place due emphasis upon the work of the public schools, for they lay the foundations in the elementary stages of intellectual development. The efficiency of the work per - formed there will contribute very largely to the greater success through the academy, the college and university. Last September my wife and I gathered some interesting observa - tions that are buggestive of the different stages of intellectual progress. One bright morning we boarded the "Hendrick Hudson" in New York City for a journey up the Hudson River — that famous stream, frequently described among rivers as the QueeD "decked with romance, jeweled lad with history and crowned with beauty. " That stream is recognized as the "noble threshold to a great continent, with New York Bay as a fitting portal." During the entire day we journeyed up the stream, and after viewing the highlands, the cascades, the Berkshire Hills and mountains with their foliage, and the valleys with their carpets of green we glided peacefully, under sweet strains of music from the orchestra, to the dock in Albany at six o'clock in the evening. After spending the following day in the city of Albany we started at tight o'clock in the evening upon our return to New York City. We </seg>

Presently we observed the searchlight falling upon the right bank; it moved gently along the shore and then dropped to the left bank, disclosing the turn in the stream and the objects of danger to be avoided. Again to the right — then to the left; back and forth it played, revealing the objects of danger and the course of safety. By the hour we watched in admi - ration as the pilot, with the aid of the searchlight, held securely in the path of safety. When we retired to our stateroom the searchlight was still pointing the way, and in the morning we awoke and found our boat anchored safely at its pier in the city of New York. In this fascinating scene I was reminded of the work of the intel - lectual leaders of the youth of the Nation, casting the searchlight of intellectual power along the pathway of the educational process, shield - ing the boys and girls from the dangers of the journey and guiding safely in the course of intellectual progress. When the public schools complete their part of this journey, the academy with a stronger searchlight, then the college with a still stronger searchlight, and then the university, will lead onward and onward into the boundless ocean of knowledge and truth — that priceless inheritance of the human Honor abU William hniinjs 3rnn. (Address of the Hon. William Jennings Bryan at the Union School Banquet of the Nebraska State Teachers' Association. City Auditorium. Lincoln, November 4. 1908. Over 1,000 teachers participates in the banquet and about 1,SM teachers were in the galleries for the after dinner speeches. Mr. Bryan was given a signal ovation by person in the auditorium rising and giving the Chautauqua salu^ Mr. Toastmaster, ladies and gentlemen: — I am glad to participate in this meeting though my stay with you must be brief. I appre - ciate the invitation that brings me here and the companionship which I have here with the officers of your association, with Chancellor Andrews of our state university, with Governor Sheldon, ani with other invited guests. Professor McBrien says that he is introducing me to the most magnificent audience I have ever aidressed anywhere in the world. In introducing nir in those words he has precluded me from entering into a joiDt debate with him. I will not dispute, even after election, that this is a splendid audience. In fact, I am very proud of Nebraska's system of education and the Nebraska teachers. I really feel more at home among teachers than you might suppose. While I have had no actual experience as a school teacher, I have from my youth had in anticipation a closer association with educational work than I have yet been able to enjoy. It is still a part of my life plan to come into more intimate contact with students and thus have a larger share in the direction of student life. I appreciate the work of the teacher, for the teacher shares with the parent the responsibility of developing character and plant - ing the ideals which control life. More and more does the value of the </seg>
            <seg id="p419">330 ideal grow upon me. Give a man bread and be will hunger again, him clothes and his clothes will wear out, but give him an ideal ana that ideal will be with him through every waking hour, lifting him 10 a higher plane in life and giving him a broader conception of his on to his fellows. To get the child to take a firm holi of a well - rounded conception of life is the greatest work of those who deal with oung. So many lives are aimless, purposeless and without plan. A preacher once presented this thought in a sermon built upon the text, "What Then?" Taking a child in school he asked the question. The child answers by describing the plans which he has for school; and what then? The college follows; and what th?n? The preparation for tome particular work; and what then? The development of that work until it has been tried cut and its results garnered in; and what then? The latter years when one enjoys the fruits of his coil and waita for the lengthening shadows; and what then? Thus did the min - ;iursue his questioning until he had completed the outline of a life and the preparation for eternity. And one cannot follow this course of reasoning without concluding that no ideal is high enough for a noble life that is not high enough to be seen from both sides of the river that separates time from eternity. It will be a part of your work to cultivate individual ideals, and the thought that you must constantly impress upon the child is that he must measure life, not by what he gsts out of the world but hat he puts into it. I received a letter some time ago from a little boy in a western state. He said that he expected to be prssident some day and that his brother was going to be a justice of the supreme court. I try to answer children's letters, even when I have no time to answer the letters of grown people. For the older people know that I am busy and might excuse me for not answering, while the children would never think of that. I told this little boy that I hoped he might realize his ambition and that his brother might, also, but that before either of them was old enough to hold any high office they would both learn that it was more important that they should do something for others than that others should do something for them. It is not strange that a child should take a very selfish view of life, for the t It m glad to do everything possible for the chili. It is encouraged to attend school, and the pleasures of vacation are held out as a reward. Christmas brings its presents, and every - day sacrifices are made by the parents for the chili. It is quite natural, therefore, that the child should come to regard itself as the center toward which all things should turn. It is the duty of the teacher to correct this impression and impress upon the child that its happiness will be proportionate to its helpfulness and that it is, after all, more blessed to give than to receive. The teacher must also assist in the cultivation of a proper national ideal, and one of the most essential elements of the national ideal </seg>

It simply means that the majority has the right to make its own mistakes and that no smaller portion of the population has a divine right to make mistakes for the rest. The recognition of the right of the majority to rule not only reconciles the minority to defeat but it prevents the use of cor - rupt means to thwart the will of the majority or secure from the public that which the public would not knowingly grant. The social ideal is the only other ideal which I have time to men - tion. I might properly call it the economic ideal which should be realized in society, viz., that each individual should draw from society a reward proportionaate to that individual's contribution to society. Justice requires this and will be satisfied with nothing less. Inequity in the distribution of the rewards of the joint toil of the world is the world's greatest evil today. Unless each one shares a reward pro - portionate to his service, the sense of justice is offended and endeavor is discouraged. The teacher ought to lead the pupil to expect no more than this, and all who have an influence in the creation of public opinion should seek to secure an approximation to this standard in the matter of rewards. There is, of course, a religious principle that runs parallel with this, viz., that those who are able to earn more than their fellows or are more fortunate than their fellows should hold what they earn as a trust to be employed, not merely in selfish indulgence but for the promotion of the general good. No one should be forced to accept less than his fair share in order that someone else may receive more than a fair share, but one's enjoyment of that which he justly earns is increased when he voluntarily shares with one less fortunate and thus adds a spiritual delight to mere physical enjoyment. I am sure you will pardon me if I make one application of what I have said with regard to the laws of rewards. I have spoken of the important work which the teacher does. I am now prepared to add that I believe the teacher's compensation is inadequate, if we measure that compensation by the service which the teacher renders. We en - trust our children to the teacher at that tender period when the child is susceptible to influence, and the good teacher returns our children to us strengthened and fitted to be a joy to us in our old age. The teacher's salary is, as a rule, very small compared with the salary of others, if we compare the work for which other recompense is given. Whenever one part of society is underpaid it means that some other part of society is overpaid, and I respectfully submit that the teachers who will agree with me that they are underpaid owe it to themselves and to society to urge such a re-adjustment of rewards as will bring about a fairer basis than is now employed. But pardon me. I did not come to make a speech but merely to acknowledge the courtesies shown me when the invitation was extended and to testify by my presence to my deep interest in your 23 </seg>

For this purpose a confer - ence of county superintendents was held in the office of the state superintendent of public instruction, Lincoln, September 6-7, 1905. Of the thirty-one county superintendents present, representing all sections of the state, and from the opinions expressed by letter by a large number of other county superintendents who could not be present, only three contended for an acceptance of all grades, without exam - ination, on certificates granted under the old law when applying for the first certificate under the new law. At least twenty superintend - ents were in favor of an examination in about three-fourths of the required subjects; about six superintendents preferred an examination in all subjects. A happy compromise was reached in a decision that when a first, second or third grade county certificate granted under the old law expired, the holder thereof, in order to secure the first cer - tificate under the new law, would be required to take an examination before the state examining board for county certificates in the follow - ing five essential subjects: reading, arithmetic, grammar, geography and history. Since that time until the present an earnest crusade has been waged in behalf of these subjects in every state, private and denom - inational school authorized by law to grant teachers' certificates in Nebraska, and our rural high schools have given greater emphasis to these subjects than ever before in the history of our state. Let us make the crusade perpetual, solely on the importance of the subjects. What to teach our teachers in the training schools and what our teachers should teach their pupils in the public schools is the paramount issue in American education today. In Nebraska there is but one subject, under the existing statute, which it is mandatory to teach, namely, physiology and hygiene with especial reference to the effect of alcoholic stimulants and other narcotics upon the human system. "There is needed, too, a thorough knowledge of phytiology, both temperance and the other kind; not merely for better health, but be - cause it is vital to wise school administration. Moreover, the problem of fatigur. of exercise, of physical training, the relation of learning to physical growth — in fact, nearly all of the questions raised by modern pedagogy — demand a good knowledge of physiology. "After making the teaching of physiology a condition precedent to sharing in the state apportionment of public school funds, the law gives the local school officers authority to say what shall be taught in the respective school districts of the state, except in rural school districts, where the course of study is established with the consent and advice of the county superintendent. </seg>
            <seg id="p424">333 There Is now a great conviction taking fast hold upon the lead - ing educators and the people everywhere that it is better to teach muoh of a few things rather than a little of many things. And &amp;o came to pan our crusade for the five essentials — reading, arithmetic, gram - mar, geography, and history. By reading we mean not only the ability to grasp the thought of the printed page In the silent study of the book, newspaper or magazine, but the art of good oral expression. Read - ing must comprise a knowledge of our best literature and include a mastery of the art of correct spelling, punctuation, pronunciation, and the proper use of the dictionary. Every public school teacher should be a good oral reader. Arithmetic should be intensive rather than exten - sive. Eliminate stocks and bonds, exchange, alligation, duodecimals; and all such impractical subjects. Make rapidity and accuracy the watchword in the fundamental operations. Let thoroughness and ex - actness be the motto in the principles and applications of fractions, denominate numbers and percentage. These are the indispensable things to be mastered in arithmetic. This subject should also com - prise mental arithmetic. Quoting Dr. Edward Brooks: "The value of mental arithmetic is two-fold: first as a mental discipline; second, as uns of cultivating arithmetical power. Mental arithmetic gives culture to the reasoning faculties, cultivates the power of attention, gives culture to the memory, cultivates exactness of language, sharp - ens and strengthens the mind in general, prepares a pupil for extem - poraneous speaking, and gives the pupil the power of independent thought in arithmetic and is an excellent preparation for algebra." Grammar should include English composition and letter writing. Tet how few of our eighth grade pupils, high school graduates, and even teachers possess the ability to write a good letter. The subject of letter writing is the most generally practiced and, practically considered, the most important of all kinds of composition. It is indispensable in busi - ness. To be able to write a good letter is greatly to one's advantage in any occupation. Many excellent situations are obtained by teachers. clerks and others on account of this ability, and quite as many are lost through the want of it. In geography, nature study, agriculture and commerce it must be given consideration. History nrust not only tell the story of our country — it must teach the principles of free govern - ment and the duties of American citizenship. KAs already stated we have selected reading, arithmetic, grammar, raphy and history as the five essentials. Let us consider briefly nerits of each of these subjects from the standpoint of both the er and the pupil as stated by men of affairs. READING. Quoting President Felmley: "Every teacher should be a superior oral reader. Every poem was written to be read aloud. The first step in teaching a poem is not to have the'allusions looked up, the words de - fined, or the sentances parsed. It is not to discuss the meter, the rhymes and alliteration, the figures of speech, useful as some of these </seg>
            <seg id="p425">334 are. It is rather to read the poem to the pupils so well that its music ■hall be heard; its rhythm, its melody, its harmony of sound and sense, that give charm to every great work of literary art. The teacher must understand and feel the thought and spirit of the poem; but unless he has perfected his voice as an instrument of expression, he can do little to awaken an appreciation of its beauty and power. The few teachers who can read well often seem afraid to read to their pupils. The child - ren enjoy it so much that it seems like wasting time, if not positively wicked. We still hold to the opinion that work is what you don't like to do. Too much time may be devoted to reading aloud mere books of information, which have no special literary merit. After the mechan - ics of reading are mastered in the first four or five years, all reading aloud should be of literature — literature in the best sense. There has b«ea in the past few years a lamentable decay in the art of oral expres - sion, especially in our Mgh schools. There is no possibility of relief until good reading is made an essential qualification of the teacher." Hear ye also Dr. Richard Edwards, one of the greatest educators America ever produced, in behalf of the subject: "Let pupils and teachers study and thoroughly master the lofty thought and the grand descriptions of Hawthorne. Let them become accustomed to the beauti - ful imagery and the gentle spirit of Longfellow. Let them enjoy the chaste humor and the gentile satire of Holmes. Let them seek to un - derstand the profound but simple philosophy of Emerson. Let them follow Thoreau into his retired communion with Nature and be educa - ted by her simple teachings. Let their minds be enlightened and their taste Improved by the thorough but genial scholarship of Lowell. Let them be transformed by the profoundly earnest but gentle influence of Whittier. In the study of each of these authors there is a possibil - ity of valuable culture. The works which these men have given us are a rich and goodly heritage. It is in all respects wise for us to im - prove it to the best of our ability." • ARITHMETIC. Let Dr. Edward Brooks, formerly superintendent of Philadelphia. public schools, speak for arithmetic. "There is reasoning in Arithmetic. All reasoning Is a process of comparison; it consists in comparing one idea or object of thought with another. Comparison requires a stand - ard, and this standard is the old, the axiomatic, the known. To these standards we bring the new, the theoretic, the unknown, and compare them that we may understand them. The law of correct rea - soning, therefore, is to compare the new with the old, and the theoretic with the axiomatic, the unknown with the known. "This process, simple as it seems, is the real process of all reason - ing. We pass from idea to truth, and from lower truth to higher truth, in the endless chain of science, by the simple process, of compar - ison. Thus the facts and phenomena of the material world are under - stood, the laws of nature interpreted, and the principles of science evolved. Thus we pass from the old to the new, from the simple to the </seg>
            <seg id="p426">335 complex, from the known to the unknown. Thus we discover the truths and principles of the world of matter and mind, and construct the various sciences. Comparison is a science-builder; it is the architect which erects the temples of truth, vast, symmetrical, and beautiful. I "In mathematics this process is, perhaps, more clearly exhibited i in any other science. In geometry, the definitions and axioms the standards of comparison; beginning in these we trace our way 1 the simplest primary truth to the profoundest theorem. In arlth - ic we have the same basis, and proceed by the same laws of logical ution. Definitions, as a description of fundamental ideals, and ax - i, as the statement of intuitive and necessary truths, are the foun - on upon which we rear the superstructure of the science of numbers. "These vlswe though admitted in respect to geometry, have not al - ways been fully recognized as true of arithmetic. The subject, as pre - sented in the old text-books, was simply a collection of rules for numerical operations. The pupil learned the rules and followed them, without any idea of the reason for the operation dictated. There was do thought, no deduction from principle; the pupil plodded on, like a beast of burden or an unthinking machine. There was, in fact, ae the subject was presented, no science of arithmetic. We had a science of geometry, pure, exact, and beautiful, as it came from the hand of the great masters. Beginning with primary conceptions and Intuitive truths, the pupil could rise step by step from the simplest axiom to the loftiest theorem; but when he turned his attention to numbers, he found do beautiful relations, no interesting logical processes., nothing but a collection of rules for adding, subtracting, calculating the cost of groceries, reckoning interest, etc. Indeed, so universal was this dark - ness, that the metaphysicians argued that there could be no reasoning in the science of numbers, that it Is a science of intuition; and the poor pupil, not possessing the requisite intuitive power, was obliged to plod along in doubt, darkness, and disgust. I "Thus things continued until thie light of popular education began •read over the land. Men of thought and genius began to teach dements of arithmetic to young pupils; and the n-ecessity of pre - ng the processes so that children could see the reason for them, n to work a change in the science of numbers. Then came the od of arithmetical analysis, in that little gem of a book by Warren am. It touched the subject as with the wand of an enchantress. It began to glow with Interest aDd beauty. What before was dull ne, now became animated with the spirit of logic, and arithmetic enabled to take its place beside its sister branch, geometry, In ty and value as an educational agency." ENGLISH GRAMMAR. The importance of the study of English grammar can hardly be over-stated. Prof. William D. Whitney of Yale University, and editor - in-chief of the Century Dictionary says* "Give me a man who can, </seg>
            <seg id="p427">336 Ki full intelligence, take to pieces an English sentence, brief but not complicated, even, and I will welcome him as better prepared for h«r study in other languages than if he had read both Caesar and 11, and could parse them in the routine style in which they are 11 parsed." English grammar comprises letter writing and composition. Yet how few of our high school graduates and even teachers possess the ability to write a good letter. The subject of letter writing is the most generally practiced, and, practically considered, the most important of all kinds of composition. It ,is indispensable in business. To be able to write a good letter is greatly to one's advantage in any occupation. Many excellent situations are obtained by teachers, clerks, and others, on account of this ability; and quite as many are lost through the want of it. GEOGRAPHY. Dr. George E. Condra of the University of Nebraska, has the floor for geography. Listen to what he says: "It is rather difficult for me to estimate the full importance of the various school subjects. I believe the different branches should not be caused to stand out very promi - nently in the lower grades. Yet we can readily see that certain lines of study and teaching seem best adapted and at the same time most es - sential at different stages of the pupil's progress. The subjects are to serve the taught. The basis of selection must be the pupil with his obligations to self and to society. He must learn to see, do and be right. In all this he is influenced both directly anj indirectly by his environment. The mission of geography is to open the eyes and mind of pupils to the physical and industrial world in close proximity to them. McMurray says: 'Geography is the connecting bridge between two great real studies, — nature and men.' I "The subject is many sided. It treats in its own way our food sup - shelter, commerce, and adaptations to geographic conditions. It ds a very necessary mental contact with nature, at the proper time, out which higher education is not possible. Summarizing, we may that the subject is natural, practical', economic, and cultural. Can ;ay more of any other branch? II am not able to line up the principal subjects in the one, two, order, but it appears to me that geography and its nature study it is a neoessary and important study, and should not be omitted the list. The Committee of Fifteen reports as follows: 'After letic, which treats of the abstract or general conditions of mater - stence. comes geography, with a practical study of man's natural t and its relations to him.' "The Committee of Fifteen says further: 'The child commences with what is nearest to his interests, and proceeds gradually toward what is to be studied for its own sake. It is therefore a mistake to suppose that the first phase of geography presented to the child should be the </seg>
            <seg id="p428">337 enres of climate and lands and waters and obstacles that separate peo - ples, and study the methods by which man strives to equalize or over - come these differences by industry and commerce, to unite all places and all people, and make it possible for each to share in the productions of alL The Industrial and commercial idea is therefore the first cen - tral Idea in the study of geography in the elementary schools. It leads directly to the natural elements of difference in climate, soil, and pro - ductions, and also to those in race, religion, political status, and occu - pations of the inhabitants, with a view to explain the grounds and reasons for this counter-process of civilzation which struggles to over - come the differences. Next comes the deeper inquiry into the process of continent formation, the physical struggle between the process of up - heaving or building of continents and that of their obliteration by air and water; the explanation of the mountains, valleys, the plains, the islands, volcanic action, the winds, the rain distribution. But the study of the cities, their location, the purposes they serve as collecting, manufacturing, and distributing centers, leads most directly to th mediate purpose of geography in the elementary school. From this beginning and holding to it as a permanent interest, the inquiry into causes and conditions proceeds concentrically to the sources of the raw materials, the methods of their production and the climatic, geologic, and other reasons that explain their location and growth The Right Hon. James Bryce, M. P., wrote the following in behalf of geography in the Journal of Geography, May, 1902: "We are now all agreed that geography is the foundation of his - tory, and that the historian must know geography. It is perhaps not equally necessary that the geographer should know history. At the same time a geographer may gain a great deal by knowing some - thing of history, and some branches of his subject will remain incom - unless he possesses that knowledge. Without pursuing subject in detail it may serve to illustrate the proposition that geography is the key to history if I mention some branches of history upon which geography pours, a direct and illuminating light. One cf these, for instance, is ethnography. The whole study of thp of mankind and their connections with one another, and their ming - ling and blending with one another, and their passage from one part of the earth's surface to another, evidently depends upon a knowledge of geography and in particular of physical geography, because It is these physical conditions that have influenced the movements and blendings. So linguistic history, which is almo6t a branch of ethnography, is another subject on which the -geographer can throw light. Or take the case of military history, itself a branch of political history, and consider how much physical geography has to tell the student of wars and campaigns, about the importance of lines of communication, the significance of mountain ranges and rivers, the places available for fortification whether by seas or rivers, or on hills. Tou will see at once that a knowledge of the physical </seg>
            <seg id="p429">338 geography of a country is essential to a man who studies military history in a scientific spirit. Then if you come to that large branch of history for which we have no satisfactory English name, it is what Germans call Kulturgeschichte, the history or the social and economical progress of man, the history of the kind of culture which expresses itself in social life and artistic life and the develop - ment of letters and learning and science — that branch again is of course intimately connected on many sides with the physical environ - ments of the countries in which a civilization has been developed. You may find in such a book for Instance as Mr. Payne's recently published "History of the New World called America,' how the whole history of the aboriginal American peoples, and especially of those who early attained to a certain measure of civilization, can be treated most profitably in connection with the physical conditions under which they lived, and under which the latter outstripped their fellows. "An extremely interesting aspect under which geography ought always to be studied In relation to history is the change in relation of man to his environment between earlier and later times. This is, a special point which I will do no more than indicate, but you will see how interestingly it might be worked out. While man is still in his primitiv.? stage and not yet civilized he Is in entirely different rela - tion to natural conditions from that which he bears when he has invented arts and sciences, and when he has become master of the forces of nature. In this primitive state defense against wild crea - tures and ease of procuring food were his great necessities, but in his more advanced stage it 1s the facility wherewith he can obtain Kiply of those forces of nature which he can bend and use for wn purposes that becomes the most active agent in advancing irther progress. "There is also one aspect of the relations of geography and his - tory which is of great importance, and that is the history of geo - graphical discovery. We do not always, in our teaching of history, quite enough importanoe to making the pupil realize the quantity of geographical knowledge which was possessed at different periods of the Earth's history by the various peoples who Inhabited it. Many a young man may go through the university course having realised very imperfectly what was the amount of geographical knowledge that was possessed by the ancient world at different epochs, and similarly the steps by which geographical discoveries fince thi? days of the Portuguese in the middle of the 15th century have been advanced. It adds much to the interest of study and it explains many of the phenomena of history to make the pupil at stage of his progress have a picture of the world as then Vnown before his mind, and to realize where it was that darkness lay and on what points light had from time to time fallen during the </seg>
            <seg id="p430">339 of the various continents and oceans of the world. For that par - pose we want a greater Dumber of historical maps in our atlases than we generally possess, and I am sure on the walls of a college lecture - room nothing could be more serviceable than to have these con - stantly displayed before the pupil. It may be that in the best his - torical schools this is now done. It was not so twenty or thirty years ago. Lastly, the third aspect in which geography comes into education, or rather the third of the aspects that I am asking you to consider, for there are doubtless other aspects. Is that in which it is regarded as the basis of commerce. Commerce reduced to its simplest terms is an exchange of products, and both the maker of any article and the exporter of that article ought to know where each article can best be produoed, whence the raw material used in manufacture come, which are the places best adapted for manufacture, and where are the best markets. To use the words of Virgil, the merchant ought to know quid quaeque ferat regis et quid quaeque recuset, what each country bears and what each country refuses to bear. He ought to know what are the conditions under which the product can be obtained, what are the conditions of labor that determine the getting it and transporting it, what are the markets, whether near or distant, Id which it may best be disposed of and where requirements affect its production, and what are the lines of communication and transportation along which it can best (most swiftly and profitably) be carried, whether by sea or land." AMERICAN HISTORY. No person should take upon himself the grave responsibilities of teaching without a comprehensive, minute, practical knowledge of the history of his country. A narrow view can no longer be taken in the study and Id the teaching of American history. Hear Senator Bever - idge on this point: "The dominant notes in American history have thus far been self-government aod internal improvements. But these were not ends; they were means. They were modes of preparation, The dominant notes in American life henceforth will be, not only for self - government and internal development, but also administration and world improvement." The value of history cannot be better stated than in the words of Gladstone: "The several kinds of knowledge need to be balanced one with another, somewhat as the several limbs of the body need a propor - tional exercise in order to secure a healthy and equitable development. The knowledge of the hiaavenly bodies, the knowledge of the planet on which we fire, and the qualities, of all its material elements and of all Its living orders — valuable, nay invaluable as it may be shown to be, Is nevertheless knowledge wholly inferior in rank to the knowl - edge of the one living order that beyond measure tran - scends all the rest, and that has for perhaps Its most distinctive char - acteristic this — that it possesses a history. This history is among the </seg>
            <seg id="p431">340 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT It introduces as to forms of thought aDd action, which are infinitely di - versified; it gives us far larger materials of Judgment upon human con - duct, and upon the very springs of action than aDy present experience can confer. The historical mind is the judicial mind in the exactness of its balance; it is the philosophic mind in the comprehensiveness and refinement of its view." I The great lesson of history, according to Froude, is this: "The Id is built somehow on moral foundations; in the long run, it is with the good ; in the long run it is ill with the wicked. Opinions -, manners change, creeds rise and fall, but the moral law is writ - on tablets of eternity. For every false word or unrighteous deed, cruelty and oppression, for lust or vanity, the price to be paid ist ; not always by the chief offenders, but paid by some one. Jus - and truth alone endure and live. Injustice and falsehood may be -lived, but doomsday comes at last to them, in French revolution other terrible ways." Let no teacher fail to impress upon the ris - generation the great lesson of history. cA High and Honorable 'Profession, State Department of Education. Ehe grandeur and importance of the teacher's work has never given greater emphasis than by President Roosevelt in fafe s before the National Educational Association, July 7, 1905, at Grove, New Jersey. I "It is not too much to say that the characteristic work of the Re - c is that done by the teachers; by the teachers, for whatever our comings as a nation may be — and we have certain shortcomings — ave at least firmly grasped the fact that we cannot do our part in lifficult and all-important work of self-government, that we cannot and govern ourselves, unless we approach the task with developed s, and with what counts for more than developed minds, with ed characters. "You teachers — and it is a mere truism to say this — you teachers make the whole world your debtor, and of you it can be said, as it can be said of no other profession save the profession of the ministers of the gospel themselves; if you teachers did not do your work well, tWs republic would not outlast the span of a generation. K Moreover, as an incident to your avowed work, you render some igh unbelievable services to the country. For instance, you ren - 3 this republic the prime, the vital service of amalgamating into ODe homogeneous body the children of those who are born here and of those who come here from so many different lands abroad. Tou furnish a common training and common ideals for the children of all the mixed peoples who are here being fused into one nationality.

The true teacher is the best and noblest citizen of the commonwealth. She must possess a broad and accu - rate scholarship. Her every thought and plan must be developed in the light of professional learning. By an unerring judgment she must select the knowledge most useful to the children. She must be skilled in the science and art of school government. An intense patriotic sentiment must be among her cardinal virtues, an unfaltering faith in humanity one of her marked characteristics. A heart power that is profound and inspiring must be one of her noblest attributes. Though a conversationalist by nature, she will make it a constant rule to talk always as well as she can. Her personality Is pleasing, her de - meanor captivating. She is an adept in that rarest of social traits, — the flexibility of adaptation. She is fortunate in her physical strength. She is obedient to the laws of health and she cultivates the same habit among her pupils. By example as well as by precept she teaches the godliness of cleanliness. In dress she is tasteful without extravagance. In all of her work she teaches much of a few things rather than a little of many things. She kDows that it is better to Inspire the heart with a noble sentiment than to teach the mind a truth of science. She does both. An irreproachable character is her supreme charm, and an untiring industry her great genius. She is no amateur adventurer nor reckless pretender, but one fitted by nature and training for her signal calling. The opportunity laid upon her is matchless; matchless also is her responsibility. She should not be hired through the favoritism of the spoils politician nor the nepotism of some selfish relative, but she should hold her place under the merit system on her own tenure of office. As a matter of simple justice she should receive a salary commensurate with her qualifications and her success. Her final reward will be better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold. The true teacher knows that knowledge does not comprise all that is contained in the broad term of education. The feelings are to be disciplined, the passions restrained, true and worthy motives inspired; a profound religious sentiment instilled and pure morality inculcated under all circumstances. She will teach her pupils that integrity and industry are the best possession that can ever come to young men and young women in this life. She will teach her boys that "every man who falls below his highest, harms not only himself, but lowers the standard of his country; that every man who values wealth more than honesty, rank more than character, amusement rather than im - provement, ease more than reform, to that extent falls short of the </seg>

She will teach her girls that "every woman who abuses the freedom of AmericaD womanhood by unfaithfulness, lends the powerful encitement of her personality to the slavery of the past and to the failure of the republic; that every woman who leaves the duty and decorum of her native land and prostitutes her American home to the scandals, the vices, the social immoralities and moral impurities of foreign cities, not only compasses her own shame, but mars the fair fame and name of all Columbia's daughters." She will teach her boys and girls that "it is only by surpassing the world in all chivalry and dignity, in all modesty aDd purity, in the integrity of our business, in the virtue of our homes, in the rectitude of our intelligence, in the aspiration of our intellectual life under the absolute control of moral righteousness, that we can meet the respon- sibilities of American citizenship."

            <seg id="p445">351 L. C. Handy Every one will be shocked to hear of the death of L. C. Harnly. assistant In State Superintendent McBrlen's office. It came so sud - denly and so unexpectedly that no one was prepared for it. Mr. Harnly was a young man full of vigor and energy and in the best of health. He had just been away for his annual vacation when he was taken seriously 111 with typhoid fever, which be withstood scarcely two weeks. Mr. Harnly is well known to a large number of the school people of the state. He was known as a careful, efficient, faithful worker. What he did never needed to be done again. Much of his work was of a statistical nature and his figures nev«r needed to be revised. Personally he was a true friend, unsel - fish and devoted to his duties as a citizen and as a father and husband. No one of us can liope to leave a better record behind. He was the soul of honor, of truth, and devoted beyond measure to his duties and his associates. — Nebraska Teacher, November, 1907. Following the fall election of 1900 I began casting about for an office force. In this I was ably assisted by Mr. McBrien, to whom I had offered the position of deputy, and by whom I was introduced to L. C. Harnly. I was immediately attracted and profoundly im - pressed by Mr. Harnly's frank, manly bearing, his sincerity of purpose and rugged, sterling character, as well as his magnificent personal appearance. I offered him a place in, the office and never during the four years we worked together did I have occasion to regret my choice. Never w&gt;as a man more loyal to the interests of the state or other employer. He was no time server. During that first strenuous year of hard service which was new to all of us (1901) he spent many an evening in the office hard at work without extra com - pensation or apparent thought of it. He was dependable at all times, hard working, earnest, thoughtful and resourceful. While in the field Mr. McBrien and I knew that the office work was faithfully attended to. Mr. Harnly was patient and painstaking, of equable temperament, and withal a thoroughly Christian gentleman, a manly man, loyal to all the Interests he served, his family, his country and his God. We will miss his bodily presence here among us, but we will not forget the many lessons his clean, upright life taught us, and our hearts go out in sympathy to the loved ones of whom he was so fond and thoughtful. W. K. FOWLER. I became acquainted with L. C. Harnly when we were boys. We worked together on his father's farm. He was a pupil of mine in a country school north of Sterling In the good old days when big boys and big girls attended the rural schools. During my superin - tendency of the public schools of Johnson county he was one of my teachers. For the past aeven years we were closely associated in the </seg>
            <seg id="p446">352 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT offloe of state superintendent of public instruction. From the day we met as boys until the day of his death there never was the shadow of a misunderstanding between us. In his departure we lost the better angel of our nature. I At the age of fifteen he united with the M. E. church, of which ras a consistent member until death. He was one of the leaders ?rinity M. E. church, Lincoln, and was one of the most active ibers of the Brotherhood of St. Paul in this church, and a regular iber of the City Young Men's Christian Association. One of highest compliments ever paid any man was the tribute to Mr. lly by Mr. Phllpott, Lincoln correspondent for the Omaha Bee, i he said: "I never heard him use a word of slang, utter an . or tell a questionable story." Mr. Harnly obtained his education in the country schools of Johnson county, in the Sterling high school, in the Beatrice business college, and in the Fremont Normal College. He began teaching at the age of seventeen, and when but twenty years old was elected president of the Johnson county teachers' association. He taught in country, village and town schools, teaching for some time at Sterling and for five years was principal at Crab Orchard. No more popular and successful teacher ever taught in the public schools of that county. KOn July 27, 1898, he was united in marriage to Mary L. Redmond, rab Orchard, who was also one of Johnson county's most popular successful teachers. Two daughters have come to bless their &gt;, Thelma aged eight, and Kathryn, aged six, who, with their er, survive him. Kin the legislature of 1899 he served as a clerk of the committee Drolled and engrossed bills. In this capacity he formed a broad Untance with influential men from all sections of the state. In 1901 he was appointed, by the Hon. William K. Fowler, assistant state superintendent, which position he held during Mr. Fowlers' two terms. He was appointed to this same position by me on my succession to the office of state superintendent, and was re - appointed by me on my re-election. He had s?rved seven years at this post of duty when the final summons came. He was known throughout the state house as an untiring worker. He was at his desk early and late. Many nights, after a long and hard day's work, be would return to the office, working two or three hours overtime without extra pay. His commanding bearing, his courteous manner, his ever pleasant disposition made him a favorite among all state employees as well as a leader among men, and his character was a standard by which to judge others. Ewas Monday noon, September 30, 1907, that he left his desk, ill fever, never again to 1 take up earthly labors. None of us it that his illness was serious at first, for the third day he was the office it was hard to keep him at home. He was determined e back to his work. By Saturday night of that week his fever </seg>
            <seg id="p447">353 bad reached the danger point of 105 degrees. The doctor pronounced it typhoid, made him go to bed, called a professional nurse, and for - bade even his closest friends to see him. By Saturday night it seemed that the crisis had passed, and the day was set when the fever would break. During the three days that followed, the im - provement was very marked. On Tuesday night, October 15, I retired in the belief that all was well and expected to take an early train the next morning to keep an engagement at Leigh. A few minutes past midnight the ringing of the telephone bell awakened me. What an awful shock to hear the doctor say, "I have bad news for you. Mr. Harnly has just died." In the twinkling of aD eye we had fallen from the highest hopes to the deepest sorrow— "noon and mid - night without a space between." I The blow was so terrible that it stunned our sensibility. Those s who had been so long officially associated with him found our - ps unable to take up our daily task. We met each other as if : would ask the other, "Can it be true? Can it be true? Am I ke, or do I dream?" Every official in the state house waited to his bearing. Strong men wept. We knew that a faithful public ant, a loyal friend, a devoted husband, a loving father, an ideal en had been taken from us and we were lonely without him. (For such a man to die at the early age of thirty-six years is one e profoundest mysteries of human destiny. "He had not passed fe's highway the stone that marks the highest point, but being y for a moment he lay down by the wayside, and, using his jn for a pillow, fell into that sleep that kisses down his eyeliis While yet in love with life and raptured with the world, he d to silence and pathetic dust." BBut we should count time by heart throbs. We live in deeds, years; in thoughts not breaths; in feelings, not in figures on a Heart throbs are immortal. When the stars, like tears, have all ed down creations face, good thoughts go on, brightening forever. Then, noble-hearted, great-souled, manly man, "Choose thine own good time. Give us little warning; Say not good night, but in some brighter clime, Bid us all, good morning.' J. L. McBRIEN. SWrs. Eva J. Gdst. Mrs. Eva J. Case was one of the very strong school teachers of Nebraska. She was a woman of resource and of wonderful capacity to aid others. For this reason she was especially valuable in her position at the State Normal School at Kearney. Those who knew her well in this position knew her to love her and to appreciate the value that &amp; truly womanly woman has in such a place. Her work </seg>
            <seg id="p448">354 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT ■was done under difficulties. Especially at Red Cloud, when she wu superintendent of the city schools, and also while she was superin - tendent of the country schools she did two people's work — the work of her position and the work of the head of a family with an invalid husband to care for, and she neglected neither. Her life should be An inspiraition to anyone who thinks his lot difficult. Nebraska Teacher, December, 1907. I Mrs. Eva J. Case came to the State Normal School at Kearney i its organisation in June of 1905, accepting the position of eptress. During the time she held her office in the school, her en - atrength and apparently her entire interest were given over to the » of her office. She was a mother to the young ladies who were ?d in her charge and easily won and held their respect. As a member of the faculty she was faithful; as a teacher she was thorough. There was something pathetic as well as beautiful in her life and character. Nearly all of her life was spent in caring for those who were helpless. Her devotion to her invalid husband for ten years, her great interest in the orphan children of her brother and her loving care for her aged father are examples of a truly beautiful and humane life. Her active service in Nebraska in educational lines — as county superintendent of Webster couDty, and city superintendent of Red Cloud, together with her faithful attendance upon educational associations — will long be remembered by those engaged in education in Nebraska. I The pupils who attended her school while at Red Cloud offered a tiful tribute in memorial flowers presented at her funeral. In death a beautiful light has failed, but her womanly features and e character have left impressions in hundreds of youthful minds hearts. While she was yet young, she was gathered in the ripe - of womanly experience and helpfulness. A. O. THOMAS. I It would be impossible to say anything that would add credit ie life Mrs. Case lived among us; it was truly a blessing, and I shall *vor merely to emphasize some of the characteristics which made near and dear to us. If there Is one element in her character predominates, it seems to me it is unselfishness — her thoughtful - for others. She was never too busy, nor too weary to have a ght for some one else. It might occur to some that this was the ome of her position; but if we go back of her life among us here, Snd it was always the same. During her illness, one friend who »s her well said, "Mrs. Case is. truly a good woman, and most of life since I knew her has been spent in oaring for others; but she always cheerful and smiling. There may have been a time in lif? when she was free from care, but certainly not in the later s; yet we never heard her murmur or complain." The devotion she gave to her husband is certainly worthy of Admiration. Soon after their marriage, Mr. Case became an invalid </seg>
            <seg id="p449">355 In trying to regain his health, then Mrs. Case took up her school work, and kept the home. She has told me that many a night she has read or worked over Mr. Case all Dight, after having spent the day in the school room; yet she seemed glad that she could make life a little brighter for him. Although Mrs. Case looked strong physically, yet she suffered more than even her most intimate friends suspected. Those of us who were with her know how brave and heroic she was. A friend on hearing of her sickness, wrote that she was sorry she had not known sooner, and added, "If Mrs. Case were not so brave and unselfish, our world would know more about her ills, but she keeps silent and endures. I believe she is the bravest woman I ever knew." tHer mental and physical suffering seemed to enable her to find ponsive chord of sympathy for other people's cares and troubles, greatest ambition during her illness was to get well in order she might help care for her deceased brother's children. Although her official duties need not have gone beyoDd the general oversight of the girls at the dormitory, yet we all know how thoughtful she was about the homesick girls; how she planned to make them happy, and did everything in her power to bring out the best in every girl, and gave her a higher and nobler ideal of life. I The only criticism I ever heard of her work as preceptress waa she gave too much of herself to the girls, and allowed them to 1 too much of her time and strength; but this was Mrs. Case, and could not have done otherwise if she would. I Mrs. Case was certainly an optimist. I always enjoyed seeing come into the library, because she never failed to give a cheery I or smile. She could appreciate the humor in life around her, always saw the bright side. I believe it was this happy faculty made her an inspiration wherever she went. Although I did not know her in the class room, yet I t ahe fully deserved what two of the leading school men of the state said concerning her educational work: As superintendent df the Red Cloud schools, "She was most successful in her public school work, efficient as a teacher, firm and strong in organizing and in man - aging ability."

His form has been laid to rest, serenely, beautifully and with the highest tribute a community could show. His spirit has taken its flight to realms beyond, toward which we, the living, look with hope. His fine physique, and manly presence we shall see no more among us. He has gone to join the innumerable departed beyond the dreary draperies of death. But still he is with us; his life has been an example to hundreds; his influence will live on and on. He was a pure, good man; father and husband. His going out was beautiful, brave, composed and submissive. Hope and cheer were leading characteristics of his life, and these were exhibited as he died. We appreciate bis life; we mourn his death; we sympathize with his family. Then we are reminded that here is a lesson to us, of life'a uncertainty; of the necessity of our being kind, noble, true and good; of being magnanimous and unselfish; that each evening may bow off the stage of our life a day's work well done; that therein should be contained our largest service. Superintendent Simpson was born in Mitchell county, Kansas, January 2, 1875. He was left fatherless at the age of three. When he was a mere lad his family moved to Verdon, Nebraska, where he attended school, graduating at the age of fifteen. He spent a few years In teaching, then entered Kansas University where he graduated in 1898, taking degrees both in the college of arts and the college of law. War was declared with Spain at this time and Superintendent Simpson -enlisted in the 20th Kansas Infantry, he having been previously a member of the National Guard of Kansas. His regiment was sent to the Philippines and as a reward of service and soldierly conduct he wag promoted to first lieutenatnt. This regiment saw active service. On returning to America he located in Auburn as a law partner with hla uncle. In 1901 he was elected principal of the high school in which capacity he served four years when he was elected to the superintendency, which office he has filled for three years. I On June 6th, 1901, he was united in marriage with Miss Bessie , the ceremony taking place in the presence of his company, the Kansas. He was an active member of the Christian church, being president of the board of elders at the time of his death and a ber of the choir. On May second he was taken with an attack ppendicitis while singing in the choir and although everything done known by modern doctors to save his life, he succumbed to lisease early Wednesday morning, June 10.

He leaves in his immediate family a devoted wife, two little children, a mother and two brothers. His work is finished. Above the name of poet, statesman, preacher, orator, or craftsman, upon the shining scroll wh-ereon endear - ing and emulated names appear inscribed, will glow forth in ever brighter radiance, the name of teacher.

Deceased will be remembered by many of the teachers here for the prominent part he took in the junior normal at Alliance during the season of 1907. He also taught a term of school about the same time in the Cantwell district south of here. He was a young man of more than ordinary attainments, bright and intellectual.

Hyatt who died last Saturday was held at the family home on East Genesee street this afternoon. The service was conducted by Rev. William H. Hubbard, D. D. During the services the Calvary church quartette sang two selections, 'Nearer My God to Thee,' and 'Lead Kindly Light.'

"Ralph Emerson Hyatt was born in 1886 and was the only eon of Dr. Francis M. and the late Emma L. Hyatt. He was educated in the Auburn schools and graduated from the High school in the class of 1902. After a post-graduate year he entered Cornell but during his freshman year a break came in his health, since when he has lit - erally fought a battle for life. A winter in the Adirondacks and another in Denver brought a partial recovery of health that justified his accepting a position as teacher in a school near Alliance, Neb. Here he taught for a year. His high scholarship, irreproachable character and executive ability proved him worthy of the principalship of the high school at Elk Creek, which he filled during the year 1907-1908. His true gentlemanliness, and noble qualities, of mind and heart brought him many friends and in the school room he inspired senti - ments of higher and nobler manhood and womanhood. (In the face of uncertain health he courageously followed the for which he seemed so generously endowed. A broader and remunerative field opened to him when the summons came to lay aside.

Democracy is more than a political experiment. It is the latest spiritual enterprise of the ages. Though not yet complete, nor yet permanent, democracy is the crowning achievement of history. Democ - racy is an Ideal, a leaven. It is not to be identified absolutely with any particular political or social organization. It is a spirit. Democ - racy means "life and more abundant life." Destructively, it means the tearing down of artificial distinctions and class privileges. De - mocracy is the instinctive foe of hereditary and caste prerogatives. It recognizes no oligarchy but that of individual worth. The French Revolution has been styled the French Madness. But there was a philosophy in the custom of democrats in addressing one another M "citizens," discarding all other title. Democracy has the watch - word of the age for its own, Freedom and Opportunity. Constructively, Democracy has meant the carrying to the people at a whole the prerogatives of power and of privilege heretofore reserved for favored classes or individuals. It has meant extension of elective franchise, the protection of the natural rights of all men to liberty of person, save under restraint by process of law, the right of trial by thejr peers, the freedom of religion, and security of property. Democracy has meant the right of any political society to depose its existing rulers and to raise others in their places, to elect freely their legislative and representative bodies and to hold the power of taxation in their own hands. It has meant freedom of Industrial opportunity and the largest possible extension of educational privileges. Democracy is pervasive. It illuminates. It challenges. The ex - tension of power and privilege to the people is after all but the more superficial aspect of democracy. Its greater meaning is duty. But the great and deep and solemn meaning was not at first the most obvious. Democracy's first appeal has seemed to be to the selfishness of the people. To the American no less than to the French revolu - tionists democracy appeared to spell privilege, exemption from bur - densome taxes and oppressive legislation by an authority outside of themselves or of their election. It meant the breaking of yokes, emancipation from real or imagined grievances. The first attempt at a nation in the confederation of states was a ludicrous failure — though a necessary step in the process of educating a people to self - government. The appreciation of the necessity of a central and efficient authority was slow. The sense of duty follows tardily upon the heels of privilege. But democracy's great and deep and solemn meaning is not privilege alone, but privilege through duty and duty beyond </seg>
            <seg id="p458">362 Prophets of evil have not been wanting. The irresistible political and social tendencies of the age, the underlying gulf streams, are toward democracy. But men whose political optimism is sound con - cerning the part political history of the race are pessimistic in the presence of the democratic tendency of this age and look upon democracy with undisguised apprehension and suspicion. Lecky, in his "Democracy and Liberty," sees in democracy itself the doom of liberty except democracy be curbed and limited. He looks upon democracy much as Alexander Hamilton did upon the type of democ - racy prevalent in America in the period immediately succeeding the revolution, as, a "disease." Lecky regards the democratic theory of government as reversing all the past experiences of mankind, that superiority and competence lie with the few, not the many; that the extension of the franchise is but to place government more and more under the control of the least enlightened classes; in short, that democracy means government by the mob, by the least fit, and that it seeks increased capacity for good government in the representative body by the foolish expedient of increasing the amount of ignorance in the elective body. Lecky points out the tendency of democracy to produce inequitable taxation by placing the power of voting taxes In the hands of one class which another class must almost exclusively pay, the chief taxpayers, "being completely swamped," are for "all practical purposes completely disfranchised." ("Democracy and Lib- I page 32.) He also adverts to the instability of democratic governments. Frederick the Great of Prussia told the English am - bassador in 1782 that the United States could not endure, "since a republican government had never been known to exist for any length of time where the territory was not limited and concentrated." (For - mation of the Union." Hart, p. 100-1.) It was one of Lincoln's grave and statesmanlike utterances, that "it has long been a grave question whether any government, not too strong for the liberties of its people, can be strong enough to maintain its own existence in great emergencies." ("Life of Lincoln." Morse. II, p. 293-4.) R These critics of democracy are not to be laughed out of court nor warnings disregarded. It still remains to be demonstrated that rnments "of the people, by the people and for the people" can 5 endure." The Ethics of Democracy Critics like Lecky, however, overlook the fundamental ethical principles of democracy. Enlightened democracies are not governed by the least fit, the ignorant, the incompetent. The are governed by majorities and majorities are secured by ideas and by policies crystal - majorities and majorities, are secured by ideas and by policies crystalized Into party platforms. There Is no school of political science so the people under a sense of responsibility for political action. The ballot in the hands of the voter is sobering and educative. In the </seg>
            <seg id="p459">363 meet the approval of the sound judgment and enlightened conscience of the people or lose supremacy. "All such questions," said Lincoln, referring to temperance, slavery, etc., "must find lodgment with the most enlightened souls who stamp them with their approval. In God's own time they will be organized into law and then woven into the fabric of our institutions." (Fhrndon's "Life of Lincoln" I p. 158.) I There is a finality about the ultimate decree of a free people great moral and economic questions, like that of slavery, that Is unto the decrees of the Eternal. In democratic forms of govern - , while the demagogue may flourish for a season, the leadership ie fit, the commanding influence of men who are kings by divine of character, the power of personality, are at least as marked as enduring as in any other political organization. Let us call itness Gladstone. Washington, Lincoln. I The boldest political experiment of history is now in progress in ) United States. That it is of vast interest is evidenced by the that over a million immigrants are coming every twelve months to their fortune with us. And there are not wanting prophets of evil ie face of this tremendous fact. Our great cities are half alien, ire drawing apparently the larges.t number of immigrants not from nost but from the least desirable of European and Asiatic peoples. But in the midst of evil prophecies let us recall another principle in the ethics of democracy, namely: that it is the more virile and aggressive of any people that are attracted by the freedom, the indus - trial and political and social opportunities of the democratic west. The Bethlehem star that guides searchers for larger and better life is the atar of liberty. It is freedom's challenge that appeals to the people that sit in darkness. They have seen a great light. We may not despise tb«M seekers, after a "better kingdom." They compare very favorably with our own forebears. The Peril of Republics But the peril of republics is ever before us, the peril that springs from ignorance and from a lack of intelligent patriotism. Other forms of government may survive indefinitely over a stolid and non-progres - p ople. Republics cannot live without virtue. The instinct of self-preservation has inspired democratic governments to foster uni - versal education. Enlightenment and virtue are the sina quo non of existence. Jefferson stated the problem of democracy when he said it was the province of the school "to form the statesmen, legislators, and judges, on whom public property and individual happim much to depend; to expound the principles and structure of govern - ment, the laws which regulate the intercourse of nations, those formed principally for our own government in a sound spirit of legislation; K. . . to harmonize and promote the interests of agriculture, manu - es, and commerce, and by well-informed views of political econ - to give free scope to the public industry." ("The trend of r Education." Harper, p. 33.) </seg>
            <seg id="p460">364 There is do duty more imperative than the fostering of all educa - tional facilities. The public school stands first and should. It is the greatest unifying agency of the age. But the parochial and the private schools also have an honorable place. There are not schools enough. Parts of our country are fairly destitute. The president of the school board of New Orleans, a public spirited and very intelligent man, told me recently that he favored a compulsory school law for that city; no. because it would be possible to school all the children of the city, or half of them, with present facilities, but because a compulsory school law would overwhelm the schools, compel attention to the need and the sooner secure adequate provision. There doubtless is much to criticise in present schools and school methods. Let wholesome criticism proceed. But let us not forget that our great duty is to encourage the extension of the influence of the schools existing. We may not quarrel overtime about doctors and pathies and poultices. The doctor at hand is quite efficient in emergencies. There is no need so great nor any duty so imperative as the strengthening of our primary and country schools to greater efficiency. It is still true and should be increasingly true that the little red school house on the hill is the temple of liberty. There is no severer test of the ability of democratic society to preserve itself from decay than this. Can and will democracy maintain at a high of efficiency its common schools? There is no civic duty of an educated and patriotic citizen that should stand superior to this of assisting to foster the common school. There needs to be a civic conscience about adequate taxation for this purpose and the encouragement of a high order of character and ability to enter the teaching profession, especially in the common Enlarged Scope of Education I Democracy has felt the inadequacy of the older educational meth - md ideals. Education must not be for the few but for the many, the duty of the state not only to provide educational facilities, but quire that they be generally utilized. The scope of educational est must be broadened. Classical culture and the humanities alone The school must teach the real interest of life for Irking people. A few may sit aloof in haughty isolation and re with Lowell that a university should be a place "where noth - iseful is taught." But democracy has small patience with such itional fastidiousness. The sturdy youth in laboratories and shops, Ing rooms and field, with life's real business before them have ed aside intellectual dilettantism. Science and art have meaning fe's earnest work as well as for its leisure pastimes. And with the extension of educational interests has coine the -'on of educational privileges. State and private munificence have alike conspired lo bring to the common people the blessings of higher </seg>
            <seg id="p461">365 idrale have been conservatively aristocratic. Thos. Barclay, in the report of the English (Mosely) Commission, says: K'The British mind must at once disabu&amp;e itself of the idea that ard and Yale are educational centers for the seventy or eighty &gt;ns forming the population of the United States. They are only universities which have more or less resisted the democratic ncies of the New World." (Mosely Commission Report, p. 395.) And further along he says: ("When we get closer to Americans, we see that in spite of all their rent superficiality, their schools are turning out more active, ess-lik?, hard working, enterprising young men than either ish or German schools — young men with greater ambition, and reliance, and a greater capacity for development, equally cour - js in work, ard more sober in their lives, with a higher sense dustrial integrity, and all round greater pleasure in effort, and r humor in adversity." (Mosely Commission Report, p. 397.) I have found no better expression of the democratic ideal of edu - cation than in the address of Dr. Barrows, General Superintendent of Education for the Philippines, in which he says that the ideals of the educational commission- include "a large, general purpose to raise the spiritual character, industrial efficiency and the political capacity of the entire people." To this end higher education in its wider and more inclusive scope of technical and professional training has its place, and a most important one. The characteristic restlessness of the age is quite as much in evidence in educational work as in the people's business and the peo - ple's amusements. Apostles of classical culture are harking us back to old ideals aDd old methods of discipline. "The proper study of mankind is man," they insist, and we are abandoning the only prop?r cultural agencies when we turn from the study of Greek temples, literature and art, logic and the hlsory of metaphysics. These Nehemiahs would dearly like to hustle the profane and vulgar advocates of a so-called prac - tical education out into the street and all their belongings of so-called laboratory equipment with them. The temple of learning has been profaned by their presence. The idea that education can be practical has taken possession or is taking possession of the minds of the people. Manual training and domestic science are demanding recognition and equipment. The Polytechnic High School in Los Angeles is as fine as a Greek temple in its architecture and more elaborate in its equipment than many technical collegiate institutions of repute. This is suggestive of the Importance being attached to the training of the hand in educational curricula. The Pharisees and purists, the priests of the old regime, declare that all this is a displacement of the proper cultural character of the school by an appeal to the mercenary, a weak yielding to a vulgar demand for instruction that will help mechanics and book - keepers to better jobs and that it all has about as" much relation to the culture of the mind and heart as pulling beets has to composing </seg>
            <seg id="p462">366 Moreover, these eager and unrefined "practicums" crowd rudely into the temple and elbow the muses into the corners. And there is confusion. The ultimate good of culture for its own sake seems so remote and vague compared with a training that will definitely fit one for a given task. Practical studies lead to results that are near and definite and tangible and to efficiency in earning a living. It is no wonder young men flock to practical and technical courses. Jobs await them just beyond commencement day and good pay. "Is job hunting to be the chief end of life?" cries the priest of culture. Is it not unseemly and a perversion of educational agencies and a degredation of ideals that the thousands of students in universities and colleges should have before their eyes perpetually the thought "will this study or that help me to get a job and to keep it after I get it?" Shall bookkeeping and carpentry and shop work usurp the place once held by Poetry and Art and Literature and Logic and Religion? O tempores. O Mores!" exclaims some modern Cicero. A sister of mine onca en - gaged in missioD work approached a raw Swede and trying to make herself intelligible, asked "Would you not like to live and work for the Lord?" "Nope," was the prompt answer. "I got a job now." And it sometimes seems to the apostle of culture that all men are divided into two classes, those who are looking for jobs and those who have atttained jobs, and that the sole criterion of life-values is the scale of relative remuneration for different jobs. (Now all this contention may be true, but whether truth or stry depends not on the superficial facts but on the spirit and ootif. The same instrument that clatters out rag time is capable mphonies.

The theme in any great musical composition is usually very simple. About this dominant and simple strain of melody is woven the tangled medley of a complex composition, but all is subordinate to the simple theme. Not a grace note can find place in the bars that does not relate itself to the theme. 1 once heard Guilmant improvise on the organ. Musical critics declared his improvization to be classical and worthy of permanent place in musical composition. But his theme was given him as he took his seat &amp;t the organ. It was the melody of "Swanee River." That plaintive melody, with its wierd sweetness suggestive of southern skies and cabins, with the touch of atmospheric characteristic of Dixie Land, and the strain of Negro pathos, (the Negro is the only race that has given us a folk-song in </seg>
            <seg id="p463">367 Irica) — that plaintive melody dominated the player and the organ the audience. It was like a silver stream that starts in the snows he mountains and laughs through the canons and meanders igh the valleys but never forgets that its destiny is the sea. Here a dominant motive, a note that was never entirely silent, an nal note that held sweet tyraDny over all. Browning in his "Abt Vogler" makes the musician say ■ through my keys that gave their sound to a wis of my soul, through my soul that praised as its wish flowed visibly forth through music and me! ■here is the finger of God, a flash of the will that can, :ent behind all laws that made them, and. lo, they are! 1 know not if, save in this, such gift is allowed to man, out of three sounds he frame, not a fourth sound, but a star." I Ah, Browning! you have spoken to us a soul-secret. The creative jy of a dominant ideal may transfigure the commonplace. It is thus a pearl is made out of a grain of sand, a diamond out of carbon, w drop may bear the image of a star. 1 After all is said, literature, and art, and architecture, are but reflectors of life. Their secrets are but life's secrets. Their licities are life's simplicities. I In architecture, the elaborate, confused and fussy, as well as bald and barren, must give way to the simplicity, dignity and riency of the architecture that has back of it and within it com - ling ideals. The Greek temples were fitting. And the essential ires of the Greek temple persist in all intelligent and adequate zations. Their simplicity was borrowed from Nature. Like I's first temples," these Greek ideals appropriately house the spirit orship and praise. It is the business of the school from the kindergarten to college to extend the organizing power of ideals to all the interests of life. M astronomer discover a new star? It is the duty of the educator and the school to incorporate that new discovery into the subject matter of the curriculum. Does some iDventor make wireless telegraphy not only a possibility but an accomplished fact? It is the immeiiat? duty of the school to include that fact in its instruction and to set up a model apparatus to demonstrate its truth. Do bac - teria help the plants to feed on the nitrogen of the air? Let it be put down in the text books and let it be demonstrated in the laboratory.

Should not the resources of th? clay - deposits and the possibilities of cement be exploited? Let the school not only teach chemistry and geology and bacteriology, but also teach the applications of these sciences to the pressing interests of society. And if industrial education in this scientific and thorough and </seg>

Neither the high school nor college exist for their own sakes, but for the sake of the boys and i who are to be the men and women of tomorrow. They exist for sake of society and the state and the home. They exist for "the e general purpose of raising the spiritual character, industrial lency and the political capacity of the whole people." There must be co-operation But there Is confusion. The number and variety of subjects crowding for a place in the school curriculum is bewildering. We must soon recognize the impossibility of requiring every student to take a greft number of different subjects. There may be as large a variety of subjects as teachers and equipment for presenting, but we must cease expecting the minds of children and youth to cover them all. Instead of dissipation there must be concentration. A few subjects mastered is a much better discipline than a smattering of many. Certain subjects are and ought to be considered essential. The three "R's" have suf - fered from overcrowding. English, mathematics and introduction to some one of the sciences are essential. Along -with these may and should go for each scholar some one practical study at least. The fundamental studies can be thoroughly taught only by being extended throughout the course, the mind of the scholar taking new grasp of the principles with his own development. IThe New York plan for high school mathematics is an excellent First year, Freshman Algebra. Second year, Plane Geometry. 1 year, Solid Geometry. Fourth year, two hours called Interme- Algebra, a stiff review course suited to more mature minds with ■tie advanced work. A thorough review of English grammar is quite essential. One modern language is far better than two or i. There may be five hours for English and literature, five hours mathematics, five hours for science and history and economics civics with five hours throughout for mechanic arts or agricul- This omits modern language excspt English. It gives, however, E preparation either for life or for technical course in college the modern language and that can well be taken as a college The demand for practical subjects in the schools is a very urgent and increasing one. Manual training, agriculture, domestic economy, th— c subjects must be taken up, put into good pedagogical form and incorporated into the school curriculum. They must not usurp the whole nor a disproportionate proportion of time and space. Business colleges, though they teach little or nothing but bookkeeping and ste - nography, may have their place, and I suppose a college of mines that teaches nothing but mining engineering with the absolutely necessary prerequisites of geology and mathematics and chemistry may have its place. But these narrowly special schools can never meet any large need or meet any need in an adequate way. A school of agriculture </seg>
            <seg id="p465">LECTURES, REPORTS. ADDI: Nl&gt; PAP 369 narrow and exclusively practical course could never meet any large educational need or meet it in a large and adequate way. But into the schools these practical subjects must go, and it is the duty of those who must shape the policies of the schools to give intelligent direction. I should not like to see such early specialization of courses in the high school as should make it necessary for a boy to choose his college course if he go to college or his profession in life before he is old enough to act wisely. Yet if he were given a chance to direct his studies in certain general directions while yet a junior in high school he would then be as old and mature as the college boys were in the earlier days of Yale and Harvard. A boy usually or ofteo knows quite well whether he wishes to pursue an engineering, an agri - cultural or a science course or arts course while he is yet in the ninth grade. Other things being equal the farther one can see ahead the better. Yet there should be left room for change without too great embarrassment. I believe the college should make more elastic its entrance re - quirements, so that an equally thorough preparation in any one of several groups of studies, not omitting the fundamental branches, the three "R's," would leave the student a liberty to choose or change his course without embarrassment. And if he had not taken modern language in high school, he could offer as an entrance substitute something which he had taken and begin his language study as a college subject. If he be deficient in drawing or science or agricultural subjects, he could substitute a language or something else as an entrance subject and take up the things in which he is deficient as college subjects. I But I would not favor letting go of the thorough and continuous uit in high school of the fundamental subjects, English, mathe - cs, some science and some history. You cannot let a boy browse desultory way on subjects that lack pedagogical efficiency and him out well trained. He will be flabby and mentally incoherent, firmness of fiber commend me still to the subjects that are likely ; called fundamental while gravitation holds the rocks in the hills the sun and the moon and stars endure. The common schools of today are better systematized and graded than those of the past. It is easier for an ambitious boy or girl to pass on through the grades of country or city school to the high school and to the college than was the case formerly. There is a more definite and consecutive course of study and a more systematic promotion and advancement. There is too a far more logical grouping of studies and a vastly improved method of instruction. Instead of slavish and dogged adherence to a text book there is use of what might be called laboratory or natural methods. There is closer contact with reality and deeper respect for facts. B Nature study may be in quite a crude state of development as a sogical subject, but it aims in the right direction. It tries for pie to suggest to the pupil that botany is not primarily an attempt </seg>
            <seg id="p466">370 |;dly to comm-it to memory a Latin dictionary but a study of living MM and forms in plants. It is not unusual for a beginners' in botany to start out in their subject by picking to pieces a to see at first band how it grew. Botany is essentially a study f formulae but of flowers. The terminology is perhaps unfortu - but the terms and formal classifications are but instruments or The unfortunate impression is to be avoided that plants and rs, seeds and pollen were created according to Gray's Latin fication. With all reverence let us sedulously hold to the funda - il fact that plants and flowers were coated first and botanies and roots and prefixes afterward. This emphasis upon nature may seem at first to lack in deftnlteness. I can very well remember the method by which we studied g?ography under a teacher who became locally famous. We wrote down the names of rivers of the various countries in groups and rattled them off by rote. We did have this much reference to reality, we roughly sketched maps and pointed out the general location of the rivers named. But few or none of us had ever seen a large river or had even heard a description of one. Thef s e thn.-ad lines on a skeleton map might as well been horse hairs as rivers so far as our conception went. What a mighty river means for a country, its fertility, its commerce, its travel, its civilization; how national development has followed river courses; of the fish and the sails, the trees and the farms, the cities and the rprings, the flowers and the marshes, the mountains and the valleys; of all these things and more we had not the slightest intimation. There was no idea back of our glib rattle of names. We thought we were becoming wise and learned, gauging our stock of knowledge by the number and length of the list of names we had committed to memory. I will not say there was. no value in all this. There is probably some value in any mental exercise. But no schoolman in tfce borders of Nebraska would now follow such a method. There Tv-ould at least be t;ome hint of interesting reality, eome appeal to the imagination, some story of history or travel, some picture of facts, some effort to connect with an idea. This era in which we are living is new and wondrous. It is the nee of the school to b? aware. Looking upon the age, its uplift of life to higher levels, its extension of privileges, the widening spiritual margin which is being demanded on all sides and for all men, the increased industrial efficiency, the demand that the school from kinder - garten to college connect extensively and vitally with life's real inter - ests. We should be able to say of the schoolman and sehoolwoman, in the idiom of the French, they have arrived. If any of the world's workers should be in the front facing the problems that press for solution upon the brain and heart of the age it should be the school teachers. The providence that rules the destinies of nations and that holds to final judgment races and aeons will surely call the school t acher to the judgment seat.

The most grievous judgment lat of the Master of Life saying, "I was in prison and ye visited not; I was an hungered and ye gave me no food; I was naked and •lotted me not." The suprised answering question, "When saw :hee naked and hungry?" only reveals the blind spiritual stupidity hose who had eyes to see but saw not. The crucial tests of life spiritual. The teacher's function Is that of a directing personality, definite information about the three "R's" and some other things a teacher must of course have. And in a somewhat helpless manner it is also prescribed that he or she must be of good moral charcter. But would that some angel could join the board of examiners and tell us the secret of personality and of personal and spiritual power. What will be the effect on .the heart and ideals of boys and girls of this person who seeks authentication as a teacher? Will it be springtime or December within the circumference of the influence of that teacher? Will eouls expand or wither there? Of cours,e any teacher in this day will endeavor to connect all formal lessons with reality, will endeavor to cenjoin ideas with words, will never be content to teach alone by rote. But there Is a far more vital question than this — Will then? also be suggested a vital relationship between ideals and conduct? Will it be summer for the soul? It is needless to say that this spiritual qualification and asset is largely spontaneous and unconsciously possessed and utilized. Yet it is not altogether so. To appreciate the importance of this spiritual factor and to geek to possess and exercise it should be one of the fundamental quests of those who desire to be teachers. And here especially "to seek is to find." "To knock" is to have this "door" "opened unto you." For any normally constituted person the very position of teacher stim - ulates to this spiritual quest for power. And this leads me to remind you that the compensations of the teacher are pricelessly precious. To associate with children and young people 1n the spiritual intimacy of the school is to have the inspiration and helpfulness of those whom the Master himself declared to be the greatest teachers. "Except ye become as little children ye shall not enter the Kingdom." When he would teach the deepest of life's lea - sons he "took a little child and set him in the midst of them." The Abase of cKpte taking. Doctor Charles E. Bessey, University of Xebras.ka. Why do we take notes when we listen to a college lecture? Why do we require our pupils to take notes of our lectures? We an - swer, of course, that we take notes in order that we may not forget what the professor says, and we require our pupils to takes notes of what we say in order that they may remember what we have told them. </seg>
            <seg id="p470">372 But have we not carried this note taking quite too far? Is it necessary in order to remember what we hear that we must put the lecturer's, words into writing? Is it really essential that our pupils should first write down everything we say? Why should they not remember "by first intention" as the surgeons say, rather than after the sup - erative process of editing and rewriting their imperfect notes? And what is it that the pupil finally learns after he has neatly copied his notes in final form in his lecture note-book? I have looked over many such note-books, and I shudder when I think of what I am alleged to have said in my lectures. No doubt there are some things in «ome lectures that the student cannot remember without writing down, but I hold that any matter that cannot be presented in such form that it can be remembered as heard should not be given in lecture form. We have confused the subject matter of the text-book with that of the lecture. Some teachers seem quite unaware of this difference, and try to present details through lectures which should be attempted only by means of the printed page. Here I take it is one of the serious faults of our educational practice. We have not clearly separated the text-book from the lecture. I have heard of teachers who copied page after page of some text-book and then read these to their classes. Some teachers prepare their lectures with such verbal accuracy that they require their pupils to make literal copies, and to make this possible they slowly dictate page after page. Such a waste of time is rarely Justifiable. As long as printing is so cheap it should not often be necessary for a teacher to take his time and that of his pupils in this slow method of making a text-book. It would be far better for him to use even that slovenly and inky duplicating device called the "mimeograph." In fact any duplication of his lectures would be better than to require his pupils to perform such profitless drudgery as that of making voluminous notes from dictation. What then is the place of the lecture in a course of study if it should not be used for the communication of details? In discussing this I want first of all to say emphatically that I hold that no lecture should contain details that are difficult for the listener to remember. If now the lecture is not to contain details, what should be its nature? In the first place the details should be given in a carefully and rather compactly written text-book, or syllabus on the subject. Here should be found all of those details which have to be considered again and again in order to be fixed in the mind. Then the lecture should light up and illumine the subject. The dry and dusty text should spring into Wving foliage aDd beautiful florescence under the refreshing showers of the interesting lecture. The lecturer should add the en - thusiasm of the scholar to his subject. He should be able to give them something of his point of view. He should be able in eloquent and stirring words to make them see his subject as he sees it. For this his pupils must listen to him with their minds alert. His burning enthusiasm will be lost upon them if they are mere writing machines </seg>

Encourage pupils to listen to you with such attention that they need not notes. Consider that lecture course the most successful that puts into the pupil's head and less into his note books. In my opinion ture course is successful inversely in proportion to the size of the books which it requires. Schools of Education in American Universities. Doctor G. W. A. Luckey, University of Nebraska Almost every university worthy of the name has made provision for successful schools of law and of medicine. As early as 1765 a medical school was established iD the college of Philadelphia which later was merged into the University of Pennsylvania. Two years later a second medical school was established in Kings College, now Columbia University. By 1825 at least sixteen medical schools were distributed through different parts of the United States. Law schools began their development in this country about fifty years later, but by 1860 there were twenty such schools reported In the government statistics. The report of the United States Commis - sioner of education for 1906 shows 152 medical schools with 5,837 instructors and 24,924 students, and 98 law schools with 1,274 instructors and 15,411 students. Compare these schools as to Dumber, equipment, teaching staff, and general efficiency with the few teachers colleges that have come into existence during the past fifteen years and with one or two brilliant exceptions the meagerness of the latter in every direction is clearly apparent. I Schools of law and of medicine have not developed out of pro - on to their true Importance; in fact, they have not yet come into •ssion of what is really their own. But I do believe that schools lucation are even more important to the highest purpose of the &gt;rslty, that of teaching and training others to teach, than are )ls of law and of medicine. </seg>
            <seg id="p472">374 It is not possible here to enter into a discussion of the historical development of these intitutions nor to show why education as a university study has remained so far behind. In the third or fourth century B. C. education was beginning to play an important part in the schools of Greece, and two or three centuries later it played an equally important role in the schools of Rome. It was in these coun - tries and during these centuries that there were developed some of the greatest teachers of the world, and educational classics and pedagogical maxims which have remained as guiding principles to our thought •even to the present. A civilization that produces such masters deserves Eter fate, but its Socrates, and Platos, and Aristotles came too The people had lost faith in their gods, and no education has found keeD enough to hold together a civilization without a on ideal. During th? early Christian centuries there was little opportunity for education, the schools were few and far between. It was a period of migration, war, instability, and change of ideals. Had it not been for Christian missionaries scattered everywhere, and the hope inspired by their doctrine and the mellowing influence of their teaching, civi - lliation might have had a darker history to relate. If we turn our thought to the beginning of the medieval universities, which were the forerunners of our own, we find the first one to be the outgrowth of a school of medicine at Salerno, and probably the second one the outgrowth of a school of law at Bologna. The University of Salerno was never more than a school of medicine, but th« university of Bologna soon added the faculties of arts, theology and medicine. The term university as used at first did not ni.;an ae now a university of science or subjects, but rather a university of persons — an association of teachers and students into which all who wished might enter. Although the schools of law and of medicine were the first to receive recognition in the medieval university, the faculty of arts, which later became the faculty of philosophy, soon overshadowed all others. It was a real teachers college and for many centuries its chief work and almost universal purpose was the training of teachers. The faculty of arts was composed of two parts, that devoted to grammar and the elements of rhetoric, dialectics, and mathematics— the trivium and quadrivium — and that devoted to higher dialectics and philosophy which came to include the works of Aristotle on psychology, ethics, natural and physical sciences, and metaphysics. The student might ent&lt;r the institution at ten, become a bachelor at fourteen, and a licentiate or master at twenty-one, but before becoming the latter he hai spent several years in teaching under supervision. The degree of licentiate or master was in itself a teachers diploma and carried with it the endorsement of the faculty as to the fitness of the candidate for As th« subject matter increased, the faculties of art developed into faculties of philosophy, the influence of the church diminished and the </seg>
            <seg id="p473">375 |&gt;nal spirit increased. There was less uniform ideal or pm ducation. The spirit of teaching and the training of teachers me a less conscious purpose. However, the degree of licentiate or er was still given but only to represent th? form and not the t of the original meaning. Probably it Is for this reason that ; of the objections to teachers colleges come from those who esent the subjects found in the medieval arts faculty. When they v the subject — having received the master's or doctor's degree — not that mean that he can teach it? This fallacy is too old too familiar to need refutation here. I Medical schools have a direct bearing on the sanitation and th of the community and hence either directly or indirectly aff;et whole people. It is probably on this account that they have early ived attention. The benefits of the law schools seem less generally ributed, but they no doubt furnish us with better officers and inistrators and hence indirectly serve all. More of their product into the legislatures and it is only natural that they should ember their own. i Schools of education affect far more materially the whole people. • have been slow in developing on account of the subtlety of the lems with which they deal. Pedagogy is largely an applied science as such it must follow rather than precede the other sciences, ever it has a broader meaning and must gather and discover 1 in order to apply it. I The last report of the United States Commissioner of Education &gt;5-06) gives the total amount of governmental expenditure for all ic purposes, by states, counties, cities, towns, etc., at $740,000. - over two-fifths of which (41 paid for the common ols. The total amount expended for education in the United ?s during the year was $399,688,910, of which $307,765,659 was elementary education, $21,370,309 for secondary education, and 783,326 for higher education, not including professional edu- 1 During the school year of 1905-06 there were enrolled in the ols and colleges, public and private, 18,434,847 to which if we the 758,666 in special schools we have a grand total of 19,193,513 early one-fourth of the entire population. Of these 17,231,178 i in the elementary schools. The gathering and distribution of such vast sums of money, and its. intelligent use are questions of vital interest to everyone. While the wise and intelligent direction of this large army of school children, who are today in our control but tomorrow have us in theirs, is a problem worthy of the highest and best thought of the age. With one-fourth of our civilization in the most formative period, in the schools, hungry, dependent, looking to those who are older for ideals and guidance — what stronger incentive could be given for establishing schools of education? Of all the institutions of civilization, family, church, state, </seg>
            <seg id="p474">376 what one possesses so many common interests, reveals so much of life, means so much to the future, and pays such large dividends as the school? The problems which these questions of the school involve require for their solution the keenest minds of the strongest institutions of learning. For this reason, the state universities which are, and must continue to be, in the truest sense the people's colleges, must take up the study of education in a way that will convince everyone of their sincerity. Other institutions may be expected to follow in establishing schools of education or centers through which to gather and distribute the best thoughts of help to teachers. But throughout the great central west, at least, state universities must take the lead 1b establishing these schools and become the centers to which all citizens can appeal for light and aid. What can schools of education do which is not now being done? That depends upon their organization and freedom of action. It is easier to tell what they ought to do. In the first place, they should organise the instruction and give spirit and meaning to the teaching that leads to a degree and the teacher's diploma. A degree should lDdicate that the individual has learned to think for himself. That he has convictions and energy, and intelligence enough to put them into practice. Man is born into a civilization but not with a civilization. To effect this transfer requires the socializing influence of the home and school. We are born into a rich inheritance but even when we are able to use that inheritance it means nothing to us unless it has been vitalized by the touch of a living teacher. We read of the mob, but how little it means to us in comparison to the one who was in the midst of the struggle. The teacher should appreciate the meaning of this thought. Unless he is born again to this larger life, he will never be able to teach school. He may hear lessons and present facts, but he will not be able to make them live again. President Woodrow Wilson, of Princeton University, is quoted as saying to the Association of Colleges and Preparatory Schools, New York, November 29, 1908: "We must give up the Idea of teaching English literature. The appreciation of English can no more be pada - gogically imparted than the appreciation of the song of the bird." This criticism is only partially true, and in so far as it ia true, it is equally true of every other subject that contains a soul or liv - ing experiences. Any subject that does not possess those qualities has little value in the culture of the race. But how are we to put soul into thte inert material or literature of the past and make it live again in our children? Nothing else ia worth while. In the second place, schools of education, through their students, model schools and summer sessions, should be able to leaven and give intelligent direction to the entire teaching force of the state. As yet, all teaching is largely a matter of experiment, but these experiments should be conducted under the most favorable conditions and with </seg>
            <seg id="p475">LECTIKES, REPORTS. ADDI: Mi I'Al 377 all the intelligence at our command. At least some members of these schools should be given ample opportunity for research and Investiga - tion along with their teaching. Here would be afforded an excellent opportunity for superintendents aDd principals to work out many of the local school problems while doing graduate work. The effect that this would have on the school system is too apparent for comment. No one can teach what he does not know, and neither can anyone teach all that he knows. He who would inspire others must be Inspired. In a system so large and so complex, and at the same time so vitally connected with the whole people as the American school system, there are always many problems waiting solution. It is really discouraging that, as yet, the universities have done so little in this In the third place, schools of education should become the centers for gathering, sifting, organizing, using and disseminating the best thoughts on all subjects pertaining to the education of the people. This would necessitate the working over of all our pedagogical liter - ature in the light of recent discoveries in child study and genetic psychology. Take for example the discovery, that in muscular devel - opment — heDce allied motor development — the order is from the largely fundamental or centrally located muscles to the finer, accessory or peripheral muscles, it reveals to us the fact that much of our ele - mentary instruction is wrong and must be recast to be in harmony with the laws of development; also the meaning in education of nascent periods. Many a child has been sterilized in mathematics before the proper time to begin the subject, and the same is true with other sub - jects, either because of the time of beginning or the nature of the instruction. All the health and spiritualizing influences and activities of the home and the school belong here, including curricula, work and study hour, and teaching. These and many more I should like to mention in detail if time would permit. But I can call attention to only one of the many problems which lie in this field, the moral and religious influences which tend to give character and culture, to our people. To some this may mean only words, but to others it has a deeper meaning. This is a Christian nation, our fathers laid deep and broad its foundation. But a short time ago, we removed from our coin the phrase "In God we. trust" which indicated the faith of the fathers. Following that step, a class of citizens of New York City petitioned the board of education to do away with the Christmas celebrations in the public schools because of the reference to the Christ-child in the literature that would be used. Not entering into a discussion of the merit of these questions, one may well ask what effect will this change in literature and ideals have on civilization. As a civilization have we anything in common? Things in which we all agree? These we must discover and teach if we would give perpetuity to our nation. United we stand, divided we fall, is certainly true here. ■Along with these internal school problems come the external ones hool environment and administration managed by school officers. </seg>
            <seg id="p476">378 These are the problems of school organization, taxation and appropri - ation of funds, school period, school attendance, school aid, the teaching force, the construction, maintenance and equipment of school buildings, supplied with proper light, heat, ventilation and the modern conven - iences of sanitation; the health of the children, school diseases, medical inspection, school lunches, delinquencies, defectives of all sorts, tnd many other problems which to mention might add confusion. Again to the uninitiated these problems may seem of little import, but to the scientist and the student of human nature they have great signif - icance. What we need most is some means of putting into operation our present knowledge. If all new school buildings were constructed in laDce with our present knowledge of school hygiene there would be a revolution in education within the next ten years. We would emerge from our semi-barbarous condition to a state of partial civili - sation. In all this work, schools of education should centralize and purpose to our thought from the kindergarten through the university. These are but few of the many problems that can be better solved through schools of education, but they are sufficient to call attention to the importance of the subject. It will be seen that teaching is a spiritualizing process. The true teacher does not come heralded by trumpets and loud huzzas, but he has been with the Master and learned of Him. He has abundance of life, of which he is willing to give without recompense or reward, and he is ready to 6erve or lead as, conditions demand. The making of such teachers requires time and sacrifice, but is it not worth while? » Every institution of learning must share in this process, but the universities — the nation's, educational clearing houses — must lead, children of the state are its soul and to them is entrusted its ay, hence the importance and seriousness of the problem which, the mission of schools of education to direct. Waste in Education. Doctor G. W. A. Luckey, University of Nebraska. I One never knows himself so well as when he is permitted to see elf through others' eyes, so in teaching one never appreciates so ly the faults of his system until he sees, them worked out in larison with truer principles under the same and different environ - .s. Even then the truth is not always apparent. The traveler equently unable to appreciate the situation and returns with his ■ and preconceived notions more firmly fixed. He represents t who "Having eyes see not and ears hear not" the truth is everywhere waiting for use. My short stay in Europe convinced me of many weaknesses in oar own system of education which can be and ought to be modified. Many European countries are distancing us In education, though under far inferior environments. This is especially true of Germany. </seg>
            <seg id="p477">379 isit to that country, I was surprised at nearly every turn with the thrift, contentment, energy and uniform efficiency of thi- people. This •is the more remarkable when we think of the density of the population — an average of 250 to the square mile — and the lack of fertility of the soil. Nebraska can boast of the least illiteracy of any statr in the union per cent — which - than one-third of the average of the northern states, but Germany has less than one-tenth of one per cent taken by methods much more accurate. The average attendance in the schools of Nebraska under our best conditions is between sixty and iy per cent of the number registered — which is high compared with results in other states — in Germany it is over ninety-nine per cent. I was surprised to find how rapidly the Germans are gaining on us in industrial and commercial pursuits. Germany has doubled her sales of machinery and tools to the United States in the past five years, while during the same period the sales of the United Stat&gt; Germany, in the same lines, have been only one-third of what they were the preceding five years, and in many other directions the comparison is as surprising. The reason for these differences must be attributed largely to the school systems. I realize how unsatisfactory any criticism, either good or bad, may prove to one who has not a clear conception of the thing crit - icised, and the limits of this article will not permit me to give, even briefly, the plan of organization and administration of the German school system. Suffice it to say that from the standpoint of the state, the administration of elementary and secondary education is highly centralized, being autocratic and authoritative, while from the stand - point of the University, higher education is localized, free, democratic. There is a national board, a state board, a county board, a district board, and a local board all with clearly delegated powers and each subject to the one above. The University is much freer both in its teaching and in its management than our own. The Rector (Chancellor) is chosen by the professors — usually from among their number — and confirmed by the reigning sovereign or the minister of education. Chairs are also filled on the nomination of the professors. Students are likewise freer in their movements than with us. In my frequent visits to the Gymnasiums I was frequently im - pressed with the seriousness, punctuality, regularity, readiness, and uniformly good behavior of the students, the thoroughness and uni - formly high quality of the teaching. Watching a clasr. of twenty-flv ■» boys, ages fifteen and sixteen, in a lesson on logarithms where for forty-five minutes not an eye wavered from the thought in hand. I could but wish for the duplication of such teaching elsewhere. How different from the instruction one ordinarily sees where the teacher talks on for thirty or more minutes in a rambling way while probably one-half to three-fourths of her class, are paying no attention to what she says. Such waste Is cruel and very damaging to civilization, but will continue until we realize the seriousness of the situation and re- ■ </seg>

No one can teach what he does not know; neither can anyone teach all that he knows. No one should be called to teach as subject that he has not studied sufficiently under the best of masters. Edison is a great scientist, but he la hardly the proper man to direct a modern university department of physics. The Germans have met this condition by requiring of their secondary teachers an academic training equivalent to seven years beyond our high school and an addition of two years of special pro - fessional training, after which the teacher is given freeCom of action and a teaching that is most commendable. Another feature of the school work which the Germans are meeting much more intelligently than we, is the direction of the pupil's study or preparation of his lessons. But few students know how to study. The amount of time wasted on this account is very great and the dissolute habits of work thus formed are often sufficient to change the otherwise bright student into a mediocre one. The German student is required to do little or no home study. All his work is prepared under the immediate direction and guidance of the teacher. He is thus enabled to do much more work in a given time and at the expense of far less energy. Besides the habits of industry and economy thus established will be of immense value to him throughout life. There is now an experiment being tried in many of the German schools of having all the home study limited to one hour, to be given either betweeD five and six or six and seven P. M. All children to return to thsir respective schools for that hour to study under the direction of their teachers. Another waste that I should like to mention 'is that of instruction In methods and cadet teaching which Is often presented in the name of pedagogy at summer scboote and institutes... wherein a class of adults are made to play that they are children receiving their first lessons In reading, mathematics, history, etc. Such lessons are never given by anyone who has made a serious study of education, and why any teacher should watte time with such nonsense is difficult to understand. Quite different is the problem when real children are used to illustrate nciple in teaching that measures up to their capacity. In observ - ing quite a number of lessons in practice-teaching in the pedagogical seminar of the German Gymnasium everyone was real and serious. Both the teacher aDd taught were learning and the observers benefited.

            <seg id="p479">381 Educational Journalism . Read before The Nebraska Schoolmasters Club, May, 1908, by George L. Towne, Editor, The Nebraska Teacher. Educational journalism is as broad as the whole educational field. To attempt to discuss it all would require some volumes. There are many things which might profitably be mentioned. One might, for instance, take the historical side and find It of interest to follow from its foundations the first journal devoted to education; to give some sketches of noted editors; to indicate some of the suc - cesses and to find reasons for many of the failures. Or one might find it interesting to discuss the problems of the educational press from the side of the subcriber; to note what different classes of subscribers may have need for, to consider what would be of greatest assistance to the majority of the readers of most educational papers; those who do not have college or normal training and many who do not have even a high school education, who need suggestions and devices, helps and hints and methods of teaching. Or to consider the needs of that other class of readers, college graduates, superintendents and college men, who are most interested in the news, who want to keep in close touch with their fellows and with educational movements in the various parts of the country. But it is my purpose to discuss only a few matters that seem of importance at this time. I have chosen the place of the educa - tional press and the part it should play in a state educational system; its opportunity and ability to assist educational movements; Its duty toward rational undertakings, and the effort it should make to prevent mistakes and to protect the public from the selfish and unscrupulous. Place in the State System (First of all, what is its place and its part in the state educational m? The educational press is not a thing apart and independent of ehools, but it is an integral portion of the essential machinery for tiding and perfecting a system of education. It is as much a part is machine as is the first grade a part of the elementary school, fflce is in many respects like that of the university, the normal &gt;ls and the different organizations of teachers. It assists in ng right ideals before teachers and does what it can to inspire to aid teachers in attaining these ideals. As a part of the educational machine, the educational press is to be made use of by all the school and educational forces. There is no reason why it should not be called upon to assist any feasible and proper undertaking just as the State Department of Education or the State Teachers' Association is called upon to assist in any worthy undertaking which affects the welfare or progress of tne schools. I do not mean that it is to be the leader; on the contrary it should simply be a piece of the machinery. The State Teachers' Association may </seg>

The committee as the repr?sentative of the elation would of course be the leader in this movement, but the ational preee stands at hand a ready-made instrument to help secure desired ends. The educational journal is not to be edited by any one man or group of men. Its editorial staff though it may have regular contribu - tors, should consist of all the educational leadership of the community or state in which it circulates. Its contributions come' from the pro - gressive element- in education. Not alone from leading educators, but any teacher of whatever station, who has some good message to give or some need to reach all of the school people in that state or community, ought to feel perfectly free to make use of it. Any school officer who wishes to place before his teachers some commendable ideal or some wise method of procedure becomes at once a member of the editorial staff of the educational journal. I Though the school journal should be under fearless management the editor should have constructive ability, yet, in its truest form, not the mouth-piece of any man or *.ny group of m=n. It is •r the voice of the best educational leadership of the state. It 3 part in all progressive movements; in all undertakings which I up a better educational system, which establish truer pedagagoical ■iples. and which assist in bringing about those ideal conditions h we nil hope for but realize we have not yet attained. The journal is seldom if ever the recognized leader in a movement. It is never entitled to such recognition. It is however a medium for the use of those who are leading educational forces along right lines, educational campaign, like a political campaign, must have its leader; in fact without leadership little can be accomplished in any undertaking. This should come, however, as the combined judgment of the school men of the state, as it may be expressed by the State Teachers' Association, the Schoolmasters' Club, or the vote of con - fidence from the people which places a man at the head of the educa - tional department of the state. The educational journal follows this leadership. It stands ready to fender assistance following the lead of the proper officers or the proper association, which express the will and the judgment of the educational forces. When school legislation is needed, the educational press furnishes the medium through which the school people may be aroused. It furnishes the medium for guiding public sentiment and for the agitation which may be necessary. It should be made use of by the state super - intendent; city and county superintendents; college and normal school presidents and other educators.

Do the schools need better buildings — buildings that are more sanitary, that have better light, that are better heated and ventilated, that are more tastefully adorned, and more beautiful ex - amples architecturally? Then it becomes the means of making school officers and school teachers want better buildings, the means of showing them what these better buildings are, and how they may be secured. Should we have instead of the barren places upon which many school houses are built, school grounds with trees and flowers, walks and playgrounds; then the educational journal becomes the medium through which the school public may be shown this need and told what steps to take to secure these improvements. Should agriculture and domestic science and manual training become a part of our education, there must be a medium through which this want may be made known and the way marked out for its accomplishment. Does a Fowler or a McBrien want to emphasize the importance of public school reading, the wlcto?d impotence of methods of teaching it, the manner of making it infinitely better; the school journal is one of the means, and only one, of arousing the public conscience, of helping the teachers to see their weaknesses and to learn the better way. In short the journal is to serve a purpose very like that of a teachers' institute, or a teachers.' association, or a teachers' club, as a nK-ans to an end ; and is to be made use of in a like way whenever any worthy cause is. to be promoted. Its Position in the Nation The educational journal also has a duty toward national under - takings. There should be a national leadership and this, should come from th? National Department of Education, from the National Edu - cation Association or the national organization of colleges or normal schools or all of them. Thes.e should make use of the educational press in all the states. It is quite important to formulate theories of education and plans of procedure, but it is equally important to inform the public, to arouse their enthusiasm, to furnish working ideas and to get a movement under way. Many a good theory has been only a theory because the author thought his work done instead of begun when he conceived it.

It is her? that the editor must use prerogative. He must be the judge as to the worth or the jnhiness of any movement which may ask the aid of his paper, possible that some unworthy efforts may be made, even by men te motives are good, though usually an editor is called upon to le the use of his columns only to those who have selfish ends to n and who are not striving for the best interests of the schools as KHe must decide als.o upon the kind of material that can be used to even the good cause along. It often is necessary to reject a good tioned effort of literary merit, when in his judgment it strikes a wrong note. The best way to accomplish a desired end is by a positive method, just as the best way to build a strong building is to place •one aeries of bricks upon another, adding each day to what has been done the day before. Progress cannot be made if each morning the workmen tear down what they did the day before; so advancement cannot be made for the schools of the state by simply pointing out de - fects which exist in the system. We all know there are defects — plenty of them. It is hardly necessary even to mention these except when calling attention to their existence helps to remove them. The wiser and more helpful way is to decide what is good in what we already have, to emphasize this and work toward still better things. So the editor must choose articles which build up and not those which destroy. The article which is simply carping criticism for the sake of criticism is always to be discarded. It may be necessary, in order to prevent mistakes, to organize or to take part in an organized effort and the educational journal in such a case is simply a part of such an educational campaign — a campaign which is aa truly educational as the one which builds better </seg>
            <seg id="p483">LECTURES, REPORTS, ADDR N'D PAPERS 385 Graft in the Schools For many years the Nebraska Teacher, like its comrades of the newspaper press, has made a decided effort, though a modest and a quiet one, to free the schools and to protect the school men from graft and all its attendant evils. This effort has been made by means of occasional editorials, by means of notes, and discussions which the department editors have from time to time indulged in, and by means of articles specially contributed with this end in view. It has, been the purpose first of all to protect the young man just entering the profession, from the wily tempter, who for selfish reasons, lures him into some fault which later may be his undoing. It has been the purpose also to put school officer? and the public on their guard against the man who has gotten the habit of accepting illegitimate favors or commissions in return for bis recommendation or his business. The time has been particularly favorable for this sort of under - taking, because of the ill repute into which all improper methods of gaining business or giving contracts has come. The Nebraska Teacher will continue to do its, duty along this line. Would it not be well for teachers, superintendents and school officers to show no toleration of auch praotices? The time is now more than ever favorable for crystalizing public sentiment against any sort of graft, as we have known it to exist, either on the part of the schoolmen themselves, or school officers or business concerns, which deal either directly or indirectly with the schools. Public sentiment is the surest cure for evils of this kind and the strong condemnation of school men against such an improper use of one's position, would make at almost certain that the schools of Nebraska would hereafter be freed from it. To be sure, the frequency of the evil practice has perceptibly lessened within the last few years. Very few city superintendents are now open to any charge of wrong doing of this nature. Very few members of school boards, could be approached with any improper proposition and very few firms of any standing would consider It good business, or wise to secure adoptions or contracts by any but the very cleanest and most upright methods. But there are a few and we should know these and protect ourselves, and the public against them. There are still a few concerns which s?em to consider it their province to secure business by illegitimate means. Possibly there will always be some, though it seems, to me that should tkf sentiment of the school men be strongly felt and strongly expressed, even the firm which felt most like buying business, would not dare to do it. There are many ways of buying business and the firm which is reduced to this nueans of securing its contracts works cautiously and under cover. It attempts first of all, to get the school officer or the school superintendent to accept u&gt;me sort of favor which looks innocent. It may be a trip to some school convention with expsns.es paid ; it may be hotel bills for delegates in attendance at conventions; it may be a vacation trip to the N. E.

The young superintendent i; told that all of his fellows accept similar favors, and that the man who does not is foolish and is denying himself something which is legit - imately his and which he should tatoe; that the firm which does, not offer such concessions is niggardly and does not appreciate the busines The first favor of this kind usually comes when no business is at stake and so it seems more innocent than it otherwise would. But the clever agent, and it is only ju&amp;t to give him that title, has the future in mind and when the next year's recommendations are to be made, or the next year's contract let, this favor so innocently offered la cautiously called to mind. A few years ago it was. very common for school officers and superintendents to accept such innocent favors as Now it is very uncommon and yet the list of men who do accept them is altogether too long. The acceptance of r.uch favors is the forerunner of more substantial rewards and there ar? still concerns which make a practice of offering county and city superintendents a certain commission on ell the business which comes from their counties or districts. It is not often that a stipulated sum is paid for a particular piece of business. It is much more common to pay a certain amount, usually ten per cent, on all the business in a particular line which comes from the county or the city involved in the understanding. The unbelievable thing about It all is, that some of the men who s-till accept these commissions do not teem to realize that it is a wrong thing to do and have no notion that it is dangerous, which indicates that they have not yet felt the lash of public opinion. A certain county superintendent put the case thus: "This is to be my last term in office and I want to make all the money I can legiti - mately. (Note the word.) Therefore I should like to act as the rep - representative of your firm," etc. Another made a definite request that he be allowed to sell a certain line of goods and ace pt what be called the usual ten per cent commission. When he was told that that sort of procedure seemed altogether too much like graft, he protested his innocence of any such intention and made the startling proposition thmt he would be perfectly willing to let the directors, of his county know that he was to receive a commission; he wanted the matter to be bandied above board. A city superintendent in a small town urged mdidaey as the representative of a certain firm. He urged that M=trict had been dueling with this firm for some time and that all their transactions had been satisfactory. They hoped to use more of the came kind of material and therefore he wished to act as the repre - ■ "ntative of the firm in question. When informed that such a procedure would te exceedingly dangerous both to himself and the company, he replied that it did not seem so to him. He remembered that the year before he had sent a small order to a certain Chicago house without expectation of return and soon after a nice little check came, which wa very acceptable. </seg>

The board was. given authority le annual meeting to do this work and the members of the board authorized me to look after these things. We have the to pay on the delivery of the goods. I have corresponded several houses and we intend to buy where we can do the best. ve not Dor do I get anything for my time or trouble, but if you make me any proposition in this matter I am satisfied that I can the goods where 1 see fit as the board has left it to n. his. If you have anything to offer send it to me on a separate t from your letter to be presented to the board." KAnd here is another letter, from a man who counts himself a &gt;1 man, to the secretary of the board of education in one of our cities. "If it is not too late, I have a proposition to make to you. It is this: I hereby commission you to act as my agent to secure for me the superintendency of your schools, for the ensuing year. Let it be understood that if you are unsuccessful, I shall not be under obliga - tions to you; but if you succeed I will pay into your hands, provided that I accept the position, the excess of my salary above thirteen hundred and fifty dollars for the year. You can promise It where you know it will secure the result wanted. You can rely on the above proposition as being made by a man and a mason. Please let me have your answer by return mail; and if favorable state how long I will have to file my application, testimonials and references." K These letters are used for purposes, of illustration not to arouse curiosity as to the names of any who would degrade the teaching ?sMon in such a manner. It might be wise, however, for the ml to occasionally be more personal in such matters than has the practio? in the past. Though I have given, instances, of men who seek commissions these are not really the men who are the most dangerous. The man to be guarded against is the man who offers the commission. The firm which seeks busines?, by such m?ans is a standing corrupter. Such a firm Is deliberately seeking to debauch every one it finds sw. - ceptible. It Is devoting its talents and its energy to finding excuses for men to do what it knows to be unquestionably wrong. While the man who accepts such a favor, if he does- not make a practice of it, has probably innocently fallen into a trap, because of the clean bill of health which the wily agent has given his offer. But the agent who makes such an offer doesn't do it innocently and the man who accept?., finds a little later that he has placed himself at the mercy of such an agent because the acceptance of a favor or a commission becomes a club which is held over this man ever afterward. </seg>
            <seg id="p486">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 388 It is well to take note often of the fact that tbe men who are known to be absolutely free from suspicion, the men who are stalwart, ab - solutely honest and absolutely beyond approach, are the men whose salaries, are raised year after year in the places they hold; and these are the men who are called to take the best positions, the positions that pay the best salaries and offer the best opportunities. It is well to note also that the men who are known to be susceptible to influence of an illegitimate character, who are known to accept favors and sometimes commissions, are the men who stay year after year without advancement and who do not secure the best places. Men must not expect that illegitimate favors and commissions can be accepted without it being known among their fellows. There is a very general knowledge of those who are susceptible to such influence. In fact those who offer the commissions are the men most likely to spread the news. A man who is willing to pay a commission or offer a bribe is not a man to keep a confidence. There are always enough who know those In the habit of accepting illegitimate favors, to pass the news about the Let us put an end to what remains of this, pernicious practice. Let us have no more graft among school men in Nebraska and let us hope that there will be very little among school officers. Let us not content ourselves any longer with the contention, though it is doubtless corrfct, that there is less of graft among school men than in any other profession. School men, above all others, should be entirely free from any such taint. We have only to cultivate a right public sentiment and a thorough-going feeling that the man who auccumbs to such temptations shall not be recommended for promotion. He is not to be trusted. If, for a petty advantage to himself, he has betrayed the community which has confidently believed him true, hia selfishness will lead him to do the same kind of thing in a new community. The firm or agent that persists in the damnable practio? of cor - rupting men, cannot be measured out too severe treatment. The agent who makes an improper offer or suggestion should be ever after refused even a hearing and his firm also, till it puts a respectable representative in his place. It is doubtful whether the educational press can render a better service than constantly to warn the young principal and the young superintendent against the man who would make use of them to further his own ends.; and to arouse public sentiment against illegi - lmate practices either on the part of school men themselves or school officers, or the corrupt agent seeking whom he may devour. Aa far as the state educational journal is concerned, it certainly has a distinct place in the educational scheme of the state; it has boundless opportunity to be of assistance to the educational leadership of the state; it forms one of the instruments which should be made rue of when we some day have a national leadership; and it has a duty to ass-ist in preventing serious mistakes and in protecting the public against graft and unrighteousness. These at least are the ethics of one educational Journal. </seg>
            <seg id="p487">LECTURES, REPORTS, ADDRESSES AND i'APKKS 389 Let me conclude by quoting from an address by Sla&amp;.on Thomp - son of Chicago in speaking of the newspaper press. What he says is just as true of the educational pre&amp;s: "Each editor, publisher, or proprietor — whoever is the controlling spirit behind the types, the man who pockets the profits or empties his. pockets to make good' the losss — his will, his judgment, his conscience, his hopes, necessities or am - bitions, constitute the ethics of on? paper, no more. To expose and oppose wrong is an almost involuntary rule among newspaper workers from chief to printer's devil. They may make mistakes, like others, but I testify to a wi?Jl recognized intention of the profession, the rule is to 1 am the facts and print them too — to know the truth and not hide it under a bushel. The press stands for light not darkness. Thieves and rascals of high and low degree hate and malign it, but no I man has reason to fear the abus.e of its power. It has no license to do wrong; it has boundless liberty and opportunity to do good." Equal Chances For All. (An address prepared by President Roosevelt for the dedication of the national institute for the co-operation of agriculture and educa - tional labor, capital, home making and citizenship, Springfield, Massachusetts., November 11, 1908.) Now, in striving for co-op?ration between the national and state governments* and the farmers, for the uplifting of farm life, I am striving for exactly this principle, the principle of combining self help with 'mutual helpfulness. Of course the prime thing to be done for the farmer, as for everyone else, is to help him to help himself. If he won't help hims If. if he lies down on others and tries to make them carry him, we can rest assured that neither nation, state nor neighbors can permanently benefit him. Nevertheless a helping hand is of great service when extended even to those most capable of helping themselves. I The individual, the community, the state, each must give an iple of self help; but groups of individuals and of states — and largest group of all, the nation — may all co-operate with advantage their common interests. Perhaps this is especially true in trying »cure the conservation of our forests, and waters, the protection of streams from pollution, and the like. It is for this reason that I to see the nation not only establish forest reserves whe - ible all through the western states and territories, but join In ing the Whits mountain region a forest reserve, just as it proposes o with the Appalachian region. Agriculture Most Important We have been in the past, and we are yet, a people with whom agriculture has been the most important business. There never has been in history any movement comparable to the wonderful westward march of the hard working American pioneer farmers, and of those who </seg>
            <seg id="p488">390 camr after them, who have overspread this continent, and who are now filling its remotest corners, and thanks to whom there are unin - terrupted stretches of farm land from sea to sea, from the gulf to the watershed of the Arctic ocean. The rough wilderness has been aubdued by those who in their veins blend in a common stream the blood of so many nations of the old world. Through that moat wise economic statute, the homestead law, we have been enabled to develop the family farm, the most important and the most American of all our institutions; for our greatness as a people rests in no small degree upon the fact that instead of having here in the country districts a popu - lation of peasants on minute holdings, or else of tenants who work for large land owners, we have everywhere, as the typical American farm, a medium-sized farm, tilled mainly or in large part by the owner himself and his sons. But now that the more desirable areas of our public land have been settled, the homestead law does not meet the new conditions, and we ad - here best to its spirit when we try to modify the sys.tem at land owner - ship in such a way as to insure continuous progress and uplift, so that the American farmer may not only obtain material prosperity, but on it build a high type of civilization. Important the city is, and fortunate though it is that our cities have grown as they have done, it is still more important that the family farm, where the home making and the outdoor business are combined into a unit should continue to grow. In every great crisis of our government and in all the (low, s work between the crises which alone enables us to meet them when io arise, it is the farming folk, the people of the country districts, who have shown themselves to be the backbone of the nation. Farming of the Future IXow, when I ask that the nation co-operate with the states and the farmers themselves for the steady growth and uplift of farm I am not so much asking that the state help the people as I am it shall provide free opportunity for the people to continue their ird course through self-help and associated effort. I The farms of America are worth some thirty billions of dollars, their annual produce amounts to about eight billions. For this ■nt year, 1908, the cropa as a whole do promise the largest "gate in quantity, quality and value ever produced in our history, means that the six millions and over of farm families, more than f millions of farm people, are in a good position already; but I this position to be made sure and better. The farm no longer produces the domestic manufactures of two generations ago, but merely the raw products of food and clothing; for the great improvements in agricultural production and in transpor - tation have rendered it possible for one man on the farm now to produce food and clothing for three, whereas, formerly it needed two to perform such a feat for themselves and a third.

Farm ClUacasbip It would be a very great wrong to allow our country people, who have prospered so much, whose welfare has meant so much for the nation in the past, in any way to fall off from their former position. There is no need whatever for this happening. With wise care of our natural resources, our forests will grow better each year, our rivers more available for navigation, while the spil of our farms will improve with wise use instead of deteriorating. While as a nation we are growing wealthier and wealthier, we should see that the schools and the roads. — 'in short, all of what may be called the rural realty — should be improved. Here, as everywhere else, our prime object should be the development of the highest type of average citizen. Therefore, we should especially devote ourselves to the things, that are of interest to the average citizen. The country school is therefore of even more importance than the higher college, thoroughly alive we all should be to the vitalizing force which these higher colleges represent. There must be improvement in farm management; this is now being brought about partly by the joint action of the farmers themselves. So far as, it is possible we should strive for a common sense co-operation in institutions which shall do what the isolated farmers-, cannot well do by themselves. As an example we can refer to the experiments recently carried on by private individuals, and by th? national department of acric-ulture, and by the state experi - ment stations, to show the extraordinary possibilities In improving the breeds of our food plants and of our animals. Overcome Farm Disadvantages In all of this we have to grapple with one fact which has made both the strength and the weakness of the American farmer, and that is, his isolation. This, isolation implies a lack both of the pleasure and of the inspiration which come from closer contact between people, and from a well developed organization for social pleasure, for religious, life, for education. On the other hand, it is to this isolation more than to anything «lse that we owe the strength of character so typical of the American farmer, who lives under a peculiar individual - istic system in the management alike of the farm and of the farm home. The sucoess/ully managed family farm gives to the father, the mother and the children better opportunities for useful work and for a happy life than any other occupation. Our object must be so far as practical to do away with the disadvantages which are due to the isolation of the family farm, while conserving its many and great advantages. We wish to keep at its highest point the peculiarly American quality of individual efficiency, while at the same time bringing about </seg>
            <seg id="p492">392 I be ethical proficiency of our people, for there is. much the individual only do for himself, and there is much also which must be done by combined because the individual cannot do it. Our aim must be lupplement individualism on the farm and in the home with an dated effort in those country matters that require organized work - together. Country Homes for City Workers I Moreover we must not forget that there is a new phase of the lem of the country, which is the problem of country homes for workers. Cheap transportation, which has strengthened so much endency to city growth, is now helping to scatter the population of cities for home purposes through the adjacent country. As we nearer the healthy ideal of a universal eight-hour day, and a r association between employer and employee, there will be growth le opportunity for city people to enjoy suburban homes. t Therefore we have to deal now, and we will have to deal in uture with a nation of families on the land; and our system of c education should be so broadened in its scope as to include not ly the traditional cultural studies., excellent and indespensable in way, but also instruction relative to the farm, the trades and the Our immediate purpose is to take the first steps in providing for the 95 per cent who are not now trained for a vocation, advantages corresponding to those enjoyed by the relatively few who are trained in the professional and technical schools. I Industrial training, training which will fit a girl to do work in lome, which will fit a boy to work in the shop if in a city, to work farm if in the country, is the most important of all training from that which develops character; and it is a grave reproach i as a nation that we have permitted our training to lead the ren away from the farm and shop Instead of toward them. Schools Most Fit for Life EWe should try to provide the many with training in their profes - i, JUBt as the few, the doctors, the ministers, the lawyers, are «d for their profession*. ■In other words, the school system should be aimed primarily to ie scholar for actual life rather than for a university.

He should be ■raced and his development promoted; but this should not be done e expense of all the other individuals who can do their work best ie farm and in the workshops; it is for the benefit of these individ - that our school system should be primarily shaped.

Teachers must be trained, or their teaching will not be adequate; aal these teachers must then give vocational training to the scholars in the ordinary schools. The nation would simply co-operate with the state or city or town, and what it thus gives would be applied to indus - trial, technical, agricultural training. I The growth in the consolidated rural school, which has in so many knees supplanted the old time district school, offers; a chance to do best possible service by means of such a system as that outlined Where possible, the secondary agricultural schools should be in farm communities rather than in towns, and the training should be of the most practical character and such as will not only fit the scholars to do their part in farm work, but also fit them to enjoy in the fullest degree the pleasures and opportunities of country life. We should do everything that we can to give well trained leaders to each country community. The United States department of agriculture would preserve an intimate relation to all these proposed agricultural high schools, as well as the branch stations connected with them, for the work that the department does is steadily becoming of more and more consequence to the farmers. It is All Practical Co-operation I All this simply means that the nation ought to co-operate with tate to help the people belp themselves through better educational ties, the schools being left wholly and directly under the control e people through their local authorities, but suggestion and general light as well as improvement being supplied by the experts em - ■d by the nation, so that the children and the young men and g'irls le smaller towns and in the country may have the educational ties now only to be obtained in the wealthier communities. This would m«rely be putting into effect that cardinal American doctrine of furnishing a reasonable equality of opportunity of education and chance of development to all our children, wherever they live and whatever may be their station in life. Such a federal co-operation in technical education will help in many ways. It will mean much for the country life, for the life of th« family farm, far the life of those city workers who seek landed homes in the country near the city in which </seg>

Were the district meeting, the district board, the director, the moderator and the treasurer to comply with all require - ments of the "Business Calendar" ae printed in the first pages of our school lawa. many petty quarrels and much of the serious trouble that usually follows the annual meeting, often working a detriment to the school throughout the year, might be avoided. 'New school laws are passed by every session of the legislature. These new laws increase the duties, the responsibilities and opportunities of school officers, patrons and teachers. I We regret that the supply of school laws is so limited. There is Dne copy for each of the eeven thousand school districts. This is to be kept in the custody of the school officers, and produced tern at all meetings of the district. But let this one copy of the be passed along from officer to officer till each one is well ac- Ued with the duties of his office. There are many things on different reports which must be attended to within ten days after the annual meeting. Exercise more care in making out these reports. Get them in on time. It would be well for the directors to meet their respective county superintendents at convenient places and make out their reports in the presence of the superintendent. Many county superintendents meet their officers for this purpose. It is an excellent plan and does away with many vexing problems and delays for both director and superintendent. Text-Books, Library and Apparatus It Is the duty of every teacher to instill in her pupils a desire to take proper care of all school property. Under our present free text-book law this subject is one of great importance. Experience s that where proper care is. exercised by the school board and teachers this law is popular and satisfactory; but it becomes a detri - ment and a nuisance whenever pupils are permitted to carelessly soil, mark, deface or destroy the books. Teachers should appeal to the pride of their pupils in a proper use of the books; insist on habits of </seg>

Teachers should also hold pupils responsible for preserv - ing and returning books in good order by the proper use of the per - manent text-book record. »It is a crime under the Criminal Code of Nebraska for any person lfully and maliciously injure or deface any school property. Sec- Ill of the Criminal Code reader I "If any person shall wilfully and maliciously injure or deface any ch edifice, school house, dwelling house, or other building, its res. books, or appurtenances, or shall commit any nuisance therein, hall purposely and maliciously commit and trespass upon the ised grounds attached thereto, or any fixtures placed thereon, or any isure or sidewalk about the same, such person shall be fined in any not exceeding one hundred dollars." Kit is nothing short of criminal negligence the way some schools it pupils, to maliciously injure or deface school property. A pru - watchfulness in the care of school property is a better means of ing morality than long lectures on the subject and then permit s to violate the law in a reckless destruction of public property. IWe urge upon school officers the importance of furnishing their sis with up-to-date text-books. You should no more expect pupils teachers to work with text-books that are behind the times than should think of throwing aside the self-binder or the check-row^r ?turn to the implements used by your fathers. There are books in reading, arithmetic, geography, language, physiology, spelling and history in too many of our common schools today that are valuable chiefly as relics. It is impossible to enumerate all of the new sciences, the new forces., new systems, and new methods that have entered, and are about to enter, the domain of pedagogics through twentieth century text-books. It is sufficient here to say. Awake to your duty in fitting out the schools with the newest and best text-books now in the market. Twentieth century boys and girls demand, among their inherent rights, twentieth century text-t&gt;ooks. Your children will advance just in the proportion that you give them opportunities — just in the proportion that you surround them with good teachers, good schools and good books, good libraries. What is the old water craft which carried the naked savage as compared to the modern man-of-war like the Olympia or the Oregon carrying a Dewey or a Clark! What is the old water craft when compared with the modern steamship that turns its brave prow from the port of New York, with a compass like a conscience, crossing three thousand miles of billows without missing a throb or beat of its mighty iron heart from shore to shore! What are the old books — books written upon the skins of wild beasts, — upon the shoulder blades of sheep — books written upon leaves, upon bark, as compared with the splendid volumes that enrich the libraries of our day! And when I speak of libraries, I think of the remark of Plato: "A house that has a library in it has a soul." And may we not add: "A school that has a library in it is a school that has a soul." *7 </seg>

The slate board is the best and the cheapest in the end. But we warn you not to purchase any supplies, charts or apparatus from agents without a meeting of your board; and not then at $47.50 a chart, nor half that amount. Schoolhouse and Grounds Section 13 of Subdivision 4 of the school law makes it the duty of the district board to provide the necessary appendages for the •chool house, and to keep the same in good condition and repair during the time school shall be taught. Why let the schoolhouse and school grounds become like a forgotten cemetery during the summer? Mow the grass, paint the schoolhouse, have the door on its hinges, repair the lock, build up the chimney,' straighten up the lightning rods, put in the window glass, blacken the stove and pipe and replace that brick with a new stove foot, provide poker and ash pan, fix the door e.tep, rebuild or remove the fences, beautify the grounds by planting trees; encourage the children to plant trees, vines and flowers; and above all, we insbt upon healthful conditions, both for body and mind, at the outhouses — they should cease to be hell holes of vulgarity and obscenity, which is too often the case. Kind of School Officers Needed Without wide-awake, interested school officers, our schools cannot make much progress. We are glad that we have so many school of - leera. that are truly interested in the welfare of the schools. We want school officers who will uphold the teacher in all reasonable rules and regulations, even if the penalty falls on the heads of their own children. We want school officers who will encourage the teacher in professional reading and in attendance at teachers' meetings and ites. Yes. officers who will insist on these things rather than oppose them. We want officers who will themselves read educational journals and keep in touch with the newest and best methods of education, and- who will attend educational meetings called by the county superintendent. At least we want school officers who will visit their own schools and thus know for a certainty whethpr the school is a success or a failure; officers who will co-operate with the county superintendent on all school matters. How to Improve the Rural Schools It is self-evident that the first condition of good rural schools Is a sufficiency of funds with which to provide and maintain them. How to provide these funds If. not an easy problem. Many of our dis - trict* are small. The assessed valuation is low. So is. the enumer - ation. With a small share of the Mate apportionment and with the tax levy that has reached the limit of the law and yet a want of funds to run a good school, the question is a serious one. And the attendance is. often such as to make the per capita cost of maintainance unduly large, so that even a common school education becomes very costly. </seg>
            <seg id="p497">397 To overoome the many disadvantages of the present rural school system in Nebraska, and for the purpose of giving every farmer's boy and girl of this noble commonwealth opportunities equal to the girls and boys of the village and city, we recommend to the careful consid - eration of every rural school board and to the fathers and mothers in the&amp;e rural districts, the consolidation of schools and the transpor - tation of pupils. Consolidate or centralize the weak districts into a common central school, conveying the pupils from every part of the greater district, or the congressional township to and from school by s of covered vans or wagons, in charge of clean, capable, careful drivers. This idea of consolidation and transportation is not original with us. It has proved a success in Ohio and several other ■&lt; Note the following letter from Seymour Rockwell, Esq., of Montayne. Mass., for nearly thirty years, a member of the school board, who says: "For twenty years we have had the best attendance from the transported children; no more sickness among them and no accidents. hildren like the plan exceedingly. We have saved the town (con - solidated district) at least $600 a year. All these children now attend school In a fine house at the center, well equipped. The schools are graded. Everybody is converted to the plan. We encountered all the opposition found anywhere, but we asserted our sensible and legal rights., and accomplished the work. I see no way to bring up the country schools but to consolidate them, making them worth seeing, then the people will be more likely to do their duty by visiting them." I The merits of the plan may be briefly stated as follows.: ( 1 ) pupils enjoy the advantages of that interest and enthusiasm and dence which numbers, always bring; (2) pupils can be better ifled and graded; (3) tardin ss i-nd irregular attendance reduced to the minimum; (4) no quarrelling, improper con - or improper language so common among children on their way nd from school; (5) no wet feet or wet clothing, nor colds ting therefrom; (6) pupils have the advantage of better school - m, better lighted, better heated, better ventilated; (7) this plan is to result iD fewer and better teachers, better paid. I There are hundreds of rural schools In Nebraska that should &gt; in centralized schools. There are also hundreds of weak rural ols, near village or city, that ought to transport thsir pupils to village or city. Incidental to the operation of this plan rural schools will be estabished, rural libraries will be built up, and &gt;elieve the day not far distant when the same coaches that carry children to and from school may also carry, under government ract, the mails, and distribute them free to our farming com - ities.

Therefore, in behalf of your sons and daughters on the farm, let me urge upon you to establish your rural graded schools, your rural libraries. "The best physical laboratory in America Is the well-regulated American farm. Here the boys and girls study nature first-hand. Here they observe the growth and life of plants and animals. H?re they breathe pure air, become familiar with the beauties and wonders of the natural world. Here they make character. To have added to all these opportunities the advantages of a high school education, without any of the disadvantages that attend spending of the evenings, without chores or home duties, in the town, la an educational condition that is almost ideal." Intelligent Supervision Imperative Permit us to urge upon school officers, patrons and teachers, the adoption of the State Course of Study. This will mean a more definite course of instruction in the ungraded schools. It will take nothing lese. than an herculean effort on the part of teachers and superintend - ents throughout the state to make this, anywhere near a general success. A school will not grade itself. Patient, persistent labor will be required to reach the goal. Is not the end worth the effort? Hon. Geo. A. Walton of Massachusetts says: "Actual results demon - strate that at least one year in six is gained in completing the ordinary branches of study even by an imperfect grading of schools." Hon. J. W. Akers of Iowa says: "Little can be done in the way of progress, in our country schools until the result of each teacher's work is made ■ of record, &amp;o that a succeeding teacher may begin where work closed and carry it forward." Education an Absolute Necessity It seems humiliating to be under the necessity, in the twentieth century, of entering into a formal argument to prove the utility, and to free governments, the absolute necessity of education. But there are some parents ignorant enough and selflsii enough to deny the advantages and blessings of a free education to their own children. It Ir degrading to a Christian age and to a free state, that there are some men, even in Nebraska, whose souls are so completely absorbed In the accumulation of wealth, and whose avarice is so increased with success, that they look upon their own children in no other light than as instruments of gain — that they, as well as the shop, the store, the horses, the cattle, the hogs and the sheep, their farms and ranches. are valuable only in proportion to their annual earnings. But why should these men cling so closely to their gold? The trophies which It can purchase, the idols which it sets up, will scarcely survive their purchasers. No name, no honor can long be perpetuated by mere matter. Look at the stupendous pyramids of Egypt which were raised at such an Immense cost of toil and treasure!

Let us hearken unto the voice of patriots and statesmen. Edmund Burke: "Education is the chief defense of nations." Edward Everett: "Education is a better safeguard of liberty than a standing army." Horace Mann: "Jails and state prisons are the complement of schools: so many less, as you have of the latter, so many more you must have of the former." Hear General John A. Logan: "The million school children who daily march to the schoolhouses. of the north, the west and the south are better as a defense for the whole nation than a standing army as large as all the armies of Europe. The hundreds of thousands of school teachers who daily drill these children in the schoolhouses are a better provision for training the nation in patriotism than all the statesmen and military officers of the old world, every child of the nation be sent to a good school, and trained by a proper method In broad national ideas, and we nesd never fear either foreign aggression and domination, or domestic insurrection and sec - tional strifes and jealousies. Strength, peace, harmony, prosperity, nobility of character, patriotism, virtue, and happiness, will flow as from a perennial spring in the mountains., to fill the land forever." The Need of the Hour The soul of a good school is the teacher; therefore, the need of the hour is educated, professionally trained teachers; teachers who have a love for the work; teachers, whose character is above reproach; teachers who are strong physically as well as intellectually; teachers, large-hearted, God-fearing, liberty loving. I See the hundreds of well qualified American teachers in the Philip - teaching the Philippino.

Crusade for the Country School. K (Address of Chancellor E. Benjamin Andrews of the Univers; iska. president of the Nebraska State Teachers' Association. No - 1908.) The association is to be congratulated upon the success of the meetings now in progress. Never before have our numbers been so large, never has such wide and deep enthusiasm marked our coming together. The change of the date for our meeting .stands justified; it has been approved by an unexpectedly large number of school boards. All superintendents so far as known have assisted to this result, a ■e for which they deserve the gratitude of the school public, rogram this year is rich and in a good degree novel. One new feature, however, stands out above the rest — it is the formal setting apart in the program of a rural school day. I hail with delight this recognition of the importance attaching to country schools. It cannot but be very influential. In most of its aspects city life is commonly thought more desirable than life in the country. To date it has probably been superior on the whole, and it may still be so; but the advantage, if it exists, is less and less pronounced. In a hundred ways country residence is growing in desirableness.

The best teachers, the finest apparatus, the stateHest schoolhouses, the amplest appliances for schooling in nearly all particulars are still found in the cities. Only of late are we able to note change. Country schools ought not to be inferior. They should be the best. This, not alone for the country's sake but for the Country's. The weal of rural communities is no affair of these com - munities alone but concerns the entire republic. For its continuance and strength the nation requires that the rural classes should atrive. »An intelligent rural population is necessary to the finest character integrity of the whole people, for the richest development of aon sense, sincerity, large views and patriotism. These qualities to spring from the land. They are found in cities mo&amp;tly because Sht there. The strongest instances of them are not indigenous &gt;wns. Town life would soon grow sickly alike in moral and cal regards but for the incessant importation of blood and char - from the land. It is a. matter of common knowledge that nearly le men and women of commanding positions in society, business, ce, literature and life were born and reared In the oountry. I Over and above these considerations, which apply to other lands rell as to the United States, there is a special reason for conserving strengthening rural interests here. All over Europe the great land er is a more significant character than the manufacturer or the ker. Socially land owning counts more than wealth in any other a. The aristocracies of European states all stand in some sort of section with the proprietorship of land. An immense influence other i wealth thus operates against that of mere wealth. In the ted Staets. unfortunately, we as\ yet possess no counterpoise against dead weight of Mammon. We need to raise up such, and the best lot the only way to do thia is to cultivate the rural interests. Id up and keep up a country population, worthy and able to deter - e our national character. tlt'r. well-to-do farmers are a republic's most valuable bulwark, than other classes they think sanely, see things steadily and see whole. They love peace and pursue it, but at cries of national "When the guns begin to shoot, my boys When the guns begin to shoot," "It's please to walk in front, sir When the guns, begin to shoot" At such moments the young man from the country can always be counted on to find the firing line. 1 Hearing me place the stress I do upon the education and upbuild - of the rural classes s-ome might aocuse me of talking politics and ing for the farmer vote. My thought is much more serious, and </seg>

As agriculture shall fare in time to come so human civil - m itself must fare, the interests being one and inseparable. I The other generic supports of men's industry, mining, the forest*, manufacturing, are fast nearing their term, which means that tful toil by human beings is to be inevitably thrown back more land, its sole adequate and final resource. But the land itself fail save as the tilth of it is placed in intelligent hands. The and for a better educated rural populace is but the undertone of 's call for a larger and better life. How can such a country population be reared? How can the landed interest be put in a condition to be felt as a solid factor in American civilization, always to be reckoned with, opposing in every appropriate way the rule of brute Mammon and of those pernicious social and political tendencies always so active in great municipalities? How can we so establish country life as to make it a benflcient safety valve, fly wheel or governor to our colossal social engine? I Full answer to this inquiry would take us far; but it is clear nothing else can more momentously conduce to this grand end perfecting the country school. It is an indispensable requirement, all country schools be rendered just as. fine, just as complete, and as efficient as. resources permit. There is no reason why country ols should not be the best in existence. Their possibilities are reat as their importance. In many respects all the natural ad - ages lie with them. As. we are not sufllciently awake to the value le country school, so we do not begin to appreciate the future that be created for it. When rapid aDd easy travel over country roads is the rule, schools •will be concentrated at county and township centers — a process already print on at a rapid rate — so that grading can be as complete as you ■wish to make it. A higher order of teaching talent will be available. T*eir grading and administration being satisfactory, country schools can be rendered immensely more instructive and inspiring than city schools. Their government is less apt to be cursed with politics. Their patrons are apt to be more sympathetic and reasonable. In the classification of pupils one might at first imagine that town schools must be the more fortunate. They are usually large, giving you the fullest opportunity to sift. But the matter is not e.o simple. Numbers afford chances for fine grading, but they also im - pose upon you the necessity of large rooms — full, which make aught like perfect teaching an impossibility. A great many country schools will remain small, with not over twenty-five pupils in a room, enabling the skilled teacher to apply the personal method as can rarely be done In cities. What a benediction is freedom to deal with pupils one by one or in very small classes, that individual peculiarities may be </seg>
            <seg id="p506">404 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT No one will question that in pupil material country schools are greatly the better off. As a rule country pupils, have the firmer con - stitutions, endurance and health. Generally speaking their intelligence Is higher and their thirst for learning greater. Their sensibility is the more open and free. City children have fewer plays involving imag - ination. The average morality of country children is far and away superior and they have an Impatience to learn which is not to be paralleled save by the rarest boys and giris in the city. The whole morale of schools in the country may easily be made loftier than is common in city schools. How helpful in this direction is the freedom country children have to play. It would also seem easier to secure from them regular attendance. Less occurs to distract their attention from study. Country schools are animated by a charming spirit of democracy not found in cities, preventing cliques and the partitioning of school society into higher and lower. The staunchest type of Americans is that country and village population, whether Saxon, Celtic, Latin or Slavic in origin, so little subjected to the undesirable influences of our newest immigration. Only, in far too many localities, this sturdy American stock is falling to make the progress it should. Our social resources need a development at once more intensive and more intel - ligent, to supplement the spontaneous efforts upward with which in our period of extensive growth we are tempted to be content. Manual training, now generally and properly regarded as. an disable part of early education, is surer to be acquired by country children than by city children. School manual training in the country may be no better than in town; yet country boys and girls have an advantage in this, branch, since their activity outside of school affords manual instruction of the most useful kind because practical. In cities artisans of all sorts are at every one's beck and call to do all needed things, an unfortunate facility which city parents ought to lament on behalf of their children, who thus lose educational privileges they can never make up. In city as in country homes all ordinary repairs about the prem - ises, as of clothing, wood work, furniture, locks, clocks,, machines and gear of all sorts, should be done by the young people of the household. All girls and boys should know how to sharpen scissors, knives and tools. Common painting should be their care. A great deal of the less difficult making, as of ordinary clothing, furniture and tools, should be required of them. Every boy and every girl as well ought to be proficient in harnessing, unharnessing, saddling and unsaddling hones, in the proper hitching up and driving of teams, in managing of nervous animals. A country boy should not be permitted to vote until he has successfully broken a colt or two. Youth of both sexes should know how to swim and to row, also the elements of garment mend - ing, of cooking, of first aid to the injured, and of nursing the sick. BThe great recommendation of these various, accomplishments is not r convenience, though they eminently possess that, but their edu- </seg>
            <seg id="p507">405 eative power. They are mental and never merely manual. They form mind, morality, sense and soul, as truly as book studies, in fact much more effectively than most book studies. They are the more valuable for being concrete, nearer to real life, serving material ends. In and through them mind is articulated without reality in a natural way. That school practice which most completely utilizes for edu - cational purposes the necessary ongoings af our life, with least n«e««aity for artificial school appliances, is, so far forth, the best. It is not to our credit as school people that we make and let patrons, and parents make so little of home manual training. I Lest this large reference to manual training mislead I hasten to that the school I have in mind is alter all the old stock and lard public school of America, one of our nation's royal glories, it continue forever, a trunk current of spiritual and civic influence, I to all that is best in our social body! I am in favor of agricultural trade schools for all pupils desiring them when advanced enough oose callings with some wisdom, provid.-i such schools are so taken it to spoil th? unity or spirit of the system. Let not education for ;ions become a craze. We do not wish to supplant our pr c school system but only to diversify and adapt it. Sentiments recently uttered by Dr. A. S. Draper, if correctly reported in a New York Times editorial, July 5, m to me open to criticism. Dr. Draper is right in alleging "lack of sufficient articulation between the educational and the industrial systems of the country," but is in error, I think, in s.ay'ng that "our elementary schools train for no industrial employments." They in fact lay the basis for all employments. Reading, writing and ciphering are such hMm Dr. Draper must admit this. True, our common schooling leads to no particular calling. It is general and liberal, and so may it forever remain. We may be forced to devote fewer grades to the foundation work, perhaps encouraging youth who think they must specialize thus early to enter vocational schools or cours-.es — agriculture or some mechanic art — so early as the end of the sixth grade. But these schools, as well as the nature, manual training and domestic art studies of the earlier grades, should be germane to the system, not divisive, not extrinsic; they should fadge on to what has preceded, and, in a way, to the parallel work of the pupils who do not specialize, so that in the end as in the beginning, the pupil may justly feel that he is at work perfecting himself for the service of hi?, kind. Manhood, citizenship, sociality — that is, after all, more vital than outfit for special calling. We can't afford to let this high and splendid ideal be trenched upon or overshadowed by rense of vocation. Craftwise, society is unhappily divided already. Too many a man is for his set, his guild, his trade. Recipients of public education must stand for breadth, public spirit, humanity. ■In arguing, very ably, for his two classes of industrial schools, ory schools" to teach work as a part of an organization, and le schools" to train mechanics for independent work, Dr. Draper </seg>
            <seg id="p508">406 STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT says: "These schools are not primarily to quicken mentality." With all due deference, this seems to me shocking pedagogy. Vocational training, to have any fit place in public schools, ought to be "primarily" Eckener of pupils' mentality. In fact this quality may well be your criterion in arranging any vocational course of study. So i at least, of the "liberal" idea ought by all means, to be retained, your trade school of this, make your classes mere gangs of ntices thinking of naught but the wages they are to earn, and, my word, your school will be as hard to keep filled with pupils ' least popular public schools now. What we desire then, is not a substitute for the good old common school but only the old thing in up-to-date form, different gifts, with the same spirit: improved methods, enriched courses, relatively more atudy of things and of nature as compared with mere books. From the beginning of the seventh grade you may introduce vocational special - ties, preferably through separate schools. I urge circumspection even in this, believing that it will be found best in the main to postpone specializing to the high school period when, all agree, it may be given fairly free reign — trade high schools in town — agricultural high schools out on the land. But let the system in every stage, phase, and breadth of it be one, unitary, self-consistent, a public and general affair, broad and liberal in spirit rather than technical, narrow, divisive. This con - dition is. not difficult to fulfil. You can teach blacksmithing with pupil's mentality ever in view, as you can teach arithmetic with a purely huckstering aim. Nature, the central object of attention in modern schooling, city pupils can approach only with travel and expense, but it lies in all its departments open and ready for inspection under the eyea of country pupils, without money and price. Country pupils forever have before them our adorable mother earth, with her infinite and ever shifting species of matchless loveliness — surfeits of eye beauty in landscape, waterfall, frost-play, lightning, sunshine, sky and rainbow; surfeits of ear-beauty in the wind, in the rush of brooks and rivers, in the thunder's, diapason, and the chorus of the inimitable bird-music waking them morning by morning. All these influences are aesthetic, and they are moral as well, which is one great reason why country folk average to be better behaved than city folk. KThe sons and daughters of the country are always practicing •iously or unconsciously the liturgy set forth in Emily Dickinson's , entitled: "A Service of Song." "Some keep the Sabbath by going to church; I keep it staying at home. With a bobolink for a chorister And an orchard for a dome. Some keep the Sabbath in surplice; I Just wear my wings. And instead of tolling the bell for church Our little sexton sings. </seg>

I How desperately much of that bucolic glory inhabitants of gr;at i miss — God's sky at best in retail pieces, often never at all le for days; the sun eclipsed behind clouds of black smoke; never irise or a sunset; never a whole rainbow, only choppy bits of one and then, half seen, dingy and ashamed, athwart tall chimneys and craping business blocks. Often as I walk the streeets of a great city do I recall Matthew Arnold's verse: Who can see the green earth any more As she was by the sources of time? Who imagines her fields as they lay In the sunshine, unworn by the plow? Who thinks as. they thought, The tribes who then roamed on her breast, Her vigorous, primitive sons? This tract which the river of Time ■Sow flows through with us, is the plain. Gone is the calm of its earlier s.hore. Bordered by cities and hoarse With a thousand cries is its stream And we on its breast, our minds Are confused as the cries which we hear Changing and short as the sights which we see.. There must be in our land multitudes, of children, if not of men and women, who have never in all their lives seen a natural forest, meadow, grass-plat, mountain or waterfall; never heard "the wild sough of the sea," or even the great lakes' feeble imitation thereof, never listened to one of those bird oratorios, which each summer morning turn every country side of the world into a portico of heaven. To most denizens of cities these precious, unique, original sources of cultivation are seven-sealed books. Cities must be put up with opening to their children the best secondary sources.. God's works failing, they let man's come in — the splendid imitations or anal - ogies of God's, in musjc, architecture, painting, sculpture and liter - ature. If we are doomed to miss grace itself, absolute grace, let us have for ourselves and our children the best possible means of grace. The crowning advantage of country schooling is this nearness of nature, this openness, to nature. Before children enter school they are made familiar with a thousand aspects of valuable truth which city children learn about only with the most painful difficulty, if ever. Those who have not attended to the matter will be surprised when they reflect how hard city children find it to get at nature face to face. Dif- </seg>

This accounts for the well-known phenomenon of country youth when sent to advanced schools or to colleges shooting ahead of their city mates from almost the first day, and maintaining their lead to the end. Part cause of this is better health, which is another great asset in favor of the country children, but the effect is also due to the fact that in important particulars the mental education of such children in the country, their intellectual training began earlier. Teachers could presuppose more and were less under the necessity of extensive explanations. Our great problem over the country school is how to avail our - selves of the immense advantages thus curiously reviewed, pupils' health, their school morale, their democratic spirit, their manual training at home, and their free access to nature, working aesthetically, morally and mentally. How can we successfully utilize these gilt - edged opportunities? Carry through consolidation. Respect and reverence for rural life and affairs and the most ample references, thereto should pervade all school texts and collateral books: readers, spellers, arithmetics, grammars and geographies. All liter - ature for youth and not nature study volumes alone should breathe out-door air instead of stuffy fumes from offices and parlors. We wish no special text-book for country children, but change — not bo much in matter as in tone and spirit — in books for all pupils in town as veil as out. An "agricultural reader," telling of corn rows, plows and cattle, would be as great an abomination as a "factory arith - metic" with weavers', spinners' and machinists' computations given as examples. Away with all such class devices. What is urged is that school texts and side readings more largely involving nature and making fewer references to the thick and artificial life of cities, while specially advantageous to country scholars, would be an improvement for city as well, an out and out pedagogical advance for all. I We need the same blessings for which schools everywhere are ng. Better schoolhouses are desirable and costlier apparatus. &gt;mmon with other teachers, only more justly and loud than most iem, we appeal for higher wages. Then, when adequately ra - &gt;rated, we agree to change our positions less, frequently, ourselves ting on that permanency which we know is so much to be desired, game ought to be winnable by making safe hits without running While there are some advantages in the fact that so large a pro - portion of our teachers are young, this meaning on their part faith in things and in the future, without which good teaching is. not possible, yet we should like encouragement in the way of salaries and of public esteem, making it worth our while to grow old in our profession.

A terrible sameness usually marks, the sessions from year to year, the identical sort of matter, topics in substance repeated over and over, teachers bored and hating to attend. ■ This defect is largely due to poverty. Much may be hoped from movement to band together, perhaps changing session place yearly, joining treasuries to secure the best institute talent. I Fewer and shorter sessions a day would be another advantage, teachers in attendance grow weary even of excellent inspirations carry less nutriment away than they would under a system ing rumination along with grazing. But with the right sort of institute leaders we shall go away beyond all this in reform, making at least half the work at a session field and laboratory practice in botany, zoology, geology, astronomy, and the various other forms of agriculture and nature study. Discard books, maps and blackboards, the while. Out to field, pasture. wood, hillside, quarry and stream. Look up to the sun. sky and cloud.

The Teacher and the Pupil. K (Paper read by Superintendent William Ritchi?, Jr., before the Session of the Association of Rural Teachers and the County rintendeDt's Section, Friday afternoon, November 6, 1908.) It will be the endeavor of this paper to impress the great im - portance of the rural teacher in solving the mighty problems of the nation. The influence the rural teacher exerts, and will exert, upon the mind of the nation is cause for grave concern lest we as. citizens and rural teachers stumble or fail. Many town teachers have the habit of looking down upon and patronizing the country teachers and many county superintendents hare the sam? failing when they say, "Miss So-and-so is an excellent teacher: I will find her a place in town next year." I would «ay, "Miss So-and-so (in town) is an excellent teacher: I will find her a </seg>
            <seg id="p512">410 place in the country next year." And, friends, I have tried this and It worked to great advantage. I In our last great election, as the votes, came pouring in from city r city, we still stood waiting, — waiting for news from the country, then as the farming districts flashed return after return over the &gt; we knew that Taft had been elected. In time of war, when men irawn, endurance and patriotism are in demand, our farmer boys, d with the fire of strength, bravery and love of fatherland, supply ranks with men who win, — and is there a man who can say the le workers training these generations of our country's youth, — the :hwhos? votes decide the destiny of a race, whose lives are sac - ed for liberty, — what man can say these servants of the public good not of equal rank with those who teach in town! The one-roomed country school stands out enshrined in the nation's heart. Here the teacher's personality, life and training count for all. Here pupils are in closer touch with and have more dependence upon their teacher and her personality than in town. When school la over the majority of the teachers in town pass from the children's lives; but in the country the one-roomed district school is often the center of all that is social, inspiring and religious, — of all, in fact, •way from the life of toil upon the farm. And the teacher, director of all within her sphere, is ideal for the ambitious, hope for the dis - couraged, and savior of the fallen. Thus the future of the farmer's, children is entwined with the character, ideals and training of their teacher. Thus the destiny of a race hangs on these children's lives. Therefore, it is, of grave consequence that we see our path of service plainly marked and press forward to the goal, "sustained and soothed by an unfaltering trust," and by the knowledge of our usefulness. Spartan teachers gave to the world a man of strength and virile beauty; yet Spartan youths lacked the great principle of the Christian faith, and lack of mercy, pity and brotherhood brought Sparta's pride into the crumbled dust. Athenian teachers gave men the noblest thoughts, expressed in "honeyed words," the world has ever heard, gave to the eye the beauty of cold marble deftly chiseled, but Athens now, in glory once unsullied. Is but a memory and a mass of ruins. KRome. with her teachers, trained the youth in deeds of valor, s of grandeur, acts of conquering skill. But with the government ed and skilled to manage and direct, Rome's proud ideal — Ions ered and decayed — is, gone. ■Teutonic races, trained to the freedom of the woods, reared in the :y of godlike homes, are still enslaved and chained in Europe by ims and traditions of a barbarous past. America, the new nation, what is her ideal, 'what future lies be - fore her? Will she. too, some day crumble in the dust? Is she a comet dazzling to the eye, too soon to be a memory, leaving humanity •till darker than before? Or is she a star of hope, a herald of a </seg>

Our American ideals embody all the strength of Sparta, all of Athens' art, the executive skill of Roman general, the freedom and purity of the Teuton. And to these grand ideals we have the added gift of Christ's loved teachings of humanity. From these America has evolved some new ideals., — ideals of beauty, science, wealth, agriculture, commerce, crafts and arts. It is the work of teachers in the country to implant the culture of these new ideals into the life and heart. In farming districts the pupils' habits, good or bad, are trained and formed at school. It is the teacher's part, by charity and non - sectarian zeal, to teach the breadth of vision necessary for all great men. By devoted lives of service they can teach the dignity of work. Only the teacher who does not disdain to sweep the floor, to wash the windows, to polish up the stove, can hope to teach such ML If the teacher's life is large and lovely, so will her pupils' be. By doing, the teacher can impart strength, by waiting and pa: only can she teach wisdom. A country teacher's life is blest with health, is full of laughter, love and dreams. The gentle meadow brook, the drowsy herds, the rolling sweep of earth, the hazy blue horizon, are the country teacher's rich reward, and dreams and visions of a glorious future are her sure foundation of suc&lt;&lt; We often hear teachers condemned by the practical and matter - of-fact business men. Thanks to God's, providence we have some who are not all practical. Else would th? rut in which this old world turns wear deeper and still deeper. I If the country teacher is such an influence in the nation she must her high ideals. I would not have her otherwise than visionary i combines this with the life of activity essential to sii With ideals should come pure thoughts and noble Mves. And here I to say that a teacher's thoughts, are of greater moment than we :e. To think right is to live right; ana we must remember that reatest lessons of life are taught by example and high thoughts. A teacher's life must be a busy life. A library should grace each school. The teacher as inspirer should lead the pupils on to read good literature. Teachers who read good books, instead of pining for town and its shallow life, have pupils who read too. Teachers punctual at meals,, never tardy, have good attendance. In country schools time will not permit the fancy work of town, energy must be directed toward getting tha bread and butter of edu - cation, which in the long run produces healthier and more sturdy minds than too much cake and pie. Yet I would urge exhibits of the pupils' daily work to make the work happier, to lend incentive. Special programs are always r.igns of active work. Programs should be the daily work. Special time is not needed for a good program. Scarf drills, etc., are very excellent but they do not carry with them enough benefit to warrant the time taken in their prepara- J&gt; </seg>
            <seg id="p516">412 tion. A program for Thanksgiving, one for Christmas, another for Lincoln's and Washington's birthdays, and still another for Arbor day, will teach thankfulness, love for one another, patriotism and love of nature, and will require only regular school work for preparation. At opening exercises suitable songs, can be sung; in drawing and writing periods subjects suitable for the occasion can be pre - pared; and Friday afternoons special recitations can be rehearsed. Thus, the pupil by example is taught not only to combine business with pleasure, but also to get pleasure from business. To many people spelling contests give most pleasing incentive. A county spell - ing contest can easily be held, and will, I hope, bring back the old time "speller" of our fathers' and grandfathers' days, who would not think for a moment of misspelling a single word. In order to give all an equal chance there should be three divisions, one for the third and fourth grades,, one for the fifth and sixth, and one for the seventh and eighth. The work in each county can be arranged as best suits conditions there. (The Boys' and Girls' Industrial Clubs are also great and wise tives; but here, as in all cases, most all success depends upon the er. Tb« little folks need encouragement at school and sponta - s interest in their daily life to conteract a lack of real interest in many cases, often downright discouragement in the busy home, ndge good teachers by the interest their pupils take in such affairs. There is nothing that will please a superintendent more than to Me teachers taking a lively part in their pupils' work and play and, moat especially, at recess. The teacher who at recesses and noons stays cooped in a dirty, stuffy room is letting her greatest opportunity slip by unnoticed. Athletics should find a place in every school, graded or ungraded, and athletics in such schools will not reach the boys or girls most needy, without the teacher's guidance. If athletics are to reach its highest aim it will extend the hand of fellowship to the backward boys and girls and make them feel that they are contributing their share to the general result. Under our present system many schools are not reaching those pupils who refrain from participating in the sports, not from a lack of interest, but from knowledge of their weakness and lack of proper and timely encouragement. And here I want to read to you the plan of W. J. Ballard of New York City. "Class or Group Athletics is a device by which every boy may enter the athletic events prescribed, viz., chinning, jumping and run - ning, and, if he does his best, feel that he is helping his class to win. ■ "In this form of athletics., a trophy is won or a record is made by the individual record of a boy, but by the average of the ldual records of the boys in a class or group. "The records are obtained as follows: "Chinning or Pull Up — An inclined ladder is an ideal piece of </seg>
            <seg id="p517">413 i&gt;ol grounds. The boy must pull himself up until his chin is over bar, and then lower himself the full length of his arms. This ioes as many times as he can. He must not touch the floor with feet when he lowers himself. The number of times he pulls him - up is his record. The class or group record is found by adding individual records and dividing by the number of boys entered. "Jumping — The boys, are taken to a suitable place and lined up in the order in which they are to jump. Each is recorded. The class or group record is found as above. "Running — Use an ordinary watch to start boys out. Start them when the second hand is on the 60 mark. Let each boy run separately. "REGULATIONS. K'ln ungraded schools all boys above 10 years old are included as les. "Events will occur as follows. Standing broad jump, in the fall "Chinning, in the winter. "Running, in the spring. K "Records are to be sent in to the chairman of the central com - e of the Country School Athletic League, care of County Super - dent, as follows: "Standing broad jump, not later than December 1st. "Chinning, not later than March 1st. "Running, not later than June 1st. "SUGGESTIONS. ■ "Have class trials occasionally before taking final records. They arouse interest in the contests. K 'Encourage the boys to practice by themselves in the yard, on treet, at home, or elsewhere. "A woman s.hould not be afraid to take hold of this form of athletics. It is not how far the boys can jump; it is getting them to want to jump. This a woman can do as well as a man, perhaps better." There are two additions I could make to this; first, it should admit girls; and second, it should close with a plea for more men teachers in the country. At certain times in their lives all children, and especially those in the country, need the leadership of strong, well-equipped men, and it seems to me that the present tendency to pay rural teachers higher salaries could well be broadened until finally we have a rural system where each little country school will have beside it a teacher's house. Then men with families, receiving $1,000 to $1,500 a year, can afford to devote their lives to the service of humanity. Then the townward trend of population will be stopped and America will stand forever with her ideals realized. I do not mean to say by this that women are not doing their duty, that women are not needed in the schools, that women do not deserve the same high wage. Par from it. I mean to say that women are doing more than their share, are shouldering more than their responsibility. And, </seg>

If men are worth $1,500 a year, women — mothers and wives, sweethearts and teachers, are worth twice that sum, and more. I Some of you are smiling at my prophecies and dreams, but when rs are just, right will assert itself. But no just cause will con - without effort and endeavor, hardships and toils, — and so with sr salaries. The greatest cause for the higher wage has been better flcations. The present fight for higher standards has but just corn - ed.

The leacher and the Community. K( Paper read by Superintendent Margaret E. Brown before the meeting of rural teachers and county superintendents at the Teachers' Association, Lincoln, Nebraska, November 6, 1908.) I wonder if anybody has ever estimated the number of teachers the world has known? I wonder if any one knows how many there are today* I wish some mathematician could find the sum for us. </seg>
            <seg id="p519">LECTURES, REPORTS, ADDI; IND PAPERS 415 Then we would ask a wise man to tell us how many communities in the whole wide world have been influenced by all the teachers who have lived and who do live. But is there any known means of measuring the extent of a life influence, or of actually estimating the strength of a character? The sum total of either is as limitless as space and as immeasurable as the waters of the globe. tA few great names stand out prominently in the history of educa - and a few places have been renown?d as centers of learning, these names do not represent all the success that has ned in our profession, nor is all the learning confined to ■ 1 places. Every teacher who has. filled her niche, who has wrought faith - fully her task has been a success, and every community has contributed K thing to the grand total in the world's progress. Fellow teacher means, you and I have not labored in vain, and the communities lich we hav? lived were better because we were there a littla while, Kin Nebraska there are fi.671 districts or communities and 9,689 ers. Therefore the subject we discuss this, afternoon is broad 3 extent and varied in its personality. IDo you want us to talk ot the ideal teacher and the ideal com - ty? If by that you mean a "nothing-more-to-be-des tion, or in other words the perfect teacher and the p?rfect i n cannot do it, for there are none such in the world. But "ideal" you mean a teacher who knows there is much more to ; who realizes her own r yet is conscious of her inefn - y; who welcomes work as. that which provides the opportui rowth, and takes hold of difficulties as one grasps a stick to aid e climb to higher ground for a clearer view and wider vision, that ? kind of teacher we have in mind. If by "ideal" community you mean a place in which people live who are still laboring with the old problem of how people may live together peaceably; a place where people have much in common find it hard to sacrifice the individual interest for the good of the neighbors; a place where people live who know that the physical existence is not all of life, yet who let life's struggle bar the heart and soul from the higher and better things, we know that all communities are mere or less like that. Yes, the ideal teacher is one who growr and the ideal community is one that needs a lot of work, and it In of these that we - in this paper. We know this, is true just as we know that this old world is an ideal place for the development of character. There are three factors in a teacher's make up that are eft in her work, her education, her skill, and her personality. These are as three avenues which come together in a broad road to success. A defect in any one makes it necessary to redouble the efforts along the other two if a teacher WILLS to be a TEACHER. In any community, the teacher is the highest type of learning, is the standard of ethics, dress, manners and morals. If her scholarship </seg>
            <seg id="p520">416 is recognized, her skill respected and her personality pleasing, s.he is Imitated by pupils and patrons. If not popular, every eccentricity is magnified and ridiculed. Occasionally there is one who intrudes In the sacred halls of our profession, and poses for a little while as a teacher, but who is too passive in life and individuality to arouse either admiration or ridicule, and educationally the community sleeps. Usually, however, there is a decided "for" or "against" in the atmos - phere, and a corresponding forward movement in the life of a com - munity, or there is. a general confusion, even destruction at times, of all educational interests. Before going into a community a teacher should study conditions, learn as much as possible about the people, not gossipy information, but real items of interest, then taking an inventory of her own scholar - ship, knowing the extent of her skill, and believing in her adaptability. •he should calmly decide whether she meets th? requirements or not. If so well and good, she begins her work without fears, and has the assurance in her heart that she is right. Too often "getting a school" is merely a consideration of $45 here or $50 there and the price be - comes the teacher's conscience. The teacher, this ideally progressive teacher we are discussing, comes to a community with a desire to give her best, absolutely her best service to the people, and does not confine her efforts to the schoolroom. She comes with this desire to work, and she comes with a vision to see beyond the present. With this vision she realizes, her work does not end with the eight months or with tne nine months according to the contract. She sees th? boys and girls of the school as students in higher schools of learning, and she works to inspire them with ambition and correct methods of study. She sees the young people of the neighborhood in homes of their own, and she imparts to them the ideas of the true and beautiful, — by her life among them she does it. She sees the older people reluctantly giving up the re - sponsjbility of affairs of school and state, and she listens patiently as they relate in glowing terms of the glory and splendor of the days of long, long ago. Are these a teacher's duties you ask? Yes all this and more if she should live in the entire community. I am quite an old fashioned individual and believe in such old fashioned things as literary and debating societies, ciphering matches, spelling and singing schools in the rural communities. The teacher must be a leader in such things and must make the school the intel - lectual and social center. That is its rightful place. There are many schools in the land that once were thus distinguished, and are now not only shorn of all their glory, but are actually ignored in the community life. It is really pitiful. The cause is very apparent. The school was crowded once, there was much interest manifested and good teachers always secured. Then commenced the decline, some moved away, others grew up and quit — there were fewer and fewer pupils. </seg>
            <seg id="p521">417 ing stands, neglected and almost forsaken, till it seems many of them. by their very forlorn and treeless appearance, actually to beg for consol - idation, to dignify the balls of learning. The teacher must take the initiative in the "Spiritualization of country life." The material improvements in rural communities have kept apace with the towns, and villages. The telephone, daily mail and automobile have needed no advocate or representative. But educational matters have not fared so well, likewise art and music. There is money enough in the country to secure the best things, and intelligence enough to appreciate the good, true and beautiful in life. Blessed is the teacher who may impress a community with an ideal that is. bigger than a dollar, and more pleasing to contemplate than more land and cattle. Thus far in the discussion the burden of proof rests with the teacher. However the neighborhood is not without some respon - sibility in the education of its children. This is a two-fold work. The teacher brings her best to the people and they in turn must place their best at her service. They must provide her a home and friends. She must be welcomed as a rightful being among them and not treated as an impostor. Because her labor is for the children it wins the ready nse from men and women, for the welfare of their boys and girls really and truly lies nearest their hearts, though it may not s=em so at times. Again and again we hear some one say, "The people are so Indifferent, they just don't care what happens at school." Beware teacher! That remark reveals more than you think. It is a mirror of yourself and your own work. The people will have interest if you make the work Interesting. It is. said that "the world owes every man a living" but the man must earn it for himself. Just so the community owes loyalty and friendship to the teacher, but the teacher must win her place in their midst and be worthy of respect and confidence. I know a community, at one time reckless, lawless and irreverent that was entirely renovated and made new by the cheerful persistence of a conscientious teacher. Another teacher went into a district where one had informed the people that "she did not know enough to teach." It was her first school and it may be that she did not know enough to teach, but such was her influence in that community that the im - pression of her personality was permanent. For many years any teacher of the same name could have had the school without question. Teacher, make your name synonymous with good work, whether in the sand hill region or river bottom district, know that you deal with life, hand, head and heart, the complete life. ■ The community is the judge.

The Social Quality of Nebraska's Population, By George Elliott Howard, Ph. D., University of Nebraska. (Published in Nebraska State Journal December 10, 1908.) But fifty-four years ago Nebraska became an organized territory, while only in 1867 was. it admitted to the union of states. During the brief span of years since thus on our soil the constructive work of civilization began, what has been achieved? What accumulations of wealth as the material basis, of social well being have been gathered? What compelling ideals, economic or political, aesthetic or moral, in - ■ual or spiritual, have been conceived? When measured by the : enduring worth, what is the r:-lati\e quality, the socio - logical value, of Nebraska's people among the forty-six or forty-eight groups of American men and women? Let us "take stock" of our assets; or, if that is too much here to undertake, let us at last draw up a trial inventory of the more precious goods which we now possess. I First of all, what is the worth of our racial stock, of our &gt;nographic or social population? All things considered, a people ults from a rich and varied cross-fertilization of human Is, from the fusion of blending of many nationalities, each in senting unique biological, social, intellectual, and ous experiences, displays dominant superior traits. Us •ntial" for achievement, for progress in an aggressive civilization, ry high. Relatively it ■ enduring stamina, inbred powers, &gt;le of enormous expansion. A Fusion of Forces Now at the bottom the people of Nebraska, like the other popula - tions of the middle western states, is largely the product of two great •us of migration and complex amalgamation. On the one hand, ilt of innumerable streams of internal migration from state to state; of individuals, families and colonies ever starting and re-starting enward toward the western frontier in the search for new s or new fortune In the main, this movement of population to Nebraska has. obeyed the general law, that in the United States internal migration follows the parallels of latitude. Primarily the men and worn n who conquered the forests, and the prairies in the rich central zone beyond the Alleghenjes came from the great middle states on the Atlantic seaboard — N?w York and Pennsylvania; while, in like manner, primarily from the first daughter societies of the two parent commonwealths — from Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and the southern parts of Michigan and Wisconsin, our own population has constantly recruited with minor Quotas from New England and the south </seg>
            <seg id="p523">419 Moreover, before the American revolution, the populations of the middle colonies in a peculiar sense were already composite. Many times the seed had been sifted and re-sifted to produce the human harvest of Nebraska. The process ia yet going on. We are young. Th« soul of our people is still inspired by the energy, the daring, and the idealism of the pioneer, of the frontiersman, of the pathfinder of civilization. A Mixture of Races On the other hand our stock is in part the product of external migration, of a fusion of the Anglo-Saxon and the native born peoples from beyond the sea. We have shared in the formi task of assimilating the vast army of foreigners, who annually Imd upon our shores; but our share of the task has been very light com - pared with that of our eastern sister states. The hardest pol moral and industrial problems of the great American and of the mining and manufacturing populations of the country are largely due to th? influx of Kuropean immigr lower standards of living. At home the u art of t peasants, tillers of the soil. A wissr governmental supervision would have found means to employ them, to utilize their rich experience and skill, in their old familiar vocation of farming. Instrad vast nui have been caught in the net of the great cities, where tfc-ey ' forced to seek strange employments; and where they have fali ■easy prey to the predatory inter sts, to the exploitation of the anti - social harpies who fatten on human flesh. In this way the fin? stocks of Europe, instead of vastly enriching our progressive population from the outset, have unduly contributed to our poverty, degeneracy and crime. They have been forced to degenerate in the sweatshop. the tenement and the slum. Very different has been the fate of ■who have made their way way to the Nebraska plains. Here have been able to find congenial employments. The majority have continued to be tillers of the soil. Swift has been the proct lilation. Here as if by magic the Swede, the German, the Bo - hemian, and the other splendid stocks, of the old world rejoice in a lean citizenship and flourish through its matchless opportunity well-being. It is clear that our population ia of first rate quality. In ri measure it will share in the manifest destiny of the west. The Ultimate American Type What is that destiny? To the west, in the fullness, of t; verily believe, more than to any other part of the national body, belong, intellectually, socially and morally, the realization of the ultimate type of American character. Consider its, teeming wealth and the unimagined treasures atill locked in its mountains and in its plains. Reflect upon the character and the vastness of its present and future population. Who can doubt that to the w«st belongs </seg>

From that fuaion, physically and mentally, moit proceed the highest type of American man. »Such in the vision of the dreamer U the destiny which sometime ta us; but this vision will not be realized tomorrow, nor next year. In fifty years. We have all the time there is for striving; but in season we shall reach the goal. Now what are present signs that we are moving towards It? In the flrat place, we are rich. Our wealth provides us with ample means for noble achievements. Already, if constructed on the same principle, our assessment roll is as large as that of Wisconsin. Our vast area of rich farming lands balances the treasure of Wisconsin's larger cities. Moreover, our wealth is pretty evenly distributed. Ne - braska is a region of small estates, of average well-being. Millionaires do not there abound. Poverty is not acute. As yet the peril of predatory plutocracy is not imminent. Political Ideals Flourish I Politically Nebraska is progressive. On our soil political ideals ish; and ideals are the lever of civilization. Our institutions are al; and the spirit of reform is in the air. We have produced our share of constructive atatesmanship. More and more our politics mcerned with moral and social issues. More and more we are inding that government shall exist for '.he service of man. Emphatically our society is dynamic. Our motto is social self - help. Our leaders are on the firing line in the battle for social regen - eration. We have no reason to be ashamed of our institutions and organizations for human betterment. They are of the latest pattern. The college settlement, organized charities and the juvenile court flourish exceedingly. Nowhere in the world are the culture clvfbs, notably those of our women, more earnest and more practical, more intent on giving aid in the common endeavor to raise the moral, social and intellectual level of our civilization. In the refinements and amenities which mark a worthier society in the narrower but not unimportant sense of the term, we are not below the democratic type which prevails in the west. The simple life which here is lived is an earnest of more worthy things to come. Even in literature and the other fine ar*s the omens are propitious. A half a century has been a very short time for a people to take pooaeaaion of a new region and conquer the environment. We have been too busy with physical deeds to devote much energy to the beautiful. Still we have started in the aesthetic life. Nebraska writers are pushing their way to the front. Nebraska artists have invaded the salons of the old world. The annual exhibitions provided by the Nebraska art association are most creditable. They are adding the world's treasures of artistic genius to the great educational forces of the community.

Our land endowments for the public school and the state univ. have been wisely managed and made a rich heritage for our children. Our system of popular education is progressive. The best methods have been employed. To take a single example, it is but recognizing the simple truth to say that in time and in qualityNebraska has led all the states of the union in establishing in all grades of instruction, modern methods for the teaching of history. Again, our percentage of illiterates is near the lowest, and this, is being still more decreased through the better enforcement of compulsory attendance laws and the wholesome operation of the splendid child labor act adopted two years ago. The worthy crown of our free public school system is the state university. Fostered by the people of the state, it has flourished amazingly. In size and in quality it stands high among the first six state universities of the land. This year its student enrollment will pass 3,500. Its departments ar? rendering splendid service to society. Through the legislature the people of Nebraska have loyally shown their appreciation by giving it generous support, and now popular s ntiment is urgently demanding still more bountiful supplies, in order that, in proportion to our wealth, our equipment for the training of youth for the higher social leadership may keep pace with that provided by our powerful sister commonwealths. Work of the Churches In the development of our civilization the denominational colleges have had an honorable share. First of all they have not made the mistake of dividing their energies and their funds in a vain effort worthily to support numerous collegiate foundations. Wisely several of the churches have established state universities of their owl clining to sustain subordinate institutions of college rank. Others have been content each to maintain one or two good colleges without establishing a university. The result of this prudent policy of the Nebraska churches has been enlightening. Thus they now have strong men in their faculties, and they have secured the equipment demanded by this age of costly appliances and high specialization. In particular the growing comity of interest between the state university and the denominational schools is in every way auspicious. More and more their graduates are seeking the larger facilities, of the state university. Their professors are more and more fraternizing with their colleagues of the state institution in the ways and means of accomplishing their common ends. In short, they are availing them - selves of the help of the state university as being in fact their univer - sity, which they have a right to use for the full achievement of their general educational alms. </seg>
            <seg id="p528">422 Social Righteousness Indeed, as never before, present conditions seem favorable for a more intimate co-operation of the state university with the church colleges. The hour has come for a more earnest and deliberate joining of forces than hitherto has ever been attempted. Of a truth, it is clear to the student of society that the social functions of the secular university and the functions of the church are approaching each other. Morally and spiritually the adversaries of the one are the enemies of the other. Both the church and the lay colleges are becoming socialized. Religion and education are both becoming dynamic. In Nebraska this is especially the case as compared with tone other parts of the country 1 . Relatively in the upbuilding of the commonwealth the clergy have had a conspicuous part. They are broad-minded and progressive. They are training themselves for the new social duties which the times are laying upon them. They are supplementing their theological studies, by postgraduate work in the state university. At this moment, to give a concrete example, six or more of the active ministers in the neighborhood of Lincoln are studying sociology and political science in the University of Nebraska. More and more in the great reform movements of the time, in the battle against the saloon, the fight for the protection of child life, in the war on special privilege, the progressive sociologist and the en - lightened priest stand shoulder to shoulder. The present opportunity of dynamic religion, joining hands with dynamic education, is rich in promise for the early triumph of social righteousness in our common- tial Report of the University Extension 'Division of Wisconsin.

There are now ■early 1,200 registrations. The registrations to the middle of September, 1908, are classified as follows: Regular University Grade Work Special Advanced Work High School and Preparatory Subjects 80 Elementary School Branches Special Vocational Studies 660 Among those enrolled are labor rs. apprentices., farmers, traveling men, skilled mechanics, salesmen, clerks, stenographers, ba: business men, home-makers, club women, students, teachers, lau clergymen, doctors, and civil officials.

            <seg id="p530">424 Methods of Instruction The Extension Division of the University conducts its corre - spondence work along lines similar to those in use by commercial correspondence schools, so far as concerns the ordinary routine of les - sons by mail, replies, and corrections. It introduces, however, a supplementary feature which removes the great difficulty which has always been experienced in educational work conducted at a diatance from the instructor, namely, the tendency of students to drop work before completing It on account of discouragement or loss of interest. To remedy this difficulty, the Extension Division provides instructors who under given conditions meet classes of students at regular Intervals. Frequently twenty or more students in the same locality are engaged in the study of the same subject. Under these circumstances, cl«Mtw are formed and met by an instructor regularly at least once in two weeks. This, does not necessarily imply that students must progresss at an equal rate. On the contrary, they are grouped ac - cording to their abilities, the instructor devoting whatever time is needed by the slowest student. Sometimes students in a locality are taking allied subjects. In such cases headquarters are established, where at times an instructor receives those students who need personal assistance. — the regularity and frequency of these appointments depending, of course, upon the number of students requiring super- I'he result of thus combining personal relations with corre - ence is wholesome from every point of view ,the student not only ped past the seemingly Insurmountable points in his studies, but leral is stimulated and encouraged, his interest being maintained ;hout. As a rule persons taking this work are earnest and rioua but frequently they are not trained students, and con - ltly do not acquire easily the results for which their interest and Ion lead them to strive. I An analysis of the tables given in the foregoing pages shows that ir the greatest number of correspondence students are engaged in Lional studies. The course in Shop Mathematics, for example, taken 66 men, is written for shop men and deals with shop problems, pplied as to be also preparatory to other specialized vocational es. The usefulness of classes and personal supervision for the who take studies of this character is apparent.

            <seg id="p531">425 Bt must be conceded that in the short period since the inception a. work and with meager financial support, comparatively small ay could be made in the way of response to the need which is lized, yet the results obtained from so much of it as has been taken, notably in Milwaukee, point to an immense field of possj - 3 for the future, and, in fact, the accomplishment in comparison means has been enormous. Industrial Instruction in Milwaukee iUp to the present time the most important development of indus - 1 study through correspondence supplemented by class work, has •n place in Milwaukee. In this city, that admirable organization, Merchants and Manufacturers Association, recognizing the value heir industries of trained workmen, has invited the co-operation of University in bringing to the employees of Milwaukee firms oppor - ties for stndy and self-improvement. tAs a result, a number of men employed in certain manufacturing jrns in Milwaukee have registered for courses of study and have met as classes every two weeks by an instructor from the Univer- The groups have been organized under the auspices of the wing firms: Hoffman &amp; Billings Mfg. Co. The Kempsmith Manufacturing Co The Bucyrus Co. A. L. Lindemann &amp; Hovers.on Co. The Cutler-Hammer Mfg. Co. The Filer &amp; Stowell Co. A. O. Smith Company. The Vilter Manufacturing Co. Interest Shown by Employers iDecld«d interest has been evinced by these companies in the work irtaken in this manner by their employees. The men have been wed time from their employment for class purposes and have provided with class rooms, properly equipped at the company's nse in which to meet the instructor. By arrangement between men and their employers the students.' fees are paid by the firm ;tly to the Extension Division. In the case of students desiring to drop their studies, employers have assisted the instructor by investigating conditions and advising as to procedure. Consequently, except in cases of firms which closed work or reduced their forces, few men who have begun these courses of study have failed to continue them. Interest Shown by Employees The results attained by the Milwaukee students, who range in age from 16 to 40 years, are remakable, sometimes beyond the most sanguine expectation. Of those who began work in March, within the four months before July 1st, a number had without losing time from </seg>
            <seg id="p532">426 K daily occupations, nearly completed and amount of work alent in quantity to the entire course usually covered in a third of lester. KThe several groups of students becam = so much interested that organized themselves into clubs, appointed a leader, and met to - together at stated intervals, one group showing a surprising zeal •voting two evenings a week to this purpose. Possibilities of Expansion This work was begun only last March; eight of nine companies to whose attention the opportunity offered by ihe University was brought availed themselves of it. Those eight companies, normally employ about 4,000 men, and during this time of business depression, probably From the notwithstanding the sluggish financial situ - ation, 263 men enrolled for correspondence study. There are in Milwaukee about 210 manufacturing firms, each employing at least fifty workmen, many employing larger numbers. An aggregate of about 54,000 men are employed in these larger con - - alone. Ein the course of a f;w months., during a period of financial ;ion, 263 employees out of 2,000 desired to avail themselves opportunity for self-improvement, what a stupendous result be looked for if the same opportunity could be brought under conditions to 54,000 men. It should be remembered that the figures mentioned relate only to the manufacturing industry in one city. What might be done for all the industries in every community in the state, with time and means to develop the work, is almost beyond computation; the benfits which accrue to the individual both as a citizen and as an artisan are incalculable, and in proportion as the intrinsic value of the man unit would be raised so would the productive power of industries be Increased. (This view of the possibilities of Industrial development by means nlversity Extension is neither hypothetical nor visionary, but is. 1 upon accomplished results in a limited territory among a few «;ntative industries. With adequate support, similar methods of : could not fail to accomplish similar results in every part of the Money Value of Vocational Training The training given by correspondence-study to shopmen, when co - operated in by the manufacturer, approaches closely to a trade education, and in some respects has advantages over the trade school. The &amp;hop is the student's laboratory, and with a sympathetic super - intendent, is an ideal one. If the correspondence instruction is of the right sort— vocational in the broad sense, applying not only to the specific work the man is doing but also including allied subjects which will lay the foundation for a wider outlook on life and greater possibil- </seg>
            <seg id="p533">LECTURES. REPORTS, ADDRESSES AND PAPERS 427 Mr. Dodge, president of the Link-Belt Company of Philadelphia. Pennsylvania, g.hows that the actual money value of training of this sort is large. At the age of twenty-three he puts the earning power of each man in a given vacation, the trained and untrained, at $700.00 a year. tAt the age of thirty-two, the apprentice educated in his voca - tion has increased his annual wage to $1,250.00, while the untrained man has increased his only to $850.00. On the basis of five per cent the potential value of the two men at twenty-three would be $14,000.00 each; at thirty-two the potential value of the first would be $25,000.00 and of the second only $17,000.00. Or, in other words, the wealth of the state is increased $8,000.00 for every individual who is. given vocational training. Roughly estimated, the employees of manufac - turing firms in Wisconsin number 250,000 men. If vocational train - ing for one man inscreases the wealth of the state $8,000.00, vocational training for 250,000 men should effect an incrsase of $2,000,000,000.00. The cost of industrial education becomes insignificant in com - parison with results such as these. Practical Value to All (lasses An idea of the variety and range of work done by correspondence students has been given by the enumeration on page 3, in which is shown the distribution of the pupils, among the more important branches of study. In order to convey a conception, however, of what this work means., the following mention is made of classes of people who have been and may be benefited by it. Students, who for any reason find it impossible to spend sufficient time at the University to complete a course of study, are given the opportunity to work at hqme for Univer - sity credit. Poor boys of ability, through correspondence gain opportunity to develop special talents. Men of family, married early — before the possibilities of educational equipment consistent with their talents were fully appreciated and recognized — avail themselves of the correspondence-study system and achieve excellent results. Misfits,. who have started wrong and desire to change their occupations, and men who were deprived of early educational opportunities, are helped to adjust themselves to more ideal situations in which they may realize more nearly what they are capable of doing lor themselves and for society. t Business men receive valuable instruction and suggestions in the lization and administration of their business. In the case of a in company an Impending failure was prevented and the company lished upon a prosperous basis by the introduction of a system of accounting, brought about through the publicity efforts of this •tment. I Housekeepers and homemakers are instructed in their work, re- Dg in the introduction of improved selection and cooking of foods more sanitary living, as attested by the results of the Milwaukee estic Economy p.tudy group. The isolated community is brought closer touch with University knowledge. is </seg>
            <seg id="p534">428 Many instances might be cited of the helpfulness of correspondence - study In keeping the teacher abreast with the times in pedagogical methods and in adding in various ways to his equipment for usefulness In his community. Professional men, lawyers, doctors, and clergymen utilize the opportunities of this department to a considerable extent. One physician, a graduate of this University and of Rush Medical College, and also for three years the city Bacteriologist for Milwaukee, used the department of Bacteriology for a special course in Immunity and Infection. He has expressed himself as gratified with the results of this work, and is enthusiastic over the possibilities of the University la serving the medical profession along these lines. Credit Students KThe table presented on page 2 of this report shows an aggregate 0 students taking correspondence-study with the purpose of acquir - inits of credit toward a university degree. Admirable results have been obtained in work of this character. In order to maintain the standards required of resident students the instruction, though it may be carried on by an Extension Division in - structor, is under the general supervision of the department in which corresponding residence work is taught. T he same prerequisites are exacted, and the examination imposed at the close of the work Is controlled by the residence department. Those departments of the University in which credit work by cor - rawmdence has been completed have besn entirely satisfied with the results. So' far as known, this is true without exception. Although residence work is. the desideratum for students working for cr. (lit. yet it is a fact that mature persons who have taken both residence and correspondence work have found the latter more satisfactory in certain branches because in residence the pace of the class 1b often too rapid to admit of covering thoroughly all of the subject that is required between recitations, while the correspondence recitation nted not be made .until the preparation is complete. This arrangement, which is neceasary of course to persons carrying on employment at the same time with studies, may have decided advantages for any thoughtful ■tudent. Student Fees Under present conditions, the Correspondence-Study department must depend to a certain extent upon student fees for its maintenance. Tuition in a large measure, as well as incidental expenses, must be pro - vided for by this means. As no fee for tuition is charged for students resident at the University, in equity the non-resident students, also, should be exempt from this cost. Furthermore, on the basis that Extension shall receive state support in the interest of raising the educational standard of the 'industrial classes, the fee exacted should b? theoretically and actually as low as is consistent with recognition of the seir-res4&gt;ect or tne Denenciary. </seg>
            <seg id="p535">429 tThe fee which it has been found necessary to charge is $20.00 for e unit hour study, which would be equivalent to over $100.00 a tuition at the University. This is a little less thaD the fee ged by the University of Chicago, which is not a state institution. tAs soon as. sufficient support can be had from other sources, the mt fee, at least for those taking vocational studies, should be jed one-half. Registrations and expens.es in proportion will in - e rapidly with reduced fees, hence, the appropriation which could &gt; such reduction possible must be larger many times than the nt provision for this department of work. (The number of instructors giving correspondence courses is lty-four. Until recently they were all teachers in the Dlirn oyed primarily for the purpose of residence instruction. In r to take care of the large number of students in certain subjects to provide for meeting classes it was necessary to secure several lers to give their entire time to the work. Owing to limited 3 available for this purpose, it is possibie to engage such teachers when the fees received from registrations warrant the expend: Extension Division Instructors The Extension Division now employs a teacher In pure Mathe - matics, one in Mechanical Engineering, one in Electrical Engineering, the services of an instructor in German four hours a day, and one-fourth of the time of a teacher in History. The employment of a teacher in Civil Engineering, who shall give his entire time, ha uthorized. My communication to you of March 3, 1908, contains the following observation: "In order to get the desired results, it is necessary to secure, as rapidly as possible, special teachers in practically all of the various lices of work. While the instructors of the University are co-operating with the ■xtaastoa officers cordially several difficulties confront us. It is impossible, for example, satisfactorily to explain delays to people scattered throughout the state, though they may reasonable to those who understand the conditions. The instruc - tors in different departments of the University work have their regular ■ ; Extension work being extra is., consequently, obliged to wait upon other interests. A few delays or other irregularities, from this cause react seriously as a hindrance to growth." Those departments of the work which are under the care of teachers, who devote their entire time to it are no longer hampered by this disadvantage. Qualifications of Teachers Further argument favorable to the employment of special teachers for Extension work was made as follows.: "In order to have the lessons so prepared as to meet adequately and effectively the needs of the correspondence student it is necessary not only that those who write them should be thoroughly acquainted with ail the condi - tions affeetieg the students, but that they should possess special Instructors Kniployei] </seg>
            <seg id="p536">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 430 qualifications. In other words, the work is. peculiar, and the men who do It should be selected with reference to their fitness for It. If the correspondence work does not succeed In accordance with our highest expectations, it will be because the teachers have not the proper view-point. This observation applies more especially to voca - tional subjects and to all work other than that of University or graduate grade. The necessity for having men especially adapted to the requirements of such instruction is. recognized by all educators who have had experience in correspondence-study work." Compensation of Residence Instructors It will be for some time necessary to call upoD residence in - structors, in many departments of the University to prepare courses of study and to correct lessons. Considering the special character of the work and the extra burden thus imposed upon teachers without adequate compensation, the results have been exceptional and could not have been secured except for the self-sacrificing interests of those engaged in the work. One instructor, whose habits of accurate account - ing for his time are well known, has found that for his services in this instruction up to the present time he has received between but six and seven cents per hour. Other instructors substantiate this An instructor receives three-fourths of the fee charged the student, which should return a fair compensation, but as the labor of preparing the subject matter of the text is as great for one as for many, and as the total remuneration depends upon the number of registrations in the subject, the compensation is at best problematical. District Teachers It will be necessary as. the work grows to place University teachers in several districts for the purpose of organizing work, meeting rlsssn and looking after those- who need especial help. There are now twelve classes in one subject (about 250 students) in Milwaukee. When that number is doubled, which in all probability will be the case within the next three months, a local teacher should be provided, in the interest of both economy and efficiency. Laboratory Work In connection with many of the engineering subjects given in pondence, laboratory work at the University is now offered. ' days in a laboratory, testing a steam engine, for example, at id of a correspondence course on steam engines is invaluable onally, and any intelligent employer will allow a few days :« to an employee who is in charge of his engines for such a je. At present work of this kind can be given only when the tories are not occupied by residence students. As the work , special provision should be made in the laboratories for these its. ■For certain lines of work laboratories located at different centers ighout the state should be established as soon as funds will per- </seg>
            <seg id="p537">431 mit. A fuel laboratory in connection with the Course in Fuels would be invaluable at present in Milwaukee. This could be used in the evenings, and as a branch of the University engineering laboratory could be established at small cost. Text for Correspondence-Study I For nearly all correspondence-study subjects it is necessary to ide special texts. The first cost of this work is considerable, and ocational branches, frequent revision is required In ord«r to keep lessons up-to-date. This work should be done so far as possible len on salary in the Extension Division and by contract for special i. The best texts on vocational subjects for correspondence-study usually those written by men engaged in professional work, and led by teachers acquainted with pedagogical methods as well as the subject matter of the text. Fifty thousand dollars could be spent to advantage for this pur - pone during the coming year. I An appreciation of the cost of this kind of work may be gained the following data. A leading commercial correspondence school oys thirty men at a cost of $72,000.00 annually for salaries, for writing of texts, and expends large sums for special work by •act. The cost of printing, etc., is additional and an entirely ict force is maintained for the teaching by correspondence. Business Administration, etc. IThe enumeration on page 3 of the subjects more generally selected correspondence-study includes Business Administration, with ity students, and Home Economics, with fifteen. Both of these «t&amp; are now without instructors. The resignation of Professor Burchell from the University has made it necessary to drop his subjects, for the present. This is especially unfortunate, as th? correspondence work he was conducting attracted prominent business men throughout the state and the results secured were gratifying. K Although the subjects have been taught in the School of Com - e, it has not been possible to find any one to take charge of the spondence work. KThe work is important, and it is. desirable that an instructor be ed, who will give his entire time to it, as soon as funds are able. Home Economics The subject of Home Economics lends, itself well to correspond - ence-study, especially when supplemented with class work. A class in Milwaukee under the direction of Miss. Huntington evinced a decided interest. Miss Hunttogton's resignation from the University makes it necessary to suspend this subject until a successor is secured. Highway Construction The number of students who have taken courses in Highway Con - struction is 139. Mr. Hitchkiss, on account of the importance of this </seg>

Few of the students in this subject would have taken it if the ordinary fee had been charged. The fact that without the fee, many •vailed themselves of the course with gratifying results is an index to what might be done in other lines of equal general importance, if funds were available to offer' work at a nominal cost. (Numerous requests come to the department of Correspondence - y for lessons on agricultural subjects. A special instructor who Id present short practical courses would find a large demand for »-ork.

Its value to young people :s to the desirability of its early development. The growing interest in the improvement of town and country by the reservation and laying out of parks, play grounds, and ri - ft* well as in improved designs for buildings, with reference to beauty, convenience, and sanitation creates a demand for instruction in Rural Architecture and Art. Courses of study, treating of these subjects, conducted by instructors having suitable equipment of taste and train - log are of inestimable value in assisting the general public to an appreciation of the possible attractions and advantages of rural life. State Institutions KWith the co-operation of the Board of Control the Extension ion might establish useful courses of instruction in state institu - such as prisons, reformatories., etc. II. INSTRUCTION BY LECTURES Although this line of extension work has possibilities, for useful - ness to the people of the state second to no other, it is believed that satisfactory results cannot be secured by following the methods com - monly pursued. During the last year nothing has been done except to meet demands for lectures only so far as they could be responded to with credit to the University and satisfaction to the people, no develop - ment of the work being attempted. This procedure has been adopted because it is recognized that it is better to allow the lecture work to remain in abeyance until sufficient funds are available to re-organize it on a proper basis, than to attempt to develop it on lines which wherever tried h-ave met with doubtful success. Lecture Courses The essentials of successful extension work by lectures are as Agriculture, Nature Study, &lt;t&lt;\ </seg>

In New York City courses of free lectures under the direction of the Board of Education have been exceptionally successful. I quote from a report of this work for 1906-7. "In the lecture season that has just closed 500 men and women have through 5,500 lee uttered their messages of uplift, of information, of inspiration and of direction, in 160 different places throughout th? city, to an audience that reached a total of over one million on? hundred thousand." »In 1907-8 the audience numbered over one million five hun sand and the work cost the city $150,000.00. The population of York City is three and one-half millions, making the cost of the lectures of one season a little over four cents, for each resident. t Reckoning on this basis the State of Wisconsin would need to about $100,000.00 for this department of University Ext.nsion Courses of lectures are useful as a means of education for large numbers of people, having especial value for adult audiences, in the moulding of public opinion, the formation of character, and in combin - ing recreation with instruction. An incalculable influence may be wielded by a lecturer whose gifts enable him to impress his audience by means of the qualities of inspiration, instruction, and entertainment with which his message is endowed. III. DEBATING AND PUBLIC DISCUSSION ■ The work of this department, though of recent establishment, gained a remarkable hold upon the people of the state. It is im - ible to predict to what dimensions it may grow with sufficient pment and additional working force. General Aim This department aims to arouse and stimulate among all classes of people an Intelligent and active interest in important social and political questions. Believing that there is no form of popular educa - tion that tends more essentially to the making of good citizens than </seg>
            <seg id="p540">434 17 and discussion of live issues, the department collects and main - i a loan library of books and periodicals relating to questions of day, available upon application, Issues bulletins on special topics, keeps in touch by correspondence or personal interview with : leagues, town councils, library and school boards, farmers' and ness men's clubs, high school and academy societies, and all similar nizations throughout the state. Loan Material and Bulletins The collection of loan material for the use of individuals or organisations, includes only subjects of practical and timely interest, those great questions which are being weighed by the nation or state, and those, of even closer appeal to the citizen, which relate to the municipal policies of his own community. Clippings from newspapers, periodicals, state and national publications, books, in short, everything of value bearing upon questions of current interest, dealing fairly and comprehensively with both sides of the discussion, are accumulated by this department and plaoed at the disposal of those who will use them. Over twenty-five collections, of different subjects have been made and cent out to organizations preparing for debate, or desiring general information. The bulletins, which formulate subjects for debate and give full lists of references on both affirmative and negative aide* with information as to where and how all this material may be obtained either from libraries, archives or the Extension Division of the University, are widely distributed. Among the questions presented are "The Election of Senators, by Popular Vote," "Postal Savings Bank," "The Immigration Problem," and several phases of the "good roads" problem. Collections of materials now in preparation present among other subjects "The Guarantee of Bank Deposits," "The Commis - sion Form of City Government," and "Compulsory Arbitration " The department advises dropping the antiquated questions so popular in the past and grappling in public discussion with the live questions which are before the people for solution. BThe bulletins are distributed free of cost and loan material is lied usually without cost and with as little restraint as possible time and conditions of use. tin addition to the publications, suggesting subjects for debat -. ml compact and simple guides have been issued as aids to begin - in the practice of debating. These pamphlets discuss "Debating ties — Organization and Procedure," "Parliamentary Motions," "Principles of Effective Debating." Though designed for the use sginners, these guides, are replete with practical suggestions for ■ier.ced speakers and are valued by practiced debaters. K Requests for bulletins from other states than Wisconsin are so lent, that it has been necessary to p«t a price upon them for de applicants. </seg>
            <seg id="p541">435 Those to Whom This Work Appeals iBoys and girls in debating or literary societies of all graded schools, high schools, academies, etc., are making practical and ef - fective use of the direction offered by this department. Among these, ■eighty-five high schools have used the opportunity to secure assistance and personal advioe in their study of questions, for debate or of subjects chosen for orations, and essays. In addition to the work with these younger citizens, the depart - ment has established and maintained useful relations with various civic leagues, with organizations, of farmers and of working men, and with women's clubs. Between October, 1907, and July, 1908, 3,000 people in various organizations received assistance from this depart - ment. It has been called upod to assist mayors and members of councils in obtaining knowledge of improvements which have been tried and found successful in other communities. I An important phase of the work applies to legislative problems i the point of view of the voter. The department of Debating and He Discussion will do for the men who elect the legislators what Legislative Reference Department does for members, of the Legis - re. The assistance offered by this means is helpful to county ds, common councils, village and town boards,, not only in their &gt;erations upon state questions, but also in their consideration of questions closely related to daily welfare and comfort. Value of Public Discussion tit is difficult to estimate the value of wide-spread systematic ing of this character in its influence upon the citizens of the state. conceded that no other study in the university or college does to discipline the mind and promote an interest in questions vitally ing humanity and the government than the work done in debating Urn. It is fortunate that so useful and so broadening a pursuit can be carried on in the home of the student without interruption to his regular occupations. Without other outlay than time and thought the debater is led, first, to feel an Interest in and desire to know about the great national and state issues, of his day. This point gained, he is taught where and how to obtain material for his studies, a valuable asset in Itself, if by this, means he acquires the ability to inform himself when and upon what subjects he will. In studying great questions and formulating them for debate he learns to discriminate between fundamental underlying principles and non-essentials. He conies to recognize sound reasoning not only in questions he debates, but in all his reading. In presenting arguments in public he is gain- Ing lesson? of self-control, of correct speech, and of concise thinking. BThat an immense influence may be exerted in countless directions leans of such training spread abroad throughout the state is nt. </seg>

An immense number of reports are Issued yearly which are of vital interest to the public in their treatment of advanced scientific and economic principles and facts: The latest inquiries of the scientist and of the economist into problems relating to food, hygiene, natural resources, agricultural and dairy processes, household interests, engineering and manufacturing conditions, etc., etc.; discoveries affecting the prevention and cure of disease; labor questions; child study as related to home life, school and play ground; experimentation upon methods of garbage dis - posal; dust and smoke prevention, etc., these and many similar lines of research, tending toward the improvement of the social, educational, and political environment of the individual. The results of this great accumulation of human endeavor should be brought within easy grasp of those members of the social organ - ization who would be most clearly benefited by it. Unfortunately, however, much of the published data is latent, owing to the fact that the expert investigator frequently has neither training, vocabulary, nor incentive, so to express his facts as to make them available to the general public. There is, therefore, an immense field of usefulness open to the agency which becomes the medium for introducing this great store of knowledge to the people to whom it would be of use. Methods of Work The department of General Information and Welfare gathers this helpful information from every source and publishes it in simple and practical form. It also endeavors to interest people in studying this fund of knowledge and helps them to make use of it. It secures expert adviser for communities having special problems to solve and answers inquiries upon subjects affecting private or public progress. An effective illustration of its methods is. shown in the work done during the past year in its use of the tuberculosis exhibit. This exhibit conveys by means, of diagrams, models of ventilating devices, etc., pictures and descriptive text, the following information: First, as to the tremendous loss in this country from this grave disease; second, how individuals and families may protect themselves against infection; and third, the best measures to be taken for the care of infected persons. This, exhibit was sent last year to eight cities in the state under conditions which attracted general attention. An expert demonstrator accompanied it explaining and supplementing its graphic lessons and distributing instructive pamphlets among his auditors. Publications As rapidly as means permit, bulletins, monographs, and leaflets are being printed and distributed. An admirable pamphlet on the fire- </seg>

The department has in press a compre - ve bulletin upon "The Prevention and Cure of Tuberculo tr upon "Frosts in Wisconsin," and the beat methods of guarding st injury from them in the spring and fall, and several others ually practical value. Kit will be seen that by the methods adopted, this department inging directly to the people at little or no coet to them and by means as enlist their interest, the great discoveries and advances owledge, to which experts, and specialists are devoting their efforts rorld over. linkers' Institutes A practical example of what may be done for artisans through the agency of the Extension Division in arousing interest in improved methods and conveying instruction in available form is seen in the Bakers' Institute planned in response to a request from the bakers of &gt;nsin for practical, scientific information applicable to their Ar. institute in which exp-rts in food chemistry and practical bakers will take part is to be held in Milwaukee the latter part of October. The United States Department of Agriculture evinces its interest in this move by sending Dr. Cobb, an authority on wheat, and Dr. Winton, an authority on flour, of the United States Food and Drug Inspection Laboratories, to assist in the work. These experts and the eight other instructors whos,? names appear on the program are believed to rep - resent the most advanced results of experimentation and observation of the day. Their work should be invaluable to the men who will attend the conference. The attention of the baking industry of the entire United States is attracted by this enterprise as it is the first effort of the kind to instruct bakers in the application of the scientific principles underlying their trade. An encouraging feature of the undertaking is that the initiative came entirely from the baker? themselves. Over one hundred and twenty-five of them pledged themselves to attend the conference if the University would conduct it. The Extension Divis - ion welcomes this opportunity believing that though legislatures and Consumers' Leagues have been united for years in the demand for pure foods, yet no legislation or consumers' campaign could possibly accomplish such comprehensive reforms as must result from an intelli - gent seeking on the part of the producer himself for increased knowl - edge and improved methods. The program of work carried out by the Bakers' Institute is sub - mitted as a supplement to this report. Stationary Engineers As an evidence of Interest shown by organized labor in University Extension the results obtained in work with the Stationary Engineers </seg>
            <seg id="p544">438 K notable. Their state organization carries out educational plans i own devising and the Extension Division has been able to be of Lance to it by means of lectures, correspondence-study and advice. Recognition of the value of Extension for such organizations is expressed in the resolutions passed by the National Association of Stationary Engineers at their recent meeting in Denver, in which the work of the Extension Division of the University of Wisconsin is com - mended and the delegates instructed to endeavor to secure legislation in behalf of establishing similar work in other states. A copy of this resolution is submitted as a supplement. FIELD ORGANIZATION. I As University Extension is intended to disseminate all the benefits »d by the University to persons not resident at the institution, it is ,sary that such an organization be developed throughout the state 111 enable the Extension Division to reach the people in the most ive and helpful manner. It should be understood that it is the e of the University to reach not only those who feel the nesd of ar.ce but also those who, not realizing a need, may upon learning possibilties for self-improvement open to them through the al departments of Extension be led to avail themselves of the -tunities. thus offered. Districts In order to accomplish this end it is proposed that the state be divided into districts and that in each of these districts there be estab - lished headquarters in which a representative of Extension shall be located. Ideally, this center should be in connection' with the public library of the locality and the natural assistant to the representative of the University Extension Division would be the librarian. A magnificent work could be done by librarians educated especially for such duties. The training now prescribed in library courses would need to be supplemented but little to enable its students, to study under the supervision of a trained chief the social end economic conditions of their communities and to take an active part in developing interests of all kinds tending toward improvement in various relations of life. Extension, working through the agency of such members of every district in the state, would be able to adapt its services specifically to the needs of the people of every community more exactly than would be possible by other means. All departments, whether of Corre - spondence-Study, of Instruction by Lectures, of Debating and Public Discussion, or of General Information and Welfare would do their work with knowledge of the conditions as to people and place otherwise difficult to obtain" In a word, from the library as a center, the whole influence of the University in all its. phases, representing every possible Hne of work which the University offers might be spread over •rery community in the state. </seg>

ADDRESSK- AND PAPER!) 439 I It is not absolutely essential, of course, that the library be made center, but if it is not, some other center must be provided, and tie machinery of the library is already in existence, and as. the ing and position of the librarian are such as to enable him to be se, it would seem to be — from the point of view of economy and tiveness — the natural headquarters, for this work. In connection these headquarters, local laboratories, such as described elsewhere his report should be established and the lecture rooms in the ries could be utilized for class purposes for correspondence ps, as well as for lectures. Co-operation Through these centers arrangements would be made for lecture courses, reading courses, correspondence courses, special exhibits and demonstrations, (as for instance, the tuberculosis exhibit which the Extension Division is now sending through the state) ; also conventions on topics appealing to special industries, occupying a day, a week, or more. The library boards, public school boards, and town councils would naturally co-operate and be actively helpful in forwarding all educational movements., it being clearly understood, however, that it is not the object of the Extension Division to usurp the prerogative of these bodies, but to assist them and if possible add to what they are doing in ways compatible with their interests and ideas. Advisers I A useful function of the University district representative would tat of adviser to boys and girls in the selection of their life work, an adviser would need to be especially qualified by gifts of judg - and sympathy to deal with and exert an influence upon young le in the formative stages of their development. No attempt could lade to select occupations for those whom he advises, but they d be assisted in carefully canvassing the field and choosing suit - and with reference to the work for which they are best fitted. One need only examine into what has been done in Massachusetts by the Vocation Bureau, which has been in existence less than a year, to appreciate the possibilities of this work. This Bureau was founded in January. 1908. Since that time a large number of men and women ranging from fifteen to seventy-two years of age, have applied to it for assistance, and have received available help. The Bureau renders its services free of charge, many influential men and women being interested in its support. Its essential usefulness consists in helping the applicant, first, to know himself; second, to consider wisely the requirements, opportunities, prospects, etc., to be found in the different lines of work; and third, to reason truly on the relation of these two groups of facts. A striking illustration of the significance of this kind of selection baa been shown recently in Cincinnati.

As only a limited number could be accommodated some process of elimination and selection was necessary. A thorough investigation of the qualifications and aptitudes of the different applicants for the courses desired disclosed the fact that but a small percentage had any natural bent or real inclination, after the work was understood, for the profession or line of work which they had selected. In other words, knowledge of the qualifications essential for the specific lines of work had been so vague and meager that choice had in reality been made in the dark, and upon understanding conditions the applicant found he no longer desired what before had seemed to be especially Those who have had the experience in college work know how many students enter courses of instruction only to find that the work is not what they expected and that their ability and tastes lie in other directions. Such young people are fortunate if their losses are not more serious than those resulting only from delay and expense. BTo prevent misfitting in the choice of vocation should become a ll part of Extension work. It is a practical means for assisting young citizen to improve his efficiency and attain for himself Best possible conditions. NEEDS. KFor the proper development of the work of the University Exten- Division in the manner outlined in this report and based upon xpansion of the present organization the needs may be enumerated Hows: KFor the field organization which is fssential to the development of 'our d partments the state should be divided into eleven districts a University Extension representative be employed for each dia- Each representative should have at least two assistants. ■ In each district a central office should be opened, preferably in ection with a convenient public library, other public libraries in district becoming branch centers.

In order to secure the best results it is essential that permanent headquarters be opened in the cities where there are a large number of Extension students. Ordinarily, these offices, would be the district centers. Such an office Is now much needed in Milwaukee where the registration numbers 539.

Where high school laboratories are available the expense for this purpose would be small. These labora - tories, would in fact be branches of the laboratories of the University, whether in Engineering, Hygiene, Chemistry, Physics, or Agriculture. In the Correspondence-Study department the needs are great. Aa noted, there should be an independent faculty for this work, and the faculty should be made up of men with special qualifications,. I As the character of the text is vital and since there must be a text ivery course as soon as one student takes It, teachers who would 5 this work their first consideration, and who possess, the other fications required, should be secured as s.oon as possible.

I For carrying on the work of the department of General Instruction Welfare, as outlined, a Secretary, a library-trained assistant, a clerk, a stenographer are needed. Funds should be provided also for the laratior. of bulletins, monographs, etc. »The results secured during the past year have been extremely iraging, and were possible because of the excellent pioneer work had been done before. Mr. Lighty laid out the work of the Correspondence-Study depart - ment in the first year of its inception on a broad and comprehensive basis, with such care of the details as to make the growth a matter largely of expansion. His past experience, his belief in the work, and his devotion to it have been invaluable. KMr. Hutchins brings to the departments of Debating and Welfare an se sympathy for mankind and an exceptional appreciation of the icracy of education without which his work could not have been markably successful. Great as are the possibilities, for good in this work, it is peculiarly true that the workers must be in thorough sympathy with it or disappointment will result. But with enthusiasm and fitness in its workers and the appreciation and support of the people of the state, no movement can prevent this division from adding to what President Eliot has called the greatest State University in the country, that ■element which will make it in truth, "The People's University."

            <seg id="p548">442 Professor Cald&lt;well's Report. (Eaport of the Senate Committee of the University of Nebraska Com- mittee on University Extension.) By Professor H. W. Caldwell, Chairman To the Chancellor and Regents: KYour committee begs leave to submit the following report as the ts of its investigations, and to make the appended recommen - ns. • Some fifty odd letters were sent out by your committee to as many college and university presidents, submitting a series of questions relating to the subjects of extension and correspondence work. Answers, mere or less elaborate w = re received from all to whom the question - aire was sent. An analysis of the answer* has been prepared and the results are submitted with this communication. In brief, of 52 re - plies received 22 reported that their institutions were not at present attempting any extension or correspondence work, while an equal number stated that they were now doing or planning to do, in the immediate future, a great amount of work in one or both fields. The western universities are leaders In this new line, 18 making extensive plans as against four in the east. It is especially interesting to note that of these eighteen, fourteen are state universities or agricultural colleges. The two state universities that are planning on the largest scale are California and Wisconsin. The latter intends to try to reach every section of the state, and to make the university of immediate and direct value to every citizen who may need and profit from its assistance. California is enlarging its plans and trying to ;iny demand that may be made on it for extension lectures. So far most of the schools have developed their extension work through the regularly employed members of the teaching staff of the university. In four cases, however, a special force Is employed for these outside interests. Other universities stated that they will form a »p?cial faculty as soon as possible. Several presidents expressed their belief that the only method to make extension work successful will be to develop a separate organization, adding in some cases that the lecture system, carried on by members of the teaching staff has not worked satisfactorily, or is very limited in potentiality. The subject-matter developed by the various schools as a part of their extension and correspondence work varies widely. In some casea historical and literary topics are treated; others add the so-called prac - tical subjects, as, city lighting, engineering water, etc.; still others have classes in drawing, drafting and other technical subjects; while a few aim to answer inquiries along all lines of state interests. The University of Wisconsin is just now developing the most elaborate scheme of outside teaching and assistance to the people of the state that has ever been tried. A dean has been appointed for the </seg>

In general as far as possible the problems that come to this school are turned over to the department concerned for an answer; but in some two or three lines when the calls would 'bring too great a burden, a special instructor has been secured to give his entire time to extension work. The plan contemplates, additional instructors and assistants as soon and fast as need arises. iThe answers seem to indicate that the future is coupled with this i of providing a university for all the people instead of merely for youth who can come to the local center. Yet it also seems to be the ;ral opinion that the interests of the local habitat must ever remain rimary imprtance and intersst, but the extension field must receive adequate development. Iln general, the answers state that a part of the expense necessary irry forward this movement must come from the funds of the Uni - ty, and another portion be furnished by the local community, ng the direct benefit. The decided tendency is to increase the on borne by the University and to ask the local center to meet the local expenses. The men engaged in this field in Wisconsin 1 that the University gets back several dollars in increased appro - ions — in addition to increased good will — for every dollar it spends tese ways for the people of the state. Your committee also sent out to the leading school men of Nebraska a question circular, and received many replies. In general, the answers favorable to the undertaking of extension and correspondence work. Those replying were nearly a unit in asserting that the financial demands, except for local expenses, must for a time at least, be borne by the University itself. Almost everyone affirmed that the University, by the closer touch it would s.ecure and the better knowledge of itself It would impart to the people, would benefit many fold. If the public school men of the state are not mistaken in their judgment, both fields of work — extension and correspondence — should be organized at once. KYour committee then feeling that the time has come to begin to or - e this work, present the following suggestions for your consider- Pl. A reasonable fund should be set aside for this spscial work start it, and to get an interest aroused in th? state, or meet it where it already exists. i2. The next legislature should b t * asked for a special appropri - of not less than $ 10,000 to develop the work during the next iium. 13. On? man's time with the assistance of a stenographer should be devoted to this work. He may be called Dean of the School, ision Secretary, or such other title as you may judge best.

It is suggested that the following ' plan of outside lization may be used as a basis to begin with, to be modified and oped from time to time as experience may determine. (a) Name: The "University Extension Center of &lt; Ashland) etc. t(b) Purpose: To investigate all problems, — artistic, literary, hla - il, social, industrial, moral, political, educatioDal — problems and it ion. city lighting, sewerage; banking, crises, money, divorce, -in fine all problems that may concern the citizens of Nebraska. (c) Membership: No "University Extension Center" shall be formed with less than ten members who will agree to carry on the work. All citizens however may join. The membership may be divided into "circles" for the study of special problems according to individual interests.

Whitmore, a regent of the state TBlty, before the Nebraska association of commercial clubs at 1 Island, March 21, 1908.)

            <seg id="p553">445 In like manner, if not to the same degree, I shall endeavor with the utmost bravlty and conciseness possible, to call your attention to "The Commercial Value of University Extension Work." I realize at the outset that industrial education has come to be so frequently and so universally discussed that it seems well-nigh impossible lor me to present many new phases, and I make no claim to entire originality in what I may say. Indeed, so rife is contemporary literature with the thought that we are confronted with an enbarra&amp;smenl of ideas already expressed, and reminded of the predicament of Mr. Rudyard Kipling, most original of modern poets, who, prefacing a volume of his works, ingeniously disarms, criticism in the following delightfully unique and purposely ungrammatical lines,: "When 'Omer smote his bloomin' lyre, He'd 'eard men sing by land and sea; And what he thought he might require. He went and took — the same as me. "The market girls and fishermen The shepherds an' the sailors too, They heard old songs spring up again, But kep' it quiet — same as you. "They knew he stole, 'e knew they knowed They didn't tell, nor make a fuss; But winked at 'Omer, down the road. An' 'e winked back — the sams as us." KThe present trend of thought among the educators of this country well expressed recently by the wonderfully versatile president e I'nited States in addressing the representatives of the National ation Association during their i\-cent reception at the White e. Said he: I "I trust that more and more our people will see to it that the Dls train toward and not away from the farm and workshop. We spoken a great deal about tho dignity of labor in this country, we have not acted up to our spoken words, for in our education we tended to proceed upon the assumption that the educated man to be educated away from and not toward labor. "We must show that we understand the law which decrees that a peopl? which loses physical address invariably deteriorates, so that the people shall understand that the great carpenter, the good blacksmith, the good mechanic, the good farmer, really do fill the most important positions in our land and that it is an evil thing for them and the nation to have their sons and daughters forsake the work which, if well and efficiently performed, means more than any other work for our people as a whole." This is, I think, especially true and in the largest degree in the environment of what the late Tom Reed denominated "the Great </seg>
            <seg id="p554">446 8TATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT Omniverous West" — here where, if anywhere, is "practical democracy with all mankind in its shirt-slesves." I Said the distinguished Chancellor of the University of Nebraska a address delivered in Boston last year: "Unlike what is called al education which aims straight at personal development, dts - rding the nature of studies if only they best drill or store the I, industrial education is frankly utilitarian. It was originated is carried out with the direct purpose of assisting men and women lin good livelihood — to enrich us in our possessiona rather than in characters." § Business cannot be reduced to so exact principles as law or cine, but many a business has accumulated its fund of experience may be shaped Into scientific form and advantageously studied. 1 Universities cannot create executive ability or business genius, but can equip a man taking up business with a trained mind and with tlfic knowledge of industries and methods, centain to be invaluable im throughout his career. The hope of the farm boy, no less of the boy who expects to live in the city, lies in education. Not long ago, standing upon the eminence which is the site of a famous New York university, one of the professors, in answer to a question, said, "We succeed with everything here except in the depart - of agriculture; we cannot make our students take an interest In farming!" And yet, more than any other which could be named, this is the one occupation in which it may be truly said that the people of the whole world have a direct and positive interest; for upon the M of agriculture finally depend all financial and industrial in - terests. In the empire state of the commercial east a college professor may throw up his hands in despair at the forlorn status and prospects of agriculture; but in this, the empire state of the new west, never! "not by a jug full!" The student here is led to see the great work done by him who helps to develop the resources of the state, to perceive the nobility which attaches to the calling of a farmer, to a batter under - standing of the forces of nature, a deeper interest in her manifesta - tions, and a stronger love for country life and Its duties. Gentlemen, isn't that the kind of teaching a great agricultural state like ours should foster? The faculties in the various courses in our university are keenly alive to the situation and the teaching here is of a sort to make the students enthusiastic for agriculture. No other school in the United States gives, so large an amount of instruction in agriculture and subjects related thereto, more than 1,087 hours of work, or more than one-half of a complete college course given to instruction in purely agricultural subjects. The farm has, of course, furnished the basis upon which all the branches of technical agricultural instruction have been built, but the increased facilities for instruction which have come to the school from year to year since its Inception have resulted in making much more practical and useful the instruction given. That it requires a large and expensive equipment to properly teach </seg>
            <seg id="p555">447 fulture, the people of Nebraska as well as those of most of the great agricultural states of this country are realizing more and fully year by year. A microscope costs more than a blackboard, laboratory more than text-books; but what this state has already iD providing equipment for this institution gives promise of a liberality in the future. K There is no legislative body which has not a genuine desire to hatever will really advance the interests of a large clasa of the mnity, a class which they fully recognize as its most stable and rvative and trustworthy social force. ■ Frisnds of the university were delighted to read a few months an editorial in the Omaha Eee from which I quote: "It is not necessary to make a state university, supported out of revenues, derived chiefly from taxation, a far-famed seat of research attracting students from all parts of the country, but it is desirable, if not necessary, that instruction should be specially adapted to the char - acter and qualifications of the students entitled to participate in its advantages. Certain branches of learning are basic and must be taught in all universities and colleges., but a publicly supported university in an agricultural state like Nebraska, wher? the students are for the most part sons and daughters of farmers and stock raisers, should lay special stress on preparing the youth to return back to the soil. Without going backward in any other department, th-e University of Nebraska, ought to develop its agricultural school and push it to the forefront. It r.hould aim to make it the best — not the biggest — center of scientific agriculture in this siction, and eventually in the country." The agricultural colleges have passed entirely by the experimental stage, have produced from thems lves a capable staff of teachers, and injected the ;.pirit of investigation into all the schools of the country. We find, says a recent writer in th? New York Independent, the whole United States netted with a new and innovating system of education: an intolerant system so far as this, that it will have nothing to do with medievalism, while it bases itself strictly on industrialism — that i- the development of the industries of the state; to educate and :nnoble labor, and to prepare its pupils not only to think. but to t&amp;ink in con - in with modern affairs and everday life. Our agricultural colleges are getting to be the intellectual centers of America. There is about them not only an atmosphere of investigation but of application. While It was not easy at the outset to man our agricultural colleges, we find that a new sort of scientific enthusiasts has been evolved — a sort of men desirous of nothing so much as to apply science in finding out things; and these practical scientists are making our agricultural col - leges the most forceful institutions of learning ever established. The young men and women that flock to them are dead in earnest, and are never found in hazing and other occupations which disgrace some </seg>
            <seg id="p556">448 or correlated industries. They are not drafted off into our cities, seeking employment in the crowd. I Agricultural education, reaching out by its bulletins, lectures and ard talks, and often adding reading courses for farmers' wives farmers' children, is doing a great deal to break up the dead level arm life, the insipidity of an industry from which the factory lerly took the brightest and most intelligent class. I Once arcadian and idyllic farming had become the treadmill of nenlightened population, thinking of the distant city as a para - —but out of their reach. But this new sort of schools has touched r farm home to quicken it; it has turned all the sciences lose in our trds and gardens. It proposes not only to greatly increase the uct of our land per acre, but to make our labor intensely inter- While I believe that throughout the great middle west the most important form of education is agricultural, the mechanic arts, which allied to agriculture in the original Merrill fund granted to the state by the general government and generously supplemented from time to time since then, until our exi&gt;eriment station now derives $50,000, cash, annually from this source are easily of second importance even in this agricultural region. A simple thought reveals the value and importance of our engineering work to the state. It is estimated that about a million dollars annually is paid out in Nebraska for engineers' services; and as our industries becom? more and more diversified this amount must inevitably increase. Who is going to receive this aggregate salary? It will go to the sons of Nebraska if we educate and train them to earn it, otherwise to men whom we import from other states and countries. Our original university plant, or the academic courses, deal chiefly or very largely with the prepara - tion of teachers. Probably a million dollars per annum is paid by iskans. for teachers' services. Most of this will be earned by sons and daughters of Nebraska and the money be kept right in the family if we educate them as we ought. To enable us the better to do this, the board of regents is now about to establish in the university a teachers' college for the educating and training of teachers for high school work, so that it may be possible to supply this ever increasing demand from our own graduates, thus encouraging home industries — standing up for Nebraska. We of the present generation of business men have seen good agricultural lands in this whole region advance steadily in value from a few dollars to $100 end more per acre, and unless it can be made to earn a fair per cent on the present value there must inevitably be a slump in prices. Now there is in Nebraska no other regular, systematic agfney for keeping -up and elevating the earning power of land except the university. It is the fundamental business and problem of our agricultural work, the teaching and the experimenting to increase the profit producing power of land. By the art of renewing — or if </seg>
            <seg id="p557">449 you please re-creating — soil fertility from the air, the land owner may hereafter reap his acres but Dever rob them. All our activities in stock feeding and breeding, in dairying, in soils, in veterinary practice and in farm mechanics conspire to this end. The utterance of the distinguished governor of Iowa in regard to the agricultural college at Ames in 1904 is equally true of this station. Said he, "I believe that this, institution this year, has added more to the value of the corn crop of Iowa than has been expended by the state for th? upbuilding of the institution in all the years of its existence." It is not too much to say that as a direct result of the scientific teaching and experimen - tation in our university in the last ten years the profits to the farmers - of Nebraska have bee'n enhanced ten times the cost of maintaining all departments of the university during that time. Summed up, we find that the department of agriculture is so correlated with state colleges, and these with state experiment stations, as to constitute a new American university system. It has put medievalism to shame. It has asserted the simple life as the true end of education. It creating the country home as ideal. The University of Nebraska endowment lands at the $7.00 min - imum are worth $952,560.00, which at 5 per cent would yield $4" per annum, making a total income of over $1' 0 a year from sources outside the state. We consider a fair present valuation of the university plant. Including endowment lands, is more than $:'. 000.00. Fellow citizens, when we realize that this is a clear asset, without any incumbrance and paying bigger dividends, of every sort, than any other possible investment, realizing that "The riches of the commonwealth Are free strong minds aDd hearts of health And more to h?r than gold or grain. The cunning hand and cultured brain every public-spirited citizens' heart should swell with pride and gratitude and, in s.pite of the paltry $1,000,000 — more or less — of the stat? debt, — a mere bagatelle compared with her magDificent resources. — our people in every section of the state should agree, that wh.i else may come, the cause of higher and deeper and broader education shall never languish here for the want of material aid. In this connec - tion I am impelled to say we cannot hope to retain in our faculties our best and most useful and progressive m;n unl?ss we are prepared to meet the pecuniary inducements offered by other like institutions. Already we have been obliged to part with several to the great loss, for for a time at least, of the efficiency of their departments, and the regents feel that our state can now well afford to increase the revenues of the university sufficiently to enable them to put a stop to this brain leakage. We cannot afford to let it go on. Over and above all material considerations — "the mint and anise and cummin" — are the moral and cultural values here produced, the characters built. PAh! that ia the blessed assurance which all education, the whole nge of intellectual life, give to the world. The vicissitudes of </seg>

I The socialism of wealth, the equalization of material conditions, present an idle dream, a contradictory conception; toward which ty can take, no doubt a few faltering steps, but which no mechan - invention or constitutional device can hope to realize in our day. socialism of the intellect, the offering of all of the true riches of nlightened mind and a heart that is trained to love the true, the tiful and the good; this is a possibility for the children of every ing man; and our public school system from the primary on prairies to the university, is the channel through which this non fund of intellectual and spiritual wealth is freely distributed to rich and poor. How much might be said, did time permit, in praise of an agency which thus sweeps our vision and our interests out of the small and inbreeding confines, of local and partisan affairs, and enables us to put aside all narrow and selfish considerations, and help us to realize that our splendid state is bound together by reciprocal interests.

By Dsan Henry B. Ward, The University of Nebraska. KOur greatest American philosopher, Emerson, said, "The first :h is health," and in the year just past, President Roosevelt wrote, national health is physically our greatest national asset. • • • • The preservation of national vigor should be a matter of patriotism." Race suicide is not so great an evil as race homicide, yet today this nation clor.es its eyes to four great and unnecessary wastes from ■which it suffers: preventable death, preventable sickness, preventable Inefficiency, both physical and mental, and preventable ignorance. In spite of the general energy and effectiveness that characterizes American life we are far behind the other nations of the world in our consideration of the problems presented by sickness, and death. As Dr. W. H. Welch of Johns Hopkins has said, in America the new knowledge regarding the origin and spread of disease is applied to a lamentably small extent. We are a reproach to the civilized world by reason of our inattention to matters of public health and the preven - tion of disease. ■From whatever standpoint we regard it, the importance of the prob - can hardly be overestimated. Pasteur was right in proclaiming </seg>
            <seg id="p560">452 that it is within the power of man to eliminate communicable diseases from the face of the earth, and yet a single one of these, tubercu - loaia, costs the state of Nebraska $5,000,000 annually, the state of Vork, $100,000,000, and the United States $1,000,000,000. In spite of this loss almost nothing is being done under government auspices, either state or national, to combat the evil. To reduce this loss even one quarter would justify the investmeDt by the state of Nebraska of $25,000,000, and by the United States of $5,000,000,000. How trivial in comparison with these figures appear the small sums spent by the national government for the prevention of disease and the improvement of general health, and how unreasonable must we regard the attitude of the state of Nebraska which does not devote a single cent to the study or prevention of tuberculosis in man. Thousands of dollars have been expended by our government in stamping out cholera among swine, hundreds of thousands have gone to exterminate noxious weeds and insects, and to investigate diseases of crops and cattle, but con - great has never voted one dollar to eradicate "pneumonia among human beings. As. Dr. Norton says: "Eight millions (of our pop - ulation) will perish of pneumonia, and the entire event is accepted by the American people with a resignation equal to that of the Hindoo, who, in the midst of indescribable filth, calmly awaits the day of the cholera." The Department of Agriculture has expended in ten years about $50,000,000 to protect our plants and animals. In the same ten years about 5,000,000 babies under two years of age have died while their mothers, stood helpless. Probably half of that number could have been saved; and yet as a nation we have never devoted a singl? dollar to investigate that problem or to protect those mothers and children. Now the problem affects not only the state in general but particu - larly the schools, in a most intimate way. If conditions are not changed It has been calculated that before 1925 the city of Lincoln will have lost 2,000 children and the state of Nebraska 75,000 children from tuberculosis. To this should be added the loss from other preventable diseases so that considering only the children we must stand appalled at the draft upon the state. Surely no greater service can be rendered to humanity than the preservation and improvement of the health of children. Whether viewed from the economic s-tandpoint and exprsssed in cold calculations of dollars and cents, or from the humanitarian point, of view and reckoned in relief from sorrow and suffering, there can be no more important and more profitable work than the prevention of premature death and the promotion of physical health among the children of our land. In this work the schools, can play a great part; can they afford to neglect their opportunity? KBut from another point of view also it becomes the duty of the &gt;1 system to devote particular attention to this problem. The laws e state have made attendance upon school compulsory. The child t allowed to choose nor the parent to direct whether the children </seg>
            <seg id="p561">453 attend or absent themselves. Now since the state has taken upon itself to require the attendance of children it has naturally assumed the duty of providing the best conditions for such work. It is no longer a sufficient excuse to plead ignorance. School authorities have at their command abundant literature regarding the construction and equipment of the school fitted to give the be&amp;t conditions to the children and to enable them to achieve the best results. Teachers know full well how little attention is actually paid to light, heat, ventilation, arrangement of rooms, type of furniture, stairways, color of walls, mode of cleaning, and a hundred other details which enter into the construction and managem?nt of school buildings and which are primarily if not entirely under the control of school bo So well understood is the neglect of the authorities along these lines that the teacher rarely voices any protest against the most reprehensible conditions and too often follows the bad precedent by neglecting to provide the best light, the freshest air, and the cleanest rooms which conditions, will allow. The ability to do good work depends absolutely upon the physical condition of the children. Food, clothing, habits and home influences which the teacher can hardly control determine in first instance the health of the scholars and yet however vigorous, well nurtured and properly clothed the children may be they cannot preserve their vitality and energy if compelled to s-it for hours in an overheated room from which all oxygen is as rigorously barred as the teacher can possibly exclude it. Our teachers are not yet free from the medieval superstition that somehow fresh air is. dangerous ard they go on breeding germs and spreading infections in the devitalizing environ - ment of bad air because "colds" are philologically attribute lowering the temperature and because in the popular belief "drafts" are the cause of pneumonia and other terrible ailments. Modern medicine has demonstrated that abundant oxygen is essential for proper functioning of the nervous system and fresh air even in winter is one of the best means, to employ in fighting pneumonia, tuberculosis and lowered vitality. But if the ability to do good work depends primarily on physical condition, then there is abundant justification for the introduction into our schools of some system which shall test the physique of the child, determine the existence of minor or concealed defects that hamper progress, and inform the home to the end that such remediable defects may have immediate attention and the child be helped to achieve the best results which it can attain. Physical inspection is of relatively recent introduction into school management and yet the results obtained even before the methods are thoroughly worked out justify its inauguration. In New York City the work has been organ - ized under a definite department of the city school system, known as the Bureau of Child Hygiene. This bureau has examined about 600,000 children of school age within the past four years. Over 80% of this number showed remediable physical defects, a much larger per- </seg>
            <seg id="p562">454 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT eentage than had been supposed in advance of the collection of definite data. Less than 4% of the parents failed to act when the matter was called to their attention and thus through this means thousands of children were relieved of physical defects which retarded their progress and reduced the efficiency of the schools. But medical inspection has another important end in view. The schools are peculiarly liable to spread contagious diseases and school children are at a dangerous age — one in which the power of resistance to germ diseases is much less than later in life. The provision for compulsory attendance lays, upon the state a mutual obligation to protect its charges from disease during school hours at least by all possible means. The school has no right of any kind to cause or spread disease and the neglect to provide reasonable precautions against such a contingency constitutes nothing short of a crime. Let not the public mind be confused by false ideas of supposed medical theories or religious belisfs. Every parent has a right to hold the state responsible that no person old or young with any sort of a transmissible disease be allowed to come in contact with the children in the schools and thit all such be rigidly excluded from school buildings and premises. Child labor has been restricted, child education is being enforced; it is high time that child health be conssrved and child lives be saved. But it is necessary to go one step further. In addition to exam - ination and exclusion we must also have education. The present deplorable condition is due to ignorance. Ignorance of the parents concerning the cause and spread of disease, ignorance of the teachers concerning the importance of the question and the possibility of improving conditions through the agency of the schools. And here as elsewhere ignorance must be corrected through education, even though it involves a radical readjustment of present methods and the recal - culation of educational values. Education along health lines is being sought today through the most diverse agencies. Women's Clubs and mixed societies both local and national, labor unions and fraternal organizations, churches and lodges, in fact all kinds of voluntary associations in which men are united, vie with each other in propagating the gospel of good living, in condemning bad air, bad water, bad food and bad habits, and in exalting the virtues of sunshine, fresh air, pure food and right living. Newspapers, weeklies, monthlies, and other periodicals, give prom - inence to articles on one phase or another of these questions by men of public and professional eminence. Public meetings are held under varied auspices, traveling exhibits are carried through the country, even the phonograph is called into service to enlighten some section of the public regarding the dangers of adulterated foods or communicable disease*, and the means of avoiding them. Men are looking everywhere to find new agencies and planning constantly how they can devise new means for carrying on the campaign for education, and yet the oldest, greatest and surest educational agency of all, the public school, has not </seg>
            <seg id="p563">455 I enlisted actively and effectively in the contest. Whatever oth?r icies. achieve, their results are after all subsidiary. All permanent ■ational work must be done through the medium of the public ol. No machinery can be created which reaches so far, holds lany so long in its influence, or has such a place in the esteem of is the American school system. Not only that, but the school Iren of today are the men and women of tomorrow and what learn will rule the thought and action of the future. To achieve suppression of preventable disease, it is necessary to instruct the ing generation rather than that which is passing away. There is time here only to outline briefly the steps which must be taken in order to attain this end. Our colleges and universities must establish practical and effective courses in hygiene (right living), and sanitation (clean surroundings). Instruction in school and community hygiene as well as in personal habits must be required in all courses for the professional training of teachers. Hygiene be exalted to a primary place in the curriculum of all schools., not as a memoriter exercise concerned with anatomical details or physio - logical theories, but with a view to teaching pupils th? proper mode of life in order to secure the greatest efficiency. The education of children to correct habits, in a practical and effective manner, as patients are taught in sanatoria, would send them out into the world ready for the emergencies of life and capable of avoiding preventable diseases. The formation of automatic habits of hygiene, a love for cleanliness, for neatness, and for outdoor life, can be given a start through correct teaching even in the lowest classes and will develop good control of the fundamental principles of health and right living. To the objector who urges the present overcrowded curriculum of the schools. I would say that we pretend to teach hygiene now and this movement only calls for its vitalization. And if in the adequate consideration of the subject more time is demanded, it suffices to quote from Dr. A. E. Winship, a recogDized authority on educational ques - tions: "If the teacher and the pupils in the grades ar? so overworked that there is not time to save human lives by specific instruction aa to the prevention of tuberculosis and other diseases., a most important need of the present time is to see if any part of the work can be eliminated to advantage. "I have never seen an elementary school program from which much could not be eliminated without perceptible loss to any child. There is always much of rubbish in processes and in methods. There is no pretense on the part of any teacher that all of the teaching is of direct value to the children, and the exjcuse offered for taking so much time with it is that it is good discipline. Neither arithmetic nor grammar, spelling nor geography, discipline the mind more than an earnest study of so much physiology and biology, chemistry and physjcs, geography and civics, domestic science and architecture as are needed for the elimination of tuberculosis and other diseases. A teacher or superintendent who will deliberately say that the disciplinary value of </seg>
            <seg id="p564">456 any subject now taught is greater than that which could b? gained from teaching about tuberculosis and other diseases, is wanting In a knowledge of educational values." In short, the Good Health Campaign demands of the school system three things.: first, proper consideration for school hygiene in the construction, equipment and management of school buildings that th? children may be given the most helpful and effective surroundings; second, medical inspection that the children and the parents may know what defects limit progress and may avoid the evil con - sequences of contagious diseases; third, the exaltation of hygiene to a primary place among school subjects that before ignorance has exacted a heavy penalty the pupils may learn how to live and what dangers to shun. The problems to be solved in this movement are many, and complicated; but they can be solved by united attack and their solution is worthy the best efforts of th» best minds for their neglect threatens the progress and even the very existence of our nation.

Mrs. Sarah Brindley, Dean of Women, Kearney State Normal "A Tour of the Eastern Cities for Nebraska Teachers at a cos.t of about one hundred and twenty-five dollars," was a notice which attracted about forty-five of us and brought us together in two special cars under the direction and management of State Superintendent McBrien who lor weeks had been conferring with railroad agents to secure rates of transportation by rail and steamship, and at hotels in cities to b? visited. He also secured special concessions and courtesies from book companies and commercial clubs. We all agreed before we long on the way that our delightful freedom from care was chiefly due to the splendid planning by "Father McBrien" at the official headquarters weeks before we started. Twenty-four hours, of pleasant travel, which afforded us oppor - tunity of making each other's acquaintance, and we arrived in the beautiful Forest City, Cleveland. Here we attended the National Association for three days, receiving inspiration from noted speakers and thrilled with rapture at the music from th? throats of five huDdr?d little boys. It seemed as if angels were singing the "Holy City," so clear and sweet were the bird-like tones. In the midst of immense crowds congregated in this place, our hotel, so wisely secured in advance, was pleasant and reasonable. Some of our party were entertained by relatives and friends but all assembled on the evening of the third day to board the steamer for Buffalo. The pleasant evening spent on deck and the quiet restful </seg>

We spent the entire day viewing this wonder of nature from different points and such a delightful day as we had: perfect weather, perfect harmony, perfect management. No member of our party can ever forget that day. In the evening a shadow fell on our high spirits, when our leader. Superintendent McBrien, announced there was need of his return to Nebraska and that he must turn over the leadership to one of the party. I. A. Downey stepped to the head of affairs in an acceptable manner but as we cheered Mr. McBrien, wishing him a safe return, we all felt a pang of regret at our loss. KA restful little trip on a beautiful new steamer took us in the ing to Toronto. A good hotel had been provided and touring secured so we enjoyed the beauties of the city with comfort. We seded to Kingston by rail at night and early in the morning took Eimer on the Saint Lawrence River where we gave ourselves over i enjoyment of a full day. The Thousand Islands in their native y, added to which, we saw ca&amp;tles and other adornments far d our expectations. The running of the Lachine Rapids gave us Ikless dash of pleasure which caused the whole party to arrive at real in high spirits. We felt as. if we were in a foreign land g our stay here but enjoyed contrasting the people and buildings other cities. We were graciously entertained at an English stared at by people who read Nebraska on our badges and quea - i by some curious ones who wished to know of the far west. Again we travel at night to save time. The moonlight on Lake Champlain was an attraction which kept us from our pillows, till a late hour. Historic points were indicated, to us by gentlemanly train men, and finally yielding to sleep, we were whirled to Boston where we arrived early in the day. Here we were again conscious that our welfare had been considered in advance. A fine hotel was waiting to aerve us. A cultured gentleman, representative of the Glnn Book Com - pany met us and conducted us to points of interest over this historic city. He also chartered an electric car and took us to Cambridge, Lexington and Concord, conducting us to every spot of interest, giving ue a royal day and all complimentary from this generous book concern. During our three days in Boston, we attended bathing resorts in the evenings and rested ourselves with boat rides, etc. I Our trip was so delightfuly arranged that it took us from Boston igh the picturesque Berkshire Hills and, even tired as we were constant sight seeing, we found our spirits rise with the altitude i happier, more appreciative party could not be found. At Albany, rere met by representatives of the Commercial Club of that city did everything in their power to make our brief stay worthy of mbrance. </seg>
            <seg id="p571">461 Our trip from Albany to New York down the Hudson seems like a pleasant dream. Many concessions were made to us such as a state - room given for a rest room and headquarters for our party. A separate baggage roo'm in which our grips were locked till we were ready to leave the boat, and the most polite treatment on every hand. Arriving at New York City in the evening, we were met by Profes - sor Thompson of Hastings who had been taking a degree at Columbia College and secured by Superintendent McBrien to escort us to points of interest and this he did in a manner which showed him worthy of the responsibility given him. How we ever saw all we did at this place wh-*n we were in so tired a condition, I cannot well explain. Even the frivolous attractions at Coney Island did not escape us. In three days (and nights) we had seen all the points of interest in wonderful, terrible New York. We received most gracious attentions and ex - pensive excursions from the American Book Company at this point. The young men delegated to extend the favors were fine fellows. Nevertheless we were relieved to find ourselves on the way to the Quaker City. Here we were received by our friend, Mr. Turner, of the Silver Burdett Book Concern, who proceeded to make us enjoy our visit in Philadelphia. We found this too had been arranged for us and we permitted ourselves to be led to see the beautiful and historic places in easy touring cars, stopping where we felt disposed to inves - tigat?, and all the time happy and gay as larks. From Philadelphia, we directed our course to Washington where we seemed to reach the climax of our delightful tour. Automobiles met our train and gave us a charming impression of the beauties of that city before taking us to our hotel. United States Auditor Andrews and his lovely wife and sister acted as escorts to all places of interest we might visit with profit and pleasure, planning to save our strength as well as our money but at the same time turning every moment to account Our excursions to Mt. Vernon and Arlington, through all the capitol buildings, including the White House, the congressional library by night and by day light with guides to explain the meaning of decorations, etc., made our three days in Washington brim full of education and pleasure. From this point our party began to scatter s.o that on our return, one sleeper was sufficient to accommodate us. We spent one day in Chicago looking at the parks and school?., also peeping inside the great stores to satisfy ourselves that this, western city waa worthy of notice, too. (I was requested at the beginning of the journey to act as mother laperone to the thirty-eight young ladies, of our party, the duties hich gave me pleasure and experience.

I am constantly in receipt of postal cards from members of our party declaring they are still enjoying the feast of good things that came to them on the summer tour. I am sure I voice the sentiments of the entire party in extending a vote of thanks to Superintendent McBrien for the careful arrangement which gave us such pleasurable education and should another such opportunity present itself forty-four teachers would make a desperate effort to take advantage of it.

Civic Federation European 'Trip. I The Board of Education of the State Normal School? early in 1908 aged to excuse on full salary teachers in the state normal school Ities who desired to take the Civic Federation European trip and received appointment by this federation. Miss Eleanor Lally and Nellie May Schlep of Peru and Dr. W. A. Clark of Kearney were •red by auch appointments. It was impossible for Dr. Clark to this trip, but we are fortunate in having reports from Miss Lally Miss Schlee. MISS LALLY The Origin of the Commission: Some twenty years ago, Alfred Mosely, Esq., of London, banker and philanthropist, while engaged in mining operations at Kimberl-?y became interested in American education through his association with some very able engineers. Under their guidance the development of South Africa was started, and to their efforts tb-s success of the mining centers is largely due. Later, Mr. Mosely visited the United States for the purpose, as he himself says, of seeing "what sort of country it was that was responsible for sending so many level-headed men to the Cape." As to the result of his observations, in America he mays: "So far as I </seg>
            <seg id="p573">LECTURES. REPORTS, ADDRESSES AJJD PAPERS 463 table to ascertain, the form of education given In the United 8 is responsible for much of its success, and I returned home mined, if possible, to get together a party of experts to visit DUDtry and test the soundness of my conclusions." Accordingly, Mr. Mosely originated the Industrial Commission of 1902, and the Educational Commission of 1903. Mr. Mosely accom - panied the English educators during their inspection of American schools, and the reports of their observations may be read with profit by American teachers. The American Teachers' Visit: The visit of the American teachers to Europe, which was arranged by the National Civic Federation, was made possible through the courtesy and public spirit of Mr. Mosely, and of J. Bruse Ismay, Esq., President of the International Mercantile Marine Company of Liverpool. Upon landing at Southampton, our party were met at the wharf by a committee of men connected with education and w? were most kindly and courteously directed by them !d visiting schools and the many places of historic interest in that interesting old city. We are grateful for the hospitality extended to us in all th,e cities visited. The receptions, teas, dinners, drives and excursions to which we were invited contributed much to the pleasure of our trip. Thes-e glimpses into English horns life are among the delightful experiences of our stay abroad. I One of the most notable social events was the afternoon tea i by Mr. and Mrs. Mosely at their fine old country house near on. There we met teachers from Canada visiting England on lilar mission, as well as educators from Japan who we-r? studying In phases of English education. The warm hospitality of Mr. Mrs. Mosely and their charming daughters will never be forgott;n I School Systems. To one accustomed to a graded educational sys - from the kindergarten to the university, the absence of a school ■m in England is very striking. Each school seems to be a unit self, the head master or mistress having power to maks out courses tudy. Elementary and Secondary Schools: The terms elementary and secondary as applied to English education, have an entirely different significance than we give them. Elementary schools are those sup - ported by public money and are under the direction of County Councils. They are attended mainly by children whose parents, are unable to pay tuition and are really public schools as we understand the term. The work done occupies pupils from five to fourteen years of age. Attendance is compulsory between the ages of five and twelve. A very large number of children annually leave the public elementary schools who, if facilities existed, would continue their school course for some three or four years. </seg>
            <seg id="p574">464 The secondary schools are usually independent of any public authority, many being endowed and governed by a Board of Governors. It Is generally considered that the four years' course of a secondary school may occupy pupils between the ages of twelve and sixteen although we found most secondary schools giving work also of a pre - paratory character to children from the age of five to twelve. Many secondary schools have pupils above the age of sixteen preparing for examinations of University rank. Fees are charged in all secondary schools in England. Scholarships: A child may come from an elementary school to a secondary school at about the age of twelve by passing an entrance examination, when he is admitted without fees. This plan gives the poor man's child opportunity to advance with the more favored children. Many of those who win scholarships are numbered among the strongest students In the secondary schools. A very small per - centage of the children in the elementary schools win these scholarships. Some drop out of the elementary schools at the age of twelve and go to work, but far the greater number remain until the age of four - teen. During these two years he is given quite a different training from that given a pupil of the same age in a secondary school. The one is prepared for trades or business, while the other begins his work in languages preparatory to a broad education. Evening Continuation Schools afford an opportunity to students employed during the day to pursue studies in the evenings. Man - chester is Justly proud of its evening schools. There we saw young men studying Commercial Law, Bookkeeping, Engineering, etc. Young women were learning sewing, millinery, cooking and nursing. Education of the Masses: Id England, public opinion is not strongly in favor of the education of the masses. In the elementary schools that we visited, conditions differed greatly from those in the secondary schools. There were frequently sixty pupils and sometimes more, under the care of one teacher in the elementary schools. Prob - ably because of this crowded condition, less freedom Is allowed the children. The arbitrary discipline and unquestioning obedience in the schools attended by poor children is conducive to training good servants, but tends to efface individuality. The Recitation: The recitation, as we understand the term is rarely heard in England or Scotland. The teacher's main object seems to be to narrate the lesson to the class in order to prepare for examinations. Very few teachers have the notion of developing a lesson, or of drawing from the child what he has learned. Pupils are frequently heard to respond In concert to direct questions. The good attention on the part of pupils is remarkable considering the methods used, but is, no doubt, due to the fact that the Inspector's examination must be prepared for. I am sure that American pupils could not b° induced to give such attention to the teacher who never </seg>
            <seg id="p575">465 initiative ami produce mental alertness to a greater extent than those of English teachers. Curricula: The curricula is not so over crowded as in America. Subjects are taught more thoroughly and examinations are more rigid. Reading: Reading in the primary grades is not, as a rule, taught eo well as it is in our schools. Phonetics are taught from the beginning, but I observed that the teachers did not have the notion of teaching th« child to be independent in blending sounds so that he might early become an independent reader. The diacritical markings are seldom used, children being taught rules for long and short vowels, or, as. in Nellie Dale's method of teaching reading, certain colors of letters indicate certain sounds. Children from the better homes read well by the time they are two years in school, but this is probably due more to the influence of the home than of the school. One hears in the first three grades, in the elementary schools much stumbling, in the reading classes, as the children are unable to recognize more than one or two words at a time. The teachers more often call the atten - tion of the pupil to pauses and punctuation than to the thought expressed in the sentence. I saw one class that had been taught by the alphabet method. On the whole, time is lost in this work and pupils are not independent readers as early in their school life as our pupils are. In the secondary schools much attention is given the upper ctoweu to pronunciation and enunciation, and the pupils read very well indeed. I Music: The voices of pupils, and teachers are very musical. One : hears such harsh tones in singing or in speaking as, we are quite itomed to. Europeans comment on the harsh voices of American Hers. English teachers of music have little to do in the matter me production because the children naturally speak with good tance, ai&gt;d their tones when singing are well placed. English and girls in all grades love to sing, and do sing beautifully. In .ppreciation of accent and rhythm they are superior to our pa ugh as a rule they do not read music at sight as readily as our s do. IKnglish: One seldom hears a grammatical error in English schools. pupils, speak and write more fluently and correctly than ours, mgh comparatively less time is d-evoted to the subject.

Girls, and boys too, spend their evenings e homes with their parents. Swimming: The teaching of swimming is carried on all over London to a very great extent, so that a hundred thousand boys and girls receive instruction every year, and at least thirty thousand are taught to swim. The enthusiasm shown by parents, pupils and teach - ers, attending an annual swimming display in South London reminded me of the excitement that prevails at certain base ball and basket ball games in Nebraska. Classes of boys and girls were competing for various trophies, — silver cups., shields, etc. They did some very re - markable swimming and diving. There is so much water in and about England and its people so love to be in it and upon it that every year about 7,000 people are drowned. Hence the interest taken by the people in the teaching of swimming and life saving. Children are taught how to get hold of a drowning man and bring him to shore; how to shake him off if he clutches his rescuer; and how to restore him to life if he is apparently dead. I saw the name of a lad on the roll of honor In a truant school, who though only nine years old, had Mired a boy from the Thames. The Training of Teachers: The scientific training of teachers has been carried on only of late years. Teachers 'are not so commonly interested in psychology and child study as in Amerca. The American teacher is usually not as scholarly nor as well read as the English teacher of the same class, but he har. his knowledge in a better form to apply. An English educator who had visited American schools -observed that our elementary teachers have a remarkable grasp of the scientific principle in teaching. The English teacher often has the attitude of a dictator, rather than that of living and working with his students. Demonstration Schools: iln the department of education in the 1'niversity of Manchester, the Fielden Demonstration School plays a very important part. It is the laboratory in which the student teacher gets a first hand knowledge of hie. touch with real pupils in a real school, he sees experienced teachers working out methods and after a time he takes charge of a class in one of the ordinary branches. He observes for a time the work of the class teacher in this branch and then under his direction, takes the class in hand and is made responsible •s progress during a school term. The class teacher is, frequently present while the student teaches and he also assists the student in his preparations. One or two hours in each week are set apart for dem - onstration lessons. The lesson is selected from the regular program of B-s to exemplify certain principles, and it is given by the class sr.

            <seg id="p579">467 ii to interpret what he sees. Later, the student gives one of his )ds as an "open lesson" before a large body of students. At a rate p?riod he defends and explains his plan of teaching. Aside from practice in the Demonstration school each student is sent for some ks. into the practical work of the Elementary or Secondary schools Manchester where they teach under the direction of the head ter or mistress. Much omphasls is laid upon the study of the Mental and PI life of school children. Students share in th? work of keeping systematic records about the pupils in the Fielden Demonstration school. This work is associated with the University Lecture cuureui. An account of measurements of height and weight is kept, eyeslgnt and hearing are test?d, teeth are examined and treated and records are kept of examinations of the nervous, system and other organs. This practical work in the examination of physical conditions gives a reality to lectures on the physical life of children and enables students to realize the importance of the subject. The laboratory method puts the student teacher into a new attitude. He learns to regard teaching in a professional, scientific light. II was very much interested in the work in language, history and given in the lower grades )of this school. For experiment the me for a curriculum suggested by Dr. Dewey has been adopted in belief that he is right in turning to epochs of primitive life as suitable source for material in story and song, in art and in occu - rs. They are repeating Dr. Dewey's experiments but paying ? attention than he thought necessary to daily work in arithmetic writing. MISS SCHLEE I sailed from New York September 26, 1908, and reached Southampton October 3rd. We were met at the docks by Mr. Evans, a member of the Southampton Council, and the U. S. Consul, Mr. Swalin. Carriages were waiting to take us to our hotels. The good people of Southampton had prepared a booklet giving interesting his - torical information concerning the town. On Monday morning Miss Alexander, the Head Mistress of Central School called to accompany us to the schools that had b: en selected for us to visit.

In the recitation the teacher gave the information to the pupils without questioning individual pupils but asking questions answered by "yes" or "no" in concert. 'Much concert work was. given. However, one thing that impressed me was the close attention pupils gave the teacher. For example, seventy children in one room, four teachers holding recitations at the same time.

However the criticism made upon the Americans as to number of women teachers in the schools, they do believe the use American boy when he leaves school is infinitely better fitted lis vocation and struggle in life than the English boy. I wish to say here the whole tour was mapped out for us, and each place we visited committees were appointed to receive us and ■how us all that was to be seen. In every city receptions, teas, and dinners were arranged for us. From London excursions were planned by the London Teachers' Association to many places of interest. Mr. Gantry, President of the London Teachers' Association, directed our party (American and English teachers) through Windsor Castle. We were also welcomed as members of the London Teachers.' Association. ENGLAND Open Air Schools The schools in London which interested me ■oat and the only schools I found to compare at all favorably with the schools of the United States were the Open Air Schools. Out from the busy city the open air schools are found, usually a plot of ground one-half block In size. On this half block were school gardens, play - ground, and a "shanty" used "to go in out of the rain." The tables and chairs for school work were out in the open and were never moved in when it rained. The children were brought to school in automobiles arriving in the morning at 7:30 and returning in the even - ing at 6:00. The children came from the slums and on entering were physically unable to attend any school. The program for the day was as follows: On arriving the children form in line, each child receives a cup of milk, one division went to their school garden, gathered from their garden vegetables for their dinners, another division looked after the clearing of decayed plants from gardens, and still another division gathered flowers for the tables. The last division but not least looked after The Specimen Baby. An actual baby is used for the instruction of the pupils. As this was so entirely new to me I followed the last division, ten girls between the ages of eight and twelve years. The baby was eleven months old and sleeping comfortably in a large basket under a tree. The pupils gathered round the teacher while she explained, "Giving the baby a bath." Some thirty minutes after this instruction the baby was ready for a bath. The little mother chosen did her work satisfactorily to the teacher. After the bath and dressing an - other group came to look after the breakfast. They were taught how to care for the milk and during this time one of the boys, had very carefully made the baby's bed. During the day the baby was weighed, taken for a walk, its clothing looked after and new garments begun. I regret that I cannot give you the kodak pictures of this interesting </seg>

At 10:30 the children gathered round tables and were served bread and butter and milk. After the and flasks were removed the children took their readers and »red a lesson. Following this games and dances were given, i reading aloud. The dinner had been prepared by one division e class. At 12:00 dinner served. At 1:00 o'clock each child was &gt; a reclining folding chair and blanket. The chairs were placed row in the warm sunshine and the school of sixty children were oon fast asleep. Two hours sleep and they return to studies, raphy and Nature Study were most interestingly taught. Note. — School closed at six o'clock. The open air schools have their origin in Germany. I Normal Schools. I visited one Training School in London under supervision of the London City Council. The Mistress of Method use the term Training Teachers) met her class of twenty-two tice teachers. After calling the roll and announcements a class prelve children, first grade, entered. One member of the Training s came forward and gave a lesson in clay modeling. At the close lie lesson the class passed from the room. The Mistress of Meth - took up the work of criticism and the majority of the members le class entered in the discussion. GERMANY. In Germany I went to Dresden first. I was directed in my visiting by Professor Lyons. Here, as in England, I was must cordially wel - comed and every plan was made for my comfort and enjoyment. I was much surprised to find a great per cent of men teachers In all grades and in some kindergartens and also the absence of manual training in the grades (below the ninth grade). I found the teachers do not favor manual training. Thought its place was in the secondary &gt; Normal Schools. In the state of Saxony, Germany, there are ty-three normal schools. 'Nineteen are for men, two (or women two mixed. Attendance. The compulsory school attendance in Germany has held sWtiy since Luther (1483-1546). For the control of school at - tendance, individual school boards in some cities, in others the governmental school authorities in conjunction with the police author - ities, the police seemingly the main factor. Punishment for Absence. The penalties attached to absence from schools, are accounted as penalties for the transgressions of parents, ard are treated as such. Accordingly, an appeal to law is possible, the motion for punishment must be made by the school inspector. The limit of punishment is. fixed partly by laws, partly by regulations. The police are authorized to impose fines "in accordance with pre- </seg>
            <seg id="p582">470 latione provided for such law fines that parents did not feel their payment as a burden. Fines are paid into the school treasury. Besides punishing parents with fines, and in default of them with confinement for a number of days, the children may be forced to attend school by (Kindergartens. It is difficult to draw a line between the kinder - •n and "cretches," that is, places to which laboring people bring very young children to be kept during the day. The "cretches" apt kindergarten plays without laying claims to being kinder - ins. These children on entering in the morning are bathed, fed :ared for by nurses and kindergartners. Other Institutions. In large cities, such as Dresden and Leipsic, institutions are maintained in which boys (and some cases girls) are kept after school hours to keep them from evil associations. In these plan in well trained, enthusiastic teachers keep the boy employed with manual work and plays until the hour arrives when fathers and mothers come home from the factories. They are doing excellent work training in order, diligence, cleanliness, and general moral conduct, children who would be lost in the slums for want of proper direction. I was told by government officials that statistics show that no other state in the world claims to have set afoot so many moral and educational agencies as the small state of Saxony in Germany. Qualifications of the Teacher. No person can be employed as an elementary teacher in Germany unless he has a certificate State Exam - ination after four years (some states six years) attendance in a Normal School and no one can be appointed to a position in a secondary school who is not a university graduate and normal training combined. This naturally does away with a large number of supervisors. ■ Public Play Grounds. About fifteen years ago public spirited men women in Germany, incited by reports of health officers and the advice of physicians generally, came to the conclusion that the city parks might be better utilized If entirely or partially given over to the children. Public play grounds might be established in the parks and other available places set apart for the same purpose. They were aware of the good in offering school children opportunities to enjoy the open air and take them from the influence* of street life. The main object in view was to arrange for public games which would bring a brotherly spirit among all classes of city children. The re - qneats for parks was granted and particularly parks which were located near the school buildings. Societies were formed to buy loads of sand for the little ones, balls, bats, footballs and other things for games of all kind?.. Teachers were employed to guide the children in their games, suggest new ones, settle disputes, answer questions with regard to things new to the children, and make themselves generally useful without becoming oppressive by exercising school authority. These teachers were paid at first by the associations, but later, when the </seg>

Great care was taken In the selection of suitable persons, for not every teacher is able to act aa •playfellow" and guide. The idea found the active support of influential men, such as members of Parliament, city officials, professional men especially physicians, and private donations were willingly made. The press favored it heartily. The movement spread and today there is scarcely a city in Germany where childrens' playgrounds are not arranged in prominent and easily accessible places. Naturally, the proximity o/ a park to a school or a group of schools brought the children of that locality together and teachers who were especially gifted in managing children — born organizers. — -were secured to be on the spot for certain hours of the day and to do the best their ingenuity could suggest. KA letter of introduction from Mr. Luther Halsey Gulick, President e Play Ground Association of America to Baron E. von Schenkeo- President of the Play Ground Association of Gsrmany, aided me :ly in my tour of play grounds. BI found the time devoted to open air play varied betw-een one and ! hours a day four times a week. I The size of play grounds set aside varied from one-ninth of a [ to one block. These grounds were covered with turf, gravel, clay, sandy, and other soils. The majority I found were covered gravel. tThe methodical way of doing things in Germany, and the fact no person there can draw a salary from the public unless h-e has loma attesting to the fact that he has had the required preparation le work induced the autorities to prepare certain teachers especially he purpose. Teachers' courses in conducting play have been given .■enty-one cities. I Elementary or Common Schools. These schools are the pride of &gt;eople. In these schools I spent most of my time paying particular ition to play grounds. The features in these schools which im - ;ed me most was obedience first, last, and all the time, and in everywhere. — Cleanliness in buildings. Almost no trace of dust in building. — The tiling wainscoting perhaps was a help as it could isily cleaned. Pictures in these buildings were mostly posters of ren and animals. In no place in primary grades did I find copies ie masterpieces. Many teachers spoke English. All spoke French. </seg>

Ella Tucker by the citizens of Tekamah, friends and pupils, at the home of Dr. and Mrs. A. D. Nesbit Monday afternoon, May 25, 1908, was a most gratifying ■access, and between the hours of three to five o'clock several hundred called and paid their kindest respects to Miss Tucker and her aged mother. One of the pretty incidents of the reception was the honor conferred by the attendance of over a hundred young school children of the lower grades who marched in a body and were received between two and three o'clock. tit may be truly said that Miss Tucker was a specialist in her for the young pupils of this city and their presence in such ters was a silent testimonial of their esteem. Miss Tucker began chool work in this city in 1881, twenty-seven years ago. At that the school was in its infancy compared with what it is now. Then mployment instituted the fourth department, now it has thirteen. </seg>
            <seg id="p588">STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 474 The organization was then a board of three trustees elected at the annual meeting. The board who employed Miss Tucker were M. R. Hopewell, J. R. Sutherland and W. B. Roberts, the two former were present at the reception and could congratulate themselves on their good judgment in selecting teaohers twenty-seven years ago. The present organization is a board of education, composed of six members elected at the city election, two each year for a term of three years. Miss Tucker has always been a favorite in the school. All the pupils Tekamah schools for the past twenty-five years have been pupils under her in some period of their school days. (Misses Allie Davis and Genevieve Hamblin, members of the fac - and the young ladies of the 11th and 12th grades were in charge e refresh men ts, which were a collation of ices and wafers. It was ted fact that Miss Tucker was unanimously elected an honorary ber of the 1908 class and wore the pin and colors and carried ■ican Beauties. In the receiving line were Dr. and Mrs. A. D. Xesbit. Supt. and Mrs. Abbott, Lieut. Governor and Mrs. Hopewell. Mayor and Mrs. F. ird, Mr. and Mrs. E. C. Houston, County Supt. Eda C. Xelson, Mr. and Mrs. Henry Roberts, and Mr. J. R. Poree, president of the board of education under whose direction this public recognition of Miss Tucker's faithfulness in school work was given, and who in a brief address complimented her on the satisfactory service rendered, and that she had won the highest esteem of the pupils as well as the patrons of the school. A little incident not on the program was injected by Lieut. Gov. Hopewell, the- presentation of what to outward appearance was a book in behalf of h?r many friends as a token of th? resp ot and esteem in which she is held in this city where she had performed such faith - ful public service for a long number of years. Th? book did not contain the proverbial pot of gold to be found at the end of the bow of promise, but it did contain gold certificates In a goodly amount reaching up into the hundreds as a promise that though she had con - cluded to give up the schoolroom, that still she would retain the confidence and resprct of this community. I Another innovation not found on the program was the presence staff correspondent and staff artist from the Omaha World-Herald, deeming the occasion of sufficient importance to send special rep - ltatives to obtain necessary data to make mention which will ar later. TEKAMAH PAYS TRIBUTE TO A FAITHFUL TEACHER Sunday World-Herald, May 31, 1908. It was Oliver Wendell Holmes who drew such a pretty picture of the little schoolmistress, at the breakfast table.

Probably there is no one profession that is as 33. In New York they pension their teachers after a quarter of a century of teaching. To be sure, the teachers rather earn the pension by paying a email per cent of their salary into this pension fund every month. And perhaps there are not so many that round out the full twenty-five years of faithful service in the schoolroom. BDown at Tekamah they do even better. They honor their lers by public recognition. KOn last Monday, when Mise Ella Tucker had finished over twenty - years of work as a teacher in the Tekamah public schools, the 1 of education of that pretty little town tendered her a public ition and a substantial testimonial in the form of a gift of $700, ?aled between the pages of a book. Story of Faithful Work I There was a story behind the reception. A story of the faithful I of a school teacher, who taught day by day, in the schoolroom out, the lessons that a sterling good woman teaohes. The lesson life spent in the pursuance of duty that was made a pleasure and ■ppiness. It is a story that la lived by many a teacher who has given the best of his life to the children who come under his guidance. It might be the story of many a teacher who still goes every day to the school - room that has become a second home, so many y ars has "teacher" entered the door five days out of every week. A story that began yean ago when you and I were youngsters and when educational facilities were not so well established a&amp; now. IThe first chapter of the story of Ella Tucker began in 1881, when applied to the board of education for a position as a teacher, they did not call it "board of education" then. It was the ool board," pure and simple and generally consisted of three men. men who were on the school board then still live in Tekamah were present at the reception given to Miss Tucker to congratulate upon her long life as a teacher to the children of Tekamah. The Old School Board They were J. R. Sutherland, now editor of the Burt County HeraW, and Lieutenat-Governor Hopewell and W. B. Roberts. Th?n, as now, they were the prominent men of the town and since that time, they have been the firmest supporters of this teacher, who so fits the description of Holmes' dainty little schoolteacher at the Breakfast Table. Kin 1881, Miss Tucker first began her teaching in the same rooms e she had gained her education, when as a pretty, brown eyed of 12, she went to school every morning. Even then, the arabi- M </seg>
            <seg id="p590">STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT 476 tion of her life was to teach. And long before she had herself grad - uated, she had decided to begin her life's work in her own town, where she was known and loved. t Things were different then. Those were the days when the ren trudged through the snow and rain to be in time for school, ' they had risen early to help with the chores at home. When milked the cows and fed the pigs and carried enough wood and r to last through the day. Then they picked up their tin dinner and hurried off to school. I The dinner pails were deposited in a row on the window sill, hats and overcoats — when they wore any — were hung on nails in entry way. The big stove in the middle of the room attempted leat the room and generally succeeded exeept in freezing cold Lher, when the children shivered and held their cold wet shoes to glowing sides of the big s.tove to hear the moist leather sizzle nst the heated surface. "Passing the Water" (In those days the water stood in a big tin bucket on a shelf in the t and it was a favorite and treasured stunt with the boys to permission to "pass the water," when studying grew tire - and things needed livening up a bit. It was generally a part e game to go after the water to the nearest well and to splash &gt;m the dipper in passing. At the close of the afternoon, the monitors solemnly retired for the wraps which they brought to the urchins who sat as solemnly waiting "in position please." Either they tightly folded their dirty little fists on the desk in front of them or as tightly folded them over their blue-shirted chests. We read poems about the "little red school house" in plenty, but a word about teacher. Mighty little poetry in life for teacher. Teacher must be at school in time, must put up from 9 to 4 with a men of young ones whose parents are frankly glad to get rid of them for that space of time, and teacher is expected to regard them all in the light of extraordinary children and to kindly overlook their mischievous pranks and thousand and one meannesses common to childhood. Teacher must correct exercises all evening and must stay in after school with the refractory pupil. Teacher musji't whip mother's pet and teacher is expected to put up with common every day sass from impudent children that their parents wouldn't take in a holy minute. Teacher earns her salary, all right, I guess! KThat makes it all the more remakable that the board of education 'kamah should so heartily and publicly recognize the work of Miss er. It proves that Tekamah people are out of the ordinary and nuch to be commended. Taught 25 Years PPor twenty-flve years Miss Tucker taught in the schools In amah. In that time there were many changes in the school system </seg>
            <seg id="p591">477 and Miss Tucker kept right up with the band wagon all the time. She did not mentally fossilize or atrophy as too many teachers are apt ! During her vacations she studied, traveled and attended normal tools, everywhere striving to learn better and more up-to-date thods for her young people. There were only lour teachers, when s began her teaching.

She has taught every grade, from the id to the eighth. Some of the children whom she taught that first are now parents themselves, and send their children to the public )1. She has watched twenty-five graduating classes receive their mas.

Ehe was not alone the teacher. She was the good friend and de. When her school mates married and sent their children 1 they felt doubly confident both in her ability and in her friend- For she taught them something more than was in the books they In the Tekamah schools. She taught them of the beauty of thoughts and deeds. She taught them something of her own g worth of character. She set many a foolish youth for the first toward the goal of boyish ambitions and was. in later years led by seeing these proteges looked up to with respect and ition among her townspeople. Was Always Ready to Help tShe remembered them on birthdays and holidays. Al - ?h from her none too large salary she supported and cared for invalid mother outside of school hours, she never forgot heT &gt;1 children in times of sickness or times of happiness. After a day's work in the school room and an evening spent in caring nd reading to her mother, she was never too tired to spend the of the night bending over the bedside of a feverish boy or girl, looked to "teacher" for help and comfort in health and in illness. (She never failed to lay stress on the better things of life or to it that a teacher in the public schools has a mission that is not second to that of a parent. She rejoiced as the years went on to the greater advantages given to the school children and to meet than half way, the greater co-operation between the parent and eacher.

In loving memory of the days when teacher was teacher and not Miss Tucker. When last January It was suggested by Superintendent Abbott of the public schools that some recognition be offered Miss Tucker in view of her long and faithful service, the board and business men joined In the plan with the heartiest enthusiasm. Tekamah is a pioneer town. The people who came there thirty years ago remained Knave been friende and neighbors ever since. Half the town calls &gt;ther half by its first name and in time of grief they look to each - for help and sympathy. Must Care for Mother When the last term of school drew near, M1ss Tucker surprised the town by offering her resignation. Her invalid mother would require all of her time and she was forced to give up the work she loved to attend to the cares of their comfortable little home. Her father had been one of the first merchants in the town and not only those who had been her pupils, but the ones who had been customers of her father's store, when his well-known team of little white mules delivered the groceries bought at his store, rallied around those who were proposing to give her a public reception. BOne of the wealthiest business men of the town wanted to give argest share toward the testimonial of gratitude offered her by the less men. "She gave me my first licking," he said, "I guess I needed it bad enough, too, and a lot more like it." "If she was to tell me to go to the corner to stand up right now," smiled another of a family, "I guess I'd start without thinking, so great has. been her influence upon this town." tAt the reception given Miss Tucker at the home of Dr. Nesbit, i were prominent men and women both in the receiving line and tg the guests.

            <seg id="p596">482 Zfifty Years of Educational 'Progress in Nebraska. By J. L. MoBrien, State Superintendent. 1 (Original paper read before the annual meeting of the Nebraska Historical Society, Lincoln, January 13, 1908. Revised and rht down to December 15, 1908.) In the short time allotted to this paper on this occasion, I hardly know how or where to begin in order to give an adequate conception of the educational progress of Nebraska during the past fifty years. To do any one of these years Justice would require more time than I can take in this paper. Therefore, we can hardly hope to make a logical, or even chronological, review of this subject. I shall be forced to pass from one phase of it to another abruptly, and in some instances. I fear, dogmatically. A characteristic feature of our entire public school system in Nebraska will be the lack of any entirely new policy in these later day* compared with the educational policies inaugurated and preached in the state's early history. Notwithstanding the charge made against some of us as present day faddists, when we open the records we are compelled to plead guilty as borrowers and plagiarists from our worthy predecessors and fellow state superintendents throughout the country. But According to Wendell Phillips, in his lecture on the lost arts., this i= a marked characteristic of the whole range of imaginative liter - ature, speculative philosophy, and every field of human endeavor. Mr. Phillips says that we have hardly added one single line or sweep of beauty to the antique; that if we take the stories of Shakespeare, «ome of them are historical, but two-thirds of them he did not stop to invent, — he clutched them ready-made to his hand from the Italian novelist, who had taken them from the east. But let us not conclude from this introducory statement relative to the similarity of educational policies fifty years ago and now that we have made no educational progress in Nebraska. On the contrary we shall be pleased to discover wonderful educational advancement during each and every year of the state's history. In placing these policies clearly before you, we shall make the office of the state superintendent of public instruction our educational clearing house. LIBRARY LAWS (The legislature o&gt;f 1907 passed a law providing for a library in t school. This law requires the school board of every public )1 district to set aside annually from the general funds of the &gt;1 district the sum of ten cents for every pupil enumerated in the let at the last annual school census, which amount shall be annually rted In books other than regular text-books, which books shall jitable for the school library. The law exempts any school dls - in which a free public library is maintained and to the support hich at least $300 is expended annually.

This was certainly a retro - i movement in our school system, and as far as I have been to ascertain the opinions of the people throughout the teritory. s. been very generally condemned. k"In those states in which the District Library plan has been ted the great majority of the people could not be induced to give heir books, or abandon the system, which, by law, gives them al contributions to their libraries. I "As an instance illustrative of the strong feeling of attachment i which these libraries are regarded where they have been estab - sd and tested, and how cheerfully the expense is borne by the )le, I cite the following from an excellent address by Prof. Reed he Wisconsin State University. In which he said. 'I will give substance of a conversation which I had during my recent visit to ana, while in the Auditor's office, examining the most beautiful ?« of books — the Indiana School Library. A farmer from the otest township in the county came In — after a little, I said to him. ntry, you are heavily taxed here in Indiana, I have been running y to Wisconsin where they have no old dead horses in the form of il8 to pay for, and no interest to pay on bonds which our sharp ana Commissioners were cheated out of." "Well," said he, "we heavily taxed, and this year, with our short crops and hard prices. i as much as we can do in our neighborhood to pay our taxes." it," I aaid to him, "it will be the poMcy of this legislature to diminish tion." He said, "In all mercy I hope so." "They will begin on • extravagant school system. Now look at these books — what is use of them? Do they do a particle of good?" "Let them," said 'cut off what else they pleas.e — let them even cut off the whole ol tax beside, but the books we must have." He then told me the books had done his neighborhood more good, and had produced 'eater change in the habits of families, than any other means of "ovement which had ever been brought to bear upon the people.' I "And so it will be in Nebraska. The people will never complain le small tax of one-tenth of one mill, which was provided in the ons repealed. The small pittance of one dollar upon a valuation &gt;n thousand dollars would never be considered as onerous, when benefit?, to be derived therefrom are so clearly manifest; and h dollar, if expended according to the mode prescribed, would hase three well bound volumes, or one volume each year for every s children In the territory, and which would form a nucleus for a library in a few years. By private purchase the same books would from one to one and a half dollars per volume." CERTIFICATION LAWS tThe certification act of 1905 has been thought by the friends of movement to be the newest and most progressive policy on this Jon in the history of the state. But when we delve Into the •ds we find that it is as old as the atate school system. To prove let me quote from the first biennial report of the state superin - ;nt of Nebraska (1869-71), wherein State Superintendent S. D. i had this to say of the certification lew then in force: "In carrying out this policy, there have been prepared certificates of three grades; also three series of printed questions for the exami- </seg>
            <seg id="p600">484 In of teachers. The questions correspond to the grades of the cer - tes. They, with instructions concerning the per cent, of correct ers which should be required, and the manner of conducting the - ination, have been &amp;ent to all of the County Superintendents, questions with the written answers, are returned to the State rintendent. This renders easy the supervision of a very important of the management of the schools, which otherwise cannot be led. "The county superintendents are to a great extent, relieved from the responsibilty of rejecting incompetent and unworthy teachers, and *n shielded from censure and charges of partiality. They are re - quested to puraue the examination as much farther than the printed questions as circumstances shall seem to demand. In the first three months, June, July and August, Third Grade Certificates, were Issued, under instructions from this department, wholly at the discretion of county superintendents. Since that time they are requested to refer the oases to the State Superintendent in all instances in which the schools, most remain closed unless certificates be granted to incompetent persons. Certificates of the lowest grade are granted in such cases. Poor schools may be better than no schools. There is but one courae to be pursued. Schools we must have — good schools if we can, poor schools only when we must." In discussing the workings of this law, Superintendent Beats in Uw same report says: K'Nine months have not elapsed since the first series of ques - was issued. The policy has met objections from a few; but from it has received unqualified approval. It has already wrought chances. Public confidence in the near coming of the day of ■ schools is increasing. P-ersons who are conscious of their teas to teach turn away in pursuit of other employment. The Is are supplied with better and more enterprising teachers. Dis - boards begin to see the absurdity of sustaining an incompetent •ant for a certificate with their petitions. Teachers and schools ve. "The Rev. J. M. Peebles, superintendent of Burt county, says: 'I have rejected quite a number of applicants who hae been teaching under old examinations. Taking the whole county, I think there is a better class of teachers than heretofore, by far.' F. M. Williams, superintendent of Richardson county, says: 'I fully concur with you that the standard of qualification must be elevated. Several, conscious of their inability, kept away from the test. Thus, far I have had to refuse only two applicants.' H. K. Raymond, superintendent of Otoe county, says: "Our teachers are of a higher grade — full fifty per cent, I think.' 'The schools in the county appear very well; in the city there is a marked improvement.' Similar expressions are made by the superintnedents of Gage, Sarpy, Washington, Douglas and other counties. Cordial co-operation of district boards and superintendents will in a ahort time demonstrate the wisdom of the plan. The benefits arising from it will far more than compensate for any slight incon - venience or anoyance that may at first arise." ■ Thus, we see that his recommendation and that of the county rintendents for the law then is practically the same as the commen - in of school men for the present law. During the present administration we thought we bad advanced beyond the virtue of the three R's when we began our crusade in be - half of the "five essentials." vis., reading, arithmetic, grammar, geog- </seg>
            <seg id="p601">485 IT, and history, urging the teaching of much of a tsw things rather a little of many things. But again we were borrowers and arista, for in the school law of 1871 we find that no certificate be granted without an examination in arithmetic, reading, writing, igraphy, grammar and geography. In the good old days there must been a crusade in behalf of six essentials. UNION NORMAL INSTITUTES In the Seventeenth Biennial Report State Superintendent Fowler gives, credit to the administrations of State Superintendent George B. Lane and State Superintendent A. K. Goudy for the organization of union normal institutes, and names County Superintendent C. J. Pierson of Netnaha county and County Superintendent J. L. McBrien of Johnson county as the promoters of this scheme, citing the union normal institutes held at Tecumseh in 1890 and at Auburn in 1891 for the counties of Nemaha and Johnson. The success of these two sessions of the union normal institutes for these two counties may be judged from the following announcement signed by the two aforesaid county superintendents in the salutatory to the teachers of the second session held at Auburn from July 22 to August 19, 1891: I "Fellow Teachers of Nemaha and Johnson Counties,: — Soon we be engaged in our second Union Normal Institute. When we ct over the work of last year's Normal, grand results are evident, omparing notes and exchanging thoughts, iron has .sharpened iron, iressive ideas on problems of education throughout the two counties being unified. Education's star is growing brighter. Judging future by the past, encouraged by our most progressive teachers. lave high hopes for the success of the Union Normal Institute to be at Auburn the coming season. "The Union Normal has marked a new epoch in the line of institute work in this state. It is sanctioned and praised by such educators as Prof. J. H. Miller, State Superintendent A. K. Goudy, and the Hon. Geo. B. Lane. Its outlines have inaugurated thorough and systematic work, not only in the institute, but in the schools, as well. By both counties uniting on this two-years' course of study eight weeks of practical, professional training will have been given you instead of four weeks had we fought the battle alone. Success or failure of this scheme, in the end, depends upon your cars and energy, at the beginning, to assist us in carrying out our plans as first presented. The many warm words of praise which you have spoken in behalf of the Union Normal held at Tecumseh last summer, convinces us that the benefits of such a training school are far superior to the results of the ordinary county institute. It has given our teachers many com - mon-sense methods, filled their minds with ardent desires, new and original opinions. It breathes the spirit of thoroughness. To teach much of a few things rather than a little of many Is its mission. Its motto: Give the heart a noble sentiment and the mind a truth of science. For the interest you have taken in all questions pertaining to educational advancement, we wish to thank you. Without this aid our efforts would have been a failure. Yours for education, C. J. PIERSON, </seg>
            <seg id="p602">486 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT The union normal institute idea was old before either Pierson or McBrien had reached th-e age of seven years. This historical error found in Superintendent Fowler's report is. due to his deputy and not to himself, but his deputy may be excused on the ground that the union normal institute idea was ancient history when he was serving Mr. Fowler. It is a case of history repeating itself. The first union normal institutes ever held in Nebraska were held in 1873, under the adminis - tration of State Superintendent J. M. McKenzie (1871-1877), one of the ablest educators Nebraska ever had and the first state superintendent to serve three terms. The most successful of these unioD normal institutes was held in August, 1873, at Tecumseh, for the counties of Otoe, Gage, Pawnee, Richardson, Ne-maha and Johnson. Between seventy and eighty teachers were present. I The first compulsory education law passed in Nebraska was under administration of State Superintendent George B. Lane in 1887, such a law was first advocated by State Superintendent MoK.nzie 873. The present compulsory -education law has some weak points we hope in the near future it will be so amended as to make at - ance at private, parochial or public school absolutely imperative all children between the ages of seven and fifteen years, at least I every boy and girl in the state has obtained an eighth grade ■till IMPORTANCE OF ENGLISH EDUCATION BThe importance of a thorough English education was first em- Ized by Superintendent Thompson. His arguments therefor are as K "Inquiries have frequently been made of this, department as to propriety or legality of the teaching in our public schools of ■ languages than English. To these inquiries I have replied sub - ially as follows: I— 1. The law contemplates that, in general, instruction shall in our schools in the English language. This is the prevail - language; our laws are published in it; ninety-nine-hundredtbs 11 newspapers, books, reports, and other sources of public informa - are printed in English. On this account, it is desirable that men and their children born here should learn the English uage as fast as possible. "But it must not be forgotten that there are in the state a large number of people who do not understand the English language; end In many cases these families live in "neighborhoods," "colonies," or settlements," where they seldom hear the English language spoken. In such places the children learn English slowly or not at all. Anv instruction in the sciences, they get for some time to come, must be in their own vernacular. Yet it is just as Important for the safety and welfare of the state that these children should be educated as any others. They are to be our future citizens; if we wish them to be intelligent and useful, we must see to it that they have school privileges, and are not left to grow up in igDorance. Moe,t of these people are strongly attached to their mother tongue; their early rec - ollections are bound up in K* their memories of their old home in the &lt;X&gt;MPUL8ORY ATTENDANCE LAWS </seg>
            <seg id="p603">487 fatherland are inseparable from the language they have spoken. This affection for their mother toDgue is natural, inevitable, commendable. But still the necessity of learning English exists. The safety and perpetuity of the state must be cared for, the high and useful function of the free public school to blend all nationalities into one — the Amer - ican — must not be abrogated. "With the desire of meeting the wants of this class of non-English speaking citizens, and of making our schools secure the greatest good to the greatest number, I have advised: 1. That in districts where Ie part of the children cannot speak English, a teacher should be yed who can speak both English, and the vernacular of the en. I think it better that this teacher should use the English as tive tongue and have learned the language of the pupils. But if :igner has a good use of English, and will carefully endeavor to it the leading language of the school, he may well be licensed ch. "As regards instruction, it should be given in English in all cases except where the pupils cannot read English; and then the main busi - ness should be to teach the pupils to understand English as. fast and as far as possible. Where this arrangement is carried out in good faith the children will all soon learn to use English and may continue their education in it. I find that nearly all intelligent foreigners with whom I have talked on this subject, approve of thi.--., manner of dealing with it. Most of them are anxious to have their children learn English, but at the same time they do not wish them to forget their native tongue. I have advised that a teacher must have a good knowledge of and ability to use the English language before receiving a certificate, no matter what his acquirements in other languages may be. We cannot afford to lower the standard of English teaching in order to allow foreigners to teach. Let them learn the language of the country ar.d then we welcome them." KThe nfxt superintendent to emphasize this feature in our educa - 1 system was State Superintendent W. K. Fowler, who said: "A more thorough study of English is imperative. If it b that 'all the acquisitions of the human race, all sciences, and arts, and histories, and sentiments of humanity have passed into th tongue,' I may not be thought a dangerous agitator when I say I consider it a blunder of judgment to cling to that stubborn vanity in our system of education which pushes our young men and young women into Latin and Greek before they know anything of the 'lofty thoughts, and beautiful imagery of Longfellow;' before they have any knowledge of the 'chaste humor and gentle satire of Holmes;' !■ they have any understanding of the 'profound yet simple' philosophy of Emerson;' before they have felt any interest in the intense earnestness of Whittier; before their minds have r.^ceived any tnlight - enment and their taste any improvement from the 'thorough genial scholarship of Lowell;' aye, before they are on speaking I with that prince of dramatists, that chief of po (x. William SI peare. 'Once, it is true, the roll of human greatness read thus: Homer, Hesiod, Aeschylus, Euripides. Pericles. Plato. Virgil, C Caesar, and the splendor of the catalogue none will have the rashness to deny; but into the intellectual world came a wonderful company of modern princes- — a Xewton equaling a Plato, and a Shakespeare balancing all antiquity." "It is a reckless use of time to have so many of our young men and young women staggering along in Latin, and sometimes Greek, when they cannot dispose of a simple sentence in English; hobbling along in the dark on Latin and Greek crutches, striving for two ways </seg>
            <seg id="p604">488 Itating one idea whfn they ought to be searching for two idea* the power to express them in the Dative simplicity of their mother ;ue. 'The poor man, in the cold of mid-winter, does, not need ten ■els with which to put one ton of coal into the scuttle, but what raves is ten tons of coal and one good shovel. If the remark will give any offense, it may be let fall here that there are thousands oys and girls, older and younger, whose ability to express thought quite outgrown the thought they have on hand awaiting expression, having mastered a great many styles of saying things, they find useJvea in the position of having nothing to say.' I "The importance of grammatical analysis in the study of English hardly be over-stated. Prof. William D. Whitney of Yale Univer - and editor-in-chief of the Century Dictionary, says.: 'Give me a who can, with full intelligence, take to pieces an English sentence, and not too complicated, even, and I will welcome him as better ired for further study in other languages than if he had read both ar and Virgil, and could parse them in the routine style iD which are often parsed.' " AGRICULTURAL AXD INDUSTRIAL EDUCATION On entering upon my official duties as state superintendent, Jan - uary 4, 1905, I thought the time had come to emphasize the importance of agricultural and industrial education, and practically added a new department to the office by instructing Deputy E. C. Bishop to devote his whole time to the promotion of this work during my first term. His work in this line has attracted attention throughout the educational world in both America and Europe. But again we were borrowers of a fad. The first superintendent to emphasize this phase of education was State Superintendent Thompson. In his second biennial report submitted December 31, 1880, he devotes sixteen pages to his ar - guments for industrial education, in many paragraphs of which he grows eloquent as well as. logical for industrial education in the common schools, industrial education in the secondary schools, and for higher industrial education in the agricultural college. Let me quote one or two of his, paragraphs: I There are diminutive souls who think any kind of manual labor iding; there are others who by some kind of inconceivable logic convinced themselve that selling turnips is. a much more dignified jynient than growing them, or that standing behind a counter uring off ribbons is more refined and elevated employment than ing behind a loom and weaving them. I prefer to think with ce Mann, 'It is every way creditable to handle the yard-stick and ure-tape; the only discredit consists in having a soul whose rang; ought is as. short as the stick and as narrow as the tape.' "Who does not know that the cities would become emasculated, effeminated, debilitated, and depopulated in a few generations, were it not for the steady stream of sturdy, honest, hearty life that con - tinually flows from the country into them. And shall this class that furnishes nine-tenths of the food and three-fourths of the brains of all the professions be forever cheated out of such means of education as are adapted to their wants, and be compelled to accept a professional education or none? I cannot believe it. I confidently hope for and expect a better day. The true dignity of agriculture must not appear in the borrowed lustre of the great men who have followed it. but in its union with true culture and its direction by the highest </seg>
            <seg id="p605">489 Intelligence. Belief in its present worthiness, hope for its improve - ment, and joy in its promise must inspire the farmer as he drives his plow afield; and the great public must come to believe — as it now does in public schools — in the importance, the possibility, and the necessity of industrial education." iThus we see that industrial education had an eloquent advocate re the days of Bishop and Roosevelt. Thanks to the wisdom of Nebraska legislature for fulfilling the prophecy of Superintendent npson in the establishment of the state agricultural college and the •al appropriations it has made therefor. Could Superintendent mpson now see the hundreds of young men and young women drink - at the fountain of induatrial education at the agricultural college in the industrial colleges of the university, he would rejoice with n the progress made in industrial education in Nebraska during past fifty years. FREE TEXT-BOOKS I The argument which State Superintendent Thompson made in his biennial report, 1878, for free text-books was a voice crying in wilderness to prepare the way for our splendid free text-book law ed by the legislature of 1891 under the administration of State ;rintendent A. K. Goudy, to whom the law will always stand as a ument. Hear the argument advanced by Superintendent Thompson ehalf of free text-books: "The plan of furnishing text-books by the district as other school apparatus of instruction is furnished, is rapidly growing into favor in both east and west. For this plan is. claimed: ■ "1. The necessary books are ready at the beginning of the term no pupil is kept back by waiting until he can send to the store his books. "2. Every pupil has the right kind of books and enough of them. "3. Absolute uniformity is secured at once and can be kept up without difficulty. K4. Needed changes in books can be made without additional cost; when one lot is worn out a different kind can be bought without onal expense above what the same kind would cost. K'5. More pupils come to school where books are free, and thus snefits of the school are extended to a larger number. Pupils stay r in school where they do r.ot have to buy books. I" 6. It is much cheaper. The books can be bought in quantities holesale, at a reduction of from 20 to 40 per cent below retail 3. Also, experience shows that books last longer when owned le district than when they are the property of individual pupils, y because they are kept in the schoolhouse and free from the and tear of home use, and of carriage to and fro; and partly ise the books are used till worn out, being used by several pupils iccession. A careful collation of several hundred experiments s that when the books are furnished by the district, the whole ise for books for a series of years will be less than half what it 1 have been under the plan of individual ownership. "7. Where free text-books are furnished, if a man moves into the district his children can go into the school at once, without addi - tional expense, and when he leaves for a different locality he does </seg>
            <seg id="p606">490 find no use in bis new place of residence. "These and other things are claimed by the friends of free text-books, and I must say that the experience of districts that have tried the plan in this state, goes far to confirm them. I "In the report for 1877, sixty districts -were returned as having plan on trial. As nearly as can be ascertained at the present time, t seventy-five districts are furnishing free text-books. In the th of May a circular of inquiry was addressed to a number of these icts, asking the following questions: "1. How long have you been furnishing free text-books"? "2. What reduction from retail prices did you get when you purchased your books? "3. What Is. the average cost to the district per annum, per pupil? "4. How does, the plan work? "5. What difficulties do you meet? "To the first question, the answers varied from 'one' to 'five years." KTo the second question, the answers show that an average tion from retail prices was made of about 25 per cent; but some ed 40 per cent off. K'To the third question, the answers varied from 50 cents per j&gt;er year, to $1.25. "To the fourth question, one reports 'a failure,' another 'badly,' the remaining eighteen of the twenty reporting, speak of the plan as workiDg 'admirably,' 'well,' 'popular with teachers, not opposed by patrons,' "great advantage,' 'works very satisfactorily,' 'perfect success,' 'could not have had a school without it,' etc., etc. "To the fifth query, one answers, 'pupils do not like soiled books, and do not tak« care of them;' others answer, 'no serious difficulty/ 'principal difficulty is the choice of books, and perhaps the total de - pravity of some pupils,' "to induce teachers to feel responsible for the care of the books; this ought to be stipulated in the contract,' 'no difficulties,' etc., etc. I "Of the two districts that report 'failure and dissatisfaction,' furnished books, only to those too poor to buy them; and are unable to tell the expense of the experiment, showing that matter was not carefully managed. As it is, 90 per cent of all •icts reporting are highly pleased with the plan. K 'Suggestions. — (1) Districts that now furnish, or contemplate ihing free text-books, should present the question at the annual ng, and have a tax voted for the purpose. KBuy all books needed at the same time and from the same r, and thus, get the best reduction from retail prices possible; this Id not be less than 25 per cent, and in some cases may be more. I "it) Provide a strong book cas? or closet in the school house, that can be locked and in which the books caD be stored for safe ling. A case with as many compartments as. there are pupils in school, is very convenient, to prevent mixing the books in charge iff:- rent pupils, when the books are temporarily stored away. "(4) 'Have all the books numbered and labeled as, soon as bought, with a label something like the following: Text-book Library No. This Book belongs to School District 87, Lancaster County. "1. Books must not be taken from the schoolroom without the express permission of the teacher in each case. "2. Books must be accounted for to the Director, by the teacher, at the end of each term. </seg>

Is the supply more full and prompt and satis - factory than when pupils furnished the books? Of the 176 answers., 161 are "yes," twelve are "no," and three are doubtful. What means are employed for securing good care of books? Among the significant answers to this question are the following: "Regular inspections, books being inspected and their condition being recorded by the teacher." (This is one of th? most effective means, and if systematically done requires but very little time.) "Books num - bered and charged to pupils in text-book register." "Tact and care on the part of the teacher." (This suggestion gives the key to the situation.) "Pupils required to purchase books lost or carelessly in - jured." (A requirement eminently proper under the law.) "The covering of books." (A fresh new paper cover at the beginning of the term will go a long way toward making the books uniform and attractive.) "Careful use of bookcases." "Care insisted upon by school boards." "Talks to teachers in institutes and associations." "Circular to teachers." In conclusion, Superintendent Corbett says: "I have taken pains in compiling the answers received to report favorable and unfavorable replies, with equal fairness. My desire has been to enable the reader of this summary to gain from it in brief compass an accurate idea of the esteem in which the law is held by the school people of the state. "These are its advantages, briefly stated, it is a logical sequence to the free school idea, diminishing still further the barrier between rich and poor, removing an obstacle which stands in th? way of attend - ance of the very class the common schools are designed to reach; it reduces largely the cost of books to the community as a whole; it enables, the management of the school to secure a more satisfactory and seasonable supply of books and materials; when properly administered. It freely permits the use of books, that are needed for study at home and helps the teacher to inculcate habits of neatness and care in the use of books. I "The chief objections, to the system come from two sources: (1) i those who oppose all taxation for school purposes; (2) from »8 where carelessness in the administration of the law has resulted nn'ecessary destruction of books, and in careless, habits on the of the pupils."

SUPERINTENDENT W. R. JACKSON. Bin the Fifteenth Biennial Report (1897-8) Superintendent W. R. son gives the result of his inquiries and observations, as follows: The free text-book law has been in operation in this state since 1891. Of the 6,703 school districts in Nebraska, 5775 own and fur - nish text-books to the pupils free of cost. In many districts it is mutually agreed among the patrons of the school not to take advantage of the provisions of the law. While all within the district are satisfied with this plan, they may, of course, furnisih the books Individually, or the district may plan to secure books at contract price and 6ell to pupils at oost, but if anyone living within the district demands free looks for bis children who attend school, the law not only "em - powers." the school board to furnish th?m, but makes it "their duty to purchase all text-books necessary for the schools of such distrif One of the features, which commands our present law to the favorable consideration of the taxpayers is the provision regulating the coat of th-e books as follows: "That the contract price of such books shall not exceed the lowest price then granted to any dealer, state, ty, township, school district, or other individual or corporation in the United States, to be determined as. hereinafter provided: and provided further, that such contract shall guarantee to such districts any further reduction that may b? granted elsewhere during the life of such contract." It will be seen by the above extract that school its in this state, regardless of size or financial ability, may obtain ooks on as favorable terms as the largest and most influential ict or corporation in the United Stat- ■'Another strong feature may be noted. The law does not restrict listrict from purchasing books from one firm or company. This : great latitude in the selection of books and is a very desirable ire. The law as a whole is a good one, perhaps one of the best found in any state, and scarcely needs any amendments. About twenty of the leading book companies of the United States have filed bonds, together with sworn statements, of their lowest contract prices for books. Some ts have contracts with five or six of these companies and thus, are able to select the best books, put out by each company. The advantages and arguments in favor of free text-books may be summed up in the following: t Reports having reached this office that our present free text-book s not giving satisfection. it was thought expedient to canvass the • of the people generally throughout the state for the purpose icertaining the exact status of this matter, thus enabling me to nmend such measures for the consideration of the legislature as t be best for the educational interests of th? state. For this pur - the following questions were submitted to school officers, prin - b. and superintendents throughout the state. ■ 1. In your judgment, has this law had the effect of improving school work in your commmunity? 2. Are the people of your community satisfied with it? K3. Has it, in your judgment, had the effect of reducing the co«t hool books? 4. Would you favor a. change hi the law? If so, in what respect? Would you favor a repeal of the law altogether and a return to the old plan of the individual purchase: that is where the pupils Durchase th- books themselves? </seg>
            <seg id="p613">495 6. Additional remarks and suggestions. II have received replies from over 3,000 persons. Of this number 5 out of 132 town and city superintendents favor a repeal of the ent law. But one or two, county superintendents are opposed to law as It stands, and a vast majority of school officers reporting their districts say they are in favor of the present law. Eighty cent of the school officers answer the first question in the afflrm - ?; 83 per cent are satisfied with present conditions; 76 per cent rm me that the present law results in a reduction in the cost of cs; 28 per cent favor some change in the law, but th? changes pro - d are almost as numerous as the persons suggesting them, many ;f sting points already covered by the law; while 18 per cent favor 11 t*&gt;e 'a s er, the reasofi given by the major portion iat "individual ownership would result in better care of books." er "additional remarks and suggestions," the statements mado Id indicate that in some districts too little car? is. taken in the care xt-books; while on the whole thtse remarks would indicate that the nt law is about as. satisfactory as it would be possible to make it. BAt the «nd of another two years, in the Sixteenth Biennial Report 9-1900), Superintendent Jackson says, relative to the free text - law: The law enacted in 1891 providing that the tfxt-books for use in the public schools of the stato shall be furnished fre? to the pupils is still in force and effect. H &gt;■;&lt;- not been amended in any way. Th? purpose of the law is to s.ecur? to the people of each c! the widest latitude in the management of their schools. The object of the law in authorizing th? s.chool district to contract for the ni text-books was two-fold. 1st, to insur? to the district the right to purchase the books at tHi lowest wholesale rates offend on such books anywhere in the United States, thus s curing to the &lt;!: the benefit of universal competition throughout the country, and to protect the people of th? district against the expense incident to too frequent changes. I Preparatory to entering into a contract under the law. the pub - rs must first have with th? State Superintendent of Public In - tion a sworn statement of their lowest wholesale prices of l&gt; nu;.t be willing to execute a bond for the protection of school dis - i contracting for same. Bv this provision of th? law, each ict s-ecures not only the benefit of competition in this state, but in ■ther states where said publisher's, books ar&gt; usei. The pro - tn of the people of a district against too frequent changes in ookv i- - ■• 'h to h irovisinn nf the law author school boards to enter int contracts with their publishers for their i for a term of years. I might add that experience has, shown that teachers moving from one district to aDother frequently feel it incumbent upon them to discard som? of the text-books in use for others of the same kind but of different authorship. This, disposition often exists where there large supply of the text it is proposed to throw out in good condition; and whers the change is made, under such circumstances particularly. 1t results in large expense to the people of the district. The correct procedure for any school board, in my opinion, is to exercise discrim - inating care in making its first selection of books; being solicit. get the best the market affords at the lowest obtainable price, then to k«ep its teachers informed from year to year as to the names of the books selected in the different grades, so that when handing in their </seg>

DECISIONS OF THE SUPREME COURT AND OFFICIAL DECISIONS. (Damage to. — If any person shall wilfully and maliciously injure eface any church edifice, school house, dwelling house, or other ling, its fixtures, or books, or appurtenances, or shall commit any ince therein, or shall purposely and maliciously commit any tres - upon the enclosed grounds attached thereto, or any fixtures placed ■on, or any enclosure or sidewalk about the same, such person be fined in any sum not exceeding one hundred dollars. — Section Chapter XIV, Criminal Code, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for • Mast Furnish. — Subdivision 18 of the School Laws is mandatory, and it is not within the authority of the annual district meeting to vote not to furnish text -books; under this law any patron of the district, by the proper legal proceedings, could compel the district board to furnish his. children, pupils in the school, the necessary text-books, notwithstanding any action or failure to act on the part of the district meeting. Some patron of the district should apply to the district court in behalf of the district for a writ of mandamus to compel the board to furnish to the children of the district the necessary text-books. See the case of Ambrose Affholder et al. r. State of Nebraska ex rel. Peter McMullen, 51 Nebr. 91. In this case, in the district court of Burt county, Peter MeMullen made application for a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel Ambrose Affholder and others, constituting the school board of district No. 58 of said county to purchase and furnish to the children of school age of said district the necessary text-books In accordance with the free text-book law. An alternative writ was issued, and for a return thereto the school board interposed tbie defense that said act was, unconstitutional. The writ was issued as prayed, and the school board appealed the case to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court sustained the district court. A writ of mandamus will not issue where it is not within the power of the respondent lawfully to comply, or where it would otherwise be unavailing. 46 Nebr. 857. Funds for Purchase. — Text-books may be paid for out of any funds on hand belonging to the general fund, to the incidental fund, or to a fund especially provided for this purpose. Includes Supplies. — In passing upon the constitutionality of the free text-book law, in discussing the word "supplies" the following language is used by the judge rendering the decision: "We do not think the term 'text-books' should be given a technical meaning, but that it is comprehensive enough and does include globes, maps, charts, </seg>

" Loaning Books. — The law provides that text-books shall be loaned to pupils while pursuing a course of study in the schools. It is the duty of the board of education to place books at the disposal of pupils who need to study in the evenings. If, however, in the judgment of the teacher and the board, pupils of certain classes cannot study profitably outside of school hours, it ia proper to place reasonable restrictions upon the use of books at home by such pupils or classes. It is not within the authority of the school board to loan text-books, which are the property of the district, to be used in schools held outside the district. I Pupils Responsible for. — Section 9, subdivision 18 of the School i, provides that all books purchased by the district board shall be as the property of the district and loaned to pupils of the school b pursuing a course of study therein, free of charge; but the ict board ehall hold such pupils responsible for any damage to, of, or failure to return such books, at the time and to the person may be designated by the board of such district. SUPERINTENDENT W. K. FOWLER. A bill was introduced into the legislature of 1903 to repeal the text-toook law. After a brief discussion in ■ committee the bill was reported for indefinite postponement. Experience proves that, where proper oare is exercised by the school board and the teacher, this law is popular and satisfactory; but it becomes a detriment and a nuisance whenever pupils carelessly s.oil, mark, deface, or d» these books. See that teachers appeal to the pride of their pn insist on habits, of neatness and cleanliness; that they make a regular inspection of the books at least once a month — no other agency is more ■effective than a regular book inspection. should also hold pupils, responsible for preserving and returning books in good condition by a proper use of the Permanent Text-Book Record. School boards should also furnish each school room with a book-case. We urge upon school officers the importance of furnish - ing their schools with up-to-date-text-books. You should no mare expect pupils and teachers to work with text-books that are behind the times than you should think of throwing aside the self-binder and checkrower to return to the implements used by your fathers. Modern tex-books are as necessary as modern farming Implements. Relative to the difference in cost of text-books, when purchased by parents individually and by the district as a whole, I will say that under normal conditions the average cost per child (including children from the kindergarten to the end of the high school c • for books when purchased by the individual parent would not b - than two dollars per year. Figuring on the enrollment in the schools of the state for the past five years and the amount expended for text-books and pupils' supplies, for the same time, an average of four cents per child per year is the cost under the plan of d: Kirchase </seg>
            <seg id="p616">498 STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT The number of districts io the state Is 6666; the number of dis - tricts furnishing free text-books Is 6066. The 600 districts not now furnishing free text-books could b? compelled to do so upon complaint b^ any one tax payer in each of said districts, provided It Is within ttie power of the district to furnish said books. PRESENT STATUS The free text-book law still stands with but one amendment thereto, carrying its provisions to metropolitan cities which the original act failed to do. Let it be said, however, that Omaha, the only metropolitan school district in the state, long before the enactment of our free text-book law, found the free text-book system a policy in behalf of public economy. In the last legislature a bill was introduced proposing to change but one word in the law, making the law optional rather than mandatory. The legislative committee of the Nebraska State Teachers.' Association, consisting of one member from each congressional district and three members at large, gpeaking through its chairman, the Rev. L. P. Ludden, appealed to the legislature March 14, 1907, for the indefinite postponement of this bill in the following language: This committee -with all members present at its meeting Febru - ary 1, 1907, in the office of the state superintendent at Lincoln, adopted the following resolution: Ived, That it be the mbm of this committee that Nebraska tfcM text-book law in the I'nitcd State*, and that W% unalterably and unqualifiedly opposed to any amendment thereto. Kin view of the foregoing facts, we appeal to your honorable to indefinitely postpone H. R. 409, just reported on the first g list. I gave this appeal by said committee my official endorsement in these words: ■ men of the House of Representatives. I was present at the meeting above referred to and gave the lution my official endorsement. 1 hand you herewith a of our present free text-book law with the opinions of three of redecessors in support of this, law. Nots what State Superin - nts Corbett, Jackson and Fowler said in behalf of this law. also the decisions, of the Supreme Court as to when districts furnish free text-books and when they are exempt, pages 6 and said circular. Be it said to the wisdom of the members of the House of Repre - sentatives that said bill was indefinitely postponed by a vote of ninety - nine to one. ISupt. H. R. Corbett was the flrs.t state superintendent to make xtensive study of the workings of the free text-book law, which continued by Superintendents Jackson and Fowler. To Mr. Ett belongs the honor of urging upon teachers, school officers, and s a proper care of school prop, rty, and especially of text-books. ;ive here his suggestions therefor: CARE OF TEXT-BOOKS P "Under our present text-book law this subject is one of the test possible importance in every school. Reports show that </seg>

The methods, employed must, therefore, be determined by the teacher's Judg - and tact. The following suggestions will probably be found 1: "1. Appeal to the Pride of the. Pupils. — Say they do not want the superintendent and visitors to find them more careless, dirty, destructive, etc., than other schools. Such visitors might wrongiy conclude that they were not well taught at home. This would reflect upon their parents and their homes, of which they are so proud, etc. Tact and ingenuity will find many ways of reaching pupils. If the teacher can once secure a sentiment in favor of good care of books, the work is half done. "2. Look Inspections. — Every school should have a regular in - spection of books monthly, or at some other stated period. Make -tematie, but arrange so as to suit the teacher's convenience. It neel not take long, and can be done before or after school, at re&lt; - or noon, or in part at least, during school hours, as most satisfa (For method of recording, see "Use of Text-Book Record.") No other agency is more effective than the regular book inspection. It offers the teacher the best means of knowing the condition of all the b' but its chief u.=e is to keep the children reminded of their duty in this matter. The teacher should often allude incidentally to the next inspection. Of course all this requires a little thought and time, but not much, after all. when results, are considered. B3. New Books. — 'If, unfortunately, books in your school are in condition, make it a special point to preserve the new books asc-i ; then as the old ones wear out a better condition of I will b? brought about in time. I "4. Habits of Neatness. — It is as important to teach children cess in their habits as to teach them reading and arithmetic, ar= they too young to learn about duty to the public and the ansibility involved in the use of public property. The free text - ; plan gives the teacher better opportunities for this kind of ire than does individual ownership. Is not this a nobler motive simply the selfish interests of pupils and parents to protect property? Yet the principal objection to the law is that it takes .■ this selfish interest; and where teachers and school boards so careless as to remove the better motive, it is no doubt true the selfish motive i3 b?tter than none. Show that in your school under your influence the better method is more effective. B"5. Covering Books..— Advantages. — First, saving of books; ii, greater cleanliness; third, uniformity of appearance — pupils likely to complain that books are old and worn. The cover should enewed whenever a different pupil begins using it. "Do not allow pupils to deface covers. Allow no marks except nam of pupil and name of book. "Material. — All books should be covered with strong, smooth paper. In the smaller cities, and towns suitable material can usually be secured best at a good hardware store. It is cheap and should be provided by the director In sufficient quantities. "Size of Sheet. — Length, about one and two-thirds times the width of the book when opened wide; width, about twice the leneth of the book. (Exact dimensions not essential. — best size can be de - termined by a little experimenting.) </seg>
            <seg id="p618">500 ("Directions. — There is only one good way to fold and apply tra. No stitching or pasting is necessary, and a perfect cover be made with a little practice. Lay sheet on table with longer ; toward you; fold further edge down toward you and lower edge From you and crease, making the folded sheet slightly wider than length of the book. Then fold right-hand end of this folded sheet • to the left, and left-hand end over to the right and crease, making length of the folded sheet a little more than the width ofthe book n opened wide. The cover is now ready to insert the book. Bend stiff covers of the book back; insert one of them In one side of »r cover and the other in the other side. A little practice will &gt;le you to fold the sheet so as to make a perfectly fitting cover." COURSE OF STUDY The first state superintendent to make the course of study his hobby was the Hon. W. W. W. Jones, the second and the last state superintendent to be honored with a third term. On the course of study Mr. Jones said in his first biennial report submitted in 1882: "During the early part of the present year, I consulted with leading educators concerning the practicability of introducing more systematic work into the common school district. One of the most serious obstacles to effective work was found to be lack of system. Thli defect is not peculiar to Nebraska schools. It is general, and many plans have been suggested for removing it. Among others examined, those of Superintendent Whitford, of Wisconsin, A. L. Wade, of West Virginia, and Superintendent Slade, of Illinois, were found to meet the exigencies of Nebraska. Consultation was had with some of the leading workers, and an outline was adopted, to be filled out by the state superintendent. One difficulty in the way was the the want of funds to publish the work. This was met by charging a small sum for each copy, just sufficient to cover the cost. As small as this sum was, (five cents) it proved a sufficient obstacle in many places to prevent a general introduction of the work. Wherever tried, it has proved a valuable help. Some superintendents had al - ready published a course for their own counties, and it was. not thought best to change. An outline of this course is appended. If deemed advisable, I would be glad to extend this outline into a more com - prehensive -work, and place it in the hands, of every teacher not now supplied with some systematic work. Inexperienced teachers fre - quently lose much valuable time in the arrangement of classes and Deed the practical hints contained in this little pamphlet, to enable them to accomplish the most possible with the means at their disposal About three thousand five hundred copies were sent out, and probably two thousand were disposed of. The remaining copies are in the hands of the superintendents, subject to the order of this department." In his second biennial report submitted in 1884, he presents a rertoed course of study for the common schools, a course of study for institutes; and a course of study for high schools arranged by a committee of the faculty of the university and of the superintendents and principals of the public schools of Nebraska.

The same legislature passed the following law relative to the examination for teachers' certificates. This law reads: 1 "Examination for Certificates, — No certificate shall be granted to person to teach in the public schools of the state of Nebraska, the first day of January, eighteen hundred and eighty-six, who not passed a satisfactory examination in physiology and hygiene, special reference to the effects of alcoholic drinks and other iilar.ts and narcotics upon the human syatem." There are some of us who still remember the ridiculous answers that some teachers gave in their answers to questions in physiology on their examination for teachers' certificates. Supt. Rakestraw, formerly one of Nebraska's leading educators, is authority for the following ridiculous answer, made by a certain teacher on her exam - ination Id physiology soon after this law went Into effect. The ques - tion was, "What is hygiene?" She replied, "It is a fatty substance situated back of the eye.'" I can vouch for the following absurd and ridiculous answer, made by a certain teacher several years after the law was in force. The question was: "Describe the brain." Her answer was: "The brain is a soft substance situated on top of the head and protected by the hair." In Nebraska there is but one subject, under the existing statute, which it is mandatory to teach, namely, physiology and hygiene with especial reference to the effect of alcoholic stimulants and other narcotics upon the human system. "There is needed, too, a thorough knowledge of physiology, both temperance and the other kind; not merely for better health, but because it is vital to wis« school admin - istration. Moreover, the problem of fatigue, of exercise, of physical training, the relation of learning to physical growth — in fact, nearly all of the questions raised by modern pedagogy — demand a good knowledge of physiology." After making the teaching of physiology a condition precedent to sharing in the state apportionment of school funds, the law gives the local school officers authority to say what shall be taught in the respective school districts of the state, except in rural school districts, where the course of study is established with the consent and advice of the county superintendent. Supt. E. H. Koch of Seward county stands up with the courage of * Roosevelt for scientific temperance. In his official letter mailed to every teacher in Seward county under date of September 12, 1908, Superintendent Koch says: "Section '5' in the constitution of the 'Personal Rights League' organized in Seward county early this summer states — 'We vigorously protest against teaching prohibition in the public schools, or that they be used for prohibition purposes.' ■Section 4, Subdivision 9 of School Laws says: — "Provision shall iiade by the proper local school authorities for instructing the Is in all schools supported by public money, or under state control. </seg>
            <seg id="p622">502 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT in physiology and hygiene with special reference to the effects of alco - holic drinks and other stimulants and narcotics upon the human Bern.' So you see, teachers, that the law requires us to teach effects of alcoholic drinks and other stimulants and narcotics upon human 6ys,tem. Science teaches us that alcohol is not a food but Eson to the human system; that it has a destroying effect, that ralyzfs the nerves, weakens the heart and leads, to delirium ns. In other words, excessive use of it completely destroy* tht - n body. "The above are the effects of alcoholic drinks, and the law says we must teach these effects in our public school. If we do our duty and teach these effects forcefully as we should, our pupils will see the injurious, poisoning effects and many will not only abstain from using alcoholic drinks, but consider it their duty to help bring about such conditions as will prevent others from poisoning their systems with alcoholic drinks. This preventing individuals, of society from doing injury to themselves, if directed to using poisonous drink, is termed prohibition and yet it is an incident to teaching the effects of alcoholic liquors, which the law says we shall do. So what shall the conscientious teacher do? Shall she obey her better judgment and the laws of the state, or shall she heed constitution No. '2,' conceived by the brewers and fathered and nursed by members of the Personal •y League? Let us meet the challenge and go forward, teaching the effects of alcoholic drinks and trusting that we may not be enjoined by proceeding contrary to the constitution — constitution No. "2." n "3' of the same constitution reads, "We work against prohi - n in any form and aguinst nny rttitriotion of |&gt;er&gt;&lt;,nul rights.' Thick what the last clause means — We work against any restriction of personal rights. If every person had a personal right to do as he pleased we would have no law and anarchy would prevail." Let every county superintendent In Nebraska follow the example ret by Superintendent Koch relative to the teaching of scientific temperance in the public schools of Nebraska. Let every teacher in the state teach intelligently the evil effects of alcoholic stimulants and other narcotics upon the human system. F) not make exaggerated statements. Teach the truth, the whole and nothing else but the truth, for the truth shall make you There is a moral side to this question which comes within the legitimate work of the public school teacher. Every public school teacher In Nebraska should have the moral courage to stand up against the saloon. The governors of thirty-seven states within the last few months have attacked the saloon as the arch enemy of the home and free government. In Indiana, Judge Artman has. handed down a decree that the licensing of a retail liquor saloon is unconstitutional. ■tee* the saloon is so essentially an evil, so destructive and anti-social, that any law legalizing it is void. Counsel for the saloon keeper, under the advice of the liquor men, did not appeal from this decree, for fear of having it affirmed by the Supreme Court of Indiana, and sixty days later another court made the same ruling. Governor Hanly, the irrepressible Republican of Indiana, is lending the fullest aid to the temperance movement, not only in Indiana, but throughout the nation. His address befor% the Nebraska State Teachers' Association last winter was the most eloquent, logical and convincing argument </seg>
            <seg id="p623">503 Imade in this country against the legalized saloon. Governor the fearless Democrat of Missouri, is vigorously enforcing the y closing law against the saloons of his state. With what truth, force and conviction does Archbishop Ireland of the Catholic church speak against the saloon! I "The American saloon is, responsible for the awful intemperance h desolates the land and which is the physical and moral plague ir time. The drink which intoxicates is dealt out in the saloon, there temptations to use it are multiplied through conscious, and erate plannings. Let us waste no words on the saloon in s*, on iosr-.ible, or ideal, saloon; when this is discovered, and is something than a rare exception, it will be time to discuss it. The saloon oday trades in and fattens upon intemperance, and all the evils which accompany or follow from intemperance are to be laid s door." ' Ktake the following extract relative to the legalized liquor traffic the Bishop's Address to the General Conference of the H h at Baltimore, 1908: "There ought not to be — nay, there must not be — any reaction from the wrath •with which all good and Christian citizens p this sneaking, law breaking and murderous traffic. It deserves neither charity nor mercy. There is no law it will keep, no pledge it will honor, no child it will not taint, no woman it will not befoul, no man 111 not degrade. It feeds upon dishonesties of conduct and on the shame of brothels. It stimulates all revenges and ■ makes the mur - derer dance upon the body he has, killed. It falsely claims to be a great public interest because it employs thousands and pays heavy taxes. But no money in the pockets of employers, and no taxes in the treasury of the city, county, state, or nation, can balance the monetary - of the nation through this traffic. Xo profits, however real or immense, can compensate for the corruption of our politics, the ness of the drunkard's home or the fullness of prisons and graves. Rise here and now and pledge eternal enmity to this foe of man and God." ARBOR DAY The greatest honor of George B. Lane's administration was the inauguration of the celebration of Arbor Day by the public schools throughout the state. Ir. his first biennial report submitted in 1S88. to encourage the observance of this day, Mr. Lane gave the following reasons: I "The Statutes of Nebraska designate the twenty-second dav of as. Arbor Day. This day was originated in Nebraska in 1 ,s since been established in twenty-eight of our states and two ir territories. The people of the United States realize the lm - ,nce of forest culture. In no part of the country is it of more rtancs than in this state. Statistics show that there ha ed in Nebraska, since Arbor Day was, instituted, t, shade and fruit trees. "On this day, above all others, the pupils of our public schools should be educated to care for the material prosperity of the country and to foster the growth of trees. L:t teachers, parents and school officers, urge and encourage the children in every school district, town and city in the state to plant trees on that day in the school yard. Let the child understand that he has a special interest in the tree he </seg>

In every yard there should 'Stem and regularity in arranging the trees, and In cities and i they should be planted according to artistic designs. The 1 yards of the state beautified with trees would educate the etic taste of the children and be a material blessing to the I "For the purpose of encouraging tree planting by the school iren, and investing the exercises with interest, I sent out a ;ral circular letter to every school district in the state. The ob - anoe of the day was heartily approved by teachers and school ers. If this practice is continued in a very few years every 1 school in the state will have its pleasant shaded bower, where pupils can find shelter from the scorching sun during the summer ths. and where their taste for the beautiful in nature will find e gratification among the trees, shrubs and flowers." COLUMBUS DAY I (It was during Superintendent Goudy's first term that the 400th anni - ary of the discovery of America was celebrated as Columbus Day he people and the school children of the state, October 21, 1892. mbus.

The history of this, day observance is well told by Mr. Goudy in his second biennial report • 4) as follows. "One year ago last August there was introduced in the Saunders County Teachers' Institute, at Wahoo, and adopted by more than one hundred teachers, without a dissenting voice, a resolution which set aside October 21st as permanent Library Day. On this "Day" each teacher endeavors, to create a deeper interest in the cause of education by th° observance of the day, and also to establish, or add to, a library in every school house in the county, from funds raised at this, time by subscription, donations, or entertainments, or by whatever method seems best adapted to each locality. A "poverty party" once yielded more than thirty dollars. Such libraries are presided over by the teacher, or a librarian chosen by him; and are accessible to all in the district, under given rules and regulations. "A committee consisting of County Superintendent Watson, Super - intendents and Principals Bradbury, Crabtree, Paleshka. Men-gel, and Cone, was appointed in thia interest. I "The exercises of a year ago were mainly Columbus Day programs, a few or no modifications, and were chiefly given in the evening, lally in the rural districts. The success of the work was greater was anticipated. So interested became teachers, children and ns that over sixty libraries were founded or enlarged in the 113 cts of Saunders county alone. The principal difficulty experienced donations of inferior or unworthy matter, the committee made a ion of sixty-five books, and asked teachers to select or request Ions therefrom. It is believed that good literature will create a s for itself. "At the December meeting of the Saunders County Association, the teachers petitioned the State Association to adopt the same work and day.

At the meeting of superintendents and pals, at Columbus, in May of this year, similar resolutions -were &gt;d. "The State Association appointed a committee of seven to advance this movement, consisting of State Superintendent Goudy, Chancellor Canfleld, Superintendents Fitzpatrick of Omaha, Corbett of York, and Bradbury of Wahoo, Principal Cone of Cedar Bluffs, and Miss E.

When this ia clearly established in the minds of young and women, at the close of corn gathering, fruit preserving, and ral preparation for winter, they will be found coming into the jl room. "3.

By this library and through its influence raise the general in - telligence and the social and moral standard of every community. LIBRARY DAY Office Superintendent Public Instruction Lincoln, Nebr., September 19, 1893. "To the Superintendents and Teachers of Nebraska: "In accordance with a resolution of the Nebraska State Teachers' Association, passed at its last annual meeting, a program has been prepared by the committee appointed for that purpose, looking to the observance of the anniversary of the discovery of America as Library Day in the schools of the state. "It will be remembered that October 21st was observed all over the country last year as Columbus Day. It is the thought of the promoters of Library Day that it would be well if Columbus Day could be perpetuated as an annual festival for awakening interest in the schools, and especially for the building up of school libraries in every district ir. Nebraska. "It is well known that books of special interest and profit to children are no less interesting and profitable to adult?, and that the books of the children are read with avidity by the teachers and by the parents of the children. K"Good books put into the school library soon find their way into homes in the district; they are read both by the school children the home children; a habit of reading is thereby encouraged or ndered, and the good reading takes the place of no reading or ad reading in the community. B'This movement has received the hearty endorsement of Francis my of the Youth's Companion, and of Dr. E. C. Hewett, ex-pres - of the Illinois State Normal University, and of others of national e, as well as the approbation of the educational workers generally ghout our own state. K'ln accordance with the recommendation of the committee it gives leasure to call the attention of the teachers and patrons of the Is to this matter, and to recommend that Friday, October 20th, much thereof as may be deemed expedient be devoted to the rmance of this program, and to efforts to arouse an interest in lbject of school libraries, among the children and patrons.

Respectfully, A. K. GOUDY, State Superintendent of Public Instruction BIBLE READING IX PUBLIC SCHOOLS It was during Superintendent W. R. Jackson's secoDd administration (1899) that he handed down his famous decision relative to the read - ing of the Bible in the public schools. This case was carried through the district court to the Supreme Court, and was finally passed upon by our highest judicial tribunal during Superintendent Fowler's first term, sustaining Mr. Jackson's rulin-g on every point. The controversy en this question and the ultimate decision of the court gave Mr. Jackson a national reputation among the educators of the United States. The decision is found in his secoud biennial report (1900) and is as follows: Lincoln. Xebr., Nov. 25, 1899. 'Mr. H. D. Odell, Director, Beatrice Nebr KDear Sir: — I am in receipt of your letter of the 23rd ins.t.. in you set forth that a mandamus suit has. been instituted against hool board of district No. 21 of Gage county to compel said board p th? reading of the Bible or singing religious songs. ••In Kffctinu forth the conditions aD&lt;l the facts in the case, you show - that the plaintiff has heretofore rucceerled iu stopping the reading of the Bible, and by so doing has caused several good teachers to refrain from applying for your school. You state that nearly all in the t are in favor of allowing the teacher the privilege of having her ng exercises, and that you find no cne opposed to it outside of ' imily of the plaintiff. The exercises you say consist merely of the teacher reading from the Bible and repeating the Lord's Prayer, ind in a few instances of r-avinc siiifringr from the (iospel or Pente - costal Hymns and offering a prayer of her own composition. You inquire, "Am I (considering the above facts) using good judgment as B;mber of the school board in refusing to interfere with the er's opening exercises?" "I desire to eay in reply that in a district where the sentini nt is unanimously in favor of devotional ex rcise?.. such as reading a chapter from the Eible and repeating the Lord's Prayer, there can be no question as to the right and propriety of such exercises, especially when the reading of the Bible is. without any comment. I do not mean to say that it would be proper to require pupils to conform to any religious rite cr observance, or to go through with any religious forms or observances inconsistent or contrary to their religious con - victions or conscientious scruples. Such a requisition would be a viola - tion of the spirit of the clause in the constitution which prohibits sectarian instruction. The word "sectarian," as defined by Webster, is "pertaining to Bit, or to sects; peculiar to a sect; bigoteily attached to the i and interests of a denomination; as sectarian principles or dices." Whether or not any particular kind of religious service at the opening of school work would constitute sectarian instruction would depend upon the character of the exercises, and would be a question of fact to be determind in each individual case.

The same may be said of the singing. I The Bible surely cannot be considered as falling within the category ctarian books. Indeed, the Bible is the rarest and richest book in lepartment of thought and imagination which exists. In its pcetry, listory, its oratory, and its logic, it rises into the solitude of hless pre-eminence. It has been the inspiration of more literature any ten thousand other books put together. The vitality of espeare comes from the moral convictions of the Bible. It may itted against all the books of all the libraries, out of all races and &gt;f all ages, and on all the subjects it proposes, to handle, and in all ines of literature it touches it will discount them all many fold. Shall pupils be deprived of hearing read in our schools the book which is the greatest classic of our literature, the book which touches and crowns all other branches of knowledge, and is the most widely studied book in the world today? If we were to take the Bible quotations, direct and indirect, from our literature and our laws, we ■would divest them from nearly all that is high and noble. There is no other book so calculated to impress on the minds of children and youth the principles of piety and justice and the sacred regard for truth. There seems to be nothing in the laws of Nebraska that would prevent the simple reading of the Bible in our public schools. Judge H. M. Edwards of Scranton, Pa., has decided that there is nothing in the laws of Pennsylvania to prevent the reading of the Bible in the public schools. He says: "The reading of the Bible in the public schools may be allowed, and even commended, from a stand - point which does not involve the question of sectarian instruction nor the rights of conscience. It is conceded by men of all creeds that the Bible teaches the highest morality apart from religious instruction. It must be admtitted that sound morality is one of tbe foundations of good character. An education which does not involve the inculcation of moral principles is incomplete. And why cannot the common precepts of morality be taught by the reading of the Bible better than in any other way? Furthermore, there is much in the Bfble which cannot justly be characterized as sectarian. There can be no valid objection to the use of such matter in secular instruction of the pupils. Much of It has great historical and literary value, which may be utilized without violating the constitutional prohibition. It may also be used to Inculcate good morals — that is, our duties to each other — which may and ought to b? inculcat d by th? district s-hools No more complete code of morals exists than is contained in the New Testament which reaffirms and emphasizes the moral obligations." I Section 4, Article 1, of the Constitution of Nebraska, recot: gion, morality and knowledge" as "being essential to good govern - :.'" I am, therefore, of the opinion that in this enlightened age Christian land the public school teacher ought not to be deprived ■ading. without written or oral comment, the Bible or of repeating Lord's Prayer.

            <seg id="p628">508 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT Fremont, Nebr., March 21, 1900. Hon. W. R. Jackson, State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebr. Dear Sir: — I read your communication to Mr. Odell on the subject of reading the Bible in the public schools soon after it was written, and I then thought and still think that your views were right. The meaning of the word "Bible" is book. It is The Book. It has come down to us through the centuries and is the great classic of the ages. It gives us an intelligent account of the origin of the world and the race as the work of a Great and Benevolent Creator, and states our duties to him and to each other. A large part of the Old Testament is devoted to the origin, government and proceedings of the Jewish nation. Many of the grandest characters in history are here recorded. The New Testament shows the birth, life, teachings and cruel death of Christ. The time and place of his birth had been predicted by the prophets of the Bible centuries before, and the literal fulfillment of those and other predictions proves the truth and absolute rellabilty of the various Bible prophets. Christ came among the poor. He labored like other poor men until he began his ministry. His ministry embraced kindness to every form of humanity that needed help. He taught love to all, and unselfishness, to do good to all, even to our enemies, as we have opportunity. If his teaching and example were followed by all, this earth would be a paradise. He condemned bigamy and poligamy, and thes? crimes against humanity are made felonies in every Christian land. The effect has been to raise woman from the position of a semi-slave to be the equal of .her husband. Who can estimate the benefit to the world of the provision? It carries blessings to every home in the land. In history, poetry, prophecy, rhetoric and moral teachings the Bible stands without a peer. It reaches the highest morality, the most tender regard for the poor, the unfortunate and helpless, and condemns avarice, covetousness, greed and extortion. It presents the character of God as a kind, benevolent Being who desires the welfare and happiness of all, and holds out inducements for com - pliance with his will. iToo little attention is given to the reading of the Bible, and there great deal of ignorance as to its contents. I believe its general in the public schools would be attended with the most beneficial Its. There is good reason to believe that Shakespeare, that great :er. borrowed very many of his apt sayings and illustrations from Bible. Free government rests upon the teachings of the Bible, the ground work of the leading principles of our Declaration of pendence and is woven into the warp and woof of our laws and e*. A book that thus teaches u« our duty to our Creator, to elves and to society and is so interwoven into our daily life and Ings, should be in the hands of every student in the land. Yours very respectfully. SAMUEL MAXWELL. Nebraska Woman's Christian Temperance Union. Wymore, Nebr., Feb. 16, 1900. Supt. Wm. R. Jackson, Lincoln. Nebraska. E? general officers of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union to you our appreciation of, and hearty sympathy with your regarding the use of the Bible in the public schools. This on, though tardy, is very sincere. Yours truly. MARY D. RUSSELL, Corresponding Secretary. </seg>
            <seg id="p629">509 Chicago Woman's Educational Union. Chicago, May 11, 1900 Hon. Mr. Jackson, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: The thanks of the whole country are due you for your truly American and intelligent position concerning Bible reading in public schools Wishing the best possible results of public edu - cation. Very respectfully. ELIZABETH B. COOK, President. State Supt. Corbett ruled relative to the reading of the Bible in the public schools in 1895 as follows: I In a district where the sentiment of the people is in favor of tional exercises of this kind (prayer) there can be no question &gt; the right and propriety of such exercises. On the other hand, lever a considerable number of the people are, for conscientious ins opposed to such exercises., considering it to be opposed to religious views, such devotional exercises would do little good, the teacher could easily find mom effective means of exerting lpful influence upon the morals of the school. Whether or not particular kind of religious service at the opening of school d constitute sectarian instruction, would depend upon the char - of that exercise, and would be a question of fact to be mined in each particular case. The matter of religious exercises bject to regulation by the district board, and in this as in other srs, the teacher must be guided by their directions. Supt. W. K. Fowler ruled. Oct. 30, 1901: — It is the custom in many of the public schools to open the exercises of the day with reading a few verses of the Bible without note or comment. We have no Supreme Court decision in this state on this matter, though there is a case on this point from Gage county now before our State Supreme Court. Until that court has spoken, this department will be governed by the decisions of the Supreme Courts in other states. It is my opinion that this question rests with the district board. Xo court of last resort has ever held that a rule adopted by a public school board requiring that the Bible should be read in the public schools under its charge is unconstitutional. On the contrary, it has been held by the highest courts in several states that such a rule is entirely proper and not unconstitutional. The tendency of the ablest judicial decisions is to view favorably those statutes which entrust the control of the schools and the selection of text-books and studies to the local school boards to be regulated according to the wants of the community, and where there is no statutory or constitutional provision to the contrary and the general management of the schools Is entrusted by the voters to the school boards, such boards would, under authority, have the right to prescribe or to prohibit the use of the Bible and the Lord's Prayer; provided, that where the Bible is read, any child, whose parents or guardians request it may be excused from such exercises. I But the test was made on State Supt. Jackson's decision, and fore is a question belonging to his administration. In 1904 Supt. Fowler published the following in his Official Decisions, ve to the final ruling of the Supreme Court of Nebraska on the ion of Bible reading in the public schools as handed down by Justice Sullivan: Chief Justice Sullivan asserts that the law does not forbid the use </seg>

"3. The whole duty of the state with respect to religion is "to protect every religious denomination in the peaceable enjoyment of its own mode of public worship.' Knforced attendance upon religious services is forbidden by the constitution, and pupils in a public school cannot be required either to attend such services or to join in them.

It goes only to the extent of denying the right to use it for the purpose of imparting sectarian instruction. The pith of the opinion is in the syllabus which declares that exercises by a teacher in a public school in a school building in school hours, and in the presence of the pupils, consisting of songs and hymns, and offering prayer to the Deity in accordance with doctrines, beliefs, customs or usages of sectarian churches or religious organiza - tions. Is forbidden by the constitution of this state.' I "Certainly the Iliad may be read iD the schools without inculcating belief in the Olympic divinities, and the Koran may be read out teaching the Moslem faith. Why may not the Bible also be without indoctrinating children in the creed or dogma of any sect? ontents are largely historical and moral: its language is unequalled jrity and elegance; its style has never been surpassed; among the ics of our literature it stands preeminent. Is It a Sectarian Ilook? "It has been suggested that the English Bible is, in a special and limited sense, a sectarian book. To be sure there are, according to the Catholic claim, vital points of difference with respect to faith and Is between it and the Douay version. In a Pennsylvania case cit d by counsel for respondents the author of the opinion says that h noted over fifty points of difference between the two versions, some of them important and others trivial. These differences constitute the of some of the peculiarities of faith and practice that distinguish Catholicism from protestantism and make the adherents of each a distinct Christian set. But the fact that the King James transla - tion may be used to inculcate sectarian doctrines affords no pres.ump - tion that it will be so used. The law does not forbid the use of the Bible in either version in the public schools; it is not proscribed either by the constitution or the statutes, and the courts hav? no right to declare its use to be unlawful because it is possibl? or probable that those who are privileged to use it will misuse the privilege by attempting to propagate their own peculiar theological or ecclesiastical views and opinions. Where the Courts May Intervene "The point where the courts may rightfully intervene, and where they should intervene without h&lt; is where legitimate has degenerated into abuse; where a teacher employed to give secular instruction has violated the constitution by becoming a sectarian propagandist. That sectarian instruction may be giveD by frequent reading, without note or comment, of judiciously selected passages. Is. of course, obvious. A great modern philosopher — perhaps the | €st— has saiid th &gt; persistent iteration is the most effectivs means of forcing alien conception upon reluctant minds. Whether it is prudent or politic to permit Bible reading in the public schools is a question for the school authorities to determine; but whether the practice of Bible reading has taken the form of sectarian instruction in a particular case is a question for the courts to determine upon eviience. "It cannot be presumed that the law has been violated; the alleged violation must in every instance be established by competent proof. The value of the common schools as disseminators of knowledge and social levelers is well understood and justly appreciated; and there is likelihood that the people will ever permit their usefulness to be impaired by sectarian controversies. Little Discord in Schools "When we consider that th.is is th-3 first care of its kind evr presented to this court for decision, we feel assured that neither </seg>
            <seg id="p634">512 teachers nor school boards have been much inclined to bring discord Into the schools for the chance of securing by indirection a slight sectarian advantage. But, if the fact were otherwise, it could not in any way aff ?ct our conclusion. The section of the constitution which provides that "No sectarian instruction shall be allowed in any school or institution supported, in whole or in part, by public funds set apart for educational purposes, cannot, under any canon of construction with which we are acquainted, b? held to mean that neither the Bible, nor ;&gt;art of it from Genesis to the Revelation, may be r?ad in the educational Institutions fostered by the state. We do not wish to be understood as either countenancing or discountenancing the reading of the Bible in the public schools. Even where it is an irritant element, the question whether Its legitimate use shall be continued or discon - tinued is an administrative and not a judicial question; it belongs to the school authorities, not to the courts." FOWLKR'S ADMINISTRATION" This brings us to th? administration of State Supt. W. K. Fowler (1901-1905). His genius was his untiring hard work, and he possessed that art in a marked degree of inspiring all associated with him to be up and doing. He conducted the most strenuous field work campaign of any man ever elected to this office. He was the first state superintendent to agitate the consolidation of school districts, the cen - tralization of schools, and the transportation of pupils at public exi (During his administration he issued two publications of Special Programs, the first a 12,000 edition of 116 pag s. the second a 10 edition of 160 pages. Of the second publication John Quincy is, secretary of the American Flag House and Betsy Ross Memorial Nation, Philadelphia, wrote that it was the finest publication of al Day Programs ever received at his office. I Another publication of Supt. Fowler deserving special mention his School Buildings and Grounds in Nebraska — a 100 page book, hich 12,000 copies were printed. But Mr. Fowler was not the to Agitate better school buildings and the beautifying of school nds. From the second biennial report of the Commissioner of nos Schools of the territory of Nebraska, 1861, we quote Com - oner W. E. Harvey as follows: I "It is proverbial that the most unsightly feature that usually as a landscape scene, in many parts of the United States, is the ol-house. This remark is of general application, although happily few of the Eastern and Northern States, public taste has improved, a great change for the better has taken place within recent years. eleTs have frequently remarked it, and those of them who came across the seas, have seldom hesitated to point it out to our edit, and to the fostering of foreign prejudice against us. "A rude log-cabin with one door, and (if any) one window two feet square; or, at best a fram? building covered with unpainted and sun-warped clapboards, unplastered and unceiled. is too often the le of learning,' which disfigures an otherwise sightly and pleasant landscape. Standing at the X roads, with no enclosure, or within the remains of a dilapidated fence — the places of a moiety of its window panes filled with old hats, rags, or bits of shingles — the weather-boards fiapping in the wind, — the door dropped from a hinge, — the country </seg>
            <seg id="p635">REPORTS. ADDl: M) PA I 513 Sohool-house is an eye-sore of the scene. One would hardly imagine that so miserable a description could by any possibility be made of a Schoolhouse in Nebraska, because of the assumption that the settlement of the country itself is not yet old enough for ancient buildings. But I have in my mind now, two edifices which present very nearly the appear - ance above indicated; and it is to awaken some taste, to excite some feelings of pride, to prevent as. early as possible any tendency to run into the old carelessness In these matters, that I speak of thes » things in this place." ■ How like this was the crusade urged by State Supt. Fowler nearly a century later: "Very few of the next generation of Xebraskans will have the pleasure of attending school in a Nebraska sod school house. They might go to school in poorer buildings than one built of sod, how for it was as warm in winter and as cool in summer as any ordinary school house, although some of our lady teachers do object to the fleas and vermin that sometimes infest such a building. "Children are always influenced by the school house, its surround - ings and the interior. Our experience has always been that a school that was neat and clean in appearance was doing careful, thorough work, with excellent order prevailing, while a dirty, dingy, disarranged schoolroom was invariably a disorderly, inattentive, careless and sli; school. If the aspect ot the school premises is forbiding. it is ni • prising that the children are reluctant to go to school and are pli to get away again as soon as. they can. There are too many school buildings and grounds in Nebraska whose appearance is apparently designed to encourage truancy. This condition beroni when the improvement of residences outruns the improvement of school houses. Children are quick to notice contrasts and to mak? compar - isons. They will compare their dusty, dirty, ding&gt; -begrimed school hous? with its broken plaster, rusty stove and rough, knot - protruding floors, its broken, rattle-trap desks and dirty windows., with their mothers' clean, neat, tidy kitchens, with their par nts' homes where comforts and conveniences are multiplying, where plate glass windows, cedar trees and other evidences of prosperity and care and forethought attract one's eye as he drives from one school house to another. The appearance and condition of the school house, in which our children spend one-half of their waking hours every school day in the year, should be the equal of the same in our homes." "Section 13 of subdivision 4 of the School Laws mak;s it the duty of the district board to provide the necessary appendages for the school house and to keep the same in good condition and repair during the time school shall be taught. But why let the school house and the school grounds become like a forgotten cemetery during the summer? Mow the grass and weeds.

Fowlfr's administration was his war on t sharks and book agents. This is what he said: K'A chart agent has been roaming the counties west of Lincoln g the past month, not only seeking whom he might devour, but ring all or nearly all of those he saw. The gentleman claims to </seg>

We think mistaken, and his conduct impels, us to make the following decision elf-protection; henceforth, we will refuse to write, dictate, grant, or any testimonials or recommendation whatsoever of any school ts, without regard to their merit, color, or prospect of servitude, — is usefulness." I "Under date of July 29, 1901, I gave the Teachers' Library Union iioago a recommendation, believing that its plan afforded excellent rtunities for teachers to study history, literature, science, etc., in stematic way, and that the Union would do business on businees :iples. Upon statements made by Supt. Ed. C. Bishop of York ty in a letter dated September 23, 1901, that an agent of the hers' Library Union had done some work that appeared crooked iveral respects, frightening teachers into paying notes secured by epresentation, etc., I revoked my endorsement Septembr 25, 1901." But State Supt. Beals in 1870 was vexed by similar troubles, which he described as follows: "Book agents, like birds of prey, hung over every quarter of the state. Some of them have given thousands of volumes to citizens and to the schools, hoping thus to forestall the action of law (th,? uniform tfxt-book law), and prepare the people to be easily prejudiced against it. If it should be that the selection happen not to embrace their 'books. They must suffer disappointment and chagrin if the decision should be against them. The disappointment came. It vented itself in false and shameless charges of corruption against the superintend - ent. The state was flooded with circulars containing these charges. County superintendents and school boards were visited, and were told that the Interests of the schools and of the state had been betrayed; that they had been made into merchandise. To some extent the press of the state, for a short period, was misled by the efforts to prejudice the public mind and lent its powerful aid. The people were called upon to wait — delay could do no harm — to wait until a recommendation -should be mad? by a superintendent who would be chosen at the ballot box. Nothing was left untried that would tend to array the e against th? law and the books selected. Nothing, that would e the people to continue to purchase the books that were sold by these disappointed agents. I In some portions of the state, the people influenced by interested sns, were led to believe all that was reportel, and to reject the s; in some they were led merely to hesitate, to delay making a ge; in others the books that were selected were put into the schools ist as new books were needed; and in some, the whole list, so far Fed in the schools, was purchased at once, and without hesitation the old books were thrown out. Had there been no interference by ts whose sole interest was to get at the people's money, there I 1 have been no difficulty, and there would have been very little y in obtaining uniformity of text-books in all of the public schools." This forces us to refer again to our free text-book law. The M of Superintendent Beals in the administration of a state uniform text-book law should teach us to protest against the re-enact - ment of such a law fraught with so many evils, dangers and temptations. There is no safer way of judging the future than by the past. If Superintendent Beals properly described the problems which confronted him under this law, may heaven save us from such another. While state uniformity would be better than the diversity of text-books as </seg>
            <seg id="p637">515 found under the old system of pupil ownership, when in hundreds of rural schools there were not less than six different series of readers, grammars, arithmetics and geographies for the same grade. Under the existing free text-book law we have district uniformity, or at least grade uniformity, in nearly every public school district throughout the state. This makes gradation possible, and a pupil may go from one district to another without any serious break in his work. Besides, our present free text-book law gives us free and open competition for the best text-books on the market. We are not compelled to use any out-of-date books. Besides, competition is so active as to give us these best books at as cheap a rate as they can be sold anywhere, under similar conditions, in the United States. The selection of text-books rests solely with the district board. We have nearly 20,000 school officers in Nebraska. This is too great a number of men for any text - book company to unduly influence. It relieves the authority selecting the text-books under our present law from the criticism as described by Superintendent Beals when the superintendent alone made the selection, and it is better than a state board as in Kansas. Where one man or a state board makes the selection for an entire state, it will be impossible for a selection of books to be made without the charge of graft. KLet me quote from Dr. A. E. Winship, one of the ablest educators e United States, against state uniformity of text-books. He c ong statement with the^.e pointed paragraphs: B"The one oprn, avowed, uncompromising enemy of the progr» - ational forces in the country is state uniformity, the bar sinister ie educational world. Not one word can be said in its favor by any i nt of educational progress. "It has not one redeeming virtue, not one decent educational apology for its existence. K"The time has come tor the r.chool men along the line from In California, from North Carolina to Texas, to assert them - 'ullv anrt refuse to have their work jeopardized by such criminal e of a great factor in their life. "The time has come to rid the schools of this incubus. At a time when half the states in the union are dethroning the saloons let us be equally heroic and manly and dethrone the enemies of the American child, the scheme for text-book uniformity. Party ties now bind lightly, party power is weak. If ever the schoolmaster is to be emancipated from the politician in this line, it must come now." I It was in Mr. Fowler's first term that he organized several union aal institutes in various sections of the state, which were super - is second term by junior normal schools at Alliance, Holdrege, ook, North Platte and Valentine. The legislature of 1907 increased number of junior normals to eight. The organization and management of the junior normal schools is under the jurisdiction of the state superintendent. t During the past six years th? enrollment of the junior normal ils reached 6,758 teachers. Never did the state do so much good so little money in the professional training of its teachers. Over </seg>
            <seg id="p638">516 1,500 teachers will be enrolled in the eight junior normal schools during the session of 1908. Mr. Fowler was the first state superintendent to agitate normal training in high schools. He had no precedent for this in the educa - tional history of Nebraska, but being a New Yorker by education he naturally turned his eyes to the empire state for something good. He found there that normal training in high schools had been a part of their public school system for nearly three-quarters of of a century, though this idea is still considered by a few good people in Nebraska as an educational fad. The last legislature enacted this idea of Mr. Fowler into law and appropriated $50,000 therefor. If there were any who ever doubted the demand for normal training in the high schools of Nebraska, that doubt must be dispelled in the face of the number of schools that haw qualified and the number of students who have registered for the work. For the school year of 1907-8 the number of high schools approved for normal training under the act of 1907 was sixty-eight, and the number of juniors and seniors who subscribed to the entrance declaration and did the work was 1,200; for the school year 1908-9 eighty-six high schools have been approved and the number of juniors and seniors who have subscribed to the entrance declaration and are now pursuing the work is 1,502. This is a showing far beyond the most sanguine expectations of the friends of the movement. Probably the most enduring monument to the administration of Mr. Fowler was the establishment of the second state normal school, which was located at Kearney. The Dormal school question and the establishment of one or more new state normal schools has been prominently before the public for the ten years preceding. The phenomenal success of this school vindicates Its establishment. It is no exaggeration to say that during all the history of state normal schools the success of the new state normal school at Kearney is unprecedented in America or Europe. Ilt ia due Mr. Fowler to say that during his administration the essional training of teachers was given a greater Impetus than ng all the state's previous history. THE PRESENT ADMINISTRATION tWe have already referred to the certification law of 1905. This added a new department to the office so far as the responsibility volume of work are concerned. Our examining committee is strictly partisan and non-sectarian. I do not hesitate to say that the ency of this committee will equal that of the United States Civil ice Commission. There was nothing new under the sun left for me to do. We have endeavored to build on the foundations laid by our worthy predecessors, and by the united support of the school people of the </seg>
            <seg id="p639">517 latuiv of Nebraska Is of far-reaching importance. Th-e school people of the state are grateful to the members of the legislature, individually and collectively, for their deep personal interest in educational affairs and for their recognition of the needs of the common schools. Special attention is called to the seven great school laws passed by the last legislature which will do more for the public schools — the people's schools — than all school legislation combined since the act establishing public schools in Nebraska. Ten other school bills of considerable importance were enacted into law. The seven great acts are: 1(1) A law providing for a library in every public school district; a free high school law; (3) a law enlarging the scope and in - iing the number of junior normal schools,; (4) a law providing for lal training in high schools; (5) a law providing state aid to weak icts by appropriating $50,000 therefor; (6) a law making the mum entrance requirements to state normal schools a two year school education or its equivalent; (7) a law raising the standard srtiflcation of teachers by private and denominational schools by Iding for a more rigid inspection each year by the state superin - }nt or by the state board of examiners for Mfe certificates. While each of these seven acts is, a hobby with me, were I to select the one which in my opinion will in the long run give the greatest good to the greatest number, it would be the act providing for at least seven months of school each yfar in th&lt;? first eight grades for all the youth of this state whose parents or guardians live in public school districts whose funds are not sufficient to maintain school for at least seven months. The state treasurer, upon a voucher drawn by the state superintendent in accordance with reports furnished him by the county superintendents, shall pay to each district which shall have voted the maximum tax levy authorized by law, such an amount as is necessary to maintain seven months of school with a legally qualified teacher at a salary of not less than thirty dollars a month. No district shall receive aid from the state in any one year in excess of one hundred twenty dollars, which amount shall be applied exclusively to the payment of teachers' wages. (There will be about 1,000 districts in the northern and western ties entitled to aid under this measure. The average &gt; r of pupils in these 1,000 ' districts is about fifteen, ti will mean that about 15,000 boys, and girls will receive at least i months of free school privileges under this law. This makes ssible for all boys and girls in the state to receive at least an h grade education, which means at least two years more than are now receiving. This is not an attempt to build society. It is an attempt by society to build the individual. Such a policy holds that the state is strong in the proportion in which every individual in the state Is free, large, educated, independent. The policy too long pursued may have given us a finer educated upper class, nobler and deeper think- </seg>
            <seg id="p640">518 greater numbers than we would were we to bend our efforts along this new line, but we have educated the top long enough at the expense of the bottom. Let us unite to educate society from the bottom to the top. "We are not attempting to lift the favored classes higher; we are not attempting to give to those that already have; w.e are attemping to put our hands under the foundations of human society and lift everybody up. That is a slower work; but when it is done and its fruits are ripe you will never doubt again which is the wisest acd best policy." In Conclusion Nebraska stands, at the head of all the states in the union with the small -st percentage of illiteracy. During the past ten year educational progress has bten phenomenal. She now spends narly 0,000 annually on her public achool system. The one it?m of salaries paid to women teachers is over $3,000,000 per year. It now requires an army of over 10,000 teachers to instruct her 375,000 children of school age. The total value of her school district property is over $15,000,000. Under the school district plan she has 6,783 school districts. Out of the total numb r of 6,784 public school buildings, 6,215 are frame, 357 brick, 43 stone, 75 log, and 183 sod. The average number of days of school in all districts, is 141, a little over seven months. The opportunities for higher education in Nebraska are unexcelled in any of the other states. At the head of these higher institutions of learning stands the University of Nebraska, with Its world renowned chancellor, Dr. E. Benj. Andrews. The university ha? an enrollment of over 3,000, and ranks with the universities of California. Wisconsin, MinDer.Dtii, and Michigan. There are two state normal school, one at Peru, one at Kearney, with an enrollment at Peru of over 1,500, and over 1,000 at Kearney. Nebraska also has eight junior normal schools (summer normals under the management of the state superintendent of public instruction), with an aggregate enrollment each year of about students. In addition to these state schools, Nebraska has twelve private and denominational schools of such rank as to be authorized by Imw to grairt teachers' certificate? on the basis of the University of Nebraska or on the basis of the state normal schools. These private and denominational schools, a majority of which are of college rank, enroll over 5,000 students, during the year. The aggregate value of the property belonging to these private and denominational schools reaches into the millions. I There are now over 500 public graded schools in Nebraska. Under ree high school law, this means 500 free high schools distributed &gt;nveniently that no farmer boy or farmer girl need b? deprived free public education from the first grade in the humblst rural let to the completion of the senior year in the University of aska. There are over 10,000 high school pupils attending th?ae schools, including both resident and non-resident pupils. At least </seg>
            <seg id="p641">519 5,000 country boys and girls are now taking advantage of the free high school privileges offered under this new law, as passed by the last legislature, which we are confident will stand the test in the court if its constitutionality is ever attacked there. These boys and girls will be under the instruction of over 1,000 trained teachers. It will place at the disposal of the state over $3,000,000 for school buildings, grounds, apparatus, books and libraries, for the education of this great army of young people in the higher duties of American citizenship. Reading Circle Work. KThe most reliable information that we have found relative to the ry of reading circle work in Nebraska is the following article by P. W. Grins.tead of Norfolk, and published in the July, 1890, i western Journal of Education: "In the spring of 1885 State Supt. W. W. W. Jones issued a circular announcing the intention of the state department to establish 'a system of culture and general education that brings to the home of every individual many of the advantages, to be obtained by direct instruction within the walls of a university.' This circular proposed to organize the teachers of the state under the direction of a board of five directors. Accordingly, postal cards on which were printed the names of several leading educators of the state were sent out, and receiving them were 'requested to select five names from the list, crossing out all others,' and return the card to the state superintendent. 'A large number of teachers responded to the call and elected the following persons as members of the Board of Control: \V. \V. W. Jones, Geo. E. Howard, H. S. Bowers, H. M. James, and Miss Anna I "On August "th the board met and organized by electing Supt. W. W. Jones president, and Prof. George E. Howard secretary and surer. 1"The board then issued a circular giving the plan of organization course of study. The course announced the first year's reading r the following topics: 1. Professional; 2. History; 3. Science; ;neral Literature. K "Later a second year's course was announced, and during the "85, '86 ar.d '87 much progress was made in the work; but there seemed to come over the teachers, for some cause, a spirit kewarmness — indifference; and the organization ceased to exist, ne knows just why, when, nor how. "At the last State Teachers' Association, held at Lincoln, in March, 1890, an effort was made to organize- a new reading circle. The association elected a new board of six directors, consisting of Supt. Maria Upson, Supt. E. E. Thompson. Mrs. Edwards, Lincoln. PTof. W. E. Taylor, Prof. W. E. Andrews and P. W. Grinstead. The board organized at once by electing P. W. Grins'tead president, and W. E. Andrews secretary and manager. </seg>
            <seg id="p642">520 I "It was found that there was about $55.00 in the hands of the surer of the state association belonging to the old reading circle, board asked for and received this amount to be used in organizing new circle. 1"The board can, at this time, only report satisfactory progress, expect to issue a circular to the county institutes, next month, uncing a complete organization, course of study, etc. "The aim of the board is to make the first year's course light, and specially adapted to the needs, of country teachers. County superintend - ents are requested to take hold of this work and assist in making the Nebraska Teachers' Reading Circle a great factor in promoting pro - fessional and general culture among the teachers of the state " ADVANTAGES OF READING CIRCLE WORK. The advantages to be secured from the reading circle work were recognised by its early promoters. No one has yet set forth in an abler manner these advantages than Prof. W. E. Taylor of Peru, whose paper on this subject wae also published in the July, 1890, North - western Journal of Education: "The advantages to be secured from the Reading Circle are: "1. Mutual Improvement. — Our teachers are derived from three sources; (a) colleges, and universities, (b) normal and training schools, (c) public and private schools. The first class, as a rule, lack pro - fessional training, the second scholarship and hence culture, the third often professional training and culture. By bringing these classes together mutual improvement is bound to follow. "2. Mutual Understanding. — There Is always more or less mis - understand in our educational work. Teachers from different state and Eoctfons of the United States have various views and opinions. There is a tendency on the part of the college graduate to regard the normal school graduate as shallow and narrow and on the other hand the normal school graduate often speaks sneeringly of the lack of training on the part of the college graduate. A closer acquaintance would had to a mutual understanding. "3. State Organization. — No other work so closely unites the teaching forces of the state as a thoroughly organized and well directed reading circle. The mere fact that he is a member of an organization with a definite plan and purpose is a great stimulus to the teacher. t'4. A Definite Plan and Purpose. — The course of reading will be ged with a definite plan and purpose in view. The culture of the ?r does not depend so much upon the quantity as the quality, the at his. reading. Too many of our teachers read any and every which conies in their way. All reading should be with definite and purposes. 5. Instruction. — In an organization such as we have in the. Reading Circle, definite instruction with explanations, printed or other - wise, may be given, as requested, by competent and experienced </seg>

            <seg id="p645">521 (readings may be suggested tor collateral reading, etc. Our young h«rs need aid both as to how to read and what to read. To think most teachers, do not read is a mistake. There are more teachers read too much than not enough. "Th;re is much reading done he American people, but the difficulty is that it is scattered and wseless. If all the reading could be dlreoted to some well-defined, ! end, the amount of good done by it would be vastly increased.' — Edwards.) »"6. Aids to County Superintendent. — The Reading Circle strength - the superintendent in his effort to secure systematic rending on part of his. teachers and thus enables him to give due credit for ing. Our county superintendents can do more for the circle than other class of workers. I "7. Pupil's Reading Circle. — The most Important advantage to secured from the circle ia that children are provided for by the inization of the Pupils' Reading Circle. Everyone will readily the pleasure and profit to be derived from this department. I "8. General Culture. — The aim of the reading circle is to cultivate ste for good reading on the part of the teachers and pupils of the le state. In thia way it is hoped to raise the grade of professional ding and culture, more closely organize the teaching profession, thus enable our teachers to better prepare pupils for citizenship, better indication of progresa even than thie improvement and easing number of educational journals, is the formation of Teachers' ding Circles. More may be confidently expected from these circles i from any other educational movement ever started.' — Col. Parker. PUPILS' READING CIRCLE WORK. KThe Pupils' Reading Circle work was, maintained for several i but finally merged into the work of the Reading Circle Board sr, who continue the work by recommending each year lists of 3 for school libraries.

From the organization of the Reading Circle Work in 1890 until 1900, credits for reading circle work consisted in the granting of certificates and diplomas. In 1900-1901 this credit took on a more sub - stantial form, when the Reading Circle Board, of which the state superintendent is a member ex-offlcio, recommended that county superintendents give a credit of one per cent on the general average earned by teachers, in the examination for county certificate for each book of the reading circle course which had been carefully read, or three p«r cent for all three books. tin 1901-1902 the board recommended that a credit of one and one - per cent be added to the general average for each book of the te carefully read, or three per cent for the two books. This mt of credit was recommended by each successive board until 1905 - , when the amount of credit was increased to two per cent on the pal average for each book read, or five per cent for careful work e three books of the course. The new certification law, which went into effect in 1905, contains the following provision relative to the renewal of county certificates for the pursuance of and completion of the reading circle work: "First and second grade county certificates may be renewed, without </seg>
            <seg id="p649">525 examination, at the discretion of the county superintendent, under such requirements as may be imposed by the state superintendent of public Instruction for the pursuance of and completion of reading circle work, and attendance at teachers' associations and the county Institute." — Sec. 12, Subd. 9a. Under the above provision of law, the state superintendent made the following rules for the granting of reading circle credits. "Suoh academic and professional credit will be added from year to year to grades earned on examination as are recommended by the Nebraska Teachers' Reading Circle Board. The county superintendent of the proper county shall, between June 1 and August 1 of each year, certify these additional grades to the state superintendent who will add them to the grades, already recorded in his office. The work on which these credits are given is entirely under the supervision of the county super - intendent." I "An applicant passing "With Credit" or "With Honor," doing the lred amount of reading circle work, and meeting the require - :s of the county superintendent in attendance at institute and ty associations will be entitled to a new certificate without examina- The holder of such certificate will register for the examination ig the regular fee of $1.50, and will receive a new examination ber. On this new examination number the county superintendent certify to the state superintendent all reading circle grades earned tie candidate and not already certified to the state superintendent, county superintendent will then fill out for the candidate a new floate. This, makes "With Credit" and "With Honor" county floates practically good for life. In, 1906-1907, under the provisions of the new certification law and the rules of the state superintendent, a grade of five per cent was added to the academic grade earned on an examination in theory and art for satisfactory work done during the school year in White's Kl m;nts of Pedagogy or Putnam's Psychology; and like credit of five per cent for satisfactory work in Sherman and Reed's Essentials of Teaching Reading. These were the books of the reading circle course for that year. Teachers were also permitted to earn a credit in psychology toward a life certificate by doing satisfactory work hi Putnam's Psychology in three tests sent out by the state superin - tendent. tin 1907-1908 like credits of five per cent on th^ academic grade id in theory and art and agriculture were given for satisfactory In the reading circle books of the course — White's School Manage - and Kern's Among Country Schools. The state superintendent offered teachers an opportunity for earning credits toward a life icate in psychology and physical geography on written tests, similar to the pliin of the previous year. For 1908-1909 It Is recommended that teachers be granted an additional credit of five per cent in grammar and five per cent in English </seg>

HISTORY OF LIBRARY DAY IX XKIiRASKA Et the Saundcrs county teachers' institute, held at Wahoo, Ne - , August, 1892, Principal Trenmor Cone of Cedar Bluffs intro - the following resolution, which was adopted by more than one d teachers without a dissenting voice: "I move that the county teachers' association endorse to the fullest extent Library Day, and exert efforts to have a resolution passed by the state association to establish October 21st as Library Day." A ©ommittee consisting of County Superintendent Watson, Super - intendents and Principals Bradbury, Crabtree, Paleshka, Mengel and Cone was appointed in this interest. The exercises in the schools of that county that year were mainly Columbus Day programs, with a few or no modifications., and were chiefly given in the evening, especially In the rural districts. The success of the work was greater than anticipated. So interested became teachers, children and patrons that over sixty libraries were founded or enlarged in the 113 public school districts of Saunders county alone. KThe North-Western Journal of Education, December, 1892, oon - d the following editorial in favor of Library Day by Prof. J. H. K'The friends of education have been working for years for a general recognition of the necessity of school and general libraries, journal has advocated 'in season and out of season' the public 1 library supported by taxation, controlled by the board of edu - i and open to every man, woman and child in the community, communities in Nebraska have taken up this plan, and in a few it will become more general. "Two years ago State Supt. Wolfe, of Missouri, named a day as 'Library Day.' He urged that every school in that state add to its library or start a. library by an entertainment, by contributions of money or books, or both. Now comes Principal Trenmore Cone, of Cedar Bluffs, Nebraska, with the patriotic plan of having a National Library Day which he proposes sjiould be on Columbus Day — October 21st. Cer - tainly there is no more fitting way to keep this day in a proper manner. The work of Columbus, whether he so willed or not, was the first blow to the exclusiveness of learning. Why can we not perpetuate hia memory and the memory of his work by observing this day, October 2 1st, as a National Library Day. This subject will be discussed at the State Association." RTh,e Nebraska State Teachers' Association, at its 27th annual meet - , December 29, 1892, unanimously endorsed the Saunders. county </seg>
            <seg id="p651">527 teachers' resolution establishing October 21st as Library Day, and recom - mended thait each year the Friday nearest said date be observed throughout the public schools of the state as Library Day. The Ident of the association, Supt. J. L. McBrien of Johnson county, appointed the following committee on Library Day: Principal Trenmor Cone, Cedar Bluffs; Chancellor James H. Can - fleld. University of Nebraska; State Superintendent A. K. Goudy, Lin - coln; Superintendents F. A. Fitzpatrick, Omaha; H. R. Corbett, York; T. H. Bradbury, Wahoo; Miss E. O. Clark, Fremont. ■This committee recommended that the day be observed in every )1 district and an effort made to accomplish the following results: 1st. — Get the people awake to the fact that it is the educated man — the well-read man, that leads the day. 12nd. — When this is clearly established in the minds of young and women, at the close of corn gathering, fruit preserving, and •al preparation for winter, they will be found coming into the ilroom. 3rd. — Establish a library, the poor man's university, in every school house in Nebraska. K4th. — By means of this library and through its influence raise the ral intelligence and the social and moral standard of every lunity. KThe following strong editorial in the interest of school libraries rof. J. H. Miller is taken from the May, 1893, North-Western nal of Education: "A library should be considered as much of a necessity to every district, every village, every city, as the school itself. The board of education is the most natural custodian of the library. No reason can exist for a school that does not hold for the establishment and maintenance of a public library for the whole people of the community, large or small. Every school meeting that makes a levy for funds to support the school, pay the teacher, etc., should make a levy for library purposes. A LEVY OF ONE MILL FOR LIBRARY PURPOSES WOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO BUILD UP A GOOD PUBLIC LIBRARY IN A VERY FEW YEARS. I "A committee was appointed at the last Nebraska Teachers' Associ - i to select ia list of books suitable for PUBLIC SCHOOL libraries, committee will probably report sometime before September. Ar - e-ments can probably be made with some extensive bookseller In aska. or elsewhere, to keep these books in stock and sell to ds at the prices secured from the publishers. This, is the plan wed in Missouri and Minnesota. I "We have been writing on this subject for several year?, and we ose to keep on writing about it until every school house has, a Every village, town, and city in the Northwest should support blic library — maintained by the board of education by public taxa- This library should be for the children, for the patrons, for all citizens and residents of that community.

It is a mistake to buy one copy of certain good (books and have them carried about from building to building. I "There is no reason why good public school libraries,, supported controlled by the school boards, should not be supported in such 9 and towns as Beatrice, Hastings, Grand Island, Fairbury. York, ird, Fremont, and others In Nebraska, and such thriving Colorado i as Fort Collins, Greeley, Durango, Aspen, Canon City and others. y city, every town, every district should have its library. Let teachers and principals bring it before the people. Talk it up at ol and everywhere." B September 19, 1893, State Superintendent A. K. Goudy issued the ring circular to superintendents and teachers of Nebraska relative brary Day: K'ln accordance with a resolution of the Nebraska State Teachers' iation passed at its last annual meeting, a program has been pre - by the committee appointed for that purpose, looking to the mnce of the anniversary of the discovery of America as library i the schools of the state. '"It will be remembered that October 21st was celebrated all over the country last year as Columbus Day. It is the thought of the pro - moters of Library Day that it would be well if Columibus Day could be perpetuated as an «nnual festival for awakening interest in the schools, and especially for the building up of school libraries in every district ir. Nebraska. Elt Is well known that books of special interest and profit to •n are do less interesting and profitable to adults, and that the of the children are read with avidity by the teachers and by the s of the children. I "Good books put into the school library soon find their way to the Bs in the district; they are read by both the school children and home children; a habit of reading la thereby encouraged or ndered, and the good reading takes the place of no reading or of reading in the community. "This movement has received the hearty endorsement of Francis Bellamy, of the Youths' Companion; of Dr. E. C. Hewitt, ex-president of the Illinois State Normal University, and of others of national repute, as well as. the approbation of the educational workers generally through - out our own state. "In accordance with the recommendation of the committee it gives me pleasure to call the attention of the teachers and patrons of the schools to this matter, and to recommend that Friday, October 20th, or so much thereof as may be deemed expedient, be devoted to the per - formance of this program, and to efforts to arouse an Interest in the subject of school libraries among the children and patrons. ■ "I especially recommend that an effort be made in connection with celebration to create a fund, be it ever so small, for the purchase ►oks for the school that may serve as a nucleus, for a school library. "Trusting in your well-known custom of heartily responding to every call of this department and recalling your uniform co-operation with Its chief in every educational work, I have no hesitancy in leaving this matter in your hands." BThe October, 1893, North-Western Journal of Education apoke as we relative to Library Day tar that year: "One question that confronts teachers is that of how to raise money. The first step should be taken by the school board in appro - priating not less, than $5 and as much more as the funds will allow.

A small lee should be charged and then a collection should also be taken to accommodate those who desire to contribute more then the admittance fee. It might be well to circulate a subscription paper a few days before Library Day. Then let it be known that you will receive books as donations. This is the last aDd worst way to build up a library. Pew people care to give away good books, and the school library does, not want any questionable books. All donated books should be received wKh the understanding that they are to be examined by the county or city superintendent before they will be permanently rcorded as the property of the library. Many books are useful to adults that are not useful to a child. Many books are useful for a private library that are not fit for a public library as this is to be. Then with the money make your selections carefully. Do not be influenced by some specialist and use up your money for books to Interest him. Buy the best books, the product of noble minds. Do not buy cheaply printed and bound books." tSupt. A. K. Goudy in his report covering the biennium ending mber 31, 1894, recommended that "public libraries be established I school districts where it is practicable for the use of pupils and &gt;ns. The habit of reading good literature is of the highest cult - value." In a further discussion in behalf of school libraries, rintendent Goudy said: B Nebraska has for two years past devoted one day in each year I consideration of school libraries and has celebrated the day by priate exercises and by a presentation, in the. schools, of the bility of libraries and in devising means for securing small les. In several counties much has been done already in the establishing of libraries in the various school districts. With books so cheap, with provisions made dn connection with our school text-book law, for taking care of books belonging to the district, and with a general sentiment constantly growing in favor of literary culture, the step is a short one to the legal provision for a district library in every school district in the state. Between 6,000 and 7,000 libraries, within the reach of the pupils in the schools and by them carried into their homes would be a fact to thrill the heart of every intelligent person in the state in contemplation of its possibilities. Already our people aiv seriously considering this, problem; indeed, one member-elect of the coming legislature, the Hon. Patrick Barry, of Greeley county, has been for some time in correspondence with this department on the subject. and will doubtless introduce a bill, and press its passage, providing for the establishment and maintenance of school libraries by the district authorities." I Every state superintendent since Mr. Goudy has emphasized the rtance of Library Day, and through the observations of this day year in the public schools of the state thousands of volumes have added to the sohool libraries, but it was, left for the Hon. Trenmor , who, first, as a school man, took the initiative for the observance lis day, and, second, as a legislator in the 30th session of the ilature of Nebraska, secured the enactment of the folowing com - iry library law — both of which will stand as an enduring monument e progressive spirit of Mr. Cone. </seg>

We snail hare to make war on fake agents who will endeavor to sell cheap and unsuitable books at enormous prices. Therefore we suggest that you ask the county superintendent or write the leading book companies for lists of books with prices attached for $5, $10, $15. $20, and $25 libraries approved by our Reading Circle Board and the Nebraska Public Library Commission. Write Miss Charlotte Templeton, secre - tary of the commission, State House, Lincoln, for her List of Books for School Libraries.

KThe books are made up into $5, $10, and $15 libraries. Each ry will be sent to any railroad express office in the state, transpor - 1 prepaid. Sectional book-cases may be purchased of the nearest ture dealer for a few dollars. A LIBRARY IN EVERY SCHOOL We urge upon teachers and school officers the importance of a school library in every district in the state. Be careful in the selec - tion of books. None but the b?st books should be placed in the school library. Select with reference to the understanding of the pupils who are to read them. Let us begin a campaign for the establishment of at least a five dollar library in every country school in Nebraska. Observe the Friday nearest October 21 as Library Day, and make it the greatest day for libraries in the history of the public schools of Nebraska. Here Is an opportunity to do good for the country children worthy the best efforts of teachers, county superintendents, and school officers. A library being among the necessary school supplies, it was held by State Superintendent Fowler that books for libraries may be purchased out of school district money the same as any other books. This ruling still stands. Teachers may secure lists of books by addressing their county super - lw&gt;—rtrntr or the 'leading book companies. Books will be sent in a single parcel, transportation prepaid by the publishers, to any teacher or school officer in Nebraska on receipt of the money for the books offered. A $5 library, a $10 library, or a $25 library may be secured according to the funds at command. For "A Graded List of Books for School Libraries," or for information relative to a free library, write Miss Charlotte Templeton, secretary of the Nebraska Public Library Commission, Lincoln, Nebraka. We wish to caution every school district against purchasing any books whatsoever from traveling agents. Many school districts in </seg>

Then you must illy pay such ageDt at least two prices and oftentimes four prices hie books, which as a rule are not suited to the average rural ol district. The actual expenses and profit of the traveling agent secure for any district a good library by dealing direct with itable publishing houses. Do not fail to inspire in your pupils a love for good books. Teaoh them to try to frequent the company of their Detters in books as well as in associates. Teach them to note what great men admired by having them read the master thoughts of the master minds. The Influence of Books. ■ A good book is the precious life-blood of a master-spirit, embalmed treasure up on purpose to a life beyond life. — Milton. The true university of these days is a collection of books, — Carlyle. I The influence of books upon man is remarkable; they make the You may judge a man more truly by the books and papers be reads than by the company which he keeps, for his associates iften, in a manner, imposed upon him; but his reading is the result lolce, and a man who chooses a certain class of books and papers nsciously becomes more colored in their views, more rooted in opinions,, and the mind becomes fettered t&lt;&gt; their views. All the life and feeling of a young girl is fascinated by some flowing love romance, is colored and shaped by the page she reads. If it be false, weak, and foolish, she will be false, and weak, and foolish, too; if it be true, and tender, and inspiring, then something of its truth, and tenderness, and inspiration will grow into her soul and become a part of her very self. The boy who reads deeds of manliness, of bravery, and noble daring, feels the spirit of emulation grow within him, and the seed is planted which will bring forth fruit of heroic endeavor and exalted life. — Royal Path of Life. &amp;{ebra.ska. 'Public Library Commission. In 1901 a bill was passed by the legislature, through the efforts, of the teachers, librarians and club women of Nebraska, creating a Public Library Commission to foster the library interests of the state. The Commission consists of the chancellor of the State Uni - versity, the librarian of the State University, the state superintendent of public Instruction, and one member appointed by the governor for a term of five years. This insures a board which is out of politics, is fairly permanent, and composed of men who have the educational interests of the state much at heart. The commission appoints a secretary to carry on the active work. The first person chosen for the position was Miss Edna Bullock, who served for five years, and on her _„,: nnotlAn In In 1 OHfi Vf Ice f~*Yt a t*1*~» t t a Tp m niA^nn lira a a nnnint^/i rvrol£UallUH 1U 1 14 I 3vu, .»! loo vsiltt J lUHC A (r ill p 1 trlULl W Bo tt|ipuiu ICU- </seg>
            <seg id="p660">534 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT The work of the Commission falls Into three lines; circulating books for general reading in communities without public libraries, K lying special students with material on their subjects, and aiding e establishment and administration of libraries of all kinds, school, utional, and public. To accomplish the first of these objects, it has a system of travel - ing libraries. These are groups of about 40 volumes., made up to suit the needs of the average community and consisting of fiction, non - flction, and children's books. They are sent out to any community desiring them and are kept for three months or longer and are then exchanged for a fresh set. There is no fee for their use but the borrower pays the transportation charges. The Commission now has 113 of these libraries and they hau? been out in the past two years 430 times. The special loan department came in answer to an Insistent demand for it. Since there are practically no reference libraries outside of Lincoln and Omaha, students in search of material began to write to the Commission. What they could not supply from their own shelves they have bren able to borrow from the other libraries of Lincoln and have almost never had to refuse a request. Teachers, club women, high school debaters, students of all sorts make these demands, and in answer to them the Commission has sent out in the past two years over 2,600 volumes to 400 different places. I All of the Commission's other activities come under the third head, b assisting of librariss. To encourage the establishing of libraries, •let in their organization, to devise the best plan of their admin - tion, to instruct their librarians, to help in the selection of their s, to talk over with architects library building plans, these ara of the duties which fall to the Commission, increasing every day le library movsment gains ground in Nrbraska. I The Commirsion has co-operated in every way possible with the c schools. The founding of school libraries has been encouraged; las been given in book selection; talks have been given by the tary at teachers' institutes and junior normals; definite instruction oeen given in several Institutes along these lines, and book lists been compiled to aid the teacher in her work. Many of the ling libraries have been sent to rural schools, often proving an itive to the school to start a library of its own. State aid for public libraries is a new development in the library field. Nebraska was one of the earliest states to establish a com - mission to look after its library interests, and though its support has always been inadequate, and it has. fallen behind its neighboring states on this, account, still a great deal has been accomplished; the ground has been broken, the seed has been sown, and we are now ready for a </seg>

            <seg id="p663">535 History of Nebraska Schoolmasters' Club, Editor Geo. L. Towne, Nelbraska Teacher. The Nebraska Schoolmasters' Club is one of the many organiza - tions, which strive to promote the interests of the public schools in this state. It was organized ' ?n ,&gt;«:&lt;.. 3 ago by a number of prominent school men of the state who believed that there should be an organ - ization, partly of a social nature and largely of a professional nature, to carefully consider school principles of current interest and of large importance. It has always been the view of the members of the Schoolmasters' Club that its mission was not to take a definite hand in shaping policies in th&gt;; school affairs of thie eitate; but that it should rather seek to thresh out and clear up by full discussion any subject that might be considered of enough importance to deserve consideration at the hands, of the club. In other words the School - masters' Club never puts itself on record with resolutions or votes. Its platform is a free forum where every member can foe heard and where every member is. expected to present his views upon the subject before the club. And usually whsn a subject has been presented and has passed the gauntlet of an evening's disecussjon the club finds itself fairly well agreed as to the general policy which should be pursued, although the members undoubtedly differ upon the details of many problems. When the Schoolmasters' Club was organized in 1S98 it had upon its roll the following names of men prominent in the school affairs of this state: Dr. J. A. Beattie, President of the State Normal School of Peru, Dr. Charles E. Bessey, of the University of Nebraska, J. W. Crabtree, Inspector of High Schools, J. W. Dinsmore, Superin - tendent of Schools at Beatrice, Prof. A. Ross Hill of the University of Nebraska. State Superintendent W. R. Jackson, Prof. G. W. A. Luckey of the University of Nebraska, Pres. George E. MacLean of the University of Nebraska, J. H. Miller, Editor of the North-Western Monthly, Carroll G. Pearse, Superintendent of Schools at Omaha, Pres. D. B. Perry of Doane College, Supt. A. A. Reed of Crete, Supt. J. P. Saylor of Lincoln, Dr. L. A. Sherman, University of Nebraska, Dr. H. E. Ward of the University of Nebraska and Prin. A. H. Waterhouae of the Lincoln High School. KMany of these men are still prominent as educators in this state, ;h a number have been called upon to take important and nsible positions in the school world outside of Nebraska. Dr. J. A. Beattie is one of the pioneers in education in the west. He has held many very important positions. Since the organization of the club, he has left Nebraska and has again returned. During bis absence from the state he was president of the State Normal School of Oregon for several years and in that position helped to organize and crystallize the work of th? training of teachers in the coast state. Prom there he went to the presidency of his Alma Mater, Hiram College, Ohio. This, is the famous school over which President </seg>
            <seg id="p664">536 Ed at one time presided. From this position he returned to ka to become vice-president and Professor of Education In University. Dr. Charles E. Bes&amp;ey is often epoken of as dean of the edu - cational corps of Nebraska. He is a man known the world over for his scholarly attainments and for hie great work along the lines of hi* «hoaen subject — botany. He has always kept himself thoroughly in touch with the public school Interests and is universally loved and respected by public school men and women. He is an author of con - siderable renown, having published a number of text-books in botany and having contributed to scientific journals and to many other prom - inent magazines. Dr. Bessey has chosen always to remain a great botanist rather than to accept any of the many opportunities to be the executive head of the University of Nebraska, though he has, several times consented to take upon himself the duties of acting chancellor. When the club was organized J. W. Crabtree wae inspector of liigh schools for the University. He continued in that position with marked influence upon the high school courses of study and high school policies for several years. He then became president of the State Normal School at Peru, which position he still occupies. Mr. Crabtree has come to hold a commanding place in the educational councils of the state. He is known wherever teachers, gather and his judgment is sought and accepted by school teachers and school officers constantly. No one man has had more real and more lasting influence, ami his counsel and advice has always 'been wisely and hon - estly given. He has been an inspiration to many a young teacher and a wise guide to many a young principal. J. W. Dinsmore wae the popular and ambitious superintendent of schools at Eeatrice when this, club was founded. He remained in that position for several years with marked influence upon its school policies and with weight in the councils of the school men of the state. Hia ability and aptitude for a great work in a southern state was recognized by the authorities of Berea College, Kentucky, and he was Induced to accept a position at the head of the Normal Depart - ment of that institution. In this position Professor Dinsmore has had a most wonderful experience. He has traveled through every part of the mountain regions of Kentucky. He has come in contact with the mountain people in their homes and has inspired great numbers of their young people to continue their education, and many of them to prepare to go back to their mountain community to help work out the serious educational problem which is theirs. Professor Dinsmore is still at Berea continuing hia work in the institutes of that state during the summer months and continuing his work as professor of education and dean of the Normal Department at the institution during the college year. A. Ross Hill was the popular and most successful professor of </seg>
            <seg id="p665">537 the Schoolmasters' Club. He was known then as, a man of great promise and since that time that promise has been abundantly fulfilled. From Nebraska he was called to Missouri to establish and organize * teachers' college in the university of that state. This work he did remarkably well, so well in fact that the old conservative Cornell University noted his work and finally induced him to come there as Dean of the Department of Education with the problem of organizing and establishing a college similar to that of Missouri and like that of the teachers' colleges at Columbia and Chicago. Dr. Hill was not per - mitted to remain long in New York, however. He had made so great an impression and had done so strong and important a work in Missouri that when the presidency of the University of Missouri was vacated by Dr. Jessee, Dr. Hill was immediately offered and finally accepted that position. He has just begun his duties as president of the university of Missouri and doubtless will leave his impress upon the school system of a wealthy and great state. W. R. Jackson was State Superintendent of Public Instruction. He occupied that position for a traditional four years, and when he completed his work there he took up a course of study at the University of Nebraska, taking his degree from that institution soon after. His services were immediately sought by the trustees of Wesleyan Uni - versity to establish at that institution a department of education, which has grown into a teachers' college where hundreds of teachers of the schools of Nebraska are trained each year. Mr. Jackson has an Important place in the councils of the educators of this state and as dean of the teachers' college at Wesleyan University wields an important influence. tDr. G. W. A. Luckey was professor of pedagogy in the University ebraska ten years ago. Dr. Luckey had come to Nebraska from ornia, having occupied in that state an important position in the ?rsity at Berkley. He has instructed and inspired a large number le influential young teachers in this state, as great numbers of ■ who have reached prominence have taken training in his classes, .uokey has been advanced several times in his work at the university now he has reached the position of head professor of education le newly established teachers' college in that institution. Dr. George E. McLean was the chancellor of the University of Nebraska. Dr. McLean came from the University of Minnesota where for many years he was professor of English Literature. He followed in Nebraska the very popular administration of Chancellor J. H. Can - fleld and maintained for the university during his administration its, commanding place as the head of the public school system of the state. He remained in Nebraska but four years, when he was invited to the University of Iowa, where he accepted the presidency and where he •till continues to do a most important work, guiding the policies of a state university in one of the wealthiest and most progressive states In the union. </seg>
            <seg id="p666">538 J. H. Miller was the editor and publisher of the North Western Monthly, which was at that time the state educational journal of Nebraska. Mr. Miller had been an important factor in Nebraska educational circle* for ten years. He came from the sister state of Kansas where he had been president of a normal school. After help- Ing to establish the Schoolmasters' Club, however, he remained in this atate only a short time, when he acccepted a call to the presidency of the SUtte Normal School at Cheney, Washington. Mr. Miller re - mained in Washington only a couple of years and from there he re - turned to Kansas where he accepted and still holds a position well suited to his genius — the superintendency of Farmers' Institutes for the State Agricultural School of Kansas at Manhattan. Carroll G. Pearse had already attained prominence as a public school superintendent when he became one of the little party to form the Schoolmasters' Club. He had risen from the position of a teacher In the rural schools of Saline county, going in easy stages from that position to the princlpalship of schools at Wilber, then a village; from there to the superintendency of the schools at Crete; thence to Beatrice and then to Omaha. Mr. Pearse was a force in Nebraska educational affairs and was also an important and leading member of the School - masters' Club at Its founding. He remained at Omaha in charge of Its schools for several years and left a very decided impress upon the system. In 1904 when the superintendency of schools, at Milwaukee became vacant be was selected to fill that position. In that city he has had a great work to do in organizing and reorganizing the school system of a metropolitan city. He has met many hard problems, he has gone through many hard contests, but his commanding personality and wonderful energy and foresight have always brought success to his daring undertakings. Pres. D. B. Perry of Doane College is one of the few men in the list of founders of the Schoolmasters' Club who still holds the same position. Dr. Perry has been for many years a conservative, wise - leader of the destinies of one Nebraska's most important denomina - tional colleges. He haa been building slowly, as was necessary with the scanty means at the disposal of a denominational institution, but he has builded soundly and well until Doane College has reached its present position of importance and influence, caring for a large number of earnest students each year and providing for them instruction of a high order, and gaining for the institution a solid foundation in buildings, equipment and endowment. A. A. Reed, then known as Major Reed because of his interest and enthusiasm for the Nebraska National Guard, was superintendent of schools at Crete. He had at that time achieved considerable prominence among school men because of his suggestions and great interest in the teaching of English and reading. Mr. Reed continued his work at Crete for several years until he was sought out and' </seg>
            <seg id="p667">539 Iowa. He remained in this position for several years, but could not be permanently kept away from his native state. Us came back to Nebraska to take charge of the schools at Superior. In that 'position he continued his, interest in the important subject of reading and worked out in connection with his own schools many of the problems which were later incorporated in an unusually successful book of which he is one of the joint authors, the "Essentials of Teaching Reading." His good record, his substantial work at Superior and the undoubted excellence of his work in instruction and on his book in behalf of the better teaching of reading made him the logical man for the University to select for the inspectorship of high schools. This position Mr. Reed still holds and in it he continues to carry out the consistent policy of the University for upbuilding and strengthening the high schools of rhe state. J. F. Saylor Id the time of the founding of the Schoolmasters' Club was superintendent of the city schools at Lincoln. He had held an Important place In educational circles in Nebraska for many years, com - ing to the superintendency at Lincoln from th? Lincoln Normal Univer - sity, whose buildings and equipment wers entirely destroyed in the disas - trous fire which ruined that institution many years ago. Mr. Saylor remained at Lincoln for only a short time when he was offered and accepted the position of superintendent of schools in the rising young city of Spokane, Washington. He spent a number of years, in that city turning a small school into a system fitted to the needs of what became while he was still there a great city system. In Spokane Mr. Saylor finally was enticed away from setoool work by the allurements of business, and is now connected with an important mining enterprise on the western coast. Dr. L. A. Sherman was then, as now, head professor of English Literature in the University of Nebraska. His work in vitalizing the teaching of English in colleges and high schools, had given him at that time a strong hold upon the affections of the public school people, and many of them wer? making the effort to apply the principles worked out by him to conditions in the high school and also in the grades. During the ten years that have followed Dr. Sherman has com to promote the interest In the study of English and English Literature. He Is the author of several widely known and widely used te^t books. At the University in addition to his work as head professor of English Literature he is dean of the graduate school. I Dr. H. B. Ward was a rather new man in this state ten years ago, his enthusiasm and energy had made a place for him, not only at the university but among the public school people, and he was one he number who gathered themselves together to form the School - ters.' Club. At that time he was professor of zoology at the Unlver - of Nebraska, which position he still holds and in addition is dean of Medical College. The development of this college as a department he university is largely due to his effort and initiative, and the M </seg>
            <seg id="p668">540 ■pment and organization of the two year course in Lincoln is entirely to his efforts. A. H. Waterhouse conies last in the list as he would were he a candidate for public office under the new primary system. At the time of the organization of the Schoolmasters' Club Mr. Waterhouse was principal of the High School at Lincoln. It was in this position that be established his great reputation for tharougness of organization «nd mastery of detail. It was here that he revolutionized a high school that was very thoroughly disorganized, placed it upon a working basis, and gave It rank as one of the beet disciplined and beet working high schools In the state. It was because of his work here that Mr. Waterhouse was called upon to repeat the task at Omaha, where he became principal of the high school the very next year. In this posi - tion Mr. Waterhouse made a national reputation. His high school was known all over the country for its thorough good discipline, for the genuine and loyal spirit of its teachers and its students and for its ability to turn out young men and women, not only well grounded la subject matter, but equally well grounded in the basic principles which make strong characters and good citizens.. Before going into high school work, Mr. Waterhouse had been a city superintendent and he has again returned to that line of work. He is now superintendent of schools at Fremont and has the distinction of drawing the largest salary paid to any superintendent of the state, outside of Omaha, Lincoln and South Omaha. Since the club was organized its membership has grown consid - erably. Its first rules limited the membership to twenty-five. This limit has been increased to one hundred. During the decade a number of names of men, now holding prominent positions in other states have on the roll of the club. Among these might be mentioned Profes - sor D. R. Majors, who was at one time professor of pedagogy in the University of Nebraska and who now holds a professorship in the • rsity of Ohio; W. M. Kern, who was at one time superintendent of schools at Columbus, Nebraska, and who is now president of the State Normal and Manual Training School at Ellendale. North Dakota; Prof. W. R. Hart,, who was at one time professor in the State Normal School at Peru who is now professor of agriculture in Amhersl ne; D. C. O'Connor, who was long known as superintendent of schools at Norfolk, and who has just returned from a three years service as superintendent of schools, of the Panama Canal Zone; T. M. Hodgman. who was at one time inspector of high schools, and who is bow president of McAllister College at St. Paul; C. H. Gordon, who was a former superintendent of schools at Lincoln, Nebraska, and who Is now professor of geology in the University of New Mexico. The roll of presidents of the club is. also a roll of prominent and distinguished men. Its presidents have been J. H. Miller, then editor of the North Western Monthly and now superintendent of the extension </seg>

Crabtre?, president of the State Normal School at Peru; and W. M. Davidson, superintendent of schools at Omaha. The Schoolmasters' Club, by its thorough discussion, has many times "cleared the air," if that expression may be allowed. It has never allowed itself to be drawn into any personal cr political , enterprise. It has kept strictly and staunchly to the line of legitimate and proper discussion of school problems, keeping before itself always the ideal of reaching the truth with regard to pedagogical principles, and arriving at the wisest way with regard to school policies. Many and varied have been the topics discussed by the club. The first program ■was devoted to the consideration of the future high school. Other subjects treated have been the development of moral character, proper and effective English teaching, the vices, of childhood and youth, the secondary school and the college, shall the grammar school be elimi - nated, pedagogical training in high school, some consideration of manual training, historical development of the training of elementary teachers in Germany, the propaganda of physical education throughout a state, the improvement of the county institute, the social need of Greek, the training of teachers for secondary schools in Nebraska, some moral aspects of public school education, the significance of our boys so early withdrawing from school life, the college and high school, the passing of the rural schoolmaster, the new physiology, agriculture in the public schools, some consideration of child study, the licensing of teachers, the teacher and his moral obligation, the business manage - ment of a system of schools, a plea for the boy on the farm, the Increased proportion of women in liberal arts, courses in the colleges, normal training in the high schools, the denominational college, does the college entrance examination system secure better scholarship than the accrediting system, the simplified spelling, to what extent should the training of Nebraska youth be in home institutions, the narrowing Influences surrounding the schoolmaster, a consideration of the report of the committee of seventeen on the professional training of high school teachers, the mission of the play ground, educational journalism, length of courses, in high school and college, isolation of the grades a»d some of its effects, a plea for co-ordination and continuity, plans for shortening the course in the colleges and secondary schools, the Inspection of private schools authorized by law to grant teachers' certificates. </seg>

VALUE OF PUBLIC DISCUSSION Ee following extract is taken from the biennial report of the ity extension division of Wisconsin, as submitted April X, 1908, i Loutte E. Reb;r, Director of University Extension of the Univer- Wisooosin : It is difficult to estimate the value of wide-spread, systematic training of this character in its influence upon the citizens of the stale. It is conceded that no other study in the university or ge does more to discipline the mind and promote an interest in questions vitally affecting humanity and the government than th« work don? in debating societies. "It is fortunate that so useful and so broadening a. pursuit can be carried on in the homi? of the student without interruption to his regular occupations. Without other outlay than time and thought the debater is led, first, to feel an interest in and desire to know about the grsat national and state issues of his day. This point gained, he is. taught where and how to obtain material for his studies, &amp; valuable asset in itself, if by this m.-ans he acquires the ability to inform himself when and upon what subjects he will. In studying great questions and formulating them for debate he learns to discriminate between fundamental underlying principles and non - essentials. Ha comes to recognize sound reasoning not only in ques - tions h? debates, but in all his reading. In presenting arguments in public he is gaining lessons of self-control, of correct speech, and of </seg>

'Bellevue College. Dean R. S. Calder. The history of this institution of learniDg has much in common with the early development of most of the colleges and universities of the country- It originated in the dtsir- of early Presbyterian settlers to secure for their children the advantages of higher education under distinctly Christian influences. Jt hus been said, doubtless with truth, that its earliest inspiration came through the Mission to the Omaha Indians, which was established Qt Bellevue in the fort: The Presbytery of Omaha in 1859 appointed a committee to consider the question of an educational institution within its bounds. Eight years later in 1867, the Missouri River Presbytery took similar action, and Mr. Henry T. Clarke was a member o^ the committ.e appoint - ed. The committee recommended the establismen.t of an educational Institution at Nebraska City and "Otoe University" had a brief ex - istence at that place. Mr. Clarke off:r?d ninety^three acres of land and other gifts, if the institution should be located at BeJlevue. I In 1879 the Presbytery of Kearney memorializ-d th ■ Synod "to ■ into serious consideration the advisability and practicability of ng immediate steps lookng toward the foundation of an Institution earning within Rs bounds and under its control." This, re&gt; he appointment by Synod of a Committee, consisting of the follow - gentlemer.: K Shaft, Samuel Alexander J. T. Baird, R. Clarke, W. J. Harsha,* H. T. Clarke. tAt the session of Synod in 1880 this committee reported that d received offers from Hastings, Beatrice and Bellevue and recom - led the acceptance of the proposition mad? by Mr. Clarke and the ion of the institution at Bellevue. The report of the comn&gt; adopted. This Synod further adopted Articles of Incorporation, inted incorporators and elected the following named trustee*: . J. A. Hood, H. M. Giltner,, A. M. Dixon, Geo. L. Little, R. W. Clelland, Geo. T. Crissman, Joshua Riale, W. J. Harsha, J. T. Baird, D. S. Shaft, Messrs. Archibald Wright, E. Benson, Samuel Maxwell, J. P. Kernahan, H. T. Clarke, Joseph S. Betz, O. P. Davis, S. P. Davidson, and W. E. Crutcher. The gifts of Mr. Clarke which formed the material foundation of the college included 264 acres of land at Bellevue, a college building erected at a cost of $20,000.00, and two houses and six lots in Bellevue. He also organized a company and bought 1,000 lots from the Board of Foreign Missions on condition that one-half of the purchase price should go to Bellevue College. 37 </seg>
            <seg id="p686">556 IOn September 10, 1883, the college opened with fourteen students ft faculty consisting of the Revs. W. J. Bollman, C. M. Des Islets, Francis S. Blaney. The classes recited in the church and an ■ent building. The Rev. W. W. Harsh*, D. D., entered upon his work as president of the college on September 9, 1884. On October 9, Clarke Hall was dedicated and Dr. Harsha wlae inauguarated. His administration lasted until June, 1888, when he resigned. The Rev. Francis S. Blaney was the president during the college year 1888-9, his resignation occurring in the autumn of 1889. I From 1889 to 1904 Rev. David R. Kerr, D. D., now President of :miDster College, Fulton, Mo., tilted the office of President. The &gt;ry of Dr. Kerr's administration forms by far the largest part of the iry of Bellevue College. One condition of his acceptance had been erection of a dormitory which was ready for occupancy June 190. I The excellent dormitory system of Bellevue, which forms one of prominent features of the instituion, was gradually developed. Kerr secured the friendly interest of Eastern philanthropists who i loyally by the college, making possible the erection of buildings the meeting of the annual deficit. iln 1891 the Trustees revised th&gt;e Articles of Incorporation, chang - the name of the institution to the University of Omaha. For ral years, certain professional schools of Omaha became affiliated the University. Later these affiliations ceased, although the orate title of the University was still used in connection with »vue Colleg?. K Following the resignation of Dr. Kerr, the Vice-President, Rev. . Stevenson, became acting president and served in that capacity Dr. G. Harlow Lampen became president in December, 1904. Dr. l&gt;en resigned before the end of the year. In 1905 the Rev. G. W. Wadsworth, D. D., was called to the presidency and was inaugurated with interesting ceremonies on October 16, the twenty-fifth anniversary of the founding of the college. During Dr. Wadsworth's administration the faculty and curriculum of the colleg? were strengthened, and a close relationship fostered with many of the leading high schools. The attendance was largely in - ercMed especially in the upper classes. The Normal Department was so organised as to receive the recognition of the state in the granting of »Ute certificates. Dr. Wadsworth resign^ed in June, 1908, to accept the pastorate of the First Presbyterian Church of Pueblo, Colorado. B Although the movement inaugurated in 1891-1892 for a wider fttional work with Omaha as a center failed to bring the immediate ts that were looked for, it appears that there has all along existed a deep undercurrent of feeling that the great and growing center of population in Omaha is the strategic point for the development of </seg>

Cotner University By Professor J. W. Hilton Founding and Early History K Those whose names appear in the minutes which record the ea'r - movements toward tho establishment of Cotner University, are Brlsooe, Lincoln, E. T. Oadd, Omaha, Porter Hedge, Lincoln, '. Ayhsworth, Fairfleld, G. E. Bigelow, Lincoln, and J. B. Johnson, &gt;to. I These men, under the instruction and by the authority of the Tiska Christian Missionary Society, the missionary organization ie Churches of Christ in the state, founded the institution in 1888, opened it for the registration of students in the fall of 1889, with lam P. Aylsworth as acting President. I Within the first six years of the life of the University the panic ie early nineties swept away the buildings and other property of school; and, like most institutions of a similar character in the , its future hung in the balances for several years. After heroic sacrificing devotion the cloud lifted in 1900 and since that time ; has been a steady and healthy growth in students, faculty, [ings and endowments, with no liabilities. Purposes The aims of the University are well Ret forth in one of the early catalogues in tb* following language: "Cotner University is the out - growth of a desire upon the part of the Christian Church of Nebraska to found an institution of learning, second to none in the west in its ability to confer a thorough and liberal culture, in the midst of an atmosphere distinctly moral and religious. To this end especial em - phasis la placed upon the study of the Bible and every aid and encour - agement possible ie given to those preparing for the ministry and for missionary work.

The purposes of the institution are the same today, — with a growing consciousness of the responsibility entailed by being made an integral part of the great educational organization of the common - wealth of Nebraska, and by being made a channel through which shall be given to the body politic mm and women who shall fully appreciate in an intelligent way the privileges and responsibilities of American citizenship, and who shall be prepared through devotion to the highest educational, religious, domestic and political ideals to be a blessing to their fellow men at home and abroad.

Ihe Creighton Unfoersity. By Chancellor M. J. O'Connor. HISTORY Th« history of The Creighton University may be briefly stated. Edward Creighton, after whom the University was named, had pro - posed during his life to establish a free school for higher education, but he died intestate, November 5th, 1874, before making provisions lor carrying out his, projeot. His wife, Mary Lucretia Creighton, inheriting both his fortune and his noble purpose, determined to carry out hie intention; she did not, however, live to do so. Her death occurred January 23rd, 1876; but in her test will, dated Sept. 23rd, 1875, she made a bequest, which, in the settlement of the estate, amounted to about $200,000 one-fourth of which was devoted to grounds and building, the balance being reserved for foundation. In accordance with the terms of her will, the executors, July 1, 1878, conveyed the entire property and securities to the Rt. Rev. James, O'Connor, who was a life-long frr.-nd and admirer of the Society of On February 27th, 1879, the Legislature of Nebraska passed an met to provide for the Incorporation of Universities, under certain circumstances. Among other things that act provided that the Board of Trustees shall have power to fill all vacancies in their number, to make rules, regulations and by-laws for the government of -their Board and of the institution ; to appoint a president, professors, tutors and teachers, and any other neosnary officers and agents, and fix the compensation of each; to erect within and, as depajQpents of said Institution, such schools and colleges of the arts and sciences and professors as to them may seem proper, and to confer such academic degrees, and honors as are conferred by colleges and universities of the United States. Thereupon Bisirop O'Connor, on July 26th, 1879, informed the District Court that he "holds certain lands conveyed to him by the ■executors for the purpose of carrying out the intention of the testa - tor, that a building had been erected on these grounds, that he holds, funds for the endowment of the school, that for the past year be has fused to be maintained an institution under the name of Creighton College, that he desires to vest the land, securities and property, as well as the trust, in a corporation known as a University, with divers departments, of which Creighton College shall be one." The Court permitted him to turn over his trust to a corporation called The Creighton University and he appointed five members of the Society of Jesus aa the Board of Trustees, August 14th, 1879.

This fund, according to the original bequest and the terms and conditions of the trust, must be invested in securities in perpetuity, the interest alone to be used for the support of the Faculty and the maintenance of the College. To those who are familiar only with the million dollar endowments of other Universities and Colleges, an endowment of $147,500 must appear a very m ■urn. Even to those experienced in the management of Cathoic Col - leges, it must seem a hazardous undertaking to build up and develop a Free College on a financial basis, of nothing more than the annual interest of $147,500. But tlw Jesuits, like most of th? teaching Orders of the Catholic Church, receive no salary for their labor, and though in this particular instance they fully realized the financial difficulties, they consented to face them. In this, no doubt, they were animated by the hope of seeing restored one of the- chief glories of their history, namely, the bestowal of gratuitous education, such as was given by their predecessors in the older and mor? fortunate days of the Order, when all Jesuit Colleges and Universities were endowed and Free Institutions. The venture has thus far met with unexi' success, thanks to good friends, and in particular to Count John A. hton, sorrow for whose recent death is still with us, and to his lamented wife, both of whom generously seconded the noble purpose of the original founders, and by large benefactions carried on the good work to a development which without their munificence would have remained an impossibility. DEVELOPMENT AND EQUIPMENT. The Creighton College, a free school of Arts and Sciences, was thus the first result of the Creighton endowment and it has. b en notably successful in its development during the thirty years of its existence. The main building, at present devoted entirely to College purposes, was begun in 1877, and completed in 1878. It is, built of brick trimmed with limestone. Tbere are three stories and a basement, with a frontage of fifty-six and a depth of one hundred and twen feet. The facade is surmounted by a tower on.? hundred and ten feet Kin 1883 the Scientific Department of the College was established furnished with a complete chemical, physical and astronomical : by Count Jotan A. Creighton generously seconded by Hon. John cShane. I The Astronomical Observatory attained its full development in &gt;, when the present observatory was ereoted'on the brow of the north of the college. In the same year, 1886, the gift from Count Creighton of a city lot. valued at $15,000, enabled the Trusties to secure by exchange, after the payment of a. bonus of $2,000, a much needed house and lot adjoining the main building on the northeast. </seg>

The corner-stone was laid by Right Rev. James O'Connor, D. on June 27th, 1887, and the Church was dedicated by the same ate on May 6, 1888. The style of architecture is English Gothic. Church is built of Warrensburg sandstone, and is at present 112 in length 'by 75 feet in width. The plan, however, contemplates lilding 184 feet long with a width at the transoept of 138 feet. The South Wing of the present College building was begun in the fall of 1888, and was ready for occupation the following Epring. Count and Mrs. John A.

Mrs. Sarah Emily Creighton departed this life on September 30th, 1888. During the year 1900 Count Creighton, desirous of making th? rsity. whose name pays honor to the memory of his brother Edward, an institution fully equipped for its educational work, gen - erously offered means, for the completion of the college buildings. The additions included an extension of the south wing for the accommo - dation of the members of the faculty residing on the grounds and a separate library building, and en the north an L-shuped extension whtch is d?voted almost exclusively to the use of the students of the Arts Department. Here are located the students' chapel, the recitation rooms, and the leetur? halls needed to meet the demands of the student body. Ips tftee.o buildings an Auditorium with a seating capacity of one thousand, and constructed in accordance with the nest modern designs, wa* «r;cted at the corner of California street and Twenty-flfth avenue, making it of easy access to the friends and patrons of the college, while rmmedJately north of the new Auditorium a large heat- Ing plant supplies steam to all buildings on the grounds. These addi - tions, practically completing the material equipment of the College as originally planned, -were ready for occupancy on the first of March, Kit whilst the outer aspect of the University's lite seemed thus tous, its inner story was less assuring.

Unwilling to leave the eot to the uncertainties of the future, Count Creighton felt it would be wise to provide for the time when he would no longer able to assist the institution by his contributions and i«el. He determined, therefore, to make considerable donatio: end during his life time. tin pursuance of this policy in mid-February, 1904, this distin - ed Omaha philanthropist deeded over to The Crdghton Univer - the Creighton Block and the Arlington Block, two substantial ings and good revenue producers situated in the heart of Omaha's ess district. These desirable properties, worth probably $200,000, ■thus added to the endowment fund of the University. (The tale of the University Founder's munificent personal giving te institution which was as his child had a singularly felicitous lg on Oct. 15th, 1906, when, surrounded by scores of friends came bearing hearty good wishes for hia seventy-fifth birthday, it Creighton himself furnished the climax of an ev.entful day, by ally presenting to The CreJghton University an endowment of srty valued at approximately $400,000, two splendid new structures completed in Omaha's growing wholesale district. The death of this generous father of our University on February 7, 1907, brought new evidence of his. fixed purpose to leave the work initiated thirty years before by his much beloved brother Edward, fully -endowed with means to bear its messages of joy to generations yet uaborn. His will, the final decree of settlement of which was en t red by the court on February 17, 1908, bequeaths to the Uni\ endowment fund the sum of a million and a quarter in property and excellent securities. Little wonder that the members of the Creighton Faculty with hearts full of grateful thanks, freely acknowledge the magnitude of the debt which he has laid upon them. The School of Medicine was founded May 30, 1892, and the School of Law in October, 190 4. The Edward Creighton Institute erected In 1905 is now the home of the Law Department. The Dental School, opened in 1905, shares with the Law School, the very commodious quarters it provides. The School of Pharmacy — a distinct department of Creighton since February 1, 1905, took possession of its splendidly equipped new addition to the Medical Building in September of the year 1907. St. John's Hall, southwest corner 25th and California Sts., was ■bulk in 1906. The large number of out-of-town students attending the University and the difficulty of obtaining accommodations favorable to serious study had long caused much concern to the University authorities.

            <seg id="p700">564 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT DEGREES. According to tbe Act of Legislature under which The Creighton University was incorporated, its Board of Trustees has power "to confer such Academic degrees and honors as are conferred by Colleges and Universities of the United States." REQUIREMENTS. I By privilege extended to Creighton College by the Department of lie Instruction of Nebraska, all graduates receiving an A. B. diploma, will have taken in addition to the set college courses, pedagogical t equal to that required in the State Normal Schools and in the •hers' Course of the State University, are entitled to a State Teach- Certiflcate good for three years. Upon satisfactory completion of three years' teaching this cer - tificate will be exchanged for a life certificate wihout further exam - ination. KThe degree of Bachelor of Arts is conferred upon those who, at least one year's residence, have received the eighteen credits :ed as essential in the prospectus of College Courses. KThe degree of Master of Arts, in course, can be obtained by devot - i second year to the study of philosophy in the College or two i to professional studies. BThe degree of Doctor of Philosophy will be granted only to ers of Arts after successful Post Graduate courses in Philosophy science. B Professional Degrees, in course, are defined by the Professional rtments of the University. E Honorary degrees are conferred at the discretion of the Board of ■ustees, upon those who have deserved well of the community Id terature, or Science, or the Professions. DISCIPLINE. Regularity in attendance, earnest application to the work assigned, conformity to the regulations, and gentlemanly conduct are required of all students of the University. Any serious neglect in these essential points will render the offender liable to effective correction, and even to dismissal. The University does not hold itself responsible for offenses, com - mitted out of its jurisdiction; yet any conduct that is detrimental to the reputation of the institution, or that hinders, the. advance - ment or moral good of other students, is sufficient cause for suspension or expulsion. THE GENERAL LIBRARY. The students of the University possess excellent library facilities. For years, suitable books bearing on different departments of university work had been accumulated previously to the erection of the present handsome and spacious library building. Since this event, the liberality of enlightened friends has. enabled the librarian to purchase thousands of volumes, comprising the great classics in different languages, numerous reference works of the most up-to-date and scholarly char- </seg>
            <seg id="p701">565 acter, and books most practically helpful in the different lines of work In which our students engage. The library now contains over nine - teen thousand volumes, and the enlargement still goes on. The sys - tematic and thorough plan of cataloging and distributing adopted has greatly increased the facility of consultation, and thus enhanced the value of the library as a college institution. The library is divided into ten great departments, each one of which may be said to constitute a special library on its own group of more or less closely related subjects. The first division contains general works of reference, such as bibliographies, dictionaries, cyclo - id, periodicals, society publications, etc. The second department la given to fiction; the third to works on logic, ontology, cosmology, psy - chology, ethics, and theodicy, together with the history of philosophy. The fourth division is assigned to religious works, such as different editions of the Bible, biblical commentaries, etc. Then comes theology — dogmatic, apologetic, and moral. These are followed by liturgical treaies. sacred eloquence, ascetics, ecclesiastical history, and more than two hundred and fifty volumes of patristic literature. After religious works comes the sociological Horary, embracing about one thousand of the best volumes to be found on its various branches. The philological department is still in an undeveloped state, but is next to receive the attention of the librarian. The collection on the fine arts., embracing the beet works, both old and new, is a recent and specially valuable acces - sion. The division of the Physical Sciences contains a well-furnished students.' scientific library of the best works, theoretical and practical. English and American Literature alone is represented by several thou - sand volumes, while the department of biography boasts over fourteen hundred volumes. The Historical library is the most complete of all. It contains over two thousand volumes of the great standard historians of the different nations, ancient and modern. In addition to the foregoing, the library has several thousand volumes replete with Useful information furnished by the United States government, as well as by individual states and different a - ations. Of these departments the students make free us.e, by outside circulation and by consultation in their large and finely furnished reading room adjacent to the library. SYSTEM OF EDUCATION The educational system of Creighton College is substantially that of all colleges of the Society of Jesus throughout the world. Those who desire to make either a scientific or historical study of that ■) have abundant sources of information in "Loyola" of the Great Edu - cators' Series, published by Scribner, and "Jesuit Education," published by Herder.

It seems almost self - ent— I FIRST. That there are some branches of study absolutely neces - in any scheme of liberal education. Without a knowledge of e, no man can be called educated. SECOND. That for a flDished education there ia, in each of the departments of study, a minimum of knowledge essential for a man of I THIRD. That the knowledge of the end should direct the choice means; that therefore the selection of studies must depend on the 1 and aim of education. FOURTH. That the aim of a truly liberal education is the har - monious development of all the faculties, the careful training of mind and heart, and the formation of character, rather than the actual imparting of knowledge and the specific equipment for a limited sphere of action. K FIFTH. That all branches of study are not equally serviceable this mental and moral development; that some contain mind-devel - ig factors and character-&lt;building elements which no electivism ild replace. SIXTH. That precepts, models and practice should keep pace in every well-ordered system; that all the branches should be directed to some one definite end. Language lessons in ancient and modern tongues should proceed par! pasaa if the studies are to be co-ordinated and unity maintained. I SEVENTH. That young students are not the proper judges of studies essential for a systematic and thorough development of faculties. K EIGHTH. That selection of studies should be permitted to none those whose minds have already been formed by the stud is itial to character-building and who have themselves practically 'mined upon their own life work. NINTH. That religion should not be divorced from education; that morality is impossible without religion and that it is far more important than knowledge for the welfare of the individual and the safety of society. The commonwealth needs good men more than it needs, clever men. TENTH. That there is no royal road to knowledge. Placing Kne on the register of a college does not make a student; a mul- Ky of courses which a student is free to ignore does not make olar. K ELEVENTH. That the standing or grade of a college varies tly as the amount of study and acquirements made requisite degree. TWELFTH. That the education given by a college should be general, not special. In this way it lays the foundation for specialties and the independent research appertaining to universities. </seg>
            <seg id="p703">567 K THIRTEENTH. That all the studies pursued need not be directly il in after life. Guid-ed by these principles, The Creighton University, in the Clas - sical D?partment, offers a course of studies superior to that of the large universities, though they are more richly endowed and have a larger clientage to draw upon for higher studies. It does not offer many courses or pretend to satisfy every applicant by allowing him to select at will from branches sometimes incompatible and often of secondary importance, thus leaving considerable gaps in the knowledge of essen - tial subjects. It maps out a curriculum which makes obligatory such branches as, in some form, however elementary, are deemed absolutely necessary for a liberal education. It does not promise that the youth who takes this prescribed course will have a specialist's knowledge of any individual branch; nor does it say that he will be wholly edu - cated at the completion of Ms course; but it does claim that he will have a more harmoniously rounded education and will bo intimately acquainted with a greater number of essential branches than by fol - lowing a collegiate system based on electives and specialties. The course may not suit all com- rs, it is. not intended to meet the wants of all, especially of those who regard electives as the one thing ■ s.iry; but it does afford a good, sound, thorough, practical education to persons who are satisfied with the method and principles already enunciated. It is a decided advantage of the system followed in this. Collfge. The student may begin his early studies in the High School, and then pass on through th.e College course, to graduation in the same institution. This secures, 'besides the moral influence thus, gained, a uniform and homogeneous course of teaching and training. The result of such a course of study is a continuous and normal development of th-a mental faculties along well-defined lines, and the possession of a clear and coherent system of principles upon which any special or professional cours.es may afterward safely rest. RELIGIOUS INSTRUCTION. As incomparably the most important element of the education it imparts, the College aims at a moral training of its students such as will make for the right fulfillment of their civil, soc:;U and re - ligious duties. There is insistence on the cultivation of the Christian virtues which aid to this fulfillment; and as the only solid br - virtue and morality, thorough instruction in the principles of religion forms an essential part of the system. Stud nts of any denomination are admitted to Creighton's classes, and all are required to show a respectful demeanor during the ordinary exercises of public prayer. Catholic students, if not excused for good rsasons, are urged to be presrnt at daily Mass, and a'*e required to attend the weekly lectures on the doctrines, of the Church, to make an annual retreat, to approach the Sacraments of Penance and Holy Eucharist every month and if they have not received the Sacraments </seg>

The school, now known as Dana College and Trinity Seminary, was established by the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church Association. Already in 1884 it was decided to establish a school where young men could be educated for the ministry among the Danish people of Amer - ica. The generosity of the citizens of Blair enabled the association to locate the institution at Blair, Nebr., and in the summer of 1886 work on the building was commenced. On October 21, 1886, the first part of the building was dedicated and a new institution of learning took its. place among the educational institutions of this country. This was the first Danish school for the education of men for the ministry erected hi this country, and penhaps, in «. measure, marks, the beginning of an effort for a liberal education for the Danish people. I Rev. A. M. Anderson, pastor of the Danish Lutheran congregation lair, through whose efforts, the liberal bonus from the citizens of was obtained, became its first president and its first theological ier. He enjoys the distinction of being the first president of the school established for the education of Danish ministers for the sh people of America, as well as its first professor. Rev. Anderson the position of president until 1889 when he was succeeded by G. B. Christiansen, who served till 1896. Each year the courses :udy were improved. The attendance increased. The building ed in 1886 was found to be too small and in 1893 the left wing of nain building waa erected. In 1896 Rev. G. B. Christiansen was succeeded by Rev. P. S. Vig who served as president till 1899. During these three years it was almost exclusively a school for theological students. This condition was brought about by a union of two Danish Lutheran organizations, the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Association and the Danish Evangelical Lutheran Church in North America. The latter organization had had a. school in Elk Horn, Iowa. This school was now made preparatory to the seminary at Blair, and was also equipped for more general educa - tional work. I By a resolution passed by th.? annual convention of the United sh Evangelical Lutheran Church in America in convention as - led at Hutchinson. Minn., in 1899 it was decided to unite the two &gt;ls.

Anker was chosen president of Dana College and P. S. Vig president of Trinity Seminary. Rev. Kr. Anker served as president until 1905. During these years there -were erected a ladies' dormitory, a gymnasium and the right wing of the main building. The school became a coeducational institution and women ware given equal privileges with men. The number of courses of study was increased. Besides the Seminary, Pro-Seminary, College, Normal, Academic, Business, Short - hand and Typewriting courses were added. In 1905, Rev. Kr. Anker was succeeded by Rev. J. P. Jensen as president, and he served as president both of Dana College and Trinity Seminary, Rev. P. S. Vig having resigned during the summer of 1905. Rev. J. P. Jensen dfced in the spring of 1908 and Rev. S. C. Eriksen was. appointed to take charge of the Institution until a more permanent arrangement -could be brought about. This was done at the annual convention, assembled at Waupaca, Wisconsin, in June, 1908. The convention chose C. X. Hansen president of Dana College and Rev. S. C. Er president of Trinity Seminary. tThe school has yet no endowment fund. Its. teachers and pro - rs are supported by voluntary contributions by the members of the :h body and by tuitions charged students. kThe largest donation from any single source has been made by Bondo estate of Iowa. It is in the form of a residence costing $3,000 donated by this estate as a residence for president of Collegie. ■ The value of the college property is. estimated at between $50,000 $60,000. During these years from 1888-1908 the school has graduated 160 students. By far the greater number of students that have attended have been of a class who wished to become better acquainted with the language of this country who have availed themselves of the courses offered them. 'Doane College. Crete, Nebraska. By President D. B. I' rry From the founding of Harvard and Yale in the earliest days of colonial life Congregationalisms have always put emphasis upon higher Christian education. What Congregationalism has done in other states, from the Atlantic to the Missouri, it sougnt to do in Nebraska. When there were but three Congregational churches in that part of the territory of Nebraska which subsequently became the state, and ten years before statehood, the General Association of Congregational Churches was organized and at its first session, held at Fremont, October, </seg>

I Nebraska was formed into a territory by the famous Kansas-Ne - ia bill in 1854. Rev. Reuben Gaylord, the first Congregational iter and pioneer Home Missionary superintendent to do service in lew territory, crossed the Missouri on ice Christmas day, 1855. iuous and praiseworthy "efforts, were put forth under his special ■rship to establish a college at Fontanelle. That this enterprise lot succeed was. due to circumstances quit beyond human control. In 1871 the General Association passed the following resolutions: "Resolved, That we believe the time has, come to take measures for the establishment of two or more academies. KResodved, That it is the sense of thia association that w - should itrate our educational efforts on our academies and on our one e for our order in the state." I At the next meeting in June, 1872, the General Association accepted eport of its committee on education and thereby located its college rete, Nebraska. This educationafl report was signed by Rev. O. W. •ill, then superintendent of our Horn? Missionary Churches, and teacon George F. Lee. Our first college building bears the name ie former — MERRILL HALL; and the name of the latter is cut in ring stone over thi? west entrance to the new building — LEE 1ORIAL CHAPEL. No name was attached to the college when it was located. Mr. Thomas Doane. of Charlestown, Mass., had brought into Nebraska not the fame of an excellent civil engine; r, but also a reputation of sterling worth. In virtue of his generous aid, his active co-operation la every good enterprise, but more especially because of h-ia character as a man, with no pledge on his part, and against his protest, the corporate body wrote &lt;his. name in the articles of incorporation, and the institution was called DOANE COLLEGE. During his life Mr. Doane was a constant and liberal giver, an invaluable adviser and colaborer. Since his death, October 22, 1897, his estate has yielded more than $70,000.00. Other property, as lands, buildings ami equip - ment carry the total assets of th? college to $350,000.00. The college &gt;waa the outgrowth of an academy which had been organized in 1871. After the location of the college the academy took the name of preparatory department. In 1893 H resumed its earlier name, a principal was appointed, and » special effort was put forth to develop academy life. The college is the center of a Congregational educational system that has. four other academies which stand to it in the relation of feeders, though there is no organic connection. These academies are at Chadron in the northwest corner of tt» state, at NeHigh in the northeast, at Franklin in the southwest, and at Weeping Water in the southeast.

For this reason the trustees increased tbwir number, at first fifteen, to eighteen, and then to twenty-seven, the maximum number allowed by the articles of incorporation. To extend still further the responsibility and privilege of caring for the institution, in June, 1893, they invited collegia graduates to nominate each year one or more of their number, that the board might annually elect one from the list of graduates to strve three years. At the same time a similar invitation -was extended by the trustees to members oC Congregational churches in every part of the state with a view to the V arly election of three to be special representatives, of the Nebraska Congregational churches.

Fremont College. By President W. H. Clemmona. The school was founded by Prof. W. P. Jones, of Chicago, in 1884. The corner stone was laid July 4, 1884, according to the ritual of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows. The school opened its doors,' to students October 21, 1884. A Miss Evans, now a teacher in the Omaha city schools, was the first pupil to eDroll. The first day's en - rollment wps thirty-six and during the year, the enrollment increased to one hundred and fifty. When the school was organized there were four recitation rooms and one business practice room. A part of- the building was used for dormitory purposes. Prof. Jones died August 3, 1886. His wife, Mary E. Jones., assumed control and carried on the work until May 12, 1888. The college was then purchased by Ppm. W. H. Clemmons. At the time he took charge there were thirty-two students. Now the term enrollment is from eight hundred to fourteen hundred, varying wKh the season of the year. The college has two large and commodious rooming halls, accommodating four hundred and twenty-four students and a dining hall with a seating capacity of five hundred.

It is their only college in this state. Starting from the •■stern border of Nebraska its field stretches west-ward for a thousand aH«. There is no other Baptist institution of learning this side of Oregon or California. The Baptists in the states to the w?et of Nebraska look to Grand Island College as their school and give it their support and patronage. Grand Island College was not the first educational venture of the Nebraska Baptlats. In 1880 they founded at Gibbon. The Nebraska Baptist Seminary. It was a seminary of academic or blgh school grade. The t quipnient was meager, tut the instruction was good. The faculty consisted of six teachers. As near as can be ascertained there were from first to last 264 different students in attendance. Ten of these students graduated. After an existence of five years the existence of the school was terminated by the action of the Nebraska Baptist State Convention. The location waa never heartily accepted by the denomination. The management was marked by disharmony. planting of the institution wae regarded by many as premature. &lt;n 1883 an Education Socfety was organized to establish a per- </seg>

            <seg id="p719">575 this society -was re-organized and became more thoroughly representa - tive of the denomination. It sought to secure a desirable location with additional ■gifts of land or buildings. When the purpose of the denom - ination to establish a college became known, several cities aspired to the -honor of being the site of th# new denominational school. The several overtures made 'by these cities were carefully considered by the Education Society. It "was decided that Grard Island had mad* - eat offer and would be on the whole the best place for the school. Grand Island was therefore encouraged to erect a suitable college buildings. Two buildings were at length completed and were deeded to the American Baptist Education Society whose headquarters were in New York City. This society transferred its claim to the Trustees of Grand Island College. By the articles of incorporation the Board of Trustees consists of twenty-one members; they are aelf perpetuating; two-thirds of them must be Baptists; the president must be a member of a regular Baptist church. There is no other denominational test to be found in the regulations or practice of the institution. I At the time the officers of the Education Society turned over the ■erty to the trustees of the college, they made the further gift of 00.00 on condition that by January 1st, 1894, the supplementary of $15,250.00 should be raised by th-e institution. It was stated $10,000.00 of this sum might be used for equipment and at least 000.00 for a permanent endowment. The offer was accepted. 000.00 was used for the equipment of the school, and $10,000.00 eet aside as a permanent endowment fund. June 1, 1896, the American Baptist Education Society offered to give the college $7,500 on condition that by January 1. 1898, the supplementary sum of $25,000 be raised in cash or bankable notes, chiefly from the state of Nebraska, the aggregate sum to constitute an addition to the endowment fund. The required amount of money was raised, in the specified time, making the endowment $35,000. I December 1, 1899, the American Baptist Education Society offered ve the college $10,000 on condition that by June 1, 1901, the ementarv sum of 825,000 be raised in cash or bankable roles, y in the state of Nebraska the aggregate sum to constitute an ion to the endowment fund. The required amount of money was j within the specified time; making the endowment fund $70,000. raportant addition to the fund was made by the $10,000 gift of J. V. Hinchman of Iowa. The endowment has now reached the of $80,000. The interest on this fund, the tuition fees of the ins, together with the annual gifts of the churches for current ises, provide the revenue for meeting the expenses, of the institution. Buildings November 18, 1903, Mr. John A. Hlbfos of Omaha moved by his interest in education sent for the president of the college and placed in Ms hand to aid in erecting a dormitory the sum of $15,000. This dormitory Is a brick building 140x58, containing rooms for one hundred </seg>
            <seg id="p720">576 Etnta, besides a large dining room, parlor and other rooms and iment necessary for a first class ladtes hall. The cost of the Ing -was $30,000. Of the buildings originally entrusted to the College Board, one is a boys' dormKory capable of accommodating forty boys. The other is a three story cortege building, 127 feet in length and 72 feet in width. Besides chapel, offices, and laboratories, there la abundant space for twenty recitation rooms. Three rooms are devoted to the 8,000 books which compose the library. The value of these three buildings with the boiler and powt-r house recently buHt is estimated to be $125,000. I The need of a library building and a gymnasium is keenly felt. Indrew Carnegie will provide the money for a library 'building, as as the college raises $20,000 to endow it. The college has •riptions to this amount but proposes to continue the canvass until gymnasium has also been secured. Departments The college is divided into departments as follows: the college, the school of education, the academy, the school of commerce, the school of music, and the school of art. The college offers, three courses, the classical, the scientific, and the philosophical. Nearly one-half of the students on entering choose the classical course. The curriculum of the school of education is equivalent to that of the Teachers' College of the University of Nebraska. Nearly one-half of the students are choosing the course in Education. Eleetives are allowed somewhat sparingly beginning with the second semester of the Sophomore year. The college is increasing more rapidly than any other department of the institution. The academy stands next in point of attendance to the largest department of the college. But one course of study is offered in the academy; electiv£s are provided for the scientific students in the last year of their course. On account of the operation of the free high school law the academy is not likely to flouri&amp;h as formerly. It may be needed however for a good many years to come. At the very beginning of the college it was determined on account of the meager salaries offered the instructors to ohoose young teachers rather than old teachers: those who could afford to giw instruction for a few years for the sake of experience; teachers who were well edu - cated; who aspired to high positions, and who would therefore render excellent service through a brief period. On this account the pro - feaaora have been numerous; their work has ibeen excellent, and their terms of service have been short. During the sixteen years of its existence the college has watched the departure of 22 teachers. But as the college has made progress the salaries have increased in amount, and the period of service has correspondingly increased. The col - lege has tfrom the beginning aimed at excellent scholarship. Its center of interest lias been not in athletics, but in intellectual activity.

The Attendance The college opened October 1, 1892, with an attendance of 32 students. The total number enrolling the first year was 59. These were all academic students. The second year th*?re was a slight In - crease. Nearly every year from the beginning there has be^n an increase of from twelve to twenty students over the preceding year until now the attendance is a little over 300. The students come from all parts of Nebraska and from surrounding states. They are for the most part young men and women who need to make their money go as. far as possible. About one-half of them earn money enough, while attend - ing school, to pay their expenses in whole or In considerable part. The dining room, the dormitories, the improvements constantly going on about the college buildings, afford numerous opportunities for remunerative labor. A gentleman in Pennsylvania stands ready to loan money to well approved students for the ministry who need such as- sistance.

Luther Academy. Wahoo, Nebraska. By President O. J. Johnson. tThe Lutheran church T»aa from the beginning been active in ational work. The fundamental principles of the reformation rally and inevitably referred, not only to primary, but also to idary and higher education. Historically the Lutheran church le mother of popular education, and the friend of every depart - : of learning. I When the Lutheran church fails, to foster schools of every grade, s untrue to its principles and history. The Lutheran pioneers America, true to the traditions of the church, at once engaged In work of education. The pioneer fathers of the Nebraska conference ? been true to our traditional history in founding Luther Academy have rhus proved themselves to be orthodox Lutherans, both in iry and practice. The need of a higher institution of learning in the Nebraska mission field was Ml very early. While N braska was yet a part of the Kansas conference, we finds this question treated In the reports of the president of the Kansas conference. We find the first mention of the need of a school to a report written by the chairman of the </seg>
            <seg id="p726">Omaha Mission district, Rev. J. P. Nyquist. He says: The establish - ment of an elementary school in our midst is an important matter. I need not say anything about the importance of such a school for our church work. It is evident to «very intelligent church member and there can therefore in this matter be but one opinion and that is: that the sooner the school is established the better. This was in October, 1882, and at this time the communicant membership of Nebraska was 1,451. A bold step to take with a handful of pioneers, but they trusted in the Lord and they were therefore not put to shame. I The following year at the convention of the Kansas conference, h 9th, 1884, at Mariadahl, Kansas, Rev. E. A. Fogelstrom reports, during the year an elementary school had been established in so. Nebraska, and that it had been christened "Luther Acad - ' in honor of the hero of the jubilee year, Dr. Martin Luther. He furthermore that the school is the common property of the rogations of Nebraska, and ought to become a source of great ing to them. Rev. Fogelstrom expresses the hope that this &gt;1 may be found worthy of the great name it bears, and thus in • true sense serve God and his Kingdom on earth. At the same meeting Luther Academy, after a heated discussion, was received as a legitimate child into the fold of the church. The following reso - lution -was passed: K Resolved, That Luther Academy, Wahoo, Nebr., be also cou - rt as a conference school and that the board be requested to h the necessary papers as soon as possible." (The articles of incorporation were filed for record March 29, 1883. following were elected as members, of the Board of Directors: rters — E. A. Fogelstrom, J. P. Nyatrom, J. ToneJl, C. J. E. rius, J. E. Nordling. Laymen — John Erlckson, N. P. Hult, ham Helsirg, P. N. Helsing. Three of the first are still members e board. Rev. J. Torell was the first chairman of the board. May 1, 1883, the plans for the main building were accepted and the south wing was erected during that year. The first school year was opened October 18, 1883, and at the first recitation five pupils ware present. The opinion seemed to have prevailed in Nebraska that th* organic union with the Kansas conference was not for the best of the work here and at a conference meeting in Omaha, 1885, a peti - tion was handed in by the Nebraska Mission district requesting that a separation from the Kansas conference be granted. This petition was referred to the Synod and granted by said body at its convention in Minneapolis, 1886. The Nebraska conference was thrown on Its own resources and the struggle for existence 'began. The conference looked to Luther Academy for assistance in the missionary work in Hi* conference, as the first report of the president of the conference clearly shows. The first report concerning the work, of Luther Academy was </seg>

            <seg id="p729">581 ruary 9, 1887. It is an interesting document, full of hope and burning with love for the cause. In 1890 the constitution and by-laws were adopted and we might consider this year as the close of the formative period of Luther Academy., Up to this time they had only three classes, but a request for a fourth class was sent to the conference of 1892, which was not granted. The following seven years were years characterized by inner growth. Mors attention was paid to the perfecting of the courses of study. The president of the board recommended that the courses be so arranged that graduates from Luther Academy would be admitted to the State University on certificates. This was, however, found impossible at this time, and it was not realized until 1906. In 1897 a new constitution was drafted. Efforts were made to add to the equipment. The intention of the founders of Luther Academy was that only the classical course should be given at the institution, but this plan was soon changed. In 1886 a Commercial Department was added and in 1893 the Music Department. tThe following changes in the courses and departments have been I since the year 1900: A complete shorthand and typewriting ,e was added to the school of business,, 1903; the art department organized, 1904; the agricultural course was added, 1905; a al department with the right to grant teachers' state cer - tes, 1908. The period of expansion began with the year 1900. The need of new class rooms and more rooms for students had long been felt and the reports mentioned this year after year. The board finally ap - pointed a committee to draw up plans for the completion of the main building. Solicitors to raise sufficient funds were called, but the conference failed to secure any one who would take hold of the work. At the annual meeting of the conference at Axtell, Nebr., 1902, the board recommended that a subscription amounting to $15,000 be raised for the completion of the main building. President O. J. Johnson was appointed to raise the required amount. In the fall of the same year $10,000 had already been raised and only a few of the members of the conference had been asked to contribute. At a meeting of the conference at Saronville, it was decided to raise $25,000 and that the old plant be abandoned and a new building be built. This, subscription reached $27,976.80. The new main building was finished and dedi - cated October 11th, 1903. A few words about the financial history of Luther Academy might b? of interest. Mr. John Erickson, of Swedeburg, has the honor of being the flre.t one to offer a cash subscription towards the establish - ing of a Swedish Lutheran institution of learning in Nebraska. The first step for raising a building fund was taken in Swedeburg, where $1,980 were promised, Malmo subscribed $1,079, and Mead, $1,250. These sums were promised regardless of where the school was to be located. The city of Wahoo offered $3,448 and ten acres of land if the school waa located in this city. Three places competed for the </seg>
            <seg id="p730">582 institution — Wahoo, Stromsburg and Saronville. A meeting was held at Saronville March 6 and 10, 1883. for the purpose of determining the location. Wahoo was successful. The south wing of th* main building was built in 1883, with the subscription on hand which almost covered the expenses. A debt of $7,000 was incurred during the following years. In 1884 West Hall was built. The financial question now became the most important one and the solution of that question meant the life or death of the institution. The hero of the hour wai Rev. E. A. Fabelstrom. He accepted the office of financial solicitor for Luther Academy and subscribed $8,238.25. The institu - tion was aife for the time being, but soon another difficulty arose. The institution bad kept on growing and more teachers had been engaged, but there was no other regular source of income other than the tuition paid by the students. This naturally caused a deficit and in a few years the debt was about $9,000. Rev. J. Brodine, of Holdrege, bravely accepted the call to wipe out, by means of a subscription, the debt of the conference, 'which was about $12,000. He succeeded and the Nebraska conference will continue to feel grateful to him for this noble work. 'Rev. J. Torell can fitly &lt;be called the financial manager of Luther Academy. He has time and again taken up subscriptions, and during the whole time has born* the financial care for our beloved Institution. To manage the financial part of this institution during these years was a most difficult matter, and required a skillful financier and a courageous, hopeful and energetic man, who was not easily disheartened. This is to me another evidence that God always sends the right man at the right time to do the work necessary for the up - building of his kingdom. Luther Academy owes to a great measure its existence to the untiring seal and wisdom of Rev. J. Torell. During the past twenty-five years the following sums have been expended for running expenses: 1883, $7,756; '87, $5,545.15; '88. $6,869.32; '90, $695.80; '91, $8,551.45; '92, $9,123.71 ;'93, $9,005.87; ■»4. $10,889.78; '95, $2,808.90; '96, $6. 463.

Wayne, Nebraska By President J. M. Pile. By the time Wayne's population numbered 1,000, her enterprising citizens and those of the vicinity began the consideration of securing an educational institution other than the public school. During the latter '80's, a Lutheran Academy was organized and oarri d on the work in temporary quarters two ye ars. Funds were subscribed ; a site was selected followed by the excavation for a building. Some differ - ences arouse among the subscribers to the fund; the school was closed and the scheme abandoned. A summer normal of 10 weeks was conducted in the public school building in 1891 by the county super - intendent of schools of Wayne county and the principal of the Wayne school assisted by J. M. Pile. The success of this session which w«i largely attended 'by teachers of several counties of northeast Nebraska called forth a plan for the establishment of a Normal school. Funds were noon raised to purchase grounds, to build and equip * suitable building for the purpose. A committee or board of trustees was authorized to complete arrangements for the organization of the school. This, committee elected J. M. Pile president, tendered the property to him free of rent for a term of five years coupled with the agreement that same should be deeded free from indebtedness to him at the expiration of this time if he should organize and conduct a normal school whose minimum attendance of students the fifth </seg>

A small dormitory had been erected during summer. At the close of the five year period, the property was led per agreement. From time to time with the assistance of the ens, new buildings were erected to meet the growing demands of school. The following buildings are now owned and occupied by school: college building, auditorium, five dormitories, central beat - plant, the president's residence. All buildings are fully equipped the most thorough and practical normal school training. The e of the property exceeds $160,000. Courses of Study The courses of study haw increased to lead the way to advanced educational preparation for the students. The following complete -courses are now maintained: preparatory which admits students over 14 years of agv, prepares them to pass examinations for second grade county certificates and to enter the teachers' elementary course; the teachers' elementary course covers a year of 48 weeks, leads to a second grade state certificate and prepares for the teachers.' professional course; this latter course prepares students to enter our scientific course or the freshman class of the university; the scientific course prepares its graduates for a first grade or life state certificate and admits to the sophomore class Of the university; emphasis has been placed on the commercial course from the opening of the school, many students graduate from this department each year; the shorthand de - partment, the music department, the elocution department are well attended; one year courses in German, in manual training, in agri - culture, in domestic science were organized in 1908. In 1903, the state -tment officially granted the school authority to issue state teachers' certificates on the same basis as the state normal schools. 321 state certificates have been issued 'by the school to graduates. The greatest work of the school is preparation of teachers. Several hundred go out to teach each year. Faculty I President and Mrs. J. M.

The Nebraska Wesleyan University was, born of a de;p rooted conviction which the Methodist church holds in common with other evangelical Christian churches, that for those features of education which have to do, more specifically, with the forming of the character of her youth, she owes it to them to herself make ample provision. This, according to her ideal, can best be done by an educational insti - tution which by its alms, its curriculum, the character and spirit of Its faculty, and the social environment of Its students, seeks to bring out and develop to completeness the whole being, the physical, mental, moral and religious nature. She will heartily co-operate with the edu - cational work of the state so far as that goes, and by physical, intel - lectual, and moral training help to make good citizens of the free - republic, and useful members of society. But the church must do mor?. In the churchly idea of education, the climax of the educational process is only reached when, in addition to these essential and highly valuable features just mentioned, the religious nature of the student is developed, and the youth brought by conversion into such conscious relations, to God as to fit them for citizenship in his kingdom. And she firmly 'believes that this crowning achievement of education and grace enhances, the value and efficiency of all the others. That to toe religious in the true sense ministers to the health of the body, to correctness of thought, and puts back of morals a spiritual power that will raise - morality to the highest efficiency in all the human relationships and activities of life. </seg>

            <seg id="p741">LECTURES, REPORTS, ADDRESSES AND PAPERS 587 And further, she deems it of great importance that while this part of the educational work is proceeding, the morals of the immature and inexperienced youth should be safeguarded as, sacredly as they are in the home, t&gt;y creating the best possible social, moral and religious environment, free from all corrupting influences and alive with stimu - lating good influences, inciting them to the best things. In the case of the Nebraska Wesleyan, this end has been attained by building around the school the city of University Place, which is a city of superior character, with no saloons or other corrupting institu - tions, but with a vigorous church, now numbering more than twelve hundred members, numerically the largest Methodist church in the state, so spiritually alive and active as to ersrt a powerful influence on the life and character of the student. And the state schools ne'A the help of the church to carry on their work. It has long s.ince been ascertained that the most difficult problem in educaional work is not the erection of school buildings nor hiring of teachers, but to induce the people to take advantage of them; and when children are brought into the primary grades, to keep them through the high school and college. It hasi been stated on good authority that, in some of our cities, not to exceed six per cent of those who enter the primary depart - ment graduate in the high school. There is nothing that can act so powerfully to create and maintain and intensify a desire for education as the processes of divine enlightenment by which a personal being becomes a child of God. For life at once takes on a larger meaning, and knowledge a greater value. For evidence of this we refer to the fact that while Christian young men and women are in the minority, that minority furnishes 80 per cent of th? students attending Wesieyan, and fully half of those that attend the State University are professing Christians. Then the state itself needs the church and her schools. It is becoming more and more apparent that in a free republic like our own, public opinion is the power behind the throne to which presidents and legislatures bow; it is. then of vital importance that this public opinion be rational and in harmony with the highest and most efficient type of morality, but this can only exist when the individual masters himself by self-control; appreciates the worth and dignity, and recog - nizes the claims of his fellow-men, not only to the extent of justice but to that of fraternal good will; and in addition to all, and sanctifying and elevating all, a profound reverence for God. This requires schools, with a curriculum large enough to comprehend not only God's works, but mankind in their fullest and largest range of being, and God Himself. Much of this lies, beyond the province of the state as now constituted, and will ever furnish a field for educational work on the part of the church. Thus the situation now is, as between the church schools, and state schools, that they supplement each other and both are required to constitute a complete system of education in order that the entire personal being shall be fully developed and brought :» </seg>
            <seg id="p742">588 STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT into harmony in all his relations, including his relation to bUs feHow - m n and to God. That in all those grades of education where during the educational process the pupil remains at home under the parental influence, including the primary and earlier secondary phasete of public education, the state by her power of taxation can better com - mand the resources needful for efficient work in that field, and the church is disposed to recognize the fact and turn that part of the work over to the state. But when the time comes for the student to leave home and prosecute his educational work to comple - tion without the parental influenoe of the home, the church insists that it can and does furnish better moral conditions, and give fuller and completer development, including the religious nature of the student, than can be done by the state. While the church recognises the state as a friendly coadjutor rival, she can never turn over to it the entire work of education, but must insist upon doing her part. The state, by its superior resources, may better supply the demand along the line of technical branches such as agriculture and engineering, but the church can supply superior culture along the lines of higher morality acd the religious life. The field is large enough for both and may the day never come when either will abandon Its part of the work. {That the-s? ideals, have pervaded the Methodist church of Nebraska the first is seen in the fact that among the first things hurch thought at and planned for was a great Christian institution irning to be called "Simpson University," to be located in the city naha. During the first session of the Nebraska Territorial Legis - e, in the winter of 1855, a charter for such an institution was ired. The ends in view in the establishing of this institution were set forth as follows: "The object of said corporation shall be the promotion of the general interests of education, and to qualify students to engage in the several pursuits and employments of society, and to discharge honorably and usefully the various duties of life." Thus we see that the aims of the state and of the church Id carrying on the work of education are the same up to a certain point; but in the vital matter of religious culture she finds that by reason of the fixed policy of our system of government, by which the church and state are to be kept legally separate, the state is necessarily restricted from entering into the field of positive religious instruction, though oft;n indirectly accomplishing something along this line by means of the Y. M. C. A., and other organizations; hence the church, in the exercise of her larger freedom in this direction, felt that she must also enter the educational field and supplement and complete the work of the state by a positive religious culture which the state could not give.

Though this enterprise failed because of the defective title to fifty acres of land on which depended her endowment, and perhaps for other causes, the church was not deterred from other enterprises. Another school was projected in 1857, at Oreapolis, just south of the Platte river, and near its mouth. Besides the endorsement of the conference, Oreapolis, Seminary had the backing of some of the wisest and strongest men of Methodism outside the territory, among them Professor George Loomis, a leading educator, and Hon. John Evans, who had already had borne a conspicuous part in the founding of Evans.ton. Illi - nois, which was named in his honor, and in the establishment of the great Northwestern University at that place, and who was afterward Governor of Colorado, and contributed largely to the founding of Denver Uni - versity. Even Dr. John Dempster, first president of Garrett Biblical Institute, proposed to become responsible for a theological school as a department if ten students, could be found. But these men them - selves soon saw that the enterprise was premature and withdrew, and soon after, the conference withdrawing ita support, the school was abandoned. This was caused by the breaking out of the civil war, which checked immigration, changed many plans and prevented the realization of their hopes. Then at Peru, in 1866, an effort was made under the leadership of the pastor, Rev. H. Burch, to found a Methodist college, backed by the church and the leading citizens of the place. A generous offer was made on condition that the church would establish there a school of college grade. This the .conference refused to do, deeming such an undertaking premature and unwise, but offered to accept the proposition on the basis of an institution of seminary grade. But the subscriptions of the people of Peru had been mad? on the basis, of a college, and the citizens declined the conference proposal and offered their bonus to the state for the establishment of a normal school, and it was accepted. I Besides these enterprises in which thie church was officially con - ed, a large number of private enterprises were inaugurated and ed on for a time, most or all of them in hope of ultimate adoption he church. Among thea? may be mentioned the Nemaha Colle - ! Institute, by Professor J. M. McKenzie; a seminary at Nebraska by Rev. P. T. Kena?y; a school at Factory ville on the Weeping ?r, by Mrs. Nichols; a school at Fremont, by Rev. Mendenhall; and at Osceola, 'by Rev. J. J. Fleharty, who established a Nebraska eyan University, which he afterwards removed to Fullerton, and h continued but a few years. ■These all failed because premature, and also because during the twenty-five years of its history the financial conditions in Ne- </seg>
            <seg id="p746">590 El were very unpropltlous, this period including the financial of 1857-8, the disturbing effect of civil war, and the grasshopper « of 1874-7. KThen in succession were established York Seminary, at York, in ; North Nebraska Conference Seminary at Central City, in 1884, Mallalt;u University at Bartley, in 1886. The first two were soon d to college grade, at the betaest at local pride and in utter gard of financial conditions. Thus in 1886, there were three colleges, one in each conference, struggling for existence. The York and Central City institutions were within thirty-five miles of each othier, and each was burdened with debt, and being conference schools were limited to their respective conferences for patronage and support. UNIFICATION This was the educational situation wlien Bi?,hop Fowler came into the state to preside over the three conferences then existing. He found that Nebraska M&gt; thodism was already the victim of a tendency to the undue multiplication of institutions, each conference insisting on having Its own high-grade school of learning. This made it impossible for either to realize the best results In the establishment of a Ktrong institution. Having others conceived the idea of unifying our work. Bishop Fowler submitted the matter to the three annual conferences and the outcome was the appointment of a joint commission, which met in Lincoln, In Dec m foe r, 1886, and adopted what has since been known as the plan of unification. By the provisions of this plan there should be but one institution of college grade, all others being sub - ordinate departments of the central institution, permitted, if they wished, to carry their work as far as the sophomore year. Ne - braska Wesleyan University was then established as the one high-grade school of Methodism of the entire state, being located three and one - half miles from tb? post offiei? in the city of Lincoln. I From various causes, but chiefly adverse financial conditions then :ing, the subordinate schools, dropped out of existence, as did also subsequently i-stablished seminaries at Douglas and Orleans, and Nebraska Wesleyan became the sole institution under the onaige and support of the Methodist Episcopal Church In Nebraska. It may be truthfully said that the successful Nebraska Wesleyan University of today is the outcome of more than a quarter of a century of self-sacrificing effort upon the part of the church, attended by many complete or partial failures, but during which the church mever swerved from her purpose to seize the first opportunity to enter the educational field. While, as stated above, the original plan of unification contem - plated subordinate Institutions of secondary grade, to be established at different points throughout the state, there has recently taken plac* In two important directions so great a change in the </seg>
            <seg id="p747">591 |;ral situation, by which the efficient public high schools have become alent in nearly all the villages of the state, and even in some rural ricts, where the youth can receive instruction in these grades, and ho same time be safeguarded as to their morals by remaining in r homes, and thereby, in the opinion of many, making it unneces - for the church to establish these seminaries; and then, in the nd place, the plan of restricting our work to a single high-grade tution becomes more manifestly by reason of the fact that oad transportation has reached such proficiency that a student can h the Nebraska Wesleyan from almost any point in the state in a le day with few, if any, changes of cars. The marvelous progress of Wer:leyan, from the beginning sufficient vindication of the far-seeing wisdom of Bishop Fowler and the commission in thi? adoption of the unification plan, for tft baa been achieved under the most adverse circumstances. The enter - prise was. inaugurated while the great boom of that period was yet in such vigorous existence that the trustees, in common with the managers of many private enterprises bank, d on its indefinite continuance. The •fact was that it was even then ready to burst, so that the first twelve years of the existence of the school coincidi-d with the terrible reaction which carried values from the highly inflated figures of the boom to the other extreme of low prices of real estate, making it impossible to realize on the sale of lots, as expected. These general conditions of financial stress following the boom were gr atly intensified by the local conditions prevailing in Nebraska at that tim?, toy reason of drouth and partial or complete failure of crops., and low pricos. and could not possibly have been worse. Yet, notwithstanding these ad - conditions, the institution weathered the storm that brought financial ruin to many other schools and privat? enterprise?., and meanwhile maintained a high-grade faculty and krpt the debt down to manageable proportion, so that when the opportune moment mme, in 1900. under the leadership of Chancellor Huntington, Governor .1. H. Mick y, and others, the debt was paid in full, and since then a gym - nasium erected, the fine C C. White Memorial conservatory of music built, and other improvements made, and all at a cost of nearly $100,000, all of which has been paid. Since then an .;ndowment fund of $100,000 has been raised, and plans outlined for an ultimate endowment of $500,000. Besides the usual curriculum deemed n cessary for such a school, the Wesleyan University hi\ recognized and provided for some special lines of work required by the demand of th? time. The call for more thoroughly equipped teachers, coming up from all parts of the state creating a demand beyond that which the state institutions could supply, Wesleyan University entred this field by the establishment; first, of a normal department which has since been deve: iped und expanded into the Teachers.' College, which meets every requirement of </seg>
            <seg id="p748">592 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT Pfor the first and second grade state certificates, the life pro - certificate, and the university certificate. Thus NebnasJca is making its contribution to the maintenance of the public f the state by supplying a large number of teachers necessary purpose. Then the demand for trained and trustworthy young men and women for positions in the business world is being met by a School of Commerce, in which bookkeeping, banking, shorthand, typewriting, telegraphy, and their allied subjcts, are taught according to the latest, improved methods. KThe Conservatory of Music, for the accommodation of which the C. hite Memorial building was erected, has already taken high rank ig such institutions in the wtst. The School of Expression provides the best and most up-to-date methods of instruction in voice and physical culture, elocution, gesture, dramatic art, impersonation, literary interpretation, and extemporaneous ■peaking. Ample opportunity is given the students, in the public recitals, to get actual experience In public speaking. Though th? Nebraska Wesleyan University has been in the field only 20 years it has property to the value of $500,000, and an endow - ment of $100,000, and has had an attendance enrollment of 12,649; a total enrollment of 9,500 different students; and has graduated 1,564. Great as has been the success under preceding chancellors, es - pecially under Dr. D. W. C. Huntingtom, the new chancellor, Dr. William J. Davidson, taking advantage of the improved conditions, is planning still larger things, and the prospects for a new era of progress tor ffcihr— Ira Wesleyan University were never brighter than at the present. The growing demand is for higher education Which the church school alone cam supply in its broadest s.nse, including the spiritual nature of man, which alone can fit him for the adequate dlMbarge of all the functions of life as determined by all his relation - ships, including his relationship to material nature, of which he is to be the master; his relationship to himself, in which the higher nature is to have absolute control of the lower; and to his fellow men, in which he U to regard them as brothers and treat them accordingly; and to God, to whose will he is to bow hi absolute and reverent submission. However Teat the progress made by the state in its educational work, the limit beyond which it cannot go stops far short of the actual demands of man for the culture thut he needs to fit him for a complete life, in all his relations; and the church must needs stay in the field to supply this deficiency and carry on the necessary educational work on the higher spiritual level. In brief, the Nebraska Wesleyan University stands to - day, first of all, for a hig'h standard of education. Its curriculum con - forms to the requirements of the University Senate of the Methodist Episcopal Church and Its conditions of graduation and reception of degree* are, to say the least, not below those maintained in state uni - versities. It stands for such work as is" accepted at its face in the grad - uate schools of older universities. </seg>

St. cNleay' s c/lcademy. O'Neill By Mother M. Leonie. To write an historical s.ketch of St. Mary's Academy, one must recede farther into the shadows of the past, than almost a decade of years, when the walls of this well-known institution began to rise on the eminence, which it now adorns. As early as eighteen hundred ninety, Very Reverend M. F. Cassia y, aided by his zealous and generous parishoners, had completed the erection of a handsome edifice costing twenty thousand dollars. Just one week previous to the arrival of the Sisters who were to take charge of it, fire broke out in the building; and, in a few hours, the first St. Mary's Acadamy was a mass, of crumbling ruins. Whether the fire was of incendiary origin will probably never be known; however, the shock to priest and people was so great, that for several years no attempt was made to rebuild the academy. Doubtless, too, it w«jb thought that the heavy, financial loss would render the erection of another building quite impossible for years to come; but special needs develop speciall resources.

Father Cassidy had recourse to the Sisters of St. Francis, i Provincial Mother House was then in Buffalo, Xew York; and be ed them to erect a new St. Mary's. Academy. Perhaps a brief 'account of this religious congregation might be of interest. It was founded in 1836, in Heytihuizen, Holland, where the 'beautiful Mother House of the entire Congregation, St. Elizabeth's College and Normal Training School, is situated. Besides, this, the congregation has many other foundations in Holland and in Germany, including "Xonnenwerth," built in the fourteenth century, and sit - uated on an island in the Rhine near Rolandseck, so famous in legend and in story. This particular congregation also has numerous colleges and schools in South America, missions, in Afric-i and in the Bast Indes. and twenty-two establishments in the United States. At present, the new Provincial Mother House. "Stella Niagara Seminary." is in course of construction, on a beautiful estate, fronting the Niagara River, two miles below the falls. The object of this sister-hood is threefold, the service of the sick, the care of orphans, and the educa - tion of youth; but it is chiefly by it3 educational work that it is known. The congregation was established in this country at Buffalo, New York, in 1878; and the annails of those early years ehow, that to the high vocation of religious teachers, the Sisters of St. Francis added an apcr.tolic spirit; for the records tell, that from the small band, none of whom could be well spare), a few were sent to St. Francis' Mission, Rosebud, South Dakota, wihere they instructed two hundred Sioux Indians in the saving trutihs of religion. This mission and another, founded a few years later at Pine Ridge agency, are today providing tor the needs of soul, mind, and 'body of over five hundred Indian -en. But, to return to St. Mary's Academy. It was one of the loveliest days of early spring. The morning sun brightened the aonely road that Jeads from Holy Rosary Mission, South Dakota, to Rushville, Nebraska, when three Sisters bade an affectionate farewell to the scene of former labors, to begin anew in other fields. These good religious were the foundresses of St. Mary's Academy. Arrived at O'Neill, they were formally received and heartily welcomed by the Pastor of St. Patrick's Church, Very Reverend Father Cassidy, and a delegation, Tepreeeoting the •people of the parish and the citizens of O'Neill. This memorable day was April eighteenth, nineteen hundred. The work of beginning the erection of the academy was not delayed a single day; aivi the bravely surmounted difficulties of the work, which to less courageous souls have been deemed insurmountable, testify to the seal and activity of the workers. Through the succeeding spring ummer. th.e work went steadily on; and yet it was laite in October ny part of the building was habitable.

In June, nineteen hundred, the number of boarders had increased to twenty; and the present enrollment is in excess of eighty, making a total enrollment, at (his writing, of two hundred seventy. The first class, consisting of seven members, wus graduate! from St. Mary's in nineteen hundred three. Since then the members o: succeeding class have been required to secure a county teacher's cer - tificate before graduation. In consequence, thJpty-eight of the fifty-one graduates, wtho have gone forth from St. Mary's, are engaged in the profession of teaching. Four are at present members of the faculty of the O'Neill public school; two are teaching in the public schools, of Seattle, Washington; one is a teacher in the Butte, Montana, high school; one is teaching in Atkinson, Nebraska; one in St. Agnes' Academy, Alliance, Nebraska; one in Buffalo, New York; one is prin - cipal of the public schools in Verdel Nebraska; and so on to the end of the list. Each one has made a marked success of her work and each one has been loyal to the teachings of her Alma Miter, thus contributing much to the name and fame of St. Mary's. It has 'been the design of tih.e Steters of St. Francis to provide professional training for their students as soon ae possible; and this year a Normal Training Class, consisting of twenty-five men: be organized, under the direction and supervision of the State Depart - ment of Public Instruction. This is not the place for discussion, in detail, of the course of studies followed in St. Mary's. The very aim of the school and the fact, that the course pursued is the one app by the State University, insures a wise choice and arrangement Knowledge is carefully distinguished from wisdom, and the student is taught to realize that the diploma she receives testifies less to k: edge gained than to love for knowledge* awakened. In addition to the graduation requirements in the classical 'and the modern languages,, the arts and sciences; homekeeping and adorning are included in the allotment of time at St. Mary's. Music is taught as a science and as an art, and the work of this department has won high praise from nm.-icians of note. 9t. Mar^ Art School has long been nated for the thoroiiL of its training.

College View By President C. C. Lewis. Educational work among Seventh-day Adventists in the Mississippi Valley began with the Minnesota Conference School at Minneapolis, in the fall of 1888. This school was the germ of Union College. R Union College was founded in 1890. Ground was broken for the lings April 10 of that year, and it was dedicated Sept. 24, 1891, ident W. W. Prescott giving the dedicatory address, and Chancellor Canfleld, of the University of Nebraska, the address of welcome. The college is located about three miles southeast of the city limits of Lincoln, on an eminence overlooking the city and surrounding country, hence the name, College View, assumed by the thriving village of about a thousand inhabitants which has grown up about the college. Union College is under the ownership and management of the Central Union Conference of Seventh-day Adventists, consisting of the confer - ences of Nebraska, Kansas, Wyoming, Colorado and Missouri. The plant consists of a main college building, two dormitories, power house, shops, and farm, and is valued at about two hundred thousand dollars. The entire property as estimated by the appraisers appointed by the state, was originally valued at three hundred and five thousand dollars, but the north dormitory was a few years ago, with a portion of the campus, sold to the Nebraska Conference to be used aa a sani - tarium. The present worth of the college property above the liabilities la $182,424.70. The main object of the school is to train workers, for the various departments of the denominational work in this and foreign countries, and for this purpose collegiate, academic, ministerial, normal, com - mercial, music, Swedi&amp;h, Danish and German departments are main- </seg>

It is affiliated with the Nebraska m for the training of nurses, and with the Medical Department ate University for the training of physicians. Most of these have medical missionary work in view. All the manual labor of the institution is done by the dormitory students under foremen, each student being required to work one hour per day as a part of his tuition, he receiving credit on expenses for extra work. The rate for furnished room, heat, light, washing, bath room privileges, and tuition is ninety dollars per year. Table board is served on the special order plan and ranges from forty-five dollars to seventy-five dollars per year of thirty-six weeks, making the neces - sary school expenses one hundred and thirty-five to one hundred and sixty-five dollars per year. Since its opening Union College has en - rolled 7,586 students, and has graduated about 260 persons, from its various departments. The enrollment has been gradually rising the put few years until it reached 560 last year, which is next to the highest enrollment of 608 in 1892 and 1893. The list of presidents is as follows: William W. ?»reseott, 1891-2 James W. Lougfohead, 1893-5 Eli B. Miller, 1896. N. W. Kauble, 1897. W. T. Bland, 1898-1900. Lewis A. Hoopes, 1901-1903 Charles C. Lewis, 1904 York College. By President Wm. E. Schell. iYork College is the pride of the city of York and of York county one of the standard institutions of Nebraska and the west. It was created by a single individual for the sake of gain, but by the sd efforts of thousands for the sole purpose of helping earnest h to secure a. thorough education at nominal rates of expense, 1st the most healthful surroundings and the best Christian in - icee. lit was the outgrowth of the Gibbon Collegiate Institute, a school of ■academic grade, which did four years of educational work (1886 to 1890), under United Brethren auspices. But the location was unsatis - factory and the people of the denomination in Nebraska felt the need of a school of collegiate rank. In consequence York College came Into existence. t August 26, 1890, was the date of its founding, its Articles of Incor - :ion being signed by Judge D. T. Moore, Lee Love, C. J. Nobes, . Sedgwick, M. D., F. O. Bell, Rev. Edward A. Leeper, D. D., J. D .Countermine, D. D., Judge George W. Post, Judge A. C. gomery, Rev. F. W. Jones, Rev. G. F. Deal, and Judge N. A. Dean. </seg>
            <seg id="p758">598 8TATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT While thousands of others in York and York county, and out over the state and beyond, have contributed money and influence toward the establishment of this Institution of learing, the above-named gentlemen may properly be accounted ita founders. The flve lust named are worthy of special mention for their efforts In securing the college for York and York for the college, moulding sentiment in its favor, talking up the enterprise and standing under the financial burdens. Judge Post served on the Board of Trustees for ten years, the first two years as ita president, and through the whole history of the college to the present day has never denied it a financial fivor. Judge Montgomery was, a member of the Executive Board for nearly eleven years, till the date of his death, nine years of which time he was also President of the Board of Trustees. He was an officer of marked faithfulness and efficiency. Messrs. Deal and Jones traveled over the country and secured the bulk of the money which was put into the work during the first seven yeure. Judge Dean has been a member of the Board of Trustees and of the Executive Board from their organization to the present time, and through the entire i, with the exception of a single year, has served is treasurer. His service with, that of Mr. Jones and Mr. Deal was especially valuable ping to tide the college over the panic of 1893 to 1896. Others who have served ae President of the Board of Trustees., are aa follows: Judge A. B. Taylor, 1901; Ex-Lieutenant Governor E. A. Gilbert 1902 to 1905; Supt. W. W. Stoner, 1905 to 1908; Rev. W. C. Miller from June, 1908, to the present time. Elders W. P. Caldwell and E. W. Johnnon, in connection with their work in the ministry, did much to encourage the undertaking during its first year*. Two weeks after the date of its incorporation, the doors were opened to students, only eleven registering on the first day. Its quarters were rented rooms in the Wirt block. Though very unsuitable for college purposes, they served as a makeshift until a building could be erected. A more beautiful site could not be found in the state of Nebraska — a gentle eminence in the eastern part of the city, the highest ground in York county. Here on a campus of eleven acres the first building was erected, 'and dedicated in June, 1892. It is a splendid edifice of brick and stone, 88x99 feet, basement and three stories, beautiful in architectural design, and in approaching the city from any direction can be seen for many miles. It is unusually well planned for college purposes, and is now thoroughly furnished and equipped. The recita - tion rooms are large and light. The commercial room covers nearly half of the second floor. The chapel will seat about six hundred people. The literary halls are among the finest in the state. This building also affords shelter for the library, which contains about 2,500 volumes; for the museum, which has several hundred feet of shelf -room filled with specimens in geology, zoology, and botany; and for the laboratories, which are well supplied with apparatus to facilitate the work in the natural sciences. </seg>

            <seg id="p761">599 In 1902 it became evident that more room would have to be provided to accommodate the rapidly increasing attendance. Plans were at once set on foot for another building, which was erected in 1903-1904, and dedicated on January 21, 1905. It is 80x36 feet, of 'brick, basement and three floors, containing thirty-five rooms, besides halls, closes.ts and bath rooms. This building is devoted to the Con - servatory of Music and Ladies Dormitory. It is heated by steam as Is also the main building, and both are supplied with city water and electric light. I The Board of Trustees has grown wHh the passing years, and is composed of five trustees chosen from York county, three trustees l each of four Annual Conferences of the United Brethren In Christ, three trustees from the Alumnal Association. The present board is e up of prominent ministers, leading educators, skilled professional , and thorough-going men of business. There is also an Executive rd of six members, all residents of York, whose duty it is to carry the will of the Board of Trustees. Such strong managing boards an assurance to all patrons that their interests will be carefully ■ded and wisely conserved. KRev. J. George, A. M., D. D., was president of York College from ist, 1890, to August, 1894. The average yearly enrollment during arm was 176. tRev. W. S. Reese, Ph. M., D. D., succeeded President George, served for a period of three years. During his time the average ly enrollment was 149. The large debt incurred by the erection of main building, became a heavy burden in his administration, g to the financial panic and crop failure, both, of which swept over vest at the same time. Rev. William E. 6chell, A. M., D. D., was. called to take charge od August 3, 1897. That wus a dark day in the history of the insti - tution. Every dollar of the great debt was due and suits entered for collection. There was nothing in the treasury to stay the impending crisis. Nearly all of the trustees advised giving up the work. Every member of the faculty had resigned except J. E. Maxwell, M. S., Professor of Natural Sciences, and Mrs. D. E. Sedgwick, Director of the Music Department. The sum tot'al of the enrollment for the year preceding was 72. No catalogue had been issued. The details of the succeeding years cannot here be given. It is enough to say that the entire situation was speedily changed. A new faculty was installed. The debt was paid. Thousands of dollars were spent for additional equipments. In due time the second building was ereoted at a cost of $25,000. and paid for; the courses of study improved and strengthened; the faculty enlarged. By these forward movements York College has attained high rank among the educational institutions of the state. An effort is now well under way to secure $50,000 for endowment. A third buWdln« will soon be erected, the basement of which is already </seg>

I The average yearly enrollment during the first five years of Pres - t Sohell's term was 281. The average yearly enrollment during secood five years of his term was 400. The enrollment for his ?nth year was 501. The above -figures do not include pupils of the Model School. The present year is going nicely, with a larger i dance than ever 'before for the corresponding period, and with ?ring prospects for continued success and growth. To the present time there have been 3,194 different students in York College. Some of them have been in attendance for eight years; four in the academy and four in the college proper. The aggre - gate sum of the yearly registrations is 5,112, or an average of 284 for each of the eighteen years. KThe total number of graduates reaches up to 376. Of these, 81 taken degrees. The students have ailways been of a most excellent class, and the graduates are toiling in fields of usefulness, this wide world over, even in India, China. Porto Rico and the Philippines. In the large cities of the nation and in almost all of the cities and towns of Nebraska they are doing a good and honorable part in the business and professional work of the world. Their ranks, include college presidents, college professors, ministers, missionaries, civil service men, lawyers, judges, physicians, merchants., musicians, mechanics, farmers, soldiers, seamen, superintendents of schools, teachers, public officers, druggists, chemists, •aatyen, and other vocations worthy of note. And many, though not completing courses of instruction, have gone forth after terms or years of profitable association and study, with increased knowledge, improved powers, and larger life, and are now filling useful positions in the industrial pursuits and professions of this busy age. The passing days, ever &gt;mi anon, bring back the story of their success, and their Joy over the good bargain of time and money spent for the precious jewels of knowledge. BYork College has official recognition by the State Department of ic Instruction, in accord wilth which it has authority to issue all es of teachers' state certificates. Said recognition was secured on waxy 8, 1905, and since that date fifty-nine state certificates have issued. ■ In reference to the departments and courses It may be said that are up to the standard in every particular. BThe Collegiate Department offers four courses of study: Classical, &gt;sophical. Scientific, and LHerary, each of four years, and leading e corresponding college degrees.

EARLY HISTORY OF PERU N'o one would thiDk of writing a sketch of the history of the Nebraska State Normal School at Peru without consulting the excellent manuscript history prepared by the first president of that school, Pro - fessor J. M. McKenzie. In fact, no one could write a sketch of the hi&amp;tory of the school without dealing with matters contained in this history, for Professor McKenzie has admirably covered the ground of the early history of the State Normal School. I The Nebraska State Normal School began its existence at the same Nebraska became a state. Settlements at this time had not ded very far westward from the Missouri river. Beatrice, a town then less than five hundred inhabitants, was the farthest town from the Missouri river in the South P]|itte country, while there was no place in the North Platte country west of the river nearly so targe. So wild was the country west of the Blue that In the spring of 1868 when a Methodist minister was appointed by the conference to a charge on Cub Creek, twelve indies west of that town, he eat down and wept at the thought of going so far from civilization and endangering his life among the wild Indians. At that time in the South Platte country, Nebraska. City was the most important place. Brownville, Pawnee City, Falls City, Tecvmseh, and Weeping Water were the other more central points around which the settlers had taken their homesteads. The stage coach and other private conveyances were the only means of travel. Omaha, Nebraska City, Brownville, and Falls had the luxury of listening to the whistle of the locomotive on the east of the Missouri. To one who goes to Peru today and sees there the excellent buildings, well equipped, situated on one of the most picturesque campuses in the United States, there comes a feeling that there must have been marvelous progress made during the last forty years. When this visitor learns also of the vast army of alumni that has gone out from the school — men and women who have taken responsible positions as superintendents, principals of high schools and teachers in all the gradeF of city and village schools — he is still more impressed with the magnificent influence of this school in moulding the educational history of the state. Then should he attend the morning chapel exercises and face eight hundred of Nebraska's finest young teachers preparing for their work, he could scarcely believe that a school of this kind has sprung from such a small beginning. To such a visitor, the story of the early school at Peru would seem almost unreal, in fact, more like a fairy tale. There are those yet living in Peru who relate &lt;with pride this fairy ■tonrof A SEMINARY AT PERU. In the summer of 1866, Reverend H. Burch, at that time the </seg>

He was doubtless inspired to this work by reason of the excellent success of the Nemaha Valley Seminary, located earlier in Pawnee City. Through the earnest efforts of Rev.

M. ■ nzie cf Pawnee City was elected principal and Mrs. C. B. McKenzie, preceptress of the new KfcOoL In April, 1866, the corner stone of the new building was laid, Elder H. T.

The floors of the building were of undrew ad green cottonwood lumber, the stairways were of a very primitive char - acter and the doors into the chapel, or large basement room, were of rough cottonwood with large wooden latches. SCHOOL SITE DONATED. I A school site of sixty acres was jointly donated to the tru le Peru Seminary by Dr. J. F. Neal, Rev. H. Burch, and Mrs C. [cKenzie. It was a wild tract covered with a growth of under - 4 and small trees — the babitat of wolves, skunks, racoon and deer. e would the visitor of that day think that the time would come when such a distinguished and cultured Bostonian as Doctor ihip, editor of the "New England Journal of Education," after ng Peru should write in his excellent paper as follows: I "Peru, Nebraska, has the best natural setting of any p.tate normal ol in the United States. It overlooks the Missouri River and val - i8 on the highland?., far above the town and valley, is on the crest he hill looking off in both directions, is in the forest primeval, a large variety of noble trees.

There are sixty acres in the forest nds of the school. 1 only know sixty-four of the state normal ols, and many of these have beautiful grounds, but no one of them sixty 6uch acres as ther.e. If cue of the schools that I do not know superior grounds, it would be interesting to know of it." FIRST TERM, PERU SEMINARY. The first term of the Peru Seminary was taught in a snrrill room in town but the winter term began the first week in January, 1867, in the new building on the hill. Fifty-eight students were enrolled for the winter term. The tuiticn charged those who simply took the common branches war. five dollars per term, while those who took some of the higner branches paid seven and one-half dollars, per term. One dollar and a haJf was charged for Incidental expenses, and four dollars per term for room rent to tnor.e who lived in the building. From these sources the whole expense of the school was to be met at least for that term. As the winter wa? exceptionally severe and there wm no money with which to buy fuel. Principal McKenzie was obliged t» </seg>
            <seg id="p768">604 to procure most of the fuel from tbe trees near the building, putting In most of bis time after school and Saturdays in preparing it Up to this time a pot metal farm bell was used to regulate the work of the school, but the extreme cold weather made thds bed! too brittle to stand the strain and it broke. A sentiment was then awakened in the school to purchase a bell of true bell metal. To aid this enterprise, the young ladies proposed a chicken supper, the young men assisting In procuring and dressing tbe chickens. As a result of this pleasant and successful social, sixty-five dollars was added to the bell fund, which was later increased by personal subscriptions to one hundred and twenty-live dollars. This new bell that rang the changes of the school In 1867 from a private to a public school still calls to duty from the belfry tower. It might be interesting to know that this bell has been rung at 9:30 in the evening each school day since the year 1867, though it rings now simply to keep up the old custom. During the spring vacation of this year, Principal McKenzie and Rev. Burch attended the conference of the Methodist Episcopal church held at Omaha. At that meeting the matter of adopting the Peru Sem - inary and College as a conference school of the Methodist church, was thoroughly and warmly discussed, but the conference refused by vote to adopt the school. Some bitter feeling resulted because the conference bad refused to accept this school and it became a very important ques - tion as to what was the best thing to do. Some thought the school should be given to the state for a reform school. Others believed that It should be counted as a private seminary. Prin. McKenzie, thoroughly imbued with the missionary spirit, secured an agreement on the part of parties most interested that he should make an effort at the meeting of the firr.t state legislature to be held in Omaha in June of that year to turn the school over to the state for a normal school. Many, however, believed that it should be given to the state as a state university. Ool. T. J. Majors and William Daily, both ardent friends of the school, represented Xemaha county in tbat session. Col. Majors at first urged Peru as the location of the state universiy, but finally compromised by locating the unversity at Lincoln and the state normal school at Peru. lgh the wise efforts cf Col. Majors, William Daily and Hon. A. B. Fuller of Ashland and others, the state was induced to accept the build - ing and grounds as the location for its state normal school. It then appropriated $3,000 in cash and provided an appropriate land endow - ment, in pursuance of the act of the legislature to establish a normal school, passed June 20, 1867, the grounds and buildings with all the appurtenances were deeded to the state in August of that year. The Bret board cf education was Sterling P. Majors, Daniel C. Oole, William Dr. J. F. Xeal, A. D. Fuller, James Sweet and S. D. Bills. The board organized by electing S. P. Majors president and D. C.

            <seg id="p769">605 FIRST TERM STATE NORMAL SCHOOL The first term of the Nebraska State Normal School opened October 24, 1867. Sixty-five students were enrolled, most of them the same students that had attended the seminary the year previous. The course of study in the seminary had been arranged to prepare students to enter college, hence the normal course not including the college pre - paratory studies, became at once very unpopular. The board was forced to allow students to enter the seminary course if they desired to keep the students then in attendance, but the principal tactfully arranged to establish a normal department. The tuition at this time was still $8.00 per term for branches, above the common English branches. With the consent of the board it was agreed with those students who were willing to enter a course covering as a text-book, Page's "Theory and Practice of Teaching" that they should pay but $4.00 per term instead of $8.00. students were to constitute the normal department of the school. This normal department was given life and vitality when on Novem - ber the 11th, the following declaration to teach was drawn up and sigped by sixteen students: "I hereby declare my intention to become a teacher in the schools of this state and agree that for three after leaving the normal school, I will report in writing to the prin of said school in June and December of each year where I have been and how employed." The class so formed for a time recited at the close of school each day that it might not interfere with the regular work of the other departments of the school. Later sixteen other students were added to this department. But normal training of n«ceesjty was regarded as incidental. Through the wisdom and skill of Prin. MicKenzie, the teachers in all branches pursued in the school began quietly to introduce as far as possible normal methods and began to make the school so far as circumstances would allow a real normal school. As the state appropriation was insufficient to fully equip the school, many hardships were endured. The janitor work and wood supply were still looked after by the principal as in previous years. A large number of books were donated for the library and many governmental documents were secured directly from Washington. Another chicken supper and social resulted in establishing a fund for the purchase of apparatus, with which, a fair microscope and several other useful pieces, of apparatus were purchased. NORMAL INSTRUCTION NEW EVERYWHERE. I en we remember that the first normal school in America was d and established about the year 1840 and that in 1860 there a than twenty normal schools in the United States, we do not that the people saw no special use for such schools. Normal at that time were considered an expensive experiment. The of the school was consequently slow, but with the energy and of the principal and his small faculty, the school gradually a influence and in usefulness. </seg>
            <seg id="p770">606 THE SECOND YEAR. The fall term of the normal school opened In September of 1869 with J. M. McKenzle principal, P. H. Martin of Michigan, associate principal, and Mrs. C. B. McKenzle, preceptress. Twenty-nine students were enrolled as normal students, thirty-five as seminary students and twenty-«ix In the model school, making a total of eighty-eight for the I In the winter of this year the legislature appropriated $10,000 h amount paid off the indebtedness accrued, put a new roof on school building, and enabled the board of education to add to the bus of a library and to procure some important pieces of apparatus, spring term of 1869 was omitted to save expense as comparatively students could attend, and the board permitted Professor Martin ■e the building for a private school at his own expense. THE FIRST GRADUATING CLASS. The winter and spring terms of 1870 were very successful, the normal department numbering forty-one pupils and the seminary forty. Near the close of the spring term the faculty named Mr. George E. Howard 'and Misf, Anna Mborehead, now Mrs. Anna Joy, as fit can - didates for graduation, they having completed the regular course of study with, great credit. The board of education at that time presented each with a diploma of the school, authorizing them to teach In any public school in the state without further examination. Pro - fessor Howard has. since become one of America's most distinguished research scholars, being at the present time the professor of Institutional History in the University of Nebraska. Mrs. Anna Joy is still a most highly respected resident of the village of Peru. A CRITICAL PERIOD In November, 1870, Prin. McKenzie was elected superintendent of public instruction at the very height of prosperity of the new school. Soon after the state election, the board of education chose Henry F. Straight, &amp; graduate of Oberlin College, as. principal to succeed Prof. McKenzie. Prof. Straight was a young man of more than ordinary ability, a thorough student, ardent in the investigation of natural history, a scholar and Investigator rather than an executive. A liberal appropriation assisted the school in passing through this critical period. At a meeting of the legislature in the winter of 18 71, the representa - tives from Xemaha county, S. P. Majors in the House and Col. T. J. Majors in the Senate, afked for and secured an adequate appropriation for the running expenses of the school, and also a levy of one quarter mill tax on the grand assesment roll of tne state for the erection of a suitable school building at Peru. As a result of this liberal appro - priation the board of education were enabled to erect a building, now known as NORMAL HALL. This new building was erected in the summer of 1871 and has atopd during the intervening thirty-seven years with very little </seg>
            <seg id="p771">LECTURES, REPORTS, ADDRESSES AND PAPERS 607 expense to keep it in good condition. It was regarded at that time as a model of convenience and was then the best school building in the state. The stone for the basement was taken from a quarry three miles west of Peru. The erection of this building assured the per - manence of the school for many years, until the erection of the new chapel finally put an end to all discussion as to whether or not the normal school should be moved from Peru. Principal Straight was a brilliant scholar, devoted to his,, work, but eccentric as an executive, and he consented to accept the chair of natural science under a new principal. PRINCIPAL WILLIAMS. During the summer of 1871, the board of education realized the importance of securing the services of a map broad in knowledge, wise in dealing with students, elevated in ideals, of life, strong in his impress en the life and character of hi^. pupils. With this in mind they finally selected Dr. A. D. Williams, upon the recommendation of such edu - cators as Wickers.ham of Pennsylvania, William T. Harris of St. Louis, and others. Doctor Williams was a clergyman of the Free Will Baptist Church, a graduate of Hamilton College at New York, and for a time had been superintendent of the public schools at Lawrence, Musf.achu- Later he was president of West Virginia University and for a time superintendent of public instruction in the state of West Virginia. He remained in the position of principal of the school for one year. (Principal Williams, not fulfilling the expectation of the board in at - t:;hing himself fully to western conditions, was not re-elected at the close of the year.) The names of the faculty under his administration are: Dr. A. D. Williams, principal; Henry H. Straight. A. B.; Perry irtin, A. M.; Miss Kate Elliott, preceptress; Miss Emma Dicker - man, model department; Mi?.s Anna A Kenney, instrumental music. The number of students in attendance during this year just passed the oLe hundred mark. GENERAL MORGAN SUCCEEDS DR. WILLIAMS. The beard of education felt it necessary to secure a man who would restore the school again to the confidence of the people. They decided that they would elect no one with whom they had not some personal acquaintance and that they would not rely on recommenda - tions ':s the evidence of success. At that time, General T. J. Morgan was filling the Baptist pulpit at Brownville, and his fame as a ripe schc'.ar, a true, dignified gentleman, a successful leader of men in the Civil War, induced the board to invite him to undertake the manage - ment of the school. After much deliberation and with the assurance of the hearty co-operation of the board. General Morgan finally consented to accept the position of principal of the school. MARKED PROGRE9S UNDER GENERAL MORGAN. ■General Morgan's administration is characterized by system and ged courses of study.

The faculty of the school was ged and the attendance increased under Gen. Mlorgan's leadership 1 students, being a gain over the previous year of over 170 pupils. THE FIRST SUMMER SCHOOL. Sensing the need for an extension of normal training. General Morgan provided the means of bringing the advantages of the school to a number of tttachers who could not attend the school as regular teachers. To meet the wants of such teachers, an institute of six weeks was. conducted at the normal school, beginning on the second Thursday in September, 1873. Classes in the common branches were organized and instruction given in school economy, methods of instruc - tion, gymnastics 'and vocal music. The model school was kept open for the observation of teachers 1n attendance. CHANGED TUITION REGULATIONS. Under General Morgan's administration, tuition in the normal department was made free to all residents of the state on signing a declaration of intention to teach in the schools, of the state. Gentle - men entering this department must be sixteen years of age, ladies fifteen years. Tuition in the academic department was $24 per year. This was applied to pupils from other states when entering the normal department. Tuition in the model department ranged from five to eight dollars per term depending upon the grade of advancement. In later years all this has been changed, allowing any person the full privilege of the school upon paying a matricuation fee of $5.00 with the exception of the nominal tuition fee yet charged in the model school. GENERAL MORGAN RESIGNS. At the close of hi? second year, a year of exceptional prosperity, a year which marked a gain of eighty-six pupils over the previous year, General Morgan resigned his position in Nebraska and accepted the position of professor of church history in the Baptist Theological Seminary, a position which offered a much wider field for usefulness and brighter prospects for the future. During the two years of his administration, he left a strong impress upon the life of the school. He wrote much in the interests of the normal, attended teachers' Institutes, labored with the members of the legislature, impressing them with the importance of liberal appropriations. With all this, he was himself an earnest student, using his spare moments in the study </seg>
            <seg id="p773">609 STUDENT ACTIVITIES. Kit is well to pause in the history of the school for a moment to e-ihe ideals of the school as shown in student activities. PHILOMATHEAN SOCIETY. — Soon after the organization of the normal school, a literary society was formed called the Philomathean society. This was open to hoth men and women. The society met on Friday eveniDg and became a wonderful factor in the school for training young men in the art of thinking and expressing thought while faciDg an audience. The literary life of the school was further promoted by rhetorical exercises held weekly during the first ten years of the school. Select readings were given by some student each day in the chapel exercises. K PRAYER MEETING. — The Tuesday night prayer meeting became &gt;ral power in the school, leading the students, to think of the us side of life. It was usually well attended by both teachers pupils and is continued to this, day in the form of a largely ded noon-d'ay prayer meeting. I MONTHLY SOCIALS. — A social gathering of the whole school held monthly on Saturday evenings. These gatherings were inter - led by quiet games and plays usually impromptu in char.: ;times short programs with music, readings, recitations, char :)antomines were given. All these school activities awakened a true )1 spirit or an "esprit de corps" as Gen. Morgan was woDt to which gave the whole school an upward trend in its conduct, r and research. High ideals of life were inculcated both in the room and out, and the general influence of the school was of the sst order. ADMUNISTRATION OF DOCTOR FREEMAN. In the summer of 1874 the board of education had again to face the problem of securing a new principal. It was thought that some state educator should be honored with this position, but no Nebraska man appeared to be just the right man for the place. Just before the fall term began, Rev. Azel Freeman of Greenwich. Kentucky, was elected &gt;as principal. As he could not commence his work in the school until January, Professor W. E. Wilson, professor of natural science, was made acting principal in the interim. The meager records of this year make it impossible to give the number of studen attendance, or to tell the character of the work done. The model department was temporarily discontinued 'and the school had only two departments, the normal aad preparatory. School interest seemed to lag somewhat this year by reason of the unorganized state of both faculty and students. Dr. Freeman was doubtless a true gentleman and scholar, and as far as the records of his work in the school are con - cerned, they show that his work was satisfactory to the board. The work was not congenial to him, however, and he felt out of place, con - sequently at the end of the school year he resigned his position. </seg>
            <seg id="p774">610 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT PROFESSOR ALBERT NICHOLS PROMOTED Upon the resignation of Dr. Freeman, Professor Albert Nichols, who was at the head of the preparatory department, and who had been selected for this work by reason ot his success as superintendent of the Ashland public schools, was promoted to the position of prin - cipal. Prof. Nichols was a refined, cultured gentleman of broad schol - arship. As early as October of his first year of service, the board of education was compelled to hold a meeting in Peru to consider whether the new principal should continue in that position. On the night of the Ml— ting, there was a general disarrangement of wagons, outbuildings and property in general, the method employed by the students to express their general disapproval of the new principal. A general (••Has prevailed that the board had made a mistake in promoting a member of the faculty to the position of principal of the school. Prof. Nichols had been very successful in the preparatory department and had the general good will of the pupils, and patrons. While the students were not displeased with him as a teacher, they did not consider him the man for the position, and he seemed to fail to win their respect. A difficulty was removed from the board by the prompt resignation of Prof. Nichols. PROFESSOR S. R. THOMPSON ELECTED. tThe board immediately elected Professor S. R. Thompson, Super - dent of the Agricultural College at Lincoln, to the princlpalship e school, who accepted the position and in a short time took his at its head. In many respects, Prof. Thompson was a most erful man. Quiet and childlike in spirit he gave the impression ■st a man of no force or energy. At first the students were at « loss how to estimate him, but when classes were called he seemed to challenge the quiet respect of every pupil. Each pupil who associated with him realized that he was a true companion and friend of the nt. The purity of his life and his high ideals blended intuitively in Ms conversation and the student unconsciously yielded to his in - fluence. Under Prin. Thompson's administration the model school was «ga!n organized, 1he faculty given more systematic directions for their work. During the year, 192 students were enrolled, not including pupi'.s of the model school. At the November election following, Prin. Thompson was offered a wijer field for usefulness by election to the of rtate Euperintendent of public instruction. He, therefore, re - flgned his position la the school' to toke up this larger work. During his incumbency in the office of state superintendent he used every mate means to build up the state normal school. At the close - office, he was called to a position in Westminster College, New uington, r&gt;a. GRADUATES AT THIS TIME.

ELECTION OF DOCTOR CURRY. Before the resignation of Prof. Thompson, as soon as it was un - derstood that he had been elected to the office for which he was nom - inated, he began to look about for a successor. While connected with the normal school at Bdinburg, Pennsylvania, Prof. Thompson became acquainted with a prominent educator by the name of Robert Curry, whom he felt was eminently qualified to succeed him. Therefore, on the resignation of Mr. Thompson, the board of education, relying on M« judgment, immediately elected Doctor Robert Curry principal, and Mrs. Jennie B. Curry teacher of language and methods and they com - menced work in the school, January 1, 1877. Doctor Curry gave his oonsent to 6erve on condttion that his wife could have a position in the school also. ADMINISTRATION' OF DOCTOR CURRY. Doctor Curry found the school well classified, orderly and ready for work. His methods were so nearly like those of his predecessor that the school commenced work wHhout a jar. Every forty minutes the whole school changed rooms, classes going from one teacher to another in an orderly manner, keepiDg step to the music of a piano heard thoughout the building. All recitations closed at 1:00 P. M. leaving the afternoon and evening for the preparation of lessons for the day following. Doctor Curry by his manner and undoubted strength of character and lofty ideals carried the school aDd pupils steidily forward. He had no pet subjects, no new or exciting methods of study or recitation, but insisted that thoroughness in the present studies pursued was most important. He was also intensely methodical and his language correct and stately. The first catalog in the F.?hool issued by Doctor Curry in the year 1877-8 showed an attendance in the normal school proper of 265 students, ladles 142, gentlemen 123. The average age was a little over nineteen years. Seventy pupils were enrolled in the model school, making a grand total of 355. As the years passed on this school received a. better class of students in a?e and preparation for normal work ,as the average work in the public schools was constantly growing better throughout the state. During the years of service of Doctor Curry 67 students graduated from the state normal school and many of these have proved themselves strong. u eful men and women. THE YEAR OF 1882 In the catalog of 1882 Doctor Curry says: "The year of 1882 </seg>
            <seg id="p778">612 catalog shows, an actual attendance of 318 pupils all preparing to teach. Of these, 45 are graduates from the elementary course, nearly all of whom are now engaged in teaching. The present seminary class in the higher course numbers fifteen while the larger classes looking to graduation from the elementary course comprise nearly one hundred. Of the whole number of students in attendance this year, 194 are young ladies and 124 gentlemen. 301 of them are from Nebraska and 17 of them from abroad. They represent in all 37 counties and 6 states. The average age Is about 19% years. A large majority of students have not been absent from chapel exercises or missed a recitation during the fall term and this has been true of many of them for the whole term." SOCIAL LIFE UNDER DOCTOR CURRY. I The social life of the students was not neglected. The literary ties were constantly enlarged. As a forerunner of the annual uet, now a fixture in the school. Doctor Curry gave the graduating and students a reception in his parlors previous to commencement, acouraged healthful sports and greatly enjoyed seeing his students f. Sot only was Doctor Curry himself a man of high ideals, sing everything low in word, thought and act, but he was a very ed Christian. His talks to the students in the Tuesday evening sr meetings were replete with deep religious thought. Doctor Curry : a genuinely religious man as well as. professional leader. DOCTOR CURRY RESIGNS. It is believed by those who know him best that Doctor Curry resigned at the very height of his power as a conscientious duty to himself, the school and the state, and his resignation was a crowning «ct of a long and useful life. The school was in the best possible condition, the board of education was delighted with his work and wu ready to grant every reasonable request. But like many other things done by him, the resignation came all at once as a great surprise to hia friends, no explanation being made. To faculty and students alike, his resignation seemed an impossibility. Doctor Curry felt that he had done his work for the school. He saw no means of pushing the school into a wider field of Influence over the state and he shrank instinctively from the effort to induce the legislature to provide better and more commodious buildings, hence, he felt It his duty to retire and give the position to another whose ambition would arouse the people and five the school a power to mould the educational life of the state to a much larger extent. PRINCIPAL GEORGE L. FARNHAM. At the resignation of Doctor Curry an effort was made to induce the first principal, J. M. McKenzie, now a most acceptable member of the faculty, to again become principal of the school. Prof. McKenzie could not be prevailed upon to accept the pflace previously filled so well </seg>
            <seg id="p779">613 the board cast about for a strong man and finally elected to the principalship Professor George L. Farnham, at that time super - intendent of the public schools in Council Bluffs. Prof. Farnham soon convinced the faculty and students, that he was master of the situation. He had been connected with the public schools of Syracuse X. Y., and in Binghampton, X. Y. He had held responsible positions in a number of other schools and had finally come wes.t for his own and his wife's health. THE FACULTY OF 1883. The fall term of 1883 opened with the following faculty: George L. Farnham, principal, teacher of psychology, ethics, and science and art of teaching; Miss Eliza C. Morgan, preceptress, teacher of Latin, rhetoric and general history; H. L. Grant, M. S., teacher of ph science and chemistry; J. M. McKenzie, A. M., teacher of mathematics and bookkeeping; A. K. Goudy, teacher of school economy, methods and training; Margaret K. Smith, teacher of school economy, methods and training; Mrs. Alice E. Goudy, teacher of Reading, drawing and penmanship; Clara Smith, teacher of language; Isabel P. Scott, teacher of United States history and geography; Prof. E. M. Lippett, teacher of vocal and instrumental music. With this excellent faculty Prof Farnham organized and carried forward the work of the school. Dur - ing the first year of h.is administration, 339 students were enrolled, of whom 217 were women and 122 were men. The graduation numbered 8, two men and six women. CHAPEL WIXG TO NEW BUILDIXG. During his second year. Prof. Farnham begun to work up a senti - ment for a new chapel building as an addition to the main building. The chapel at that time was in the third story and it was thought to be too difficult for students to ascend and desceDd twice each ckiy to attend general meetings of the school. At the next meeting of the legislature an appropriation was made for the new addition and it was completed in the summer of 1885. As. there had been no suitable rooms for chemistry and science apparatus or for proper recitation room for the use of that time, the basement under the new chapel wing was fitted up and devoted to that purpose. DOCTOR BESSEY CALLED IN. Professor Farnham at this time induced the board to purchase a large number of pieces of important apparatus especially for the study of light and electricity. A fine second-hand microscope of 200 diameter magnifying power was secured and as Prof. Grant of the science de - partment did not succeed in adjusting the lenses satisfactorily, Prof. Bessey of the State University was asked to lend his assistance. He came and succeeded in fixing the microscope. With the purchase of many other valuable pieces, of apparatus, the department of science was put in condition to do good work 'for the school!. Astron - omy, field work in geography, and the collection of specimens in natural history were encouraged. </seg>
            <seg id="p780">614 THE SENTENCE METHOD. Unlike his predecessor, Doctor Farnham took great interest in knowing the methods of each of his instructors. He became a real supervisor with keen interest in all the work of the school. In his facdfty meeting, he frequently spoke on advanced educational topics. He had prepared a small book on what he called "The Sentence Method of Teaching Reading," explaining his plan and giving his reasons. The word method was being discussed at that time in all school papers. He contended that the work carried on by the word method is purely mechanical, but when the child is given a perfect sentence, there is something in the mind that responds to the thought «o expressed. Colonel Farker, who heard of Prof. Farnham's sentence method, gave Prof. Farnham credit for originating the method. He considered Prof. Farnham a man of advanced thought and one of the most progressive educators of that day. THE PROGRESS OF THE SCHOOL. In the catalog of 4884 and 5, Doctor Farnham gives the condi - tion of the building, "Now warmed and ventilated by steam and pro - : with an ample system of waiter works" and says there were 395 students, in attendance, and ventures to predict that "with its corps of teachers selected for their professional skill and the hi?h character and earnest approval of its student?., it is believed that the school will continue to grow in usefulness and in the confidence of the peop'e and will take rank with the other Institutions of its kind in the country." In the spring of 1885 Prof Farnham assisted the teacher of science in constructing a large telescope of 240 diameters magnifying power and the science teacher erected on one side of the present brick observatory an observatory of wood octagonal in shape with movable dome with proper opening through which to place the tiles. Encour - aged by Doctor Farnham the students took wild delight in the study of astronomy and the work along this line ait that time was largely in - strumental in securing the present observatory and telescope now ■sed by the school. Prof. Farnham also encouraged the study of surveying, purchased a tnanr.lt instrument for the school, and gave rations as to the method of practical surveying. SOCIALS UNDER DOCTOR FARNHAM. Perhaps one of the most unique and original methods of inter - esting pupils at social gatherings was inaugurated by Doctor Farnham. There were then in the laboratory of physical science a number of fine microscopes ranging from 50 to 300 diameters in magnifying power. These instruments were placed on separate tables in the hall where the gathering would take place, each fitted with a slide displaying some minute insect, shell, section of wild plant, or animal tissue. The socials thus given by the faculty were usually class socials as w e students could not be entertained at one gathering. After the stuients bad assembled, the use of the microscope was explained and each student in turn was invited to take a peep at each slide. As </seg>
            <seg id="p781">615 Eas all had seeD the object in any microscope, the slide was taken nd a new one put in. Thus the evening passed quickly and the nts retired at its close "with, the sense of having spent a profitable n together." WORK OP DOCTOR FARXHAM. It is hard to say what the Nebraska State Normal School would have been without Prof. Farnham. Doubtless normal instruction in Ne - braska would never have received the impetus it did had not Doctor Farnham served ten years at the head of the state normal school. Dur - ing his ten years of service the normal school became firmly fixed in the state and performer! an unusual work in the inspiration of tear Not only was his mind a perfect storehouse of wisdom, experience, and original thought, but his heart was so completely in the work that he was emphatically a teacher loving his chosen life work and seeming to know just how to teach an inquiring mind and to teach others the fine art of inspiring pupils. In the class room his beaming face and flashing eye called out the bent and most earnest thought of his pupils like an electric flash, and many of Nebraska's prominent educators today still regard him as their ideal teacher. Miss Ellis,, in a beau - tiful tribute in the Golden Rod, 1902, says, "He was great as a man, as an educator, and m a citizen. In educational circles he is known as ■the author of 'The Sentence Method of Teaching Reading' and the greater part of his life in connection with schools was devoted to the promulgating of the principles underlying this method. He was a ologist of more than ordinary merit. In fact, his, broad ex - perience and profound erudition place him among educators of the first rank. His personal interest in the students resulted in the filial affection entertained for him by them. No one knew him but to honor him and to love him." MISS ELIZA C. MORGAN Miss Eliza C. Morgan began her work as preceptress of the State Normal School in the year 1872 on the recommendation of General Morgan, to whom she was not related. For twenty-five years her ser - vice in this capacity did much for the success of the school and even more to shape its most refined ideals. She was pleasant and gracious to thor,e who were prompt and dilligent in their duties, but she could be stern and strict with those who were careless and dilatory regarding the condition of their rooms. She giave herself up to reform and to improve the personal habits of her pupils- In the matter of dress and the care of the head, face, and hands, she was especially watchful and insistent. Personally, Mlrs Morgan was a perfect model, and she taught more effectively by her own appearance and thoroughness than by precept. Purity of speech and act, modesty of manner, sincerity and truth were priceless, jewels in her sight. Miss Morgan's impress was left indelibly on the life of all young women who came to the Peru State Normal School, who still remember her as a very dear friend, a wise counselor, a competent and thorough instructor. </seg>
            <seg id="p782">616 THE BOARD OF EDUCATION. The board of education is composed of seven members, two ex - officio, the state superintendent of public instruction and the state treasurer and five others, one appointed and one retiring each year. The governor now has &lt;the appointing power, though for the first four years, of the school the state superintendent of public instruction had this power. For the first years of its life the board was composed largely of men living in the vicinity of the school. APPOINTMENT OF MR. KENNEDY. When Prof. J. M. McKenzie was state superintendent, his. ex - perience in appointing a member of the board is told by him as follows: "Being a representative, we felt it incumbent upon us to appoint a man of that party. Mir. Kennedy of Omaha was suggested as a man emi - nently qualified for that position. Not knowing his initials, and seeing the name of Mr. B. E. B. Kennedy in the papers, we concluded he must be the man, and we made out the certificate of appointment and forwarded it to him. He accepted the position without hesitation, but shortly afterward we found out to our chagrin that we had ap - pointed one of the staunchest democrats in the state. It proved, however, to be a most fortunate mistake for the good of the school." Mr. Kennedy was appointed in 1872 and served the school until 1897, twenty-five years. f that time he was president of the board and presented the student graduates from year to year with their HON. J. T. SPENCER. In 1879 Hon. J. T. Spencer of Dakota City became a member of the board and held his position until 1899, twenty years. Like Mr. Ken - nedy he was greatly interested in the school, a gentleman of culture and wide research, an . .'i and inu resting writer, and one whose heart was in the work of higher education. Hon. William Daily w&lt;ae a member of the board of education for ten years, from 1875 to 1885. Mr. Daily was identified with all the efforts put forth for the good of the school In Its early history, and it is thought by many that the existence of the school owes as much to the persistent efforts of Mr. Daily as to any other one man. Mr. H. S. Kaley of Red Cloud was appointed a member of the board in 1873, and re-appointed in 1878, but died before the expiration of his term, and his brother, C. W. Kaley, wm appointed to fill out his unexpired term. Mr. H. S. Kaley was a young roan of push and energy, wide awake to every enterprise that made for growth in knowledge and true prosperity in material things. The school doubtless owes much to his influence with the men who held the reins of state government and whose good will toward it meant much for the school.

WORK OF COLONEL MAJORS. I The work of Colonel Majors deserves more than a passing notice, steadfast devotion to the interests of the school, his unreserved &gt;tion to the cause of education and his untiring efforts in behalf of school have won for him the admiration and good will of students the faculty of the school during all these years of the growth of institution. It was due to such untiring energy and resistless ition on the part of members of the board that the state nal school at Peru was enabled to take its position as a molder ducational thought. DOCTOR A. W. NORTON PRINCIPAL. Upon the resignation of Doctor Farnham as principal after ten years of service. Doctor A. W. Norton, an eminent educator of York, was elected principal, and served during the years 1893 to 1896. Under Doctor Norton's administration the expert idea in the training of teachers was more thoroughly emphasized and the practice school Idea was made the central thought in the training of teachers. Doctor Norton insisted that the practice school was the professional laboratory of the young teacher, and he insisted upon practice guided by expert crit - icism as the means of putting the final finish upon professional training. During his administration, also, the entrance requirements were raised and the standards of the school increased. The state normal accepted, without examinations, students well recommended for character and scholarship, provided they had studied the high school subjects by laboratory methods. Graduates from the higher course could now graduate from the literary, philosophic and English courses of the state university in three additional years.. The attendance of the school Increased until the normal department numbered 373, the practice school 182, making a total of ' FOUR LITERARY SOCIETIES. The Philomathean society which had been organized in 1870 and the Everett sociejy organized in 1886 were now joined by the Welling - tonian society in 1893 and the Junior society in 1S94. Together these four literary societies, with natural rivalry, provided ample means for literary training of the students. In 1894 the societies united to bring to the normal school the first lecture course. This lecture course, at first under the auspices of the literary societies, has. now become a permanent fixture of the school and is given under the asupices of the school. WORK OF DOCTOR NORTON. ■ Doctor Norton was a principal wholly devoted to his work, a of high ideals and one who in many ways proved a prophet of the and more advanced education to follow. At the close of his </seg>
            <seg id="p784">618 administration in 1896, he was r.ucoeeded by Doctor J. A. Beattie, who began his service in January of 1897. Doctor Beattie was an eminent scholar, whose life and influence are familiar to the educators of Nebraska today. Doctor 'Beattie is remembered aa a most progressive educator -in a trying tftne of the school development. With tireless ene»gy he addressed many hundreds of teachers' institutes, conducted educational rallies and meetings, besides being the general director of all the interest.*, of the school. With all his other work, he found time to sit quietly down in his office and outline enlarged courses of study. In the catalogue announcement of September 1, 1897, twelve groups of study are advertised as. offered. In all of the groups two main threads of thought were emphasized, which charac - terized the administration of Doctor Beattie. In the first place, he emphasized the need of trained teachers in primary and kindergarten work and did everything in his power to accentuate this training. At the other extreme of the college course he suggested that every grad - uate should pursue advanced courses of study in other institutions and his influence is still noticeable in the tendency today of large numbers of students who return to do graduate work in the normal school or to pursue advanced studies in higher institutions of learning. DORMITORY BURNED. With the burning of the dormitory, January 4, 1897, the question of the removal of the school due to its inaccessibility was raised. Many educators of the state felt that the state could now afford to move the school to a more central location, making it accessible to larger numbers of students. The state, however, had at thia time adopted the policy of insuring its own public buildings and the state legislature, true to the obligation imposed by the insurance principle, appropriated a sufficient amount for a new and more commodious dormitory, which was com - pleted and ready for occupancy in 1898, thus settling again for a time the question of removal and inaccessibility. WORK OF DOCTOR BEATTIE Doctor Beattie was known far 'and wide as the friend of every graduate of the normal school, as a big hearted father to all the students of the school. He is known today as the moulder of educational thought on the Pacific coast and as a worthy successor to James A. Garfleld as head of Hiram College. His power and skill as a teacher are difficult to estimate, until one has sat under the influence of his teaching. His. mind is a storehouse of fundamental facts and his soul U imbued with the teaching power to impart these facts. Doctor Beattie is today regarded as Nebraska's most eminent patriarch in education. DOCTOR CLARK PROMOTED RIn the year 1900, Doctor W. A. Clark, at that time the professor lucation and psychology in the normal school was promoted to principalship to succeed Doctor Beattie. Doctor Clark was. a </seg>

He brought to the position of principalship broad scholarship and a wide experience in the field of public education. DEDICATION OF ATHLETIC FIELD. During the early days of Doctor Clark's administration, a n athletic field formed between two wooded hillsides was del Thanksgiving Day in the year 1901. Thi Ion of thi marks a step in the broader life of the school and made it possible for the school to come in contact with at The field then dedicated has since been completed and the athletic life of the school has been placed on a permanent b this time, also, with the co-operation of students and patrol splendid greenhouse was. built, offering an opportunity for the stu to study plant life during all seasons of the year. THE FACULTY MEETINGS. K Doctor Clark was -essentially an organizer as well as. a sti: r Monday evening he met his faculty and together they engaged discussion of some fundamental pedagogical topic. The ft discussions prepared during his administration, could they be ?ted, would form a classic contribution to educational thou£ THE WORK OF DOCTOR CLARK. Doctor Clark has always been regarded by his students as a most inspiring m3n in the class room. His research in education and his masterful grasp of the history of education have given to him such a breadth of resource that as he stands before his students he seems to be overflowing with good things. Not only had the students loved Doctor Clark as a professor but as a friend they gradually followed his guidance and leadership. The faculty worked together with new zest and Doctor Clark's administration was. numbered as a bright spot in the history of the school. Although he was president of the school during the most trying time.', in the financial history of this country, he managed the school with wise economy and secured from the legislature adequate appropriations with which to conduct the work. In the year 1904, after a successful administration. Doctor Clark resigned his position as principal to carry on advanced studies under G. Stanley Hall at Clark University. He was succeeded by PRESIDENT J. W. CRABTREE. I President J. W. Crabtree had been graduated from the school had become a successful educator of the state. He was so suc - rul as principal of the Ashland schools that he was promoted to superintendenoy and in that capacity served the people of Ashland I he resigned his position to pursue higher studies in the graduate 41 </seg>
            <seg id="p786">620 •chool of the university. After a year's successful work as principal Ke Beatrice high school he was called upon to accept the position ite high school inspector of the university. It was while acting is capacity that he was called by the board of education to the epalship of the state normal school at Peru. This story of his istration at Peru is familiar to all Nebraska educators, and the of his wonderful influence as a leader is briefly epitomized in the following statistics of annual enrollments: Pupils in the model school are not included in this summary. No name counted twice. Enrollment for the year 1902-3 720 Enrollment for the year 1903-4 812 Enrollment tor the year 1904-5 982 Enrollment for the year 1905-6 1,215 Enrollment for the year 1906-7 : 1,280 Enrollment for the year 1907-8 1,352 During the four years of his administration the school has grown Ka local normal school to the proportions of a middle sized univer- The courses of study have been enlarged and extended until it is possible for a student to take four years of normal training after high school graduation and to graduate with a BACHELOR OF EDUCATION DEGREE. This degree is granted by the board of education at the suggestion of Pres. Crabtree upon the completion of two years of college or univer - sity work following graduation from the original higher course. Grad - uates of the state universities and other higher institutions of learning may receive this degree upon completing the required professional work «t the normal school. Already the suggestion of Pres. Crabtree, that the Bachelor of Education degree should thus be conferred, has met favor with the leading normal schools of the country, and all west of the Allegheny mountains are now offering higher courses leading to this degree. HIGHER ENTRANCE REQUIRENfENTS. The condition very favorable to advanced work in the normal school has been brought about by the raising of entrance requirements by statutory provision. The legislature of 1907 provided that no nt should be permitted to enter a normal school who had not com - pleted at least a tenth grade high school course or its equivalent. As a result a large increase in attendance in the higher classes of the school has been noticeable. When the suggestion was first made that entrance requirements should be so raisved by law, it was thought that the normal school would raise serious objections, but Pres. ree, with keen insight iDto the future of education, favored higher entrance requirements from the start and expressed himself as wishing that the time might soon come when none but twelfth grade graduates might be admitted to the school. </seg>
            <seg id="p787">621 MATERIAL PROGRESS OF THE SCHOOL. To keep pace with the larger growth in attendance, rapid material progress has been necessary. During Pres. Crabtree's administration, the frame library building, which was built in 1889 under Doctor Farnham's administration, and which was then known as a "commo - dious building" has been doubled in size and brick veneered for use as. a science laboratory. The library which then comprised 5,549 volumes now comprises 20,000 volumes and is housed in a splendid new modern library building, with well lighted and heated reading and research rooms. The chapel, which for years was. confined to a ■wing in Normal Hall became so inadequate to meet the needs of the school that it was necessary to erect a flue, large, new ohapel of a 1,500 seating capactity to accommodate students and patrons at the daily chapel exercises. The splendid heating plant erected in 1891, with its excellent electric power plant was no longer adequate to meet the demands made upon it. The legislature of 1907 appropriated $25,000 with which to construct a new and larger heating and electric plant. Upon the campus may now be seen the historic Normal Hall, the new science hall, the large new chapel and gymnasium, the new library building, the modern Mount Vernon Hall, the observatory, the stand - pipe, the green house, and the old heating plant now used under the crowded conditions as a recitation room. Then on the hillside to the eastward may be seen the finished athletic field and to the north of Mount Vernon Hall is the new dormitory, known as Oak Glen in which is carried out the PERU PLAN OF SELF-BOARDING. Oak Glen is a dormitory constructed at private expense in which young women may in conveniently arranged apartments board them - selves while attending school. The dormitory accommodates, 35 young women, each two young women having parlors and kitchen together, these apartments being furnished with such furniture as is necessary to carry on the work of self-boarding. The dormitory is under the direction of a preceptress, who is. the professor of domestic science, and who directs the general work of the young ladies of this dormitory. The plan has become so popular that it has been extended to many private rooming apartments under the direct supervision of the pre - ceptress of Oak Glen. STUDENT ORGANIZATIONS. Bin addition to the many social organizations that afford opportunity tudent activity, the following permanent organizations are main - d: Young Men's Christian Association Young Women's Christian Association.

GRADUATES OF THE SCHOOL The graduates of the normal school have no difficulty in securing employment in the public schools and high schools of the state. Many of the graduates have taken responsible positions as superin - tendents of city schools., principals of high schools, teachers in high schools, and teachers in the graded and rural schools of the state. With the increasing demand for normal training which has swept like a w»ve over the state during the administration of Supt. J. L. MeBrien, there has been a very much greater, demand for normal graduates in all the schools of the state. In this regard, something of the marvelous growth of the school influence may be understood by a glance at the following NUMBER OF GRADUATES BY CLASSES Class of 1S70 Class of 1890 16 Clus of 1871 3 Class of 1891 12 Class of 1872 o Class of 1892 9 Class of 1874 1 Class of 1893 26 Class of 1875 Class of 1894 35 Class of 1876 8 Class of 1895 39 Class oT 1877 9 Class of 1896 41 Class of 1897 53 Class of 1878 4 Class of 1879 17 Class of 1898 31 Class of 1880 Class of 1899 39 .

I would paint those hills and valleys, Those fields with their golden sheaves. The little squirrel with his swish and swirl. Those beautiful autumn leaves. Those kings of the stately forest, Monarche of ages past, Those rugged hills, those rocks and rills, — God grant they may always last. We mix our earthly colors And call our paintings good; But the God above with a heart of love Makes colors that no man could. He has taken the rarest colors. The gems of heavenly blue. And painted a picture in nature, — God bless it, dear old Peru. S. R. Barton. Nebraska. State Normal School at Kearney. By President A. 0. Thomas. HISTORY. For a long time there had .been a feeling through Nebraska that there was need for better facilities in educating its, teachers. This was felt very strongly by educators who knew the conditions in central and western Nebraska. Teachers situated in this part of the state were f.o far from educational institutions that few had an opportunity to pre - pare thoroughly for their profession. State Superintendent William K. Fowler, realizing these needs, in his biennial report to Governor Mickey, published January 1, 1903, made the following recommenda - tions relative to the normal school question: First — Exchange the Industrial school at Kearney for boys with the State Normal School at Peru. Second — Establish a new Normal School at Lincoln. The idea of moving the Normal from Peru was met by so much opposition that K was given up, but the fact remained that a Normal somewhere in the west was badly needed. A bill, known as. House Roll No. 1, was drawn op and introduced in the legislature of 1903 by Chauncey Warner of Lancaster county. It provided for an appropriation of $100,000 for the location of a new Normal west of the sixth principal meridian, the selection of the site to be "left to a committee of nine </seg>

Xo site should be chosen unless twenty acres of land, worth at least $75.00 per acre, accompanied it. The school should be under the direction and control of the board of education of Nebraska and governed the same as. the school at Peru. After careful consideration, it was agreed upon by normal school advocates that the bill should be amended providing for an appropriation of $50,000, the selection of the site to be left in the hands, of the state board of education, but otherwise the bill was the same as before. This bill was introduced March 20th, and on March 26th had advanced to the third reading in the house, bu amended to the ninety-eighth meridian instead of the sixth principal meridian. It was then passed by both houses and signed by Governor Mickey. Its passage was assisted by all western Nebraska cities, as well as many individuals. As bids were soon to be opened for the location of the Normal, and as, several other towns had already made headway along the lin - securing lands and other requirements ifor it, the citizens of Kearney, on April 23, held their first public meeting on the new school tion, for they were anxious to secure the prize for Kearney. The old committee of Messrs. Gregg, Lowe, Crocker, Robinson and Dr; wag continued as executive committee with power to appoint financial and sub-committees. The first part of May a mass meeting was held in the city hall. Reports or speeches were made by the following: C. H. Gregg, J. F. Crocker, Representative Davis of Gibbon, Repre - sentative Knox, A. O. Thomas, E. C. Calkins, L. F. Watson, Senator Wall, Mayor Roe, Judge Oldham, and N. P. McDonald. Early in June a committee meeting was held at which subscriptions were checked up. accounts averaged and people urged to bring in their subscriptions. In July delegates from Central City and Holdrege visited Lincoln in behalf of their respective cities, and probably to look after the appointment of the new member of the board, to take the place of W. L. Stephens, whose term was to expire June 21. As the bids were to be opened July 28, this new member was a matter of great importance to all concerned. Before this date Governor Mickey had appointed Superintendent Delzell. On July 12 advertisements appeared in the papers by order of the board of education to the effect that proposals were solicited relative to the donations to the state of suitable land, not less than twenty acres, worth $75.00 per acre, w«et of a point not exceeding five miles east of the ninety-eighth meridian, building or buildings, money or registered bonds, might be included in the donation. These -were to be opened in the presence of the board Tuesday, July 28, 1903, in the office of the superintendent of public instruction. The proposals would be investigated by the board and it would consider in making a selection the character and value of </seg>
            <seg id="p794">626 IJte, the building or buildings thereon, whether the buildings were i donated or sold, and the value of the bonds accompanying the &gt;aal. The normal school would be located on the site which i appear to be for the best interests of Nebraska. Other ele - s entering into the selection of the site not mentioned in the adver - ents were den.--.ity of population immediately around the proposed oe from railroad depot, drainage and lighting facilities. The state board of education, while making a tour of western Nebraska viewing locations, visited Kearney August 17. The board -ted of George Rogers, Omaha, president; \V. K. Fowler, state superintendent, secretary; Peter Mortensen, Ord, state treasurer; Hod. Thos. J. Majors, Peru; Rev. Luther P. Ludden, Lincoln; R. A. Tawney, Pierce; Superintendent J. E. Delzell, Lexington. They were taken in carriages to the proposed site, and the grounds and also Green Terrace, which m proposed as a dormitory, were inspected. They visited the lake, power plant, and principal school buildings, and siven a hurried view of the town to judge of surroundings. In \ening a .n and banquet was given in the rooms of the iton Loan and Trust building, no-w occupied by the Farmers Bank. After the banquet, Hon. E. C. Calkins took charge of the ring and announced that the claims of Kearney for the new normal would now be presented. The first speaker was John N. n. He represented the moral and educational features of the town as well adapted to the needs of such an institution. Professor A. O. Thomas gave figures relative to the population within a radius of me hundred miles of Kearney, that tended to make Kearney the il situation for the new school. Some of these figures, are as Population of state, 1,066,300; within the named radius, 11; school population of state, 275,340; within radius, 12o ■ state institutions south of Platte, four north of it; teachers in the state, 9,150; within the radius, 3,485. He also gave a table of distances by rail from all important points to Kearney. The ers of the fooard made responses, and speeches, were made by .--. Frank Harrison, Hostetl-?r. Murch and Brown. On Sept. 1, 1903, the board of education, after one hundred eleven ballots, selected &lt; location for the school. I The school was located en a tract of about twenty-five acres in restern part of Kearney. In 1905, the legislature, in an appropri - of $86,200, provided for the full equipment and opening of the )1. The faculty war selected by the state board of education in , 1905, and in the same month began a summer term in the ney High School building. It was not generally known until a time before the school opened that a summer term would be but notwithstanding, one hundred twenty studeDts matriculated. The regular year's -work opened on the 20th of September, 1905. At that thne the building was not complete!, but temporary stairways were put in, and the school took possession of the third story of the </seg>
            <seg id="p795">627 building, the only available part. The heating plant was not com: until December. When the school took possession of the building there were no windows, or doors in place, nor was there a foot of baseboard or casing on the entire building. The first story was not plastered. All af the concreting and marble tile throughout the halls and corridors had to be put in place while the school was in operation. In order to keep out the draught, muslin was stretched over the windows. Two large traction engines were brought in from the fields and attached to the steam pipes for the purpose of furnishing steam for the building. It is remarkable that the building, although in this condition, was kept comfortably heated until the regular steam plant was in operation in December. I The first day's, enrollment reached 168. By the end of the third it had reached 195, and at the end of the first month, 250. In rriber the enrollment had reached 400. The best of feeling pre - d, and the students and teachers went about their lessons paying attention to the busy workmen and the constant sound of hammers, eemed to take delight in watching the beautiful plant unfold. By ?nd of the first year the matriculations had reached 863. The year's work for l'jOfi-1007 opened on the l'Jth of September. The first day's registration reached over 300. The first week 450; at of the second week the registration had reached 611, and on November 6th, 542. Eighteen students were graduated the year from the higher course, with life certificates, and thirty-three completed the Teachers' Training Course, receiving elementary state certificates. The legislative session of 1907 increased the entrance requirements so that students, in order to gain admission must have completed the tenth grade of high school or its equivalent. This limitation cut out a great many students from the common schools and from the country places, but seemed to limit the attendance very little, for, at the close of the third year, 2,100 students had matriculated with an average attendance of 1,000 students each year. The second year's enrollment reached 1,181. The schooi has maintained a steady and solid growth from its organization to the present. Students from all parts of the state were attracted by the conveniences of the cit healthful climate as well as. by the splendid equipment of th? school and the magnificent corps of teachers. 354 students have already completed the various courses and are now filling important positions in the state. FACULTY. The faculty numbers among its members many of the best known educators of Nebraska, teachers of broad scholarship and wide ex - perience. Many of these men and women have been member? of the faculties of other normal schools of high standing, wni;e others have been directly connected with rural and city school systems. This, forms a combination of rare value. If breadth of scholarship and rich experience count any where, thev count in normal school work. </seg>
            <seg id="p796">628 Here the counsel and leadership of the instructors will assist in moulding into form the ideas and ideals of young men and young women who are preparing for the profession of teaching. The 'board of education, in selecting the faculty, took into consideration only the building of a strong and useful school. The members were chosen for their special fitness for the positions they occupy, and have such do— touch with the public schools of the state from which they were chosen that it may be said in all truthfulness that no other school in west stands in such close relation to the people it is to serve. COMPLETE PLANT. It is the plan of the Board of Education to establish, in due time, as complete and convenient a plant as can be found anywhere in the country. To this end they have already planned the campus relative to the location of all future buildings. At present, only one $50,000 building is in use. It calls for three additions; a north and a south wing, and a chapel and gymnasium to the rear. The wings are con - nected with the main building by a structure 28 feet wide by 38 feet long. These connections contain the cloak rooms, toilet rooms, entrance ways and stairways. The north wing will contain the art department, music department and biological sciences, making provisions for class rooms, laboratories, storage rooms, consulting rooms, etc. The south wing will contain the department of theoretical education, and also the physical sciences, provision being made for class rooms, lecture rooms, laboratories, storage rooms, etc. Each part of the building is planned for its special purpose. Aside from the main 'building and its connections, the plans call for four independent buildings. To the southeast is to be located an administration building, registration rooms, board of education room, faculty rooms, etc. To the northwest of the campus is to be located the lire-proof library, while to the rear and north is located a model rural school; the grounds about it will also afford a model for rural school grounds. To the rear and the south is the building containing the observation and practice schools, representing a model graded school. The buildings are so arranged relative to each other that they • re of easy access. There is also a beautiful dormitory across 26th street, near which is located the central heating plant. THE GROUNDS. The public school should be the pleasantest place in the com - munity next to the home. As yet, teachers and boards of education do not take sufficient pains in fixing up school grounds in an attractive manner. The State Board of Education believes that there is a place for a practical arrangement and demonstration of what can be done la beautifying school grouds at small cost. Accordingly they have secured a competent landscape artist who has. laid out the grounds, planning all of the drives, walks, flower beds, trees, etc. When the </seg>

The faculty realized at the outset that in order to build a school for the future and establish a reputation of credit to the state it be careful of its products. It was a temptation many times to offer to graduate students with the minimum requirements, but it was the unanimous opinion of our faculty that if we wished to succeed as a school and establish a reputation worthy of consideration we should be exceedingly careful in regard to the teachers sent out from the school. We have even advised students who have not shown ability as. teachers to enter some other calling, to go to some other kind of a school to prepare for some other line of duty. We have held to a high grade of work and 'have cut off students from certification and gradu - ation who were not fully up to the standard required. In many instances students have felt that they could secure grades from other institutions more quickly and more easily than from ours. For this, reason we have lost some students who have been seeking for a short cut to preparation, but in most instances the school was. the gainer rather than the loser. We have endeavored to so regulate our course of study and our methods of instruction that students, who come under our tuition would come into thorough sympathy with our aims and ideals; that when they go out into the schools of the state bearing the brand of our institution, they -would reflect credit upon the school. STRONG DEMAND FOR TEACHERS. There is a great demand at the present time for teachers, and we are entirely unable to supply it. Since the early fall we have sent out Into the schools of the state nearly one hundred students. These students are reluctant to leave their work in the middle of the year, but on account of the strong inducements in the way of salary many have done so. The call comes from county superintendents in the central and western portions of Nebraska, and from many of the city schools in every part of the state. In many instances the salaries offered are as high as $60.00 per month. We hope in time to be able to supply the demand of school officers, and to be in such a position that when called upon at any time in the year to provide qualified teachers, we shall be able to do so. GRADUATES. Since the school was organized three years ago, we have grad - uated one hundred forty-six students from the higher course, forty - four h-aving been granted life certificates.

During the first three years of its history twenty-one hundred (2,100) students matriculated. As no student matriculates more than once, the matriculations do not ■how the enrollments. Many students, who matriculated the first year of the school remained during the full three years, and are even yet In ianee. Counting the enrollment by years, over three thousand ujents have enrolled in the first three years. This makes an average of seven hundred (700) students on matriculations and one thousand (1,000) students on enrollment during each year of the school's history. I have studied somewhat the condition of new schools in the United States, and have failed to find any school equaling the growth of the State Normal School at Kearney. The growth is accounted for largely by Its central location, its fine equipment, its % work, and its splendid faculty. History of the University of cHebraska..

From the political story of the state, it is apparent that those who nought to cripple or destroy the new capital and those who had a like intent against the political cabal of the capital, made common cause. The attack of the allies was also directed incidentally against the state university, which for many years was treated by the Omaha es as a local institution of Lincoln. The main fault found was that the university was opened too early, and its scant patronage and an inferentially high per capita cost of students was industriously ridiculed and denounced. While the complaint was. very plausible, its foundation was as flimsy as that of the first building. The act of congress of July 21, 1862, provided that a quantity of the public lands In each state, equal to 30,000 acres for each senator and representative to which the state was entitled by the apportionment of 1860. — -90,000 in the case of Nebraska — might be appropriated to create a per - petual fond for the maintenance of at least one college, where the ■leading object should be to teach such branches, of learning as are related to agriculture and the mechanic arts, but without exchidlng scientific and classical studies and including military tactics.

The first report of the board of regents, of the state university to the governor gave an account of its establishment. The board was organized at a meeting held in Lincoln, June 3, 1869, Augustus P. Harvey being elected secretary, and John L. McConnell treasurer. At this meeting plans and specifications for the first building, presented J. McBird of Logans,port, Indiana, and which had been adopted by the Commissioners of Public Buildings, were approved. At the second meeting, held September 22, 1869, the regents attended the ceremonies of the laying of the corner stone of the first building — Sep - tember 23 — ; at the third meeting, held December 22, 1870, Uriah Bruner of Cuming county was elected regent in place of William B. Dale, and Rev. Henry T. Davis of Lincoln was chosen secretary of the board in the place of Augustus F. Harvey, the original incumbents of these offices having removed from the state. At this meeting — Decem- </seg>
            <seg id="p804">632 t23rd, 1870 — President Butler reported university funds on to the amount of $26,431.23 and that the income for the coming would be $53,000 — the proceeds of the one-mill tax on the valu - of the property of the state. The annual salary of the chancellor e university was fixed at $5,000. At the fourth meeting, held iry 6, 1871, in the chapel of the new building. Rev. Allen R. m of Alliance, Ohio, was elected chancellor. On the 4th of April ilary was fixed at $4,000. The fact that the trilary of the chancellor remained as first fixed, more than thirty years, notwithstanding that the university had grown In the meantime from insignificance to greatness, is due more to the entailed influence of early privation and necessary economy, than to intentional stinginess. The growth of the university has been more rapid than the admitted resources of the state. The burden of taxation is naturally heavier in n«w, than in old and well established commu - i, and its revenue is never enough to go around. Then the settle - ment and industrial development of Nebraska hung upon a great ques - tion mark for the first half century of its organized life. First there was the general doubt of the agricultural practicability of "the Nebraska country." When Confidence, encouraged by courageous experiment, fairly began to hold up her head and reach out for new conquests toward the ever questionable west, the grasshopper plague reinstated Skepticism and introduced Discouragement. The later succession of droughty years lent renewed color to the faded question mark. Poverty became a Nebraska feeling, more or lees acute, according to the s.tate of the capricious crops, and now that Confidence has spread and irrevocably established her sway from border to border, and has. put over the question mark the exclamation denoting almost boundless riches, the echo of the poverty plaint still lingers and affects our civic attitude. But aside from these special conditions, our educational institutions where are in a chronic state of impecuniosity, owing to the marvelous, growth of the demand upon them. I At the meeting of February 7, 1871, believing that the tax of one was heavier than was necessary, or fearing that such would be the lar feeling, the regents prepared a bill for introduction into the lature for reducing the tax to half a mill; but even this fifty per concession did not satisfy the legislature which reduced the tax quarter of a mill. 282. In 1877 it was raised to three-eighths mill, and in 1899 to the original amount of one mill. 283. By e of the continuing rise of the value of property this tax will soon uce a princely revenue, but no more th3n will be necessary to main - the princely university which conditions seem to call for, and is in course of development. The early public buildings of Nebraska were remarkable in being of a uniform structural type; all of them had to be propped up or burned down to keep them from falling down. While the first uni- </seg>

At the meeting of the nts held June 13, 1871, the executive committee was inetr rocure a thorough examination of the building; and Jonas maha, John M. Taggart of Palmyra, and Cyrus W. Wheeler of mville, practical builders, were appointed for the purpose. On the igth of the report of the examiners, at the meeting of June 23, , the regents ordered that the foundation of the building be re - id at an estimated cost of $7 47. 2 8 4. After very expensive ■ring of the foundation of the north wing or chapel in 1873 and , the climax oame three years later. Moved by persistent reports and assertions that the building was unfit for occupancy on account of defective construction, during the spring term of 1877 the faculty abandoned the north wing. At a i ing held on the 6th of July to consider the crisis, the regents reach' startling decision that "the building was unsafe for occupancy," that it was "impracticable to repair it so as, to make it a sound and substantial building and one in which the people of the state would have con - fidence," and that "there seemed but one course left, to rebuild it by and with the assistance of the people of Lincoln." 285. The regents estimated that $40,000 would be required to carry out this, plan, and in their financial extremity they called upon the citizens of Lincoln to supply this staggering sum. Accordingly, at a mass meeting held in Lincoln on the 13th of July, a committee of lawyers was appointed for the purpose of ascertaining if it were feasible :to submit a proposition to issue bonds to the amount required and look to the legislature to subsequently validate the action. On the 17th the com - mittee made a favorable report to an adjourned meeting, which there - upon decided to proceed with the plan. But in the meantime, through the efforts of a few doubting Thomases, a skillful architect from Chicago and another from Dubuque made a critical examination of the building and then each gave an emphatic opinion that the super - structure was in good condition and that there was no impending danger whatever on account of the foundation, but as a precautionary measure it should be replaced with better stone, in spite of tin sistence of local architects and builders in their original panicky fear, a revulsion of popular opinion followed the report of the imported experts, and the regents reconsidered their destructive decision. At a meeting of citizens of Lincoln, held August 20th, a committee w*» appointed to devise a method for raising money to pay for a new foundation; on the 22nd the city council appropriated $4,000 of the municipal funds, and afterward individual citizens subscribed 1 1 and the stone of the old foundation &lt;was sold for $200, making a of $6,010 expended for the improvement. At the same time $2,'.' of the funds of the university was expended for repairs of I structure '286. During the summer vacation of 1887 all of the </seg>
            <seg id="p806">634 cross walls were replaced by limestone walls, at a cost of $7,470. The building, though probably not actually unsafe is generally unfit for its se :nd is a cumberer of the ground upon which it stands. The leaders who urged the people of Lincoln to pay the cost of the repairs assume 1 that they would be reimbursed by act of the legislature or the board of regents; but on account of the hostile sentiment against in and the university the just claims of the enterprising citizens were never pressed or presented. report of the regents made in 1874 states that no income had so far been derived from the endowment lands. In the report of 1876, "the regents desire to call attention to the pressing necessity of some legislation looking to a speedy realization of some income from the endowment lands;" although they admitted that "a very small part of these lands can at present, and perhaps for some years to come be sold under the restriction in the constitution (the minimum price of $7 an arcre), yet a very large amount of them may be leased." The report *S0 says that "the income from lands leaped and from interest the investment of endowment fund.s is just now becoming avail - able." The further statement that this income "will within a few years reach an amount sufficient to support the university without resort to a tax," illustrates a modest and inadequate conception of the future growth of the university. 286%. The university could now, with, profit, use aD income double that which the mill tax and the endowment yield. The University of Wisconsin has for some time been planning its buildings for the ultimate accommodation of 15,000 students. The endowment lands are nearly all sold or under contract of sale, and the fund derived from them yields about $80,000 a year. The mill tax yielded, in 1907, $329,413.38; in 1908. $391,735.46. The increase is due to the higher assessment of real estate in 1908. I The act of Congress of March 2, 1887, known as the Hatch made an annual appropriation of $15,000 for every agricultural ■ge established under the act af July 2, 1862, for the purpose of ylug on experiment stations in connection with such colleges. By act of 1906, $5,000 was added to the original amount for each &gt;ge, this sum to be increased by $2,000 annually until the original ■opriation shall be doubled — in- the year 1911. Under this act, 'xperiment station is now conducted 'at the college of agriculture incoln. A sub-station was established at North Platte in 1904 for purpose of adapting experiment to local conditions distinctly rent from those at Lincoln. This sub-station is supported by state -opriation. By the act of August 30, 1890, the federal congress appropriated &gt;i0 for each agricultural college established under the so-called Morrill Act of 1862. this sum to be increased by $1,000 each year after 1890, until the total appropriation should amount to $25,000 — in 1900.

At a meeting in December, 18 75, the regents received the resig - nation of Chancellor Benton, to take effect at the end of the college year. At a meeting held March 24, 1876, Edmund B. Fairfleld, then principal of a normal school in western Pennsylvania, was. elected chancellor, and he assumed the duties of office at the close of Benton's term. At their annual meeting in June, 1882, "the regents decided to dispense with the services of Chancellor E. B. Fairfield, his services to terminate September 30, 1882." George E. Church, professor of Latin; George E. Woodberry, professor of English; and Harrington Emerson, professor of .modern languages, were also dismissed at a previous meeting, held in January, 1882, the order to become effective at the close of the academic year. They were all men of uncommon aggressiveness and ability. Having decided that the chancellor ought to go, they set about with sys - tematic energy to attain their end. The Omaha Republican, whose editor was Datus C. Brooks, father-in-law of Professor Emerson, and the Daily State Democrat of Lincoln, were the gunnery of the insur - gent professors who furnished ammunition — some shrieking shells and some solid shot — for the bombardment. It was a spectacular campaign, resulting in the annihilation of the forces on 'both, sides. The trio of Sampsons who thus deliberately dragged down the Philistine temple upon their own heads, afterward won distinction in other walks of life. Woodberry has achieved a great reputation as a writer and literary critic, Church has had a successful career at the bar, and on the bench in California, and Emerson has been a very active man of business In various parts of the country. At a meeting of the regents held February 21, 1883, Charles Kendall Adams, of the department of his.tory in the. University of Michigan, and subsequently president of the University of Wisconsin, was elected chancellor, but he declined the office. At a meeting held December 18, 1883, Irving J. Manatt, professor of Greek in Marietta College, Ohio, &lt;was, chosen chancellor, and he assumed the office on the 1st of January, 1884. Professor Henry E. Hitchcock was acting chancellor in the interim. The university began to find itself on the incoming of Chancellor Maniatt's administration. Until then its career had been "grasshoppered" — both by adverse natural conditions and by a natural human perversity. It is only success that succeeds; and it was only when success in spite of opposition seemed sure, that sneers and contumely changed to public praise and pride. As late as 1880, there were only 255 students enrolled and they were accommodated by only one tumble-down building. In 1885, the legislature appropriated '00 for "a building for industrial and scientific department - the chemical building of the present; in 1887 and 1889, provision wm ntfade for the industrial college building — Nebraska Hall — and for Grant Memorial Hall. While such inferior buildings as the two last named 43 </seg>
            <seg id="p810">636 ought never to have been erected, yet they bridged a chasm between general adversity and success. In 1891 $37,000 was appropriated toward the library building — the first structure fairly creditable to the campus. In 1879, $50,000 was appropriated by the legislature for the maintenance of the university during the ensuing two years; in 1881, 956.000; in 1887, $165,000 — the last showing that the university had somewhat suddenly become established in the popular mind and heart. A medical college was prematurely established in 1884, on an appropriation of $2,000 by the legislature of 1883 for incidental ex - penses. The services, of the faculty were gratuitous. In 1885 the legislature prohibited the use of any funds for the support of the medical school. The faculty hung on without compensation for another two years, when the college was, discontinued. It was revived in 1902; and perhaps the most important act of Chancellor Andrews' administration was the affiliation of the Omaha Medical College with that of the university. Better clinical facilities are supplied in Omaha than in Lincoln — a very important consideration. The relations, of the Omaha school are not clearly or definitely denned, but the students take the first two years of the medical course at Lincoln. The college of law was established at a meeting of the regents in August, 1891, and William Henry Smith was the first dean. The teaching of military tactics began by the detail of Lieutenant Edgar S. Dudley for that pur- The first fifteen years of the university's, life were full of vicissi - tudes, due largely to pioneer poverty and scant population. But there were two other conditions which retarded its growth: the public mind was not prepared to concede that it was expedient for the state to undertake the function of so-called higher education at all, much leu to carry it to the extent to which it has been developed; and then growth was seriously obstructed by the partisans of sectarian colleges, partly through jealousy, and partly through fear that these state schools would become too secular or irreligious. As there were then no sectarian schools of importance in the state, the various religious denominations sought to influence as far as possible, or com - pletely control the university, and their respective spheres of influence were as murked and definite as those of the various civilized nations elr appropriation of Africa. * This condition or policy soon became incongruous, and it was the chief cause of the internal disturbance in the early part of 1882 which resulted in the dismissal of the chancellor and three of the ablest members of the faculty, leaders in a rebellion against htm. It is now a well settled policy to select the head of &amp; university chiefly with reference to his executive fitness; and clergymen, who were formerly preferred for the office in question, are now usually deemed unavailable. The modern conception of a university was first applied to the Nebraska institution under the administration of Irving J. Manatt, and succeed- </seg>
            <seg id="p811">637 There has been no serious religious friction since the explosion of 1882, and that phase of the university life or polity adjusts itself to other conditions unostentatiously, but freely. In very marked contrast to the earlier policy, the government of the university now treats the religious question as, according to their constitutions, the governments of the states and nation treat it — by leaving it alone. Of late, also, the internal management of the university has been tainted but lit - tle by partisan politics, though its governing board is still scandalously chosen by partisan selection, and scandalously wears the party label. Still there have been several examples of the pernicious effect of the partisan choice of the regents of the university. Chancellor MacLean resigned in the midst of his usefulness In anticipation of political prejudice against him — not entirely unearned — on the part of the in - coming democratic board; and this board ohose Chancellor Andrews chiefly on account at his political views, and by a strict party division! And yet, considering the conditions and circumstances, these acts were natural if not excusable. The least and the most that can be said in comment is, O, times! O, customs! An. I .ill that can be done is to await the issue of the protest against the choice of public school boards in general and judicial and municipal officers by party label which begins to be faintly heard. Furthermore, while the governing board of the university has on the whole been composed of faithful and fairly representative men, yet it is impracticable to regularly supply regents of the special qualifica - tions required by popular choice. This is especially true under the primary election system. While the popular primaries discriminate against very unfit aspirants fjsr office more honestly and effectively than caucuses, and conventions have done, yet they do not discriminate between indifferent and special qualification as well as those institutions which they have displaced often did. The typically short tenure of the chancellors, and its, usually either strained or violent ending, is not only hurtful to the university, but, together with not uncommon, if not chronic internal dissension, sometimes amounting to demoralization, indicates that the best form or character of university •government yet awaits discovery, or at least attainment. It seems that quantitative forcing at the expense of its qualitative character, of which the steady loss of the ablest pro - fessors and the faithful retention of weak ones is but a single example, ought to have been, in some sort, avoided. The university is now the most important of our state institutions, save only the general government, and its condition should be freely though, of course, fairly criticised.

There was a lengthy debate in the constitutional con - tention of 1871 as to the necessity or propriety of inserting a section declaring that "the location of the university and agricultural college at the capital of the state, as already established by existing lawe, U hereby sanctioned and confirmed." The discussion disclosed the usual jealousy of Lincoln though the grounds for it were not clearly established, for it was shown that recognizing the latitude at the act of congress which required that "at least one agricultural college should be provided," the proposed section provided that "other agricultural colleges and experimental stations may be established when the wants of the people may so require." But the ob - jectors feared there was danger lurking in the words, "as already estab - lished by existing laws." It was shown that the act of 1869 specifically provided for establishing "the state university and the agricultural college" and for the erection of the necessary buildings. Mr. MoCann said: "I know the opinion of the Secretary of the Interior-. He asked me If we had built an agricultural college; I answered him that we had. I told him that we were going to use it as a university and agricultural college, but I think it would be well to recognize it as such, (in the constitution) with this proviso, that whenever circumstances will allow, agricultural colleges (will) be located elsewhere throughout the state." Owing largely to the keen legal perception of Thomas, that the recog - nition wu unnecessary and- the effective oration of Mason, the section ■was stricken out. I Though Mr. Estabrook reminded Judge Mason that the law pro- I that ten per cent of the agricultural college fund should be for maintaining the experimental farms, yet Mason's speech was ietic in spirit, anticipating the subsequent development of the main ;e farms, and the special appropriations by congress for their main - ice. Judge Mason said: "For my own part, I believe I am in favor of recognizing as the agricultural college of this city this building over here in this oat - field; but I want to see our agricultural college surrounded by broad acres upon which to experiment. Now it is true that this section provides for the erection of other agricultural colleges; but when we build an agricultural college, I don't believe 1n planting it in anybody's town. I want it where they can plant trees and have broad acres for prac - tical experiments in order that the poor men of our state may gain thereby and save the large sums which many of us, in the early settle - ment of our state have lost heretofore in experimenting. For the purpose of securing our lands, I am in favor of letting this section stand, and call this an agricultural college, but I am not in favor of calling It, by constitutional provision, the agricultural college of this state. I want lands around our agricultural colleges as, well as these experimental farms. I wish my boy to go from the field with sweat still on his brow to his books. I would take him from practical farm - ing to the schoolroom, from the toil of the muscle to the toil of the brain, and for that reason I would have my buildings upon a farm.

It was reported a.lso that Stephen P. Nuckolls, the founder of Nebraska City, had sent to the university from Salt Lake City, a collection of Utah minerals.

In an address to the state legislature, January 31, 1877, Chancellor Fairfield said that $50,880 wUs accumulated under the mill tax levied in 1869, 1870, and 1871, and that more than $40,000 of that sum remained unexpended when the university was organized and the building opened to occupancy. By the act of 1871 the tax was reduced to one-fourth of a mill and Its proceeds, together with the accumulation in question, had been" sufficient for the support of the ratty up to this time; but now this surplus had been expended and the regents asked for an increase of the tax to three-eighths of a mill, which was granted. I The Chancellor said also that most of the states had sold their •rstty lands for $100,000. Had Michigan waited and obtained $1, - 100, "as Nebraska will for hers," the annual tax would not now be si.

Reports of architects Dufrene of Omaha, Craig of Nebraska City, Artemus Roberts and John J. Butler of Lincoln, made July 7, agreed on three points: use of defective material in foundation and superstructure; present unsafe condition of the building; imprac - ticability of repairing it. The regents reported that, "from personal examination, and the reports of architects and builders, they are con - vinced that the building is unsafe and should not be longer used, en - dangering the lives of students. They are likewise convinced that it is impossible to repair the same so as to make it a substantial building, one in which the people will have confidence." They advise taking it down while it can be done, using all material worth saving on a new one, and raising by subscription, "the only means In our power," from the people of Lincoln and vicinity enough to erect a building costing about $60,000; (amount to be raised, $40,000 by July 20&gt; so as to complete the work by Christmas. I The executive committee was directed to remove the contents of building for safe-keeping when necessary, to contract to take q the building and erect a suitable one, provided the citizens or y\n donate $40,000 towards erecting the same, and "that they be charged with the duty of making temporary provision for the term, that no inconvenience may arise to the students or faculty." The committee was also authorized to relocate the site if thought advantageous but within two miles of the Capitol. July 14. Evening of the 13th a large mass meeting nt the opera house. Amasa Cobb presided. Appointed a committee of seven la'A — Turner M. Marquett, Oliver P. Mason, Mark H. Sessions, Lorenzo \C Billingsley, Smith B. Galey, Paren England, Gen. Joseph R.

Six of thr mittee of lawyers report that the county may vote bonds or borrow money, the bonds to be afterwards validated by the legislature. G dissented. It was resolved to vote county bonds to the amount of $40,000. If that exceeds the amount of indebtedness the county may legally incur, the city to raise the balance. Judge Mason said it would be "endorsing a bankrupt and des power" — the board of regents. July 21. John Mullany, architect and builder for 2 7 years, of Dubuque, had examined the building: said it would stand 50 years, and with a portion of the wall renewed would be as substantial as any building that could be put up, — though many things had not been done aa they should have been, as he informed Silver (the builder). ■July 22.

The building had settled, but had stood the test of settling better than 99 in a hundred. No more cracks than usual in buildings of that size. Few buildings so well tied and supported d&gt;" crow-walls. Outside walls had nothing but themselves to support. Utterly impossible for them to fall out or in. They had not sprung, and were perpendicular. Some of the bricks were soft and not of first quality, but medium brick stand the most pressure and are always put on the inside where they get it. No danger at all of crushing or giving way. Sand stone in foundation not good material, and ought not to have been used. It deteriorated through moisture — like the Parliament House of England. Should be faced with Portland cement. Such as had crumbled should be taken out. The northwest corner had settled one and one-half to two inches more than the rest of the wall, but had not cracked off; it had gone down, showing that the walls were well constructed and could not fall. A bulge of one and five-eighths Inches to the north wall occurred, while being constructed, from unequal settling of that corner; but it had not changed since the plastering was put on, seven years before. It would take $90,000 to duplicate the building, though material was then very low. All that was needed was 97,000 or $8,000 for repairing such part of the foundation as required it, and protecting the outside of the walls from the weather. July 26. "G. P. Randall, an eminent Chicago architect was tele - graphed for by regent Tuttle." (At the instance of Chancellor Fair - field who had seen his work of the same kind.) July 2 5th Randall made a report. He said that the work generally was not good, but ridi - culed the idea of the brick walls "splitting". Part of the foundation had already been replaced with limestone and he advised removing all the rest and putting in good limestone. Below the ground line, the walls were built of rubble, "the cheapest of its kind," above this the piers — between windows of the foundation — are in fact two walls, an outside thickness of stone six inches in depth into the wall without bond with the backing; in fact a compound wall. Inside of undressed stone or ruble. The sandstone of which the walls were built was not good, would not stand wet and frost; decomposed too readily. The Journal of July 27th demands that the regents reconsider their action condemning the building. Mass meeting at the university ehipel Juily 26th. Randall endorsed reported saying of Moillany that "no one but a d d fool would ever talk of tearing down Che build - ing." Said the bricks were fair, and he had found no defective ones in the face of the wall. There was no occasion to remove the inside foundation walls; but twenty or thirty years hence, if they showed s gns of softening or disintegration, they might be replaced. These cross- walls had no footings. There was no breaking of bonds of the superstructure, and with a good foundation the building would be safe. "Mr. Randall is known to be the most prominent </seg>

Says that Randall examined the old Capitol in Omaha a years ago, and advised that it was in such a dilapidated condition it should be removed. He designed the "magnificent building that crowns that city" (the old high school building). IJuly 29. On the 28th, Randall made further examination of the ting and reported more emphatically, concluding that the present dation walls would last 50 years if well protected from the weather, inside partition walls were in pretty good condition. But he still ■ ed replacement of the balance of the outside walls. July 31. John J. Butlsr opposes Randall's views in the Omaha Republican; copied by Journal. August 2. Prints John Mullany's written report — addressed to John R. Clark. Says foundation walls are banked up with earth, con - ducive to dampness; the sandstone absorbs water 147 to 1000, while brick, only 10C to 1000. This stone would have been his last choice; lie was familiar with it in Iowa. Advised removing any deterioriated stone from the walls and covering all with Portland cement; would be less expensive than replacing all the foundation. Building would be perfectly safe repaired in this way; sandstone abundantly able u stand the pressure. Window caps should be removed and replaced with a single stone. Cracks between windows caused by unequal settling. All weight falls on the "piers" between windows; little or none under window openings. Cracks should be pointed. Brick walls "all-suffici - ent" — singularly free from cracks. There were walls enough inside to support the building if the outside walls were ruined. The only objection to the building was its gloomy appearance. Ridicules J. J.

At this time the Republican begins to retract; excuses itself by quoting Tuttle's remarks at the first meeting of citizens. He had watched the building carefully and was nervous over it, and was glad when the last term closed and the building could be shut up. August 9. Communication of Regent Tuttle including a joint report of J. J. Butler, and Seth \V. Beats, Supt. U. S. court house and postoffice, and separate reports by A. D. Dufrene and A. Roberts, archi - tects. The first two advised taking down .all of the building. Duf - rene finds the material of all the walls of such inferior quality that it Is Impracticable to repair them. Roberts estimated (that It would cost $15,000.00 to replace the foundation walls. This coat added to the value of all material would make a better new building on a new location. W. R. Craig of Nebraska City said the building wae not worth more than $80,000.00 at first, if of good material and work, and could be erected now for $60,000.00. He advocated a new building for $50,000, using the present material, worth $20,000. toward it. 1 August 10.

The Journal opposes removal of the university to a larger campus and argues that it is better to keep it close in. August 17. Report of a meeting of regents in which it transpired that a window was removed from the part of the north wall of the chapel where the greater danger seemed to be, and the wall was found to be sound and secure. Two holes were made, one in the north, and the other in the west wall; both in splendid condition. J. J. Butler, W. R. Craig and D. C. Brooks, editor of the Omaha Republican, acknowledged their error, and the regents unanimously rescinded their resolution of July 7, calling for $40,000 for a new building, and in the same number Regent Tuttle called for bids for repair of the foundation ding to Randall's specifications; but citizens of Lincoln were re - quired to pay the expense.

(See Senate Journal 1 s 79. .09.) The Omaha newspapers kept up attacks on the university for many years. The Journal, May 23, 1875, protests against Regent Barrows' proposal to suspend the university for 5 years. To so do would be bad faith, since the state had accepted 136,000 acres of public land as an endorsement. The Omaha Republican (weekly), April 26, 1171, says the Herald advises that the capitol and university building ought to be burned. The Herald (weekly), June 19, 1874, asserts that the university is on a downward scale and ought to be suspended for five, or ten years. May 8, 1874, a correspondent of the Herald says that it is a failure; it had only sixty students, and the chancellor was "destitute of executive ability, brain power, and physical force." January 1 . the Herald (daily) says the university is a "patent humbug" and the building a stupendous fraud. January 31, it declares that there will he ample time to start a university when the state has attained a popula - tion of 1,500,006 (Its population still falls far below that — in 1!* but the university enrolls 3000 of them). In May and June the Herald insisted that the operation of the university should be sus - pended. Feb. 19, 1875, advises regents to suspend operation for five or ten years. tThe Herald, May 28, says that Regent Barrows, also editor of the blican, advocates suspension of the university for a term of two i, and complains that the graduates cost $1900 apiece for two The Omaha press ridiculed the attempt to make the univei •- pan-sectarian school.

The agricultural division or group is called the school of agriculture and the other groups of No. 2 fall under engineering. The College of Fine Arts has not yet been formally organized, but the division has been recognized in a school of fine arts, in which, so far, music, and drawing and paint - ing, including ceramics, are taught. The school of music, while recog - niied as an adunct, is not an integral part of the university.

"The board, having received a request from many eminent citizens of this state, conferred the degree of doctor of laws on Right Reverend Robert H. Clarkson, blsTi - op of the Episcopal diocese of Xebraska. The committee on land was authorized to offer any of the university lands for sale or lease, pro - vided that no land should be sold at less than seven dollars an acre. At the same meeting'the board elected "a visiting committee consisting of eminent educators in the state to visit the university and report thereon to the board." The members of this committee were John H. Kellom of Omaha, Wellington Rich of BrowDville, — Roberts of Ashland and John B. Maxfleld, a member of the board of regents. Augustus F. Harvey was the first secretary of the board of regents. Rev. Henry T. Davis was elected as his successor at the meeting of the regents held December 22, 1870. J. Stuart Dales was elected to succeed Davis at the meeting of the regents held, in Dec. 1875, and he has held the office ever since. At the meeting of the board held Feb. 28, 1871, the salary of the secretary was fixed at $300 a year; at the meeting of June, 1871, the salary was fixed at $400; at the meeting in June, 1872, the duties of librarian were imposed upon the secretary, — according to the organic act of 18C9 — and his salary was fixed at $600. At the meeting of June, 1875, the duties of librarian were imposed upon the professor of Latin, with an additional salary of $100 a year and the salary of the secretary was correspondingly reduced to $200. At the meeting in De - cember, 1875, the distinct office of librarian was created by the re - gents. The amendments of the organic act passed by the legislature of omitted reference to the office of librarian, and the duties of the office were passed around, sometimes to the Chancellor, and again to the faculty, and finally in 1878, to Prof. Geo. E. Howard. The regents finally assumed authority to create the office of librarian, under their powers as defined by the constitution. The organic act provided that marticulation and diploma fees should be used for the benefit of the library, and at the meeting of December 17, 1872, the regents ordered that these fees be so applied. The report of 1874 says that these fees amounted to $260 last year, of which $200 was spent for books anS magazines.

He attended Doane college, graduating from the classic course in 1887. After teaching for a time in the country schools he entered the University of Nebraska, graduating with the B. Sc. degree in 1892. In 1894 he was granted the degree of Master of Arts. Two year later he received the degree of Ph. D. (multa cum laude) at the University of Heidelberg. On returning to America he was ap - pointed to a position in the department of chemistry in the University of Nebraska. In 1889 he accepted the position of professor of chemis - try and chemist of the experiment station in the University of Idaho. During the two years spent in Idaho a considerable part of his time iwas given to the work of the farmers' institutes. In 1901 he returned to Nebraska with the rank of professor of organic and analytical chemistry. A year later the department of agricultural chemistry was created, and for three years succeeding he held this post together with that of chemist at the university experi - ment station. In 1905 he was made head professor of chemistry and director of the chemical laboratories, which position he has since held. Dr. Avery is peculiarly fitted for the weighty responsibility that </seg>

His earlier studies in the classics, his later exact scientific training, involving familiarity with detail, and his intimate knowledge of agricultural education give him a breadth of appreciation of the university that is ideal on the part of one who must correlate so many varied interests. He is young enough to have a potentiality of many years of increasing value if the work proves con - genial. kDr. Avery stands in a friendly relation to his associates. He r 8 the reputation of being absolutely frank and fair-minded. He a favorable position for maintaining harmony in the faculty — so tial to the continued progress of our university. The student body will find Dr. Avery a safe counselor and sympa - thetic friend. His own student life was a splendid preparation for this leadership. His appreciation of the importance of reaching the great masses of the students is shown by the fact that he has always retained a hold upon beginning classes in his department. He has also drawn to him an excellent group of strong students who have carried advanced courses under his direction. Among these are Professor Dales and Professor Mary Fossler of the university; Miss Gere of the Lincoln high school; Dr. Beans of the faculty of Columbia, university, New- York City; Professor Thatcher, director of tihe experiment station at Pullman, Washington, and numerous rising chemists in technical line;;. The over-crowded condition of his department is in a measure due to Ms popularity with the students. An acquaintance with the entire stu - dent body will doubtless result in the same loyalty and enthusiasm that now characterizes his relations with the students of his department. The alumni will rally to Dr. Avery in a united support that wilt make their influence felt for the advancement of the university. However great their loyalty in the past, it will be more active in the future from a sense of personal responsibility on account of this recog - nition that has come to one of their number.

Four of the above mentioned contributions to Science have been adopted as official methods for the Association of Official Agri - cultural Chemists. The work on Paris Green has been quoted by the compiler of the "Jahrbuch der Chemie" as among the most important contributions to the science of chemistry of the year 1906. A number of articles on more popular subjects have been pub- lished from time to time in the daily and agricultural press ch(ebraska. School of eAgriculture. PROF. A. E. DAVISSON. The University of Nebraska School of Agriculture has been in ex - istence for almost fourteen years and since it was founded gr progress has been made in agricultural education than was made in all the years intervening between the establishment of the universitv and the founding of the school. "In March, 1894, the regents an - nounced that they proposed to open in September, 1895, a School of Agriculture and the Mechanic Arts." The announcement was not quite in accordance with the facts as they actually occurred for the school was opened in December of 1895. "In the Organization Act of the University in 1869, provision was made for a College of Agriculture and a college of Practical Science, Mechanics, and Civil Engineering. 43 </seg>
            <seg id="p838">652 STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT In 1877, the legislature changed the title to 'The Industrial College' embracing agriculture, practical science, civil engineering, and Me- chanic Arts." Previous to the announcement referred to above, several attempts were made to satisfy the demands of the people for instruc- tion in agriculture. These, however, amounted to no more than the giv- ing of a few short courses in which there was no enthusiasm manifested on the part of either students or instructors. When the time came to open the school, the Regents found them- selves embarrassed by the entire absence of any buildings in which instruction in agriculture could be offered so they were obliged to begin the work of the school on the university campus. The session opened in December, 1895, and only fifteen students availed themselves of the opportunity for the instruction in agriculture. Besides being few in number, the students suffered many embarrassments because of the fact that they were held in low esteem by the students in the college courses. The faculty offering instruction was Thomas Lyttleton Lyon, director of the Bchool; Professor Bessey, Professor Bruner, Dr. Peters, and Professor Card. The faculty list as shown in the University cata- logue of 1895 and 1896 was quite imposing but only those persons named above had any part in offering work to the fifteen students who appeared. The course of study was divided into two parts, one of which consisted of a one-term course and the other a three-term course. It will be noted in the full course which appears below that there appeared the subjects of Animal Husbandry, Farm Dairying, Agricultural Engineering and Hydraulics, and Farm Accounts. No one of these was given the first year: OXE-TER.M COURSE.

This building consti- tuted half of the present dairy building. There was a dairy laboratory below and a lecture room above. Besides these extensive(?) facilities for instruction there were a chemical laboratory, in a small cement house now occupied by Mr. Frank Schmitt who is in charge of the barns, and a lecture room in the upper half-story. Professor Lyon occupied the two rooms of this house with his library and office furniture. This year two additional instructors were added: A. E. Davlsson, the present principal of the school and head Professor of Agricultural Education, gave instruction in English, History and Mathematics, and Professor Haecker, at the present time Professor of Dairy Husbandry, was assistant in dairying. There were thirty-three students registered and the instruction continued for twelve weeks. Three of the students this year registered for the three-term course. It is interesting to note that of these three, Charles Wesley Melick is now professor of Dairy Husbandry in the Agricultural college of Maryland; Frank A. Gustaf- son is a prosperous farmer near Oakland; and Frank McGrew is also a farmer and prospering. In the summer of 1897 the east half of the present dairy building </seg>
            <seg id="p840">654 STATE SUPERINTENDENTS REPORT very well recalls with what feelings of exultation the faculty prepared to open school Id Decemfoer. It was felt by Professor Lyon, director of the school, that great things in agricultural education were about to happen. Some members of the faculty thought there would be more than one hundred students; others were more conservative, while the opinion was freely expressed by some of the professors on the campus — who were then opposed to agricultural education but are now wholly in sympathy with the idea — that no greater number of students could ever be expected. As in the previous year, the school opened in December and fifty-one students registered. At the fall election of 1897, Honorable E. V. Forell, now of Scotts Bluff county, and Honorable George F. Kenower of Wisner were elected to mem - bership on the board of regents. Both of these men were enthusiasts for agricultural education and Mr. Forell especially so. Besides, the young men in the school were of a very high order of mental excellence and had begun to feel that agricultural education was not "a fraud, a delusion and a snare," but a thing worthy of the pursuit of any one seeking learning of a sort to make him successful in life. Just at the close of the school in March, 1S98, the students were entertained at the residence of the then chancellor of the University, Dr. George E. MacLean. At the close of the delightful evening given the students by the chancellor, it was proposed by him that an Associ - ation of Agricultural Students be organized for the purpose of con - tinuing the work begun In the school. The suggestion was receive i with favor and the next day a meeting of the students was held at the farm. The question was brought up as to whether such an associa - tion should be organized. It was unanimously favored by the students and an invitation was sent to Chancellor MacLean and to Dr. Bessey to come to the farm for the purpose of organizing the association It was certainly a most commendable thing in both the Chancellor .md Dr. Bessey to be willing to come and to take their place as sponsors for a movement looking toward the advancement of the cause of agricultural education when there was so little with which to start as there was at that time. It may be confidently said that, had not the association of agricultural students been organized, no such step as was taken in the following April by the board of regents would ever have been thought of. Regent Forell, however, when he heard of the action taken by the students, became convinced that something more must be done in the extension of the course of study than had been done in the three years previous, so at the April meeting of the regents he moved the establishment of the Three Years' Course of study of the School of Agriculture to run concurrent with the regular university jrear and also moved that all students who completed the course should be admitted to the Technical Agricultural Group of the the university. The motion was unanimously adopted by the regents and the following course of study was arranged: </seg>

Of cour?e any one who looks over the course of study will perceive that the number of agricultural subject?, and the hours devoted to them, was very small and that the criticism actually made of the course was well founded. People soon began to say that the university was run - ning a preparatory school and calling it a School of Agriculture. Be - sides, the Winter Course still continued and the students of the THree Years' Course were expected to go into the same classes as the Winter Course students for agricultural subjects. As the students first men - tioned had had more advantages in the way of elementary training than tho^e of the Winter Course, the practice of putting them together for induction in agriculture was found to present so man* difficulties that </seg>
            <seg id="p842">656 they seemer insuperable. The course shown above was, however, fol- lowed strictly during 1898-99 and the two years following but the criticism became so outspoken and the desire of the major portion of the students to make the school one merely preparatory to the uni- versity was so noticeable that in 1901 the course of study which appears below was adopted FIRST YEAR.

The writer is of the opinion that no other School of Agriculture gives the same amount of attention to agricultural instruction as does this one. It is also unquestionably true that the subjects of English, History, and Mathematics are given less attention than they should have but there is no way to remedy this defect other than to add a year as a requirement for graduation. No doubt exists in the minds of the faculty as to the wisdom of doing this ultimately. There is, however, a feeling that the school has not as yet grown sufficiently for the step to be taken. Very few changes have been made in the course of study since 1901. Such as have been made have, it seems to the faculty, improved the school in no small measure and the course of study which follows is thought to be as nearly ideal as it is possible for a school as young as the University of Nebraska School of Agriculture to have. </seg>

No more enthusiastic students and no more faithful in the matter of study could have been found than the young women who applied for registration last year. This year the completion of the building together with additions to the corps of instructors has made possible the strengthening of the work and there are forty-seven young women availing themselves of the advantages offered. The work is identical with that offered to men in that both men and women study English, Civics and History, Botany, Physiology, Chemistry, Geometry and Political Economy and women and men recite together in these classes. But the purely technical subjects of agricultural Instruction are taken by men only while the women study Cookery and House Practice, Physical Training, Sewing, Designing and House Practice, Household Economics and German. Some fear the effects of co-education. The writer can say unquali- fiedly that since the work of the Home Economics Department has begun in the school, there has been a great improvement in the tone of student life. While all these improvements in the matter of increasing the subjects for instruction and the hours devoted thereto have been taking place, the Winter Course has not been abandond. It was predicted that the Winter Course would gradually deteriorate and finally cease to exist. As yet, there are no indications of this happening. The attend - ance has increased every year and the students are just as enthusiastic as they were when the school first began. It has, however, been noted that the men attending the Winter Course are generally those who are either of such an age that they do not feel like becoming students in the regular work or they are young men whose engagements in life are such that they can spend but a few weeks in seeking instruction. The faculty hopes that the time will come when the Winter Course shall be regarded as the course for mature men who have already established themselves and that the young men of the state who are engaged in laying the foundations for life's work will decide that the Three Years' Course is the one which should be taken by them. Great improvements have been made in the Winter Course of instruction and, that the readers may be able to perceive this, the full Winter Course as it now appears is placed below.

A plan was agreed upon by which teachers who possess a second grade certificate can be admitted to the School of Agriculture and do one year's work in agriculture and subjects related thereto, thus fitting them to carry on instruction in the rural schools along lines which will have a tendency to direct the minds of the pupils of such schools to the advantages of farm life and at the same time to give to these pupils a trend of mental and physical activity that can but result in the improvement of farm conditions in the matter of better buildings and more tasteful ar- rangements of grounds as well as their adornment.

            <seg id="p848">662 Manual Training 2 Sanitation of Farm Buildings 2 Thus far no students have registered in this course. It is be- lieved, however, that time will justify the wisdom of the movement and that many applications will be made by persons who can meet the re- quirements for admission named. It is also believed that persons who do meet the requirements for admission and go into the work of teaching rural schools will find themselves greatly sought after by county superintendents and as a result the wages offered to them will be much higher than those now paid to rural school teachers. Another result of the attempt to produce an affiliation between the School of Agriculture and the Teachers college has been to establish a summer session beginning in June, 1908. There were fifty-three teachers in attendance on the first session and the movement may therefore be said to have been crowned with quite a measure of success the first Tear it waa attempted. In this division for rural schools instruction was offered in Field Crops, Horticulture, and Agriculutral Economics. The summer session of 1909 will offer Instruction in the subjects already named as well as in Animal Husbandry, Manual Training. Elementary Botany, Inductional Geometry, and Elementary Physics Altogether it may be said that the School of Agriculture is now in the position to offer not only that instruction which will directly affect crop production and production along other lines of agriculture but which will also have an important influence upon the educational policy of the state. It will be seen that the School of Agriculture is affiliated with two colleges in the university, the regular work of the school belonging to the industrial college, while the work of the summer session and the work offered to persons who possess second grade certificates to teach belongs to the Teachers College. Statistics are always uninteresting but it is felt that this article should not close without presenting a history by means of figures that will show the progress that has taken place.

            <seg id="p850">664 The graduates are as follows: The class of 1909 will probably number 72. Did time permit, the writer would like to mention by name all of the persons who have, at any time, served as members of the faculty in the School of Agriculture. Suffice it to say that no more faithful men and women have ever been found in any other Institution. In the early years of the school discouragements in the form of the small number of students, of the carping criticism of those who did not be - lieve that agricultural education could be made a success in Nebraska, and of a lack of funds for buildings and for salaries, had to be borne. The members of the faculty, however, never lost heart. They believed that the years would justify the faith they had in the cause for which they were working and while they have not yet seen success in as large a measure as they have hoped for, they feel confident that as the years go students will come in greater and greater numbers and will obtain here that sort of instruction which will enable them to go back to Nebraska farms and be a force in maintaining the fertility of the lands of our commonwealth, in increasing the yields of the various crops, besides taking measures that will result in farm buildings being more commmodious, more tasteful, more convenient and more sanitary and will also cause the planting of trees, flowers, and ornamental shrubs about the farmstead, thus causing the farm home to be the most beautiful, the most restful, and the most inspiring place to be found anywhere within the borders of the state. 901 X 903 904 905 906 907 908 50 </seg>
