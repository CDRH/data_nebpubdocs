            <seg id="p004">SUMMARY 1. The purpose of this work was to study the effect of nitrogen upon the development and composition of the different parts of the potato plant when grown with various temperatures and photoperiods. The plants were grown in sand, to which nutrient solutions were added. 2. With different temperatures and photoperiods the extent, rate, and place of N assimilation and carbohydrate synthesis and utilization were greatly altered. Consequently the nature and extent of the morpho - logical responses of the plants to changes in the external N supply were altered to a comparable extent. 3. Carbohydrates accumulated (and tubers formed) whenever they were not utilized in the formation of new tissues or the maintenance of those previously formed (respiration). The inability of the plant to utilize carbohydrates in building new tissues resulted from an in - hibition of the assimilation of N. This occurred at low temperatures or in short days or when N was withheld from the nutrient solution. Excessive respiration prevented carbohydrate accumulation or created a deficit when the temperature was high, especially if the days were long. 4. High temperatures, long days, and an abundant external supply of N favored vegetative growth (in all plant parts except tubers), whereas early tuberization was induced with low temperature, short days, or a deficiency of N. Maximum tuberization occurred with days of intermediate length, low temperature, and an abundant N supply. With adequate N the most distinctive types of the plants were as follows : (a) Small plants, with very high ratio of tubers to tops, produced when days were cool and short; (b) Larger plants, having lower tuber/top ratios but producing the greatest weight of tubers, produced with intermediate day length and. low temperatures ; (c) Still larger but less tuberous plants, produced as days became either longer or warmer; (d) Less vigorous plants, devoid of tubers and sometimes of stolons, produced when temperatures were very high and days long. When either day length or temperature, or both, was increased veg - etative growth resulted, whereas tuber formation occurred as they were decreased. Tubers were produced at temperatures commonly con - sidered too high for tuberization by withholding N from the nutrient solution, or at even still higher temperatures by use of a short (10% hr.) photoperiod. 5. Withholding N from the nutrient solution when conditions were most favorable for maximum vegetative growth (long, warm days) re - sulted in a prompt and extensive decrease in the* inorganic N in the plant, accompanied by retardation of vegetative growth, carbohydrate accumulation (especially starch), and either prompt initiation or ac - celeration of tuber development. As the N deficiency was prolonged, accumulated starch disappeared from leaves and stems, leaves became pale, maturity was hastsned, and final total weight of tubers was ma - terially reduced. When conditions were favorable for maximum tuber development but least favorable for vegetative growth, withholding N did not measurably accelerate tuberization but it inhibited vegetative growth and lowered final tuber yields 6. Resupplyinpr N to N-starved plants resulted in a rapid increase of inorganic N in all plant parts, a rapid reestablishment of the chlor- </seg>
            <seg id="p005">ophyll supply, and rapid synthesis of N compounds. With long days vegetative growth was resumed, causing immediate retardation but later acceleration of tuber growth rate. With short days, vegetative growth was not resumed. Un ler all conditions the life of plants was prolonged and tuber yields were generally increased. 7. Maximum stolon growth, i.e., long primary stolons and numerous and long lateral and branch stolons, occurred when conditions were especially favorable for vegetative growth. Under conditions most favorable for vegetative growth, stolon axes (except those terminated by tubers) continued to be initiated or elongated after tubers had formed on primary stolons, -whereas under conditions most favorable for tuberization practically a'.l stolon growth ceased when the first tubers developed. 8. In rapidly growing plant: the percentage of dry matter decreased from leaves to petioles, upper and lower stems, and to the stolons, and then increased in the tubers :o the highest percentage. The highest percentage in tubers occurred when conditions were very favorable for accumulation of carbohydrates i.e., short days, low temperatures, and when the N supply was deficient. 9. Whenever or wherever N was_ being assimilated into the plant structure, the percentage of inorganic N *as. low. Consequently it was lowest in tubers, followed by leaves and highest in the stems, and was low in all parts when days w;re long and temperature high, or when N was withheld from the nutrient solution. 10. The highest percentage if assimilated or organic N occurred in the leaves, next highest in _tl e tubers, and lowest in the stems. In young plants most of the assimilated N (fresh-weight basis) was found in the leaves, but as tubers developed a constantly increasing percentage of the assimilated N in the pla ts was found in the tubers. The amount of organic N in tubers continued to increase till plants were mature, even though it decreased in thj vegetative parts late in the life of the plant. 11. Plants that were tuberizng rapidly and were not producing veg - etative portions had only a slightly higher percentage of total hydrolyz - able polysaccharides in leaves and tubers than did plants that con - tinued to be distinctly vegetative. Tuber-producing plants generally had a higher percentage of sucrose but a lower reducing-sugar con - tent than the more vegetative plants. </seg>
            <seg id="p006">The Effect of a Controlled Nitrogen Supply with Different Temperatures and Photoperiods upon the Development of the Potato Plant H. O. WERNER 1 The potato (Solarium tuber osum, Linn.) is grown under a great variety of conditions with regard to temperature, length of day, intensity and character of light, texture, fer - tility, and moisture of soil, and atmospheric humidity. There is need for a better understanding concerning the internal response of the potato plant to these external conditions when they are applied, either singly or m combination with each otner, and the resulting morphological response, especially with regard to the tuberization process. p^iauy The basic physiological principles underlying the extent and time of development of vegetative and reproductive org - ans have been established chiefly through a series of inves - tigations by Fischer (39) * Klebs (55-58), and Kraus and Kraybill (64) . The potato tuber is a vegetative organ great - ly modified for storage purposes and used for reproductive purposes. In this connection it is well to keep m mind that vegetative development" and "fruiting" or "tuberization" are not opposite or antagonistic processes but that, as others condition" (64) 1S *" external cx P r ession of an internal Garner and Allard (41) have advanced the idea that tuber - producing plants vary through a series of physiological stages ranging from extreme vegetative growth, through flower and iruit formation to tuber production. The significance of temperature m the tuberization process was conclusively demonstrated by Bushnell (18) m 1925 Gamer and Allard (41) pointed out the importance of length ™™£ y m / elat Ilon1 lon tuber development.

Research Bulletin 75 feet of soil moisture and fertility upon yield of tubers has been studied in a large number of field-plot experiments and in addition the nutrient requirements have been quite thor - oughly investigated with water and sand cultures, particu - larly by German and American workers. The relation of each of the important chemical elements to the fundamental process of tuberization represents a relatively undeveloped field of investigation. It has been the object of this investigation to determine the relation of the nitrogsn supply to the processes of stolon and tuber formation wilh different temperatures and with photoperiods of different lengths, and at the same time to determine some of the internal physiological responses ac - companying these morphological responses. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS LIGHT AND TEMPERATURE Experimental series of identical plan were run in the green - house at different times from June, 1932, to August^ 1933. The different series and conditions under which they were grown were as follows: • Series A. — June to September, 1932. Long days decreasing in length and high temperatures also decreasing. Series B. — October, 1932, to January, 1933. Short days decreasing in length and low temperatures Mso decreasing slightly. Series C. — February to April, 1933. Short days increasing to medium length and temperatures constantly low. Series D. — April to June, 1933. Long to very long days and high to very high temperatures. Series DS.— Short-day plaits receiving 10.5 hours of daylight from 7:15 A. M. to 5:45 P. M. each day (secured by covering plants with knock-down light-tight ventilated dhambers). Season and temperature same as Series D. Series E and ES. — Comparable to D and DS but grown from July to September, 1933, with long da ys and 10.5-hour days at high temperature.

During the fall, winter, and early spring (B, C) the temperature was thermostatically controlled. The variation through the 24-hour periods was seldom over 4 degrees F (except for a few hours, in the middle of 'the day when the temperature may have risen) as shown in Figure 1. The data on light intensity were secured from the local radiation station operated by the Weather Bureau of the U \S- Department of A B ricul ture at a distance of less than a half mile from the greenhouses. These data are published m the Nebraska section of the monthly report of climato - logical data by the U. S. Weather Bureau. Tysdal (123) reports that four layers of glass of the thickness used cut out 55.8 per cent of the solar radiation as measured by a pyrhehometer when placed at an angle of 45°. Allowing for variation in the sun angle, he [figured that the light intensity was reduced 64.45 per cent. (He found (personally reported, not published) that one thickness of glass at an angle re - duced the light intensity almost exactly one-fourth as much or 16.1 per cent. When allowance is made for glass over - lapping (about two inches in these houses) and dust and dirt on glass, shade of rafters, etc., the intensity would easily be reduced 20 to 25 per cent by one thickness of glass. The maximum and minimum air temperatures as recorded each day by thermographs are shown in Figure 1. The daily means and period means were secured from these maxima and minima. The temperatures during the night and all except the middle hours of the day were relatively constant with Series Band C. The daily means thus derived tend to be too high, because the higher temperatures prevailed for only a few hours when the sun was shining brightly The temperature to which the roots and tubers were ex - posed was not the same as that of the air. Evaporation of water from the surface of the sand and through the pots lowered the temperature of the sand at night and during the daytime except when the sunshine was bright. Long-tube thermometers registered temperatures from 2 to 14 de - grees F. lower in the center of the pot than air temperatures in the early morning— the difference depending upon the at - mospheric humidity.

NUTRIENT SOLUTIONS The external nitrogen supply of the plants was altered by supplying, during definite periods, either a complete nutrient solution or a solution complete except for nitrogen * After a study of the results of dozens of workers with nutrient solutions of various compositions and concentrations Sw™ P ?££? Principally by Tottingham (120), Martin and 7oW ( ,^' Newton (55) Johnston (52), and Schropp and Zoller (105), it was deemed most desirable to use the three - salt solution designated by the type number R..

When Ser - ies B was being grown there was some concern as to whether the plants were assimilating nitrogen from the calcium nit - rate. When nitrogen was omitted, calcium chloride was used at the same molecular concentration. Immediately after planting, enough plus-N nutrient solu - tion was applied to the surface of the sand to bring the level of the solution to a height of about 5 cm. in the graniteware such^^te^t^ "™ «»-«&gt; of &gt;on B er statement,. </seg>

During periods of rapid growth, when temperatures were high and days long or bright, each of the plants received 1 litre of solution every - day; when temperatures were low and days short or cloudy 1 litre of solution was applied two or three times per week to each pot. When the level of the solution in the pans became low between periods of nutrient application, water (acidulat - ed tap water) was added directly into the basins. At intervals of ten days ( r two weeks the pots were set out of the basins and were flu; shed with five litres of acidulated water, after which they -were set back into the basins and again supplied with the requisite nutrient solution to the customary level. This system of flushing was even more thor - ough whenever a change \\as made from plus-N to minus-N solutions. Tap water with a pH of about 6.8 was used. It contained a very little nitrogen but rot enough to warrant the expense of using distilled water. Pied j ens and Robbins (115) have reported reduced assimilation of nitrogen from nitrates with a high pH in the rooting medium. Clark and Shive (21a) have reported that with the tomato the rate of absorption of nitrate N was greatest at a low pH (i.e. at 4) and of am - monium N at a high pH [at 7) when plants were 38 to 41 days old, but that when p ants were 52 days old the pH ex - erted this dominating inf uence on nitrate absorption to a lesser degree. As plants became older the rate of ammonium N absorption decreased, while that of nitrate N increased. This tap water, when used either for flushing the pots" or for diluting nutrients, was acidulated with commercial concen - trated HC1. These acidulated solutions which had a pH of 3.8 to 4.0, when applied to the sand containing roots of growing plants appeared in the drainage solution with a pH of 6.1 to 6.2 fifteen minutes later (chlprophenol red indicator), 6.6 to 6.8 eighteen hours later (bromthymol blue indicator), and 7.1 to 7.6 forty hours later (phenol red indicator). These pH values were possibly too high ior ideal assimilation of nitrates. Tiedjens and Robbins (11&gt;) point out that these pH changes are greater with old than with young plants and they as well as Pirschle (97) point oui; that these changes are not so im - portant with ammonia as with nitrate nutrients. Since this work was conducted, the balancing of ammonia and nitrate sources of nitrogen has been recommended as a method for maintaining a constant pH in nutrient solutions used for growing plants (121). This same method might be applic - able in sand-culture work </seg>
            <seg id="p014">Development of the Potato Plant Iron was applied at the rate of one part per million of solution to Series A as ferric chloride and to Series B as ferric citrate, but because of doubt as to the effectiveness of these compounds in solutions used, on personal recommenda - tion of Dr. Shive ferrous sulphate was used for the other series. Even though iron may at times have been inadequate there were never any indications of iron-deficiency chlorosis, for probably the plants got some iron from the water and iron supports. METHOD OF HARVESTING PLANTS Because of the rapid carbohydrate changes that occur in plants from hour to hour as light and temperature vary and as photosynthetic material accumulates or is translocated, a means of harvesting was used which as nearly as was physic - ally possible exposed plants of all sets of a series to the same range of conditions and enabled all of them to be put into the oven for drying at practically the same time. Harvesting was done from noon on, during bright, sunny days. One plant from each set of the series was brought to the laboratory and set on a wide sill of a window facing east. The plant was cut off at the surface of the sand and weighed at once; then the leaflets were stripped off the midribs and weighed separately, as were the remaining midribs, petioles, and stems. Both divisions were cut up at once, weighed again, and all put into the oven. While this was being done the. corresponding plant of the next series was cut off and weighed. By this system the plant tops were cut up and in the oven within 30 to 40 minutes after being taken out of the greenhouse. As soon as the tops of all plants had thus been disposed of, the underground parts were carefully washed out, so as to leave all stolons, tubers, and roots attached. The roots were trimmed off, and in all but Series A and B all sand was washed through a sieve so as to catch all small pieces of roots and then all roots were dried. A record was then secured as to the position and length of each stolon, and position, weight, and dimensions of each tuber either by ac - tual measurements as in Series A and B, by careful drawing and weighing as in C, or by photographing as in D and DS. With Series A and B, harvesting of tubers was not always completed till about 24 hours after the tops were cut off, but in Series C, D, and DS all tuber records were secured during the half day on which they were harvested. Whenever plants are reported as being harvested on two days, half of the plants of each set were harvested on each day. </seg>

If material is improperly handled, carbohydrate changes occur in the course 6f drying, due to respiration and hydrolysis. Numerous investigations (reported in 69, 71) appear to show: that at hiih temperatures (98°C ) in suc - culent tissues much of the starch is hydrolyzed to sucrose {138) ; and at 45° C. sucrose is synthesized and with respira - tion a decrease in reducing sugars results. Link and Schulz ((0) found that total nitrogen was not altered by any method of drying. Their work and kome referred to by them showed no loss of inorganic nitrogen by drying. Sessions (107) was able to determine the inorganic nitrogen content in dried plant material to a very high degree of accuracy. At a later date Sessions stated that thkre is no change in nitrate con - *n^ un J? g dl 7 in £ if minced tissue is held at a temperature of 110 c C until most of the water is lost and the drving is then completed at 75°-80° |l s Nightingale (89) found no experimentally significant difference in nitrate content of stems of tomatoes when analyses were made of fresh material or of stems dried rapidly at 75° or 80° C. It was essential in this investigation to differentiate between organic and in - organic nitrogen, but as splitting of these into fractions was not desired, drying at reasorably high temperature appeared to be a satisfactory methodJ The method adopted was [to cut leaves into bits about 5 mm. square, and the stems into pieces not over 5 or 6 mm m any direction. Tubers fere cut into rectangles about 3 or 4 mm. square with the periderm on one side severed at only a few places. This permitted the spreading out of the pieces of tubers in fan-like| style but prevented the loss of juice on the gauze, since the periderm side was placed on the screen. After the cut tuber surfaces were dried the larger groups of pieces were broken apart.

            <seg id="p016">Development of the Potato Plant peared to be as rapid as that reported by Rosa (201) from Boswell's work, who found a loss of about 90 per cent of the water from tomato leaves in the first hour. Drying was gen - erally continued for two days, by which time most samples were less than 5 per cent moisture. The material was then removed and bottled for storage. Absolute dry-matter deter - minations were made at 103°-105° C. with small samples in weighing bottles. The entire stored sample was ground in a Wiley mill and passed through a millimeter-mesh sieve before analysis. MACROCHEMICAL. ANALYTICAL METHODS Inorganic nitrogen was determined by the Sessions and Shive method (108) from a one -gram sample, the "ammonia" and nitrate fractions being determined separately on all but the samples from the third period of Series D and fourth period of all other series. The organic nitrogen was determined by a slight modifica - tion of the Kjeldahl-Gunning method — A. O. A. C. pp. 18-20, 1930 (2) — from the residue left after inorganic nitrogen was extracted. Because of the 2.5 gms. of Devarda alloy, the 10 gms. of sodium carbonate and 6 gms. of sodium chloride used in extracting inorganic nitrogen, the copper sulphate and sod - ium sulphate were omitted and 50 cc. of sulphuric acid was used and digestion continued 2.5 to 3 hours. Sugar solutions were prepared by the official A. O. A. C. method — (2) p. 281, No. 20 (1930) — with 2-gm. samples of tubers and 4-gm. samples of other plant parts. Reducing sugars were determined by using the cuprous oxide method — A. O. A. C. p. 379, No. 38 (1930)— up to point of filtration, from which point the volumetric method was used according to Peters (95). Sucrose was determined by following the A. O. A. C. method — p. 281, No. 22 (1930) — determining reduc - ing sugars as previously stated. Starch (including dextrin) was determined from the in - soluble residue remaining after extraction for sugar as was done by Johnston and Dore (.53). One-tenth gram of takadiastase was used for each gram of material in the or - iginal sample, and neutral lead acetate was used for clarifica - tion and sodium carbonate for deleading, as in the prepara - tion of the original sugar solutions. Acid-hydrolyzable polysaccharides other than starch and dextrin (so-called hemicellulose) were determined from the residue after starch was removed, as by Johnston and Dore (53), the specified amount of HC1 being added plus an amount equivalent to the one gram of CaCO : , used at the time </seg>
            <seg id="p017">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 75 of the original extraction. Clarification and deleading were done as in the starch determinations. The residue, after all soluble materials and acid-hydroly - zable polysaccharides had been removed, was determined by drying at 100° C. in a weighed crucible. MICROCHEMICAL METHODS Nitrate determinations were made on thin small sections with an abundance of diphenylamine (0.1 gm. diphenylamine in 10 cc. 75^r H,SO 4 ). The sections were allowed to dry for a few minutes so as to intensify the color by reducing the water content of the sections {49). Starch was determined by the customary iodine method, using a solution of 0 3 gm I and 1.5 gm. KI in 100 cc. of distilled water. METHOD OF REPORTING EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS The results of the experiments are presented under two general divisions : ) (1) The morphological responses of the plants with the results and discussion arranged so as to consider the response of each organ or plant part at intervals to: (a) the photo - period and temperature, and (b) the nitrogen treatments under each of these sets of I conditions. (2) The physiological responses within the plant as deter - mined by: (a) macrochemical analysis for organic and inor - ganic nitrogen and for carbo tiydrate fractions, and (b) micro - chemical studies of sections if plants for nitrates and starch. A uniform order is used in presenting data in all tables, so that information concerning any one lot of potatoes al - ways appears in the same relative position. The order is as follows : Period Number of nitrogen treatments First i Second 2 5 Third 3 4 6 7 Fourth 3' 4' 6' 7' The nitrogen treatments during these periods were as follows : Period Nitrogen treatments First __: +N ~ Second + N • " In" \ Third X N -N IN Fourth +N L-N +N -N By this system the reader need only remember that all tab - ular divergences to the left present data from plants with which nitrogen was either continued in the nutrient solution </seg>

            <seg id="p019">Nebraska Exp. Sta Research Bulletin 75 For the purposes of this bulletin "vegetative growth" refers to all plant parts except tubers and roots. The latter were not weighed in several series; MORPHOLOGICAL RESPONSE OF PLANTS TO EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS The principal characteristics of the plus-N plants are very briefly summarized on a comparative basis in Table 3. The basis for comparison was the appearance of the plants at the close of each series. This enables one (Figs. 2 to 6) to visualize the effect of day length and temperature upon plants receiving nitrogen continually. Additional details concern - ing the morphological response of these plants as exhibited at various periods of growth , as well as the response of plants from which nitrogen was during various periods, are presented in the ensuing discussions and tables pertaining to the various plant parts. TOTAL GROWTH AS MEASURED BY TOTAL WEIGHT OF THE PLANT Most investigations on record, as cited by Liebscher (68) and by Wilfarth, Romer, and Wimmer (136), report that as plants became older the total dry weight of the entire plant continued to increase, but that if grown to approximately normal maturity the weight of the tops decreased during the last days or weeks when tuberization was still taking place, partly with the aid of materials translocated from the tops. Their experience and the results of this investigation show that during the very early^ periods growth was slow while still being made at the expense of the seed piece. When plants became photosynthetically more active because of new leaves, growth occurred and the vegetative portions (leaves and stems) increased rapidly in size, number, and weight until tubers formed. Ther total weight increase continued at an active rate but consisted largely of tuber production and finally as this slowed down the weight increased very little. The extent, proportion, and duration of growth of the various plant parts and cf the entire plant were greatly altered in these investigations by temperature, photoperiod, and nitrogen nutrition (Fij;. 7, Tables 4 and 5). In this investigation, with plants receiving nitrogen con - tinually (1, 2, 3) the total dry weight of the entire plant increased throughout the deration of each series. The mean increment of gain for each day or each hour of daylight in - creased to a maximum and then decreased (Table 6, a and b). This maximum rate was attained during the third period in Series A and C. In Series D it was attained during the second period — heat damage during the third period having </seg>

Broili (16) was able to in - crease the number of seed balls, without adversely affecting tuber production, by girdling the stalks. Similar results have been obtained by gassing the plants with carbon dioxide (14). Garner and Allard (41), growing potatoes at high temperatures, found that blooming was increased by shorten - ing the day from 18 to 14 hours and that with days of 10 and 5 hours flowers formed but did not open.

Young (139) reported a definite correlation be - tween tuber and seed production and also a shedding of buds following a wave of warm weather in early summer. Stout and Clark (114) reported that plants of ten varieties (including Triumph) bloomed and tuberized profusely at Presque Isle, Maine, but that plants grown from the other halves of the same tubers at the New York Botanical Garden did not open a single flower before abscissing, although they did produce a good crop of tubers. Young (tf-40) found that in the blasting and shedding of flowers under unfavorable weather conditions there is an early degeneration of both ovule and anther con - tents. In these experiments with the plants grown at a high tem - perature and with long days of increasing length (D), large clusters of completely developed flowers terminated the main axis about 30 days after emergence (Fig. 5). Within the next ten days fully developed flowers in smaller cymes were produced on laterals growing from the axils of the third or fourth leaves from the top or tfrom the laterals coming from the basal nodes. The nitrogeii-deficient plants had the most flowers par cyme. With the high-temperature-and-decreas - mg-day-length series (A), the cymes were smaller and more of the flowers aborted as buis or ab - scissed prematurely than whe i the day %M : TKI length was increasing (Fig. 2) This was especially the case with the high-nitrogen $£Jak- ' plants.

This internal condition is a result of the external environment. When carbohydrates are formed very rapidly, in quantities in excess of the needs of the enlarging cells of the stem tip or of the embryonic leaves, as in high-temperature, long-day plants, flowers may be formed before the greater part of the nitrogen flow is diverted to lateral buds, which elongate as the next step in vegetative growth.

Conditions appear unfavorable for nitrlogen assimilation in these tops as has been shown to be the case in tomatoes by Eckerson (35). STEM DEVELOPMENT AND GROWTH Internal characteristics. — The stems of the continual - mtrogen plants grown with long days and high temperature (A) soon became very thick (9-15 mm. at the base), woody and stiff with extensive development of secondary xylem being comparable in internal appearance to the long-day to - mato stems of Pfeiffer (96). The stems of short-day and low-temperature plants were slender (4-6 mm. in diameter) with very little woody tissue and practically no ritnditv showing anatomical characteristics of the 5- and 7-hour to - mato plants of Pfeiffer (96). The stems of the short-day, low-temperature plants (B) were thinner and had less woody tissue than those at high teirperature (DS). Those of inter - mediate day length (C) had a slightly greater diameter and more secondary xylem than those of Series B The withholding of nitrogen from the nutrient solution, causing the development of a^ess vegetative stem, resulted in an increase in the proportion of xylem to the pith, as was lT n \ *A n + l° ma i? e l (6 i h r.

            <seg id="p032">Development of the Potato Plant buds along the main axis. The deve'.opment of these buds into lateral stems and stolons is discussed in separate portions of this paper. Jones, McKinney, and Fellows (5.4) secured increased height of stem with increases in soil temperature from 11° to 27° C, and then much less growth at 27° to 30.5° C. than at any of the lower temperatures. They also found that the green weight of tops reached the maximum at 21°-21 5° C and then decreased very rapidly. Bushnell (18) concluded that with soil and air the same there was no significant difference in stem elongation in a series grown * mu to 2 - 9 °, C - when axillar y shoots were kept pinched out.

Lateral stems: development and grmoth. — Elongation of buds in the axils of the lewes began about the time the flower primordia developed at the terminus of the central axis (page 28). Axillary elongation occurred from both the basal and apical buds of th ; above-ground stem with prac - tically no growth from the inedian buds.

As the lateral stems represented most of the stem growth in all except one series (B) the discussion given for total growth will suffice for laterals also. Complete data are given in Table 9. When days were long and warm, the apical growing points of many stolons came to the surface and produced leaves and stems (Figs. 2, 5, 8, 11), but when days were short (Figs. 3, 4, 6, 9, 10, 12) this did not occur.

Growth of each of the major laterals was similar to that of the central axis. The characteristic number of leaves de - veloped along the lateral axis, which then terminated in an inflorescence. Linear growth was then continued by the lat - eral or laterals which developed in the axils of the third or fourth leaves below the terminal. This process was repeated till eventually laterals of fourth rank removed from the cen - tral axis were being developed (Figs. 8 to 12). The length of each succeeding rank of laterals became shorter (Table 8). Lateral development of this kind occurred only with the high - temperature, long-day plants, the short-day low-temperature plants barely developing any primary or first-rank laterals.

Research Bulletin 75 When nitrogen was withheld from the plants during the second period after emergence (5D), the total growth of the lateral stems was cut to hall: that of continual-nitrogen plants. During the second period the growth of each of the lower six laterals was about equal. At higher levels they were very much shorter, with practically no elongation of the laterals by the end of the second period in the upper half of the plant. During the third period the laterals from the two lower nodes practically ceased growth, hut those from the third to seventh basal nodes elongated. The apical laterals elongated very rapidly, approaching the leigth of the corresponding laterals of the high-nitrogen plants. The median laterals still did not grow. When large vegetative plants were deprived of nitrogen after the second period (4D), the immediate effect was a check in the growth of th2 four lowest laterals and an in - crease in that of the fifth to tenth laterals, as compared with the high-nitrogen plants. The lower leaves of these plants were dying off rapidly as a result of the nitrogen shortage, whereas those of continua -nitrogen plants remained green ; hence the difference in grcwth of the lower laterals. There was no significant difference in the elongation of the apical laterals. Greater elongation of laterals located at the fifth to tenth nodes was due to 1he green leaves located here prob - ably having encountered less competition for nutrients than did correspondingly located leaves of high-nitrogen plants (3D). The addition of nitroger at the close of the second period increased the length of the laterals from the two basal and eight apical nodes but those from the median nodes were not as long as those of plants that were still starving. These laterals were comparable but not yet equal in growth to those of the continual-nitrogen plant. Results with the other simmer series (A) were somewhat similar. With nitrogen ccntinually supplied, apical laterals accounted for the highest percentage of total elongation, fol - lowed by the laterals coming from stolons.. When the nitro - gen supply was limited (7A and 4A), the percentage of total linear growth in the basal I laterals was higher. With a high nitrogen supply the aerial laterals from stolons accounted for a greater percentage of the total lateral growth and the basal laterals less than when nitrogen was not supplied.

Research Bulletin 75 following the development of the leaves on the main axis, but in all series considerable elongation was occurring in aerial stems throughout the life of all plants when nitrogen continued available. The £;reatest linear growth occurred in plants grown at high temperatures during long days (A, D) and least with short days and low temperatures (B. C). When day length was increasing, elongation continued for a relatively longer time and was more extensive than when it was decreasing (Table 9). Withholding nitrogen resulted in a serious check in the growth of stems in all series but elongation did not cease completely until plants were almost dead, some elongation still occurring even after most of the leaves were dead. Elongation after nitrogen was withheld was least with short - day, low-temperature plants and greatest with long-day, high - temperature plants on both a relative and an absolute basis. The total length of the stems after nitrogen was withheld had increased at the termination of the various series as follows: Series B after 52 days, 16 per cent; Series C after 53 days, 96 per cent; Series D after 28 days, 345 per cent; Series A after 43 days, 472 per cen ;. These figures refer to Lot 7 as compared with Lot 1. When nitrogen was not vdthheld until the end of the sec - ond period, elongation was again most extensive when days were warm and long. The percentage increases of length at the end of the fourth period over the length when nitrogen was withheld at the end of the second period (Lot 4' com - pared with Lot 2) were as follows: Series B, 33 per cent; Series C, 75 per cent; Series D, 98 per cent. This extensive elongation of N-deficient plants under high - temperature, long-day conditions was undoubtedly accom - plished by the breaking do-\m of organic nitrogen to soluble forms and the subsequent translocation of such soluble nitro - gen as well as other compounds from the older parts of the plant (92). When the experiments were terminated this had generally continued to the point of all leaves being dead ex - cept a few at the tips of laterals. Supplying nitrogen to plants from which N was withheld during the second period alkvays increased the linear growth — but only to a slight degree beyond that which occurred in plants deprived of N still longer. The nitrogen going into the tops apparently was u&amp;ed to rehabilitate the leaves, by rebuilding the chlorophyll supply, and also to enlarge the leaves. </seg>

The leaflets that were not fully developed when nitrogen was withdrawn were smaller and longer than those of the continuous-nitrogen plants. The leaves came out from the stems at a sharper angle. The apical leaflet was relatively larger than the lateral ones and there was more rapid tapering off in size from the apical to the basal pair of laterals than in continuous-nitrogen plants. In Series B actual counts made 18 days after nitrogen withdrawal from the solution revealed 7.5 per cent fewer pairs of leaflets, compound leaves 15 per cent shorter and lateral leaflets averaging 8.5 per cent shorter and having a ratio of width to length of 0.58:1 compared with 0.64:1 in leaflets of continual-nitrogen plants. The lower leaves died off first, the upper ones, on the central axis and at the tips of laterals, remaining green until the last. These plants ma - tured several weeks early because of the early death of their leaves. With high temperatures and long days, nitrogen-deficiency symptoms appeared quickly and distinctly, but leaves con - tinued to be differentiated for a considerable time after nitrogen had been withdrawn (Tables 4 and 5). With short days and low temperatures practically no new leaves were differentiated after nitrogen was withdrawn. Instead the uppermost leaves continued to grow until they were prac - tically as large as the older lower leaves ; thus at a very early date these plants had the appearance of plants that have com - pleted their growth, a distinctive but later-occurring charac - teristic of the continuous-nitrogen plants of Series B (Fig. 14). The leaves of low-temperature, short-day plants turned to a pale, whitish green color in Series B or a chrome yellow color in Series C, and while apparently devoid of chlorophyll they remained alive in this condition for a long time. Even the lower leaves did not turn brown and die early. Withholding nitrogen from older plants, i.e. at the end of the second period, always checked the leaf growth prompt - ly and in all ways caused a response very similar to that pro - duced by withholding nitrogen from younger plants. With short days and low temperatures (B, C) the leaves turned a pale green and then yellow but remained alive for a long time. With long-day, high-temperature plants (A, D) the lower leaves died off quite soon after nitrogen was withheld and the upper leaves remained green, and small new leaves continued to be formed. In the case of the plants grown as days were getting longer and hotter (D), the nitrogen re - duction brought about changes within the leaves that in - creased their resistance to heat. When subjected to exces- </seg>

This enabled these plants to con - tinue to function after this period of stress. Their weight of leaves and of tubers increased while in the continual - nitrogen series they decreased. Addition of nitrogen to old plants after being starved during the second period brought back a dark green color into practically all the leaves and prolonged the life of the lower leaves as compared with plants continuing to be with - out nitrogen. Old leaves we:*e enlarged but new leaves were not produced when temperatures were low and days very short (B), but when days were of intermediate length (C) a few new leaves were produced, while with high tempera - tures and medium (A) or long days (D) a number of new leaves were produced quickly and continuously until the ex - periments were terminated. In the latter case the soft leaves were severely damaged by heat during the third period. LEAF AND STEM GROWTH COMPARED ON THE BASIS OF DRY WEIGHT With nitrogen continually supplied the greatest total dry weight of leaves per plant was produced with long days and high temperature (A, D) (Tables 4 and 5). With regard to leaf weight in proportion to stem weight, the short-day and low-temperature plants produced the most leaves, i.e., had the highest ratio of leaf to stem (Fig. 16). The sig - nificant effect of a short diy in increasing leaf growth is shown in Series DS, where the leaf/stem ratios were greatly increased above comparable long-day plants of Series D. As plants became older, thi leaf weight increased most in short days with low temperatures, while in long days and high temperatures the stem weight increased most. This effect is also seen in Series A, where the leaf/stem ratio in - creased as the temperature and day length decreased. The total dry weight of leaves was approximately six times higher with long warm days (A) than with short cool days (B), yet the tuber production of the latter series was dis - tinctly the greater of the tWo (Table 5). When nitrogen was withheld at the end of the second or third period the total dry &gt; weight and ratios of dry weight of leaves to stems were greatly reduced, mostly with low temperatures and short days. Under the long-day, high-tem - perature conditions, nitrogen was utilized by the growing points of the tops to form 3tems and leaves, but with short days new leaves were not sont out and the tuber growth ap - peared to absorb most of the unassimilated nitrogen remain - ing in the plant. </seg>

With nitrogen supplied to N-deficient plants at the end of the third period, the increase in dry weight of leaves in all series was relatively more rapid and the ratios of dry weight of leaves to stems were much higher than with the constant-nitrogen plants. Most of the late-season increase m weight of the tops was in the leaves either as new leaves (AD) or enlarged and revived leaves (B, C). The plants matured like high-nitrogen plants rather than like the nitro - gen-deficient plants (Figs. 2 and 6). TOP GROWTH AS MEASURED BY INCREASE IN WEIGHT The green weight of the tops or vegetative portions (all of plant except tubers and roots) increased as the season advanced until a maximum was reached just prior to the </seg>
            <seg id="p047">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 75 period of most active tuberization (Tables 4 and 5, Figs. 23 and 24). The dry weight of the tops continued to in - crease throughout the duration of these experiments. The largest and heaviest tops were those produced in long warm days (A, D) ; the sn allest and lightest were those produced in short days with low temperatures (B, C). An increase in day length of only 2 to 3 hours (C compared with B) trebled the dry weight of the tops at low tempera - tures. Increase in the day length of 3.5 to 4 hours at a high temperature (D compared w th DS) only a little more than doubled the highest total dry weight of tops. The top weight of the short-day plants at a iigh temperature (DS) was ap - proximately three times as great as the weight of those grown at low temperature (B) but some of the difference was also due to greater light intensity accompanying the higher tem - perature. Tops were increased both by increasing the length of day and increasing the temperature, within the ranges of this experiment. In another' set of plants grown during the summer of 1933 at temperatures averaging 85° F. through - out the life of the plants (E), the weight of tops (data not reported) was less than in the Series A and D. The weight of tops was ii rapidly decreasing percentage of the total dry weight with each successive harvesting per - iod, decreasing with greater t rapidity with short-day, low - temperature plants (Tables 6C and 18). When days were becoming longer and hotter (D) the relationship was re - versed, the tops continuing to increase in weight while tubers decreased. When nitrogen was withheld at the end of the first period the green weight continued to increase for a time and then decreased at an earlier date and more rapid rate than when nitrogen was supplied constantly. The dry weight followed similar trends but more slowly, not having started to de - crease when the last plants were harvested in any of the short-day series (Lot 7', in B, C, and DS), and having de - creased only temporarily in the long-day, high-temperature series (7DS). The percentage of dry matter going into the tops decreased still more r ipidly with time than with the continual-nitrogen plants. Here too as days were getting hotter and longer (7' DS), top growth came to constitute an increasing percentage of th&lt; total increase in dry weight. When nitrogen was withheld from older plants (4) at the end of the second period, trends were similar to those with plants starved earlier, except that the percentage of weight going into the tops was very much smaller and decreasing more rapidly with time than in any other treatment. </seg>
            <seg id="p048">Development of the Potato Plant Adding nitrogen to the nutrient solution after the plants had been starved during the second period. (6) caused an abrupt and greatly accelerated increase in top growth. When conditions were least favorable for vegetative growth as in short days (B, C), the dry weight percentage going into tops was very greatly reduced after the initial rise. When days were long and warm the tops continued to represent a large percentage of the total weight, even increasing while tuber weight was decreasing (D). These plants died off more quickly than did those that continued to be deprived of nitro - gen during the later periods (Table 6C). The persistence of top growth even when sometimes ac - companied by decrease in weight of tubers as found in plants receiving nitrogen during long warm days, together with the rather sudden death of the leaves and their reduced heat resistance, may have been due to conditions similar to those discovered in the tomato by Nightingale (92). He found that at 95 F. nitrate was assimilated very rapidly, but that there were no carbohydrate reserves because of their utilization in protein synthesis and respiration. As this condition persisted the carbohydrate supply became inadequate for protein synthesis. Then complex proteins were broken into simple ammo compounds. After a short period of accelerated growth the plants died. As the potato plant has a lower optimum than the tomato, the temperatures with which plants ot benes D were growing (period means of 85°-92° F ) were excessive in a similar degree. The plants not only used up the carbohydrates in the tops but also those stored in the tubers. STOLONS Hardenburg (47) found that at 68° F. the Rural New York - er variety grown in a greenhouse at Ithaca, N. Y., during the late winter and spring produced more sto'ons. more branch stolons, and more green weight of stolons than at 59° F Uark (21) found no correlation between tuber weight and sto on length but his data indicated a tendency for upper stolons to produce smaller tubers. Wenkel (132), using short- and long-stolon varieties, found tnat stolons cease elongation as soon as the tip begins to swell into a tuber but that the various stolons on one stem do not stop elongating at the same time. He found that length increased with increased soil moisture and fertility and that length was increased more by manuring on heavy than on light soils, apparently because manured soils were more open and physically less resistant to stolons. He re - ports, from his work and that of others also, that it is char- </seg>
            <seg id="p049">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 75 acteristic of some varieties, especially after late summer rains, for plants shortly before ripening to send out several more stolons which are longer and thicker than the others, but that tubers borae on such stolons are formed too late to attain marketable size. In the long-stolon variety Preusen, the number of stolons increased during a period of four weeks but with the short-stolon Erdgold the number increased dur - ing only one week. He states that the first termination of stolon elongation occurs with certainty when blossoms fall. Shortening the days decreased the length of stolons of the South American varieties used by Shick (109). When all days were short (10 hours) Razumov (99) secured only 19 per cent as much stolon weight as when all were long (15-19 hours). He also found that short days early in the life of the plant greatly reduced the weight of stolons but that when they occurred late they caused but little difference. Very long days were so favorable for stolon formation that when tuber-producing plants wers exposed to long days the stolons renewed growth and developed vegetative shoots above the soil surface. With a very long day (18-19 hours) at high temperature Garner and A lard (41) also found stolons pro - ducing vegetative aerial shoots. General morphological observations on stolons. — At each node of the underground stem of the potato plants there was developed a compound eye like bud which when first differ - entiated had only one bud. Later generally two (though sometimes more) additional buds were differentiated in a lateral position. These buds at the nodes thus resembled the eyes of tubers more tian they did the axillary buds of the above-ground stems. The first or central bud manifested its apically dominant position and was the first to elongate into a stolon. The elongation of the others was dependent upon subsequent circumstances (Figs. 17 to 22). The first buds to elongate into stolons were generally those centrally located at what appeared to be the third to the fifth nodes from the base of the subterranean stem. The buds from adjacent nodes both higher and lower on the stem de - veloped stolons a short tine later, but the first stolons from the central nodes continued to be the longest until tubers were developed on their t ps. At the base of the stem, be - tween the old seed piece and what appeared by casual in - spection to be the lowest bud or at least the one developing the lowest stolon, one could find by careful inspection (es - pecially with the use of a hand lens) from two to seven buds. These were developed in all stages from those very close to the old seed piece] which were barely discernible as </seg>
            <seg id="p050">Development op the Potato Plant differentiated bud groups, to the upper ones in which the central bud was elongated as much as one millimeter. With low temperatures (60°-72° F.) the first buds elong - ated into stolons at about the time the sprouts were emerg - ing above the surface (B, C). With higher temperatures (70°-85° F.) stolons were not initiated till the first few leaves were forming above ground (A). With very high tempera - tures (above 85° F.) and with long days (14-15 hours) stolons developed very late and were very small (E) but stolon formation occurred quite early at high temperature if the days were short (ES). The various types of stolons will be distinguished from each other by the following terms: Primary stolons are considered as those developing first and singly from each node. These primary stolons elongated rather rapidly immediately after being differentiated from axillary buds. From 9 to 12 primary stolons were generally produced per plant. Those in the lowest and highest posi - tions were commonly not only produced later but were also generally the shortest and least likely to produce tubers. Lateral stolons are stolons developing at the same node as a primary stolon but from lateral buds. They were de - veloped later, under some conditions at the rate of one to as high as 6 or 7 laterals per node. Branch stolons are those produced still later from the lat - eral buds on the primary stolons. No branch stolons were observed on any lateral stolons. Under conditions very favorable for stolon growth, prim - ary stolons frequently came to the surface and developed an aerial stem with leaves which functioned as did the main stem. Stolons were then produced from the numerous ax - illary buds of such top-forming stolons. Tubers were generally and most frequently developed from the terminal buds of primary stolons; however, thev were T»w«T T dS^ in ny P? sition on any type of' stolon.

            <seg id="p052">Development of the Potato Plant stolons as to place, extent, predominant type, etc., was very considerably altered by the various experimental factors in - troduced. When conditions became so favorable for tuberization that no stolon growth was occurring, as in Series C, the upper two or three primary stolons appeared to be quiescent for a brief period and then died back from the tip. Sometimes almost the entire stolon rotted. At other times, as the tip was dying back, branch stolons near the base or lateral stol - ons at the same node renewed their growth and in a few instances small tubers developed at these places. This con - dition did not seem to be altered by nitrogen nutrition, being about alike with all treatments. At the same time the lower stolons also frequently failed to develop their tubers and shriveled but never were found rotting. The development of long, new stolons near the surface late in the season, as re - ported from German workers (109), did not occur in any series. Growth of stolons when nitrogen was supplied continuously. — Although growing conditions had relatively slight influence upon the number of primary stolons, they apeared to have been most numerous when plants were grown at a low tem - perature with days of intermediate length (C, Table 10). At high temperature and with long days the terminals of a considerable number of stolons came to the surface and pro - duced leaves. These stolons were commonly either the first stolons that elongated (the third to fifth from the bottom) or they came from the upper nodes located within an inch of the surface (Figs. 2, 5, 20, 21, 22). Under very hot weather conditions all the stolons commonly grew at a sharp angle toward the surface (Fig. 22). This did not occur with either low temperature or short days (Figs. 9, 10, 12, 18, 19, 21). Increasing the day was the most efficient means of in - creasing the mean length of the primary stolons (Table 11). In Series C while day length was increasing from 10 to 12.5 hours the mean length of primary stolons was approximately twice as great as in Series B, where it was decreasing from 10.8 to 9.2 hours. Although the stolons were not measured, photographs of short-day, high-temperature plants (DS and ES) show the stolons to have been very short in comparison with the long-day plants (Figs. 21 and 22). The short days hastened tuber formation on primary stolon terminals ; hence stolon growth was terminated early. When days decreased from long to intermediate length (A) the primary stolons were shorter than when the length was increasing (D). </seg>

            <seg id="p054">Development of the Potato Plant The total length per plant of primary stolons increased in all series until tuberization was well under way, thus show - ing that some stolons made considerable growth after the growth of others had been terminated by the formation of a terminal tuber (Table 11). In three series the total length was less at the end of the third or fourth period than earlier. This was due to the rotting of upper stolons, which was prob - ably instigated by their mobile contents being translocated to growing tubers on other stolons as in Series B and C, or to the top for maintaining life during a period of stress as in Series D. Lateral stolons were numerous at low temperatures when the day length was increasing from 10 to 13 hours (C) and even more so at high temperatures with long days (D) (Table 10). With sn ° rt days of constant length (DS and ES) or of decreasing length (B) the number of lateral stolons was very small, tubers having been set on the primary stolons at a very early date. The mean length per plant of lateral stolons and also the total length were increased as days became longer (Table 11). Results with Series DS and ES indicate that increased temperature did not result in lateral stolon growth if days were short (Figs. 21 and 22). Branch stolons were most numerous with long-day, high - temperature plants, largely because under those conditions many primary stolons came to the surface and produced leaves (Fig. 20). Thus these stolons could act more or less as independent units. With low temperatures and short-to-intermediate days (C) the number of branch stolons, on the primary stolons that remained in the sand, was greater than with similar stolons on high-temperature plants (A, D). With Series C the total number of branch stolons per plant was less than in A or D because none of the primary stolons produced leafy tops. With short days, regardless of temperature, very few branch stolons were produced, but frequently, especially at high temperatures, tubers were produced directly from lat - eral stolon buds without any intervening branch stolon (Fig. 21). Branch stolons as a group were relatively short, but nevertheless the mean length increased as the day length increased. With short days the branch stolons were extreme - ly short, mostly because of the extensive development of tubers from lateral buds without stolons. Of the total length of all stolons, the highest percentage occurred in the primary stolons. This percentage decreased </seg>

In all series the lateral stolons contained a higher percentage of the total stolon length than did the branch stolons. Increasing the day length greatly increased the percentage found in the lat - eral stolons but did not great y increase the percentage that consisted of branch stolons u itil the primary stolons got to the surface and produced functioning leaves as in A and D - then the branch stolons might have been considered as of lateral type. Stolon growth with nitrogen supply altered only as stolons tvere developing. — The withdrawal of nitrogen at the end of the first period exerted little eTect upon the number or length of all or of any types of stol &gt;ns. when days had been short enough to induce early tuber zation, during this period (B, C, DS, ES). When day length and temperature had not been favorable for early tuberizaticn until about the time nitrogen was withheld (A), the number and length of all types of stolons were distinctly less thkn in those plants where nitro - gen was continued. When temperature and day length were becoming increasingly less fivorable for tuberization (D) the early withdrawal of nitrogen caused a distinct increase m the number and length o: primary and branch stolons. The greatest response was in the branch stolons. The num - ber and length of lateral stolons was not so great as when nitrogen was continued. Withholding nitrogen at ths end of the second period ex - erted no significant influence upon stolon growth except in beries D, where it increased the number and length of prim - ary and especially of branch stolons, but only the length (not number) of lateral stolons (Fig. 20).

            <seg id="p057">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 75 In one supplemental series, seed potatoes planted in sand to sprout at 70° F. and watered with a nutrient solution containing nitrogen seemed to initiate stolons slightly earlier than when nitrogen was lackinig. At a temperature of 58° F. there was little difference. The difference may have been due entirely to the earlier emergence and hence, earlier de - velopment of the plants in the nitrogen series. In another supplemental ser es designated as X, sprouting seed pieces started in sterile sand on November 21 were planted in sand in six-inch pbts on December 7 and from then on nitrogen was supplied! to or withheld from the nut - rient solution as explained in Table 12. The temperature and light were as in Series B. Some of the larger plants, as the No. 4 sets of Xc, Xd, and Xe, were crowded toward the end of the experiment so as to cause more etiolation of stems or reduced daily growth. q r e - «♦ Fig. 17.— -Stolon and tuber grovfth at low temperatures during short days when plants received nitrogen for short periods early m their life or later (Series X).

However 1 , as the plants became older and the nitrogen supply in the seed pieces became exhausted there was only a slight increase in number of primary stol - ons. With nitrogen supplied the number of stolons in - creased continually so that on January 24 there were more </seg>
            <seg id="p058">Development of the Potato Plant than double the number on the nitrogen-starved series (Table 12, Fig. 17). When nitrogen was withdrawn from the solution supplied to the younger plants the number of stolons continued to increase for a brief period and then remained stationary, but when withheld from the older plants (Xc 4) the numbers remained stationary. When nitrogen was supplied to plants that had been starved since planting (Xe to Xh), the number of primary stolons was always increased and continued to increase till the experiment was terminated, the final number being pro - portional to the length of time nitrogen had been supplied. Branch and lateral stolons, which appeared about three weeks after emergence, increased in proportion to the nitro - gen supply. They responded to the addition of nitrogen more than did the primary stolons. The number of buds differentiated at the base of the stem and developed in stages ranging from apparently dormant and barely distinguishable buds to those elongating but less than 1 mm. long and considered as primordial stolons, was lowest where nitrogen was available early in the life of the plant and highest where it had been withheld during the early periods. When nitrogen was withheld for a long time (Xh 4) or when it had been available only a brief time (Xg 4) these primordia were more advanced than where it had been continuously available.. Thus it might have been possible for relatively old plants to develop new primary stolons from the base of the main stem somewhat as described by Tussing (122). The total stolon growth, as measured by total length, fol - lowed the general trend of the number of stolons. Late addition of nitrogen resulted in a very rapid growth of stol - ons. There is also some indication that while late nitrogen withdrawal curtailed top growth it may have caused a brief period of increased stolon elongation (Xc 3 and 4). These results show that the number and length of stolons can be greatly altered by variations in the amount of nitro - gen available during the early life of the plant but that changes made late, especially after tubers have set, are of much less consequence. Effect of experimental conditions upon weight and dry - matter of stolons. — Growing conditions caused considerable difference in the thickness and composition of stolons.

When nitrogen was withheld at the end of the first period there was a verv rapid increase in the stolon thickness and also in the weight per centimeter and in percentage &lt;^f dry matter, during the next or second period. This was because of limited N assimilation which with concomitant decrease in top growth caused car - bohydrate accumulation in stolons. This was followed in the third period by much lower percentages with a smaller de - crease during the fourth period. These decreases were due to decreased photosynthesis plus increased respiration in the N-deficient tops and consequent reduced carbohydrate accu - mulation of stolons.

            <seg id="p060">Development of the Potato Plant stolons that were no longer growing (Fig. 19), while in Series D the weight per unit of length decreased because of the development of some new stolons and translocation to the tops, whose heat resistance was reduced by nitrogen addition. The characteristics of Series D were distinctive. The stol - ons were of uniform thickness throughout most of their length till about the 15th to the 20th day. Then there was very little indication of tuberization at the stolon tip but instead each stolon attained a diameter just behind the apex about two or three times that at the base, the diameter be - coming gradualy less from the apical to the basal portions. In the continual-nitrogen series a number of the older stol - ons came to the surface and produced aerial stems and leaves but where nitrogen was being withheld this general swelling of the stolons continued until about the 25th day, when tubers were differentiated. However, throughout the continuation of this series, when plants were not receiving nitrogen the stolons exhibited this tendency toward tapering thickness, receding from the apical end. This thickening very largely disappeared when nitrogen was again supplied (6D). With short days, stolons were uniformly thick, tubers being dis - tinctly differentiated without any unusual amount of stolon tapering (Fig. 20). TUBERS The essential physiological facts concerning tuberization have very recently been stated concisely by Tincker and Darbishire (119) as follows: Storage in tubers is the sum of carbohydrates manufactured minus carbohydrates for growth requirements minus other local carbohydrate requirements (as storage more or less permanently in stems and dormant buds) plus residual carbohydrates in the seed piece. In order to determine some of the fundamental causes of tuber formation it is esential to keep in mind the morpho - logical nature of the potato tuber as a modified stem with its axis greatly shortened and its lateral members only weakly developed as "eyes" (9). When the stolon tip accumulates carbohydrates and develops a tuber a great deal of cell divi - sion is occurring and of course considerable elaborated nitro - gen is required. This initial stage is relatively short and does not involve much increase in size. As carbohydrates continue to be supplied the parenchyma cells expand as much as 64 times their previous volume (9). Most of the expan - sion occurs in the parenchyma cells located between the xylem and inner phloem, in the pith, and a minor amount in the pericycle. As these cells store sugar and starch and the protoplasmic content of the cells is relatively meager it is </seg>
            <seg id="p061">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 75 evident that not much nitrogen is required for their later or nnal development. Cambial activity makes a relatively in - significant contribution to the increase in size of the tuber It must be recognized that a bud, either dormant or partly developed, must be available for expansion in order to make a tuber (124, 125). The buds most frequently utilized for tuber formation are terminal] buds of stolons, but tubers are frequently developed, from la eral buds on stolons or directly from buds on either the underground or aerial portions of the stem or directly from thW eye of a mature tuber either with or without an intermediate stolon, and under some ex - ceptional conditions small tubers are produced on or within the parent tuber. At other i;imes sprouts or stems swell so extensively as to be quite tuberous in appearance (12 U, 125). Review of literature on tilberization.— The importance of the presence of a bud for expansion into a tuber was shown by Vochting (124). When cuttings were planted so that only internodal stem tissue was below the surface, tubers were produced aerially, the underground portion having been in - capable of producing adventitious buds. By darkening the apex of a primary shoot the g: -owing point was converted into a tuber. The studies on the development of "sprout" tubers, also «S ei J1» t0 . as " secondar y"&gt; "premature tubers", "blind", fandel" or "onderzeeers" (Butch for submarines), are of value in determining some of the fundamental facts concern - ing tubenzation. These tubers are formed directly from the old tubers and are separated from them only by stolons vary - ing m length from several entimeters to a millimeter or less or they are formed insid4 of the old tuber. Such tubers are formed while the potatoes are still in storage or after they have been planted. Hals.ted (46) reported observations and conclusions concerning the occurrence of such tubers in helds of potatoes in New Jdrsey and narrates that among English gardeners it is a regular practice to produce new tubers for winter market by keeping tubers of the previous years crop in a cool place during the summer, rubbing off the sprouts as they appear, "hen in the fall planting them m sand at 60° F., and in thrje months harvesting a frop of tubers of considerable size, developed without leaves Premature ripening of tubers by drouth or heat at the close of the vegetative period was considered a predisposing cause of sprout tuber forma tion by Wellensiek (131) and to!£ig£?} m h Fr , GShly iarvested Ga ™t Chili potatoes Sw Bermuda Produced secondary tubers when planted but when treated with thiourea, dthylene chlorhydrinf or sodium </seg>
            <seg id="p062">Development of the Potato Plant thiocyanate to break the rest period, normal sprouts were produced (28). On the other hand, sprout tubers of this kind have been produced by chemical treatment. Denny (26) calls attention to the "fatness of the buds" activated by treating Triumph potatoes with potassium thiocyanate. The author, in January-February, 1926, obtained prompt and rapid sprout growth from Triumph potatoes just emerging from the dormant period without any treatment. When such seed pieces were treated with a one per cent solution of sodium thiocyanate, growth was not appreciably altered but there was considerable tuberous thickening at the base of several stems. Seed pieces treated with a two per cent solu - tion produced tubers on very short stolons and then in some cases sent up plants from these new tubers. With a four per cent solution about half of the seed pieces produced small tubers directly but these did not sprout. Doring (30) ob - tained sprout tubers by the introduction of quinol into seed pieces. He found that this effect was more pronounced early in the storage period and with late varieties, which at any particular time were supposedly less dormant than early ones. This is in line with the findings of Weiss and Brierly (180) that Green Mountain tubers produced more sprout tubers than did Irish Cobblers. Goss (45) also observed with spindle-tuber Triumphs that sprout tubers were produced if the tubers were planted before the normal completion of the dormant period. Storage of seed potatoes at high temperature (50°-60° F ) was reported by Wellensiek (131 ) to have induced formation of many sprout tubers, whereas Schilberszky (104) found them when the potatoes had been chilled during storage and then were planted at temperatures too low for normal sprout formation. Most workers (131, 130, 45) agree that the con - dition was most serious when potatoes were planted in cold soils (37° and 48° P.), especially when dry. Storage in light retarded sprout tuber development but not greatly if storaee was prolonged (131, 76). Wellensiek (131) reported the water content of the parent tubers and first sprouts to have been between 75 and 90 per cent. He suggested that each successive crop of sprouts taking up a higher percentage of the remaining water gradually lowered the water content of the tuber and thus increased the relative concentration of dissolved materials until the concentration in the sprout was high enough to form a tuber instead of a sprout In this connection he reported that a 3 per cent potassium nitrate solution plasmolyzed the hairs on the first sprouts but that a 4.5 per cent solution was needed to plasmolyze those on the </seg>

When transferred from the high to the low temperature the foliage shoots took on a horizontal direction and the formation of tubers began. Decreased respiration did not account for the tuber - ization at low temperature because it was not retarded by low pressure of oxygen. Germination in sand free from moisture gave no foliage shoots but only short roots and stol - ons with numerous tubers, regardless of temperature. When the initial high moisture supply was reduced when foliage shoots were 10-12 cm. long, elongation stopped and numerous small aerial tubers were formed. When the soil was moist but the air was dry, shoots soon assumed a horizontal direc - tion and numerous basal branches appeared. In diffuse light and with moist soil, if the air was moist large leaves with long internodes were produced, but if the air was dry leaves were mere scales and internodes were short and thick, and basal stolons were produced. When tubers were placed up - right between plates without soil, elongation of the apical shoot decreased as the light was increased and roots were inhibited. According to these results by Vochting, tuberi - zation or processes approaching tuberization were brought about by conditions which checked the elongation of sprouts or which prevented the production of non-storage vegetative organs and thus created a surplus of carbohydrates. His re - sults showed that under high humidity hydrolytic processes occurred and vegetative growth resulted whereas with low humidity storage organs developed as a result of condensa - tion of simpler sugars to complex sugars and starch. This is in line with the recent work of Nightingale and Mitchell (92a), who found much greater carbohydrate accumulation in the tomato with low than with high humidity. From the work of these investigators it appears that this tuberization which occurs by the mere translocation of ma - terial from the old tuber to the sprout tuber is associated with desiccation of tuber tissue and with nitrogen deficiency, while carbohydrates continue in abundance. Dealing with normal plants growing under irrigation, Clark (21) concluded that in the Rural New Yorker variety all tubers were differentiated from stolon tips or "set" at about the same time and that final differences in weight of individual tubers were due to unequal growth rates rather </seg>

Razumov (99) found that plants given long days (19-15 hours) early in life and short days (10 hours) later, produced a much greater weight of tubers than when days were continually long or continually short. But when the short days occurred early with long days later, the tuber yields were greater than with either long or short days continually, but they were lower than when long days were followed by short ones. In the long days large tops were de - veloped which supplied abundant leaf surface for carbohy - drate manufacture and then when vegetative growth was terminated by the short days, extensive reserves were avail - able. With Solatium demissum, S. acaule, Ullucus tuberosus and Oxalis tuberosa, tubers did not develop during long days that followed short ones but instead tubers which had formed during short days were frequently resorbed and grew out as stolons or tops. All investigators have found that the largest tops are se - cured with the longest days and the most tubers with inter - mediate to short days, but when days are much shorter than 10 or 12 hours the reduced leaf area causes reduced efficiency to the point where tuber yields are reduced not only per plant but also in proportion to the leaf area. The photoperiodic response could be changed somewhat by altering the temperature or the carbon-dioxide content of the air. Arthur, Guthrie, and Newell (6) found that with the normal winter day the tuber yield of Irish Cobblers was f°?u *o 7 ?T ?' but " fair " at 68 ° F - When th * day length £ J? e «. 68 , house was increas ed by six hours of electric light the tuber production was still only "fair", but when carbon dioxide was added the tuber yield was "very good" as was the case with 24 hours of artificial light plus carbon dioxide. However, at 78° F., when the day length was in - creased six hours, and to 24 hours of artificial illumination, with additional carbon dioxide the yield of tubers was poorer than with the normal winter length of day, although the top growth was greatly increased. When maximum tuber yields were secured with a 15-hour day, Beaumont and Weaver (11) found that increasing the day length to 18 hours reduced the yield 8 per cent at 60° but only 1.3 per cent at 50° F (night temperatures). ; Adams (2) found that photoperiodic response differed with varieties. McClelland (81) also found variety differences the Lookout Mountain being most responsive to reduced 'day length and the Triumph least, with the Irish Cobbler respond - ing to an intermediate degree.

            <seg id="p070">Development of the Potato Plant Undoubtedly much of the increased yield, improved type, and increased size of tubers secured with a straw mulch when potatoes were grown with high temperatures has been due to the demonstrated decrease in nitrate content of the soil, which thus limited vegetative growth and facilitated accumu - lation of surplus carbohydrates. A number of papers by French and English workers give consideration to the theory that tuberization is dependent up - on the presence of endotrophic mycorrhiza (12, 13, 77, 83, 93). This theory does not seem tenable in view of Laurent's (67) earlier results in obtaining tuberc'.es from starch-free shoots grown in the dark with a 10 to 20 per cent sucrose solution or those of Molliard (83) in getting onion bulbs and radish roots to develop in sterile glucose solutions. Ber - nard (13) later modified his theory and considered tuberi - zation as a state of hypertrophy brought about by increased osmotic pressure. Lutman (74), however, found osmotic concentration always low in tubers and highest in the aerial stems during the period of tuber formation. In view of these facts and the great body of literature showing tuberization to be the result of a nutritive balance, the mycorrhiza theory hardly justifies further consideration so far as the potato is concerned. ■ A Fig. 18. — Stolon and tuber development of typical plants of Series A at the clcse of each of the first three periods. </seg>

The plants of these two short-day series were also the most ef - ficient in building tubers, fdr they produced more milligrams of tubers per day or per hour per gram of leaves (dry - weight basis) than any other plants, and also had the highest ratio of dry weight of tubers to tops (Table 18). On the basis of hourly production per gram of leaf (dry weight), the short-day plants of Series B were the most efficient. This is of added interest when one considers that the intensity of the light was very low in Series B (Table 1). The plants of the shortest-day series (B) always had the highest ratio of dry weight of tubers to tops and had the heaviest average daily or hourly production of tubers per gram of leaf during the early part of the season, when these plants were depositing dry matter in tubers as rapidly as or more rapidly than in the tops. During the middle period of most active tuberization th£ greater average intensity of the light coming to Series C caused those plants to produce the greatest daily increment o tubers per plant and per gram of leaf per day but not qu te so much per gram of leaf per hour. This may have been due to the greater efficiency of the reduced light intensity during the winter days, comparable to what has been reported tot. tomatoes and tobacco (24) The brighter illumination of the plants of Series C caused them to mature earlier and consequently during the last period the daily and hourly gain of tubers for a given weight of leaves declined more rapidly in Series C than in B. Series C, with an intermediate dak was still producing more grams ot tubers per day because of the larger leaf area, but the leaves were less efficient than those of the short-day series (U), which were showing no signs of maturity of tops In Series B green weight of tops increased very slowly through - out the experiments, wherjas in Series C the period of most active tuberization was fo lowed by a decrease in the green uSStv^nSk 2T of this decrease occurred in the The daily increment of Liber production of the 10.5-hour, medium-temperature plants (DS) was actually higher when SSfftTS; tW ° Periods as a un * °f time LS Htt B and V fh W T te TT tUre u' short - d ay Plant, of Series «™S«* ' Q he - Val £ e c? £ avm£r been °- 280 ' °- 16 5, and 0.197 grams for Series DS, B, and C, respectively.

Research Bulletin 75 tuber-producing plants they were actually less efficient than the low-temperature plants, the mean daily production of tubers per gram of leaf figured for the first two periods of DS, B, and C, having been 42.4, 83.2, and 43.8 milligrams respectively (Table 14). With long warm days earliest tuberization occurred in Ser - ies D, but as the season advanced and days got hotter and longer the process was retarded and later there was an actual loss of tuber weight, whereas in Series A, with the days get - ting shorter and the temperature dropping a few degrees there were increases in the (weight of tubers, in the ratio of tubers to tops, and in the daily or hourly gain of tubers per gram of leaf. Another ser es (E) grown under day-length conditions comparable to Series A but with higher tempera - tures, had produced no tubers by the 60th day, when the ser - ies was terminated. These long-day, medium-to-high-tempera - ture plants were the least efficient for tuberization. As the plants of Series D were unavoidably subjected to excessively high and lethal temperatures after the 30th dav the results secured wlien harvested finally on the 43rd day are of limited value for comparative purposes. However the tuber/top ratio of the 10.5-hour plants continued much higher than in any of the U&gt;ng-day, high-temperature plants and although the temperature averaged 90° F. for the third period, there was a slight gain in tuber weight instead of a loss. While the plants of the different series are not strictly comparable because of having been subjected to different light intensities during the photoiferiod, these data do indicate that when temperatures are not excessive during the early period of growth a slight shortening of the day (30 minutes to an hour) may be more effective in increasing tuberization ef - ficiency than a considerable drop in temperature (10 degrees *.), and that tuberization will continue for a considerable period with short days in spite of high temperature.

After this initial period of rapid tuberization there was again a rapid decline in the rate, below that of the continuous-nitrogen plants. With short days the daily in - crease of tuber weight during the third period was not altered significantly by withholding iiitrogen at the end of the second period and although continual withholding reduced the daily increase during the fourth period below that of the second period and below that of cbntinual-nitrogen plants, the re - duction was not nearly so great as with long-day, high-tem - perature plants (Table 14a). The production of tubers per day or per hour for each gram of dry leaf weight (Table 14b and c) was greatly accel - erated in all series during the third period. These rates declined during the fourth period below those of the contin - ual-nitrogen plants with long, warm days (A, D) but not with short, cool days (B, C) . With long, warm days of decreasing length (A) nitrogen withdrawal was followed by an immediate decrease in the green weight of the leaves and stems. The very slight growth of these organs weighed lesis than did the leaves which died prematurely of starvation (Tables 4 and 5). The brief in - crease in dry weight of tops was due to differentiation of fibrous supporting tissues and to starch accumulation result - ing when less carbohydrate was used in making new tissues. The growth of tubers was greatly accelerated because of the surplus carbohydrate material available which the plants either could not use for new top growth because of an in - adequate nitrogen supply or did not need for respiration, and because of the simultaneous accumulation of most of the un - assimilated nitrogen into the tubers and the translocation of some assimilated nitrogen from the tops to the tubers. Thus it would seem that when carbohydrates are supplied in abund - ance, tubers are able to grow when the nitrogen supply is inadequate for the growth bf stems and leaves and that as the inorganic supply of nitrogen in the plant decreases the tubers can draw upon nitrogen assimilated in the leaves and stems. As the plants became older and nitrogen starvation more severe, the ratio of the weight of assimilated nitrogen m tubers to that in the top^s increased. With this restricted nitrogen condition the percentage of the tuber consisting of nitrogen was less than when it was constantly supplied to the plants. The reduced rate of tube: • growth per gram of leaf in long days was largely due to the reduction in leaf area by the dying of many of the leaves as a result of nitrogen starvation (Table 14). Had this rado been determined only for the </seg>
            <seg id="p080">Development op the Potato Plant green or more or less active leaves instead of on the total leaf growth, which included dead and senile leaves, the ratio would not have declined so rapidly. However, as nitrogen was constantly being removed from the upper leaves their activity was reduced and the ratio was actually declining and would have been lower later in the season than that of the continuous-nitrogen plants. When days were getting longer and hotter (D) there was a brief slight acceleration of tuberization following the with - holding of nitrogen. During a period of extremely high tem - peratures when the leaves of continuous-nitrogen plants were severely damaged, the plants which were not being supplied nitrogen appeared to pass through a hardening process and consequently leaves were more resistant to heat. With the high rate of respiration accompanying the high temperatures, the carbohydrates were used up more rapidly than they were manufactured and some were withdrawn from the tubers as was also some assimilated nitrogen. After this period the temperature was not quite so high and the minus-nitrogen plants were able to store dry matter in the tubers again while those supplied with nitrogen continued to lose weight many of the leaves having been destroyed. With short days and low temperatures the daily produc - tion of tubers per plant did not increase above that of the continuous-nitrogen plants, but the tuberization rate per gram of leaf per day or per hour was higher and although it also decreased with age it continued higher than in the plants of any of the other nitrogen treatments. The difference between these series and the long-day series was that with the short - day plants the green and dry weight of the tops increased very slightly or remained constant but the weight of assim - ilated nitrogen decreased. The ratio of dry matter and as - similated nitrogen in tubers to tops increased. With short days and high temperature (DS) the data are incomplete, but tuberization continued in these plants in spite of hot weather, the tuber yield on the 43rd day having been about three times as great as that of comparable full-day plants and twice as great as that of short-day, high-temper - ature plants receiving nitrogen continually. It seems that . withholding nitrogen was very effective in increasing the tuberization rate. At high temperatures re - gardless of length of day it also increased the total tuber weight for a period whose duration varied according to con - ditions. With short days at low temperature the weight ver plant was increased only slightly for a very brief period or not at all, but the hourly tuberization rate per unit of leaf </seg>
            <seg id="p081">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 75 weight was raised to the highest level of all treatments. With - drawal of nitrogen late in the season increased the yield per plant only under high-temperature conditions, but it raised the tuberization rate to a very high level. With short days at a high temperature, tuber production was greatly increased by nitrogen withdrawal at any time. In all series the tub - erization rate declined as the season advanced, because of the decreased activity of all i nd final death of some of the leaves. In Series X, each tirre nitrogen was withheld there was a decrease in tuber production (Xa to Xd). Adding nitrogen after the S2cond period almost always re - sulted in a lower dry-weight ratio of tubers to tops than occurred in plants with which nitrogen starvation was con - tinued. Immediately after ni:rogen was added there was a more or less rapid increase in top growth for a short time, followed by a decrease in the green weight of tops in all ex - cept the short-day plants (B, DS) (Figs. 23 and 24). The daily production of tubers per plant was increased promptly by nitrogen addition in all except Series A (Table 14). Dur - ing the final period of growth the daily tuber production in - creased still further when days were decreasing in length (A, B) or were continuously short (DS), but when days in - creased in length (C, D) the c aily tuber production per plant was less, actually decreasing with high temperatures and long days (D). The daily increase of tuber weight was greater during the last period than where starvation was continued except when heat was excessive in long days (D). An im - portant observation is that when the temperature was high and days short (DS), tubers were produced at a more rapid rate when nitrogen had been added than when nitrogen star - vation was continued. The yield of tubers never became as high as where nitrogen had been supplied during the first two periods except in the Ion? and short day, high-tempera - ture series (D, DS), where :he yield of Lot 6 was higher than of Lot 3. The rate of tuberization per gram of leaf per day or per hour was distinctly lowered during the first period following nitrogen addition (Table 14b and c). When days were de - creasing in length (A, B) this rate increased during the final period above both the earlier rate and the rate of all the other treatments of the series, but when days were increasing in length (C, D) the rate was lower than for the previous per - iod or for other treatments of the same series. Factors favorable to tuberization were being brought to bear upon the plants with increasing force with the several minutes cut off the length of each day. These forces may have been the </seg>
            <seg id="p082">Development of the Potato Plant reduced day length plus reduced light intensity. Not only was the length of day being reduced, but with Series B the intensity of the light was also decreasing, having been about 65 per cent as strong as in Series C during the beginning of the tuberization period, and 55 per cent during the last two periods (Table 1 on gram calories). Thus the decreas - ing intensity of the light may also have been a factor favor - ing tuberization. With the shorter day there was more time for carbohydrate translocation. In the supplemental series (X) plants continuously sup - plied with nitrogen (Xd4) did not produce the greatest weight of tubers at an early date (Table 12). Maximum early yields were secured from plants deprived of nitrogen during the previous three (Xc4), five (Xb4), or seven (Xa4) weeks, with the one deprived of nitrogen the shortest time yielding most. When nitrogen was supplied to plants, vegetation was stimulated and tuber production was low but later it was increased because of the increased plant size. As a conse - quence on January 24 plants that never had received any nitrogen (Xh4) produced a greater weight of tubers than those which had received it only during the previous three or five weeks (Xg4, Xf4). However, these minus-nitrogen plants were exhausted and would not have produced appre - ciably more tuber weight, whereas the tuber weight of those recently receiving nitrogen (Xf5, Xg5) increased greatly during the next 20 days, even though they received no nitro - gen during that time. Number of tubers per plant.— With a continual nitrogen supply the total number of tubers increased steadily through - out the tuberization period (Table 15) ; the most rapid in - crease occurred during the first three to six weeks. The num - ber of tubers weighing over one gram advanced . verv little during the last period.

When nitrogen was withheld at planting time and supplied at a later date, as a general rule the earlier the nitrogen was supplied the greater was the number of tubers Generally speaking an early nitrogen shortage, especially if prolonged, reduced the number of tubers. d "y « Size of tubers.— With a continual nitrogen supply the in - crease in mean weight per tuber was very slow when days were long and warm (A and D, Table 15c). The increase in size was accelerated as the days became shorter and cool - er during the third period of Series A, in contrast to a ques - tionable mcrease as the days became hotter and longer Yn Series D With the shorter days the tubers were larger at an early date. The tubers of the short-day midwinter series (B) were largest of all at an early age but they did not at tain as great size later as did those of the late-winter short to-medium-day series (C).

When tubers once attained a Weight of 25 grams they gen - erally grew rapidly to a grea ;er weight, for the percentage in this size decreased constantly as the season advanced. This was especially the case when conditions for tuberization were best (B and C). With the short-day series, tubers of the larger sizes (over 75 granjs) comprised most of the total tuber weight. There was sorie shriveling of tubers due to resorption, but only in the two lower weight groups (Figs. 19 to 22). ; When nitrogen was withheld at the end of the first period a number of tubers quickly increased in size, and the aver - age weight per tuber during the next few weeks was defin - itely increased. This was most pronounced in Series A (in which storage had been least active), and much less so in Series B (where storage had been most active), while Ser - ies C was intermediate but closer to B. As the set of tubers was practically the same as with the continued-high-nitro - gen plants, except Series A, and the photosynthetic area did not increase, the number of snaller-sized tubers (10 or 25 to 50 gms.) constituted the greatest percentage of total num - ber of tubers with very few tubers weighing over 75 gms. Only in Series A was the percentage of tubers under 25 gms. less than in the high-nitrogen series at the time of the third and fourth harvesting. In Series A and D the average weight per tuber continued the highest of all treatments throughout the duration of the experimental period. With Series A new tubers were constantly being developed on the high-nitrogen plants, while in Series D the tender leaves were rendered more active py the heat, and tuber weight actually decreased. Apparently termination of vegetative growth resulted in the immediate enlargement of a number of tubers per plant at about in equal rate. This rate could not be maintained by the plants with limited leaf area and consequently as the nitrogen shortage in the tops became more acute fewer of the tubers advanced beyond the smaller sizes and the range of tuber size was thus much less (and size more uniform) than with high nitrogen. Furthermore with an acute nitrogen shortage the nitrogen appeared to have withdrawn from tuber primordia sufficiently to prevent later resumption of growth. The performance of Series A sug - gests that a somewhat less severe restriction in the nitrogen supply might permit enlargement of more of the tubers, thus producing a crop of uniformly large tubers. When nitrogen was withhell at the end of the second per - iod there was a tendency toward a higher percentage of </seg>
            <seg id="p088">Development of the Potato Plant tubers of intermediate size (25 to 75 or 100 gms.) and a lower precentage of very large or very small tubers. There were more tubers of the larger sizes than when nitrogen was curtailed earlier, but the average tuber weight at the end of the season was less than with continuous nitrogen except in the unusual environment of Series D. Addition of nitrogen to starved plants tended to inci-ease the size of all tubers, so that a higher percentage was found in heavier-weight groups and the average weight per tuber was greater (except Series A) than where nitrogen starva - tion continued. A number of tuber primordia were brought into the l-to-10-gram size. The distinct decrease in the percentage of tubers in the 10-to-25-gram size indicates that most of these smaller tubers were being used for the storage of much of the reserve food.

In general the tubers grew longer (lower W/L) as they became larger. Consequently the mean W/L ratios for all tubers harvested from restricted-nitrogen plants were sometimes higher than when nitrogen was not restricted. Comparisons of ratios for tubers in the same weight groups fail to reveal any con - sistent tendencies. This raises a question as to whether dif - ferences in shape reported in the literature are due to the nutritional condition of the plant or to the alteration of the physical condition of the soil, which would thus provide dif - ferences in physical resistance to tuber expansion. ROOT GROWTH Roots generally occurred in groups of five, with sometimes seven, at the various nodes of the subterranean stem and </seg>
            <seg id="p089">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 75 rarely in groups of three, as stated by Artschwager (8). This may be a variety characteristic. With young plants supplied with nitrogen, the ratio of tops to roots was increased more by long, warm days (D) than by cool, short days (C). However, the high ratio of plants grown with high temperature and a short day (DS) indicates that the short day nu.y have been more responsible for limited root growth than the low temperature (Table 17). As the plants became o der the tops grew relatively much more than the roots. The ratios reported in Table 17, which were based on dry weights of washed roots, are very different from the 44:1 stem/rloot ratio reported by Hosaus, as reported by Artschwager (8), or the 2.4:1 top/root ratio reported by Schulze (106).

After several weeks of nitrogen deficiency the dry weight of roots actually decreased and while the weight may have fluctuated it never became so great as shortly after the nitrogen supply was withheld. The ratio of tops to roots was always less than with plants receiving a continual nitrogen supply.

Withdrawal of nitrogen at the end of the second period reduced the dry weight of roots, but less so than did the earlier withdrawal. With short days and low temperature (4) the top/root ratio was reduced below that of the con - tinual-nitrogen plants, showing that root growth was affected less than top growth but with long days and high tempera - ture (4D) the top growth was favored more than root growth as the top/root ratio was greater than with the continual - nitrogen plants. Addition of nitrogen at the end of the second period al - ways increased the weight of roots. This response was great - er under high temperature than low temperature when con - sidered either as increased total dry weight or as reduced top/root ratio. The root weight .never, equaled that of the continual-nitrogen plants. With this treatment roots of a decimeter or more in length were frequently found growing out of tubers just above the eyes, as with the underground stem. This occurred most frequently in Series C. With well-developed plants in Series C the total top and tuber growth was 51 times heavier than root growth when plants were liberally supplied with nitrogen but when de - prived of it for a period of six weeks this ratio dropped to 41.9. With long, warm days the roots constituted a much greater proportion of the total plant weight. RELATIVE DEVELOPMENT OF VARIOUS PLANT PARTS The relative development of the vegetative parts or tops ° as compared with the storage organs or tubers was always greatest with long days and high temperatures, and tuber development was greatest with short days and low tempera - tures (Table 18). Although the tuber /top ratios (based on dry weight) increased with age in all plants receiving nitro - gen continually, the increases were greatest with the shortest days and lowest temperatures. The decreasing ratios of Ser - ies D" during the last two periods were due to resorption of the tubers during hot weather. Nitrogen withdrawal at the end of the first period in - creased the tuber/top ratio most when days were long and warm, but it continued to be higher throughout the life of the plants than when nitrogen was supplied continuously. With - drawal at the end of the second period resulted in changes of a similar type but to a less pronounced extent. • Refers to total weight of plant less roots and tutcrit </seg>

Resupplying nitrogen at the end of the second period caused the lowest tuber/top ritio in Series A because of re - newed top growth. In all othi&gt;r series it was generally lower than when starvation continued but higher than where N was supplied continuously. The distribution of the total weight into the various plant parts is presented in a grap - hical manner in Figure 25. PHYSIOLOGICAL RESPONSE OIF PLANTS TO EXPERIMENTAL TREATMENTS Working along lines suggested by some results from earlier studies by Klebs (55-58) on flowering and fruiting, Kraus and Kraybill (64) developed principles in relation to fruit production which since then have been repeatedly demonstrat - ed to be essentially correct. They found that the carbo - hydrate and nitrogen contert of the plants was quickly changed by altering- the nitrogen supply and that the type of growth and degree of fruiting were correlated with the re - lationship of these two groups of compounds or their frac - tions. It has been shown tha - ; heat or light may prevent the normal development of tomato flowers (112 and 128). This prevention of fruiting then permits a more vegetative type of growth than would otherwise occur, and the development of -fruit on a mediumly vegetative plant has been found to check the growth and to alter the composition of the p'ant until the. fruit has ripened (81-87). </seg>

The potato tuber is a modified vegetative organ capable of assimilating carbohydrates rapidly in large quantities, thus making it unnecessary or perhaps impossible for the stem and leaves to act as more than temporary storage organs: In order to have a more satisfactory knowledge of the physio - logical conditions responsible for tuberization and the influ - ence of tuber development upon the vegetative growth it is desirable to have more facts concerning the composition of the potato plant as grown under varied conditions. PERCENTAGE OF DRY MATTER IN VARIOUS PLANT PARTS In all series the tubers had the highest dry-matter con - tent, followed by the leaves and stems (except when very </seg>
            <seg id="p093">Nebraska Exp. Sta. ] Research Bulletin 75 small) (Table 19). The relative amount of dry matter in stolons and stems varied with age and degree of starch accu - mulation. The dry matter of all vegetative parts tended to increase with age. The larger percentage of dry matter in the vegetative parts of long day, high-temperature plants may be accounted for by the difference in methods of util - izing carbohydrate reserves. The thickening of cell walls and differentiation of woody 1 issues were increasing as day length and temperature were increased. Cell walls were thin and there was a minimum air ount of woody tissue at a low temperature or with short days. Under long-day, high-tem - perature conditions carbohydrates that were developed in ex - cess of respiration and growth needs appeared to be used in thickening cell walls and differentiating woody tissues. With short days and low temperatures when cell walls were thin and woody, differentiation was meager and excess car - bohydrates were quickly trans ocated to tubers. Increasing the carbohydrate content of high-temperature, long-day plants and eliminating carbohydrate utilization in protein synthesis by withho ding nitrogen salts increased the dry-matter content still iriore, as observed at the end of the next period. At the sap; time it increased the reserve sufficiently so that more of it was translocated and tuberiza - tion was accelerated. In contrast to this, withholding nitro - gen from short-day or medium-day plants at low tempera - tures generally reduced the percentage of dry matter in all vegetative parts until the earlier advent of senility. The carbohydrate coritent was increased for a brief period, as detected by microchemical sludies, but with the adequate transportation and storage c pacity this small surplus was soon eliminated from the tops so that by the end of the period during which nitrogen had been withheld the plants showed lower dry matter than the plus-nitrogen plants. This was probably due to a decrease in the concentration of the plant solution due to reduced photosynthetic activity, as chlorophyll was breaking down and not being replaced for want of nitrogen which was teing absorbed by the tubers. The addition of nitrogen after it had been withheld de - creased the dry-matter content of all vegetative parts when temperature was high and da^s long (A, D) but actually in - creased it with very short-day, low-temperature plants (B). Plants from the intermediate-day, low-temperature series (C) had a higher dry-matter content at the end of the next period in the leaves but not in stems and stolons.

With - holding the external nitrogen supply always caused an in - crease in the percentage of dry matter in the tubers. With plants that were tuberizing rjapidly the dry weight of the tubers continued to increase and most of the nitrogen as - similation was in the tubers, and in these tubers the per - centage of dry weight continued to increase more rapidly than in the plus-N plants. The plants that were not tuber - izing when nitrogen was withheld continued to make their already large tops still larger o that, although tuber growth was accelerated, it soon fell far behind that of the plus-N plants in Series A and the dr/-matter percentage decreased. With long days not so warm at the time of nitrogen with - holding, the great amount of s:arch that accumulated (pages 115-119, Figs. 28 and 30) permitted tuber weight to in - crease quickly and then very felowly as the heat became ex - cessive (D). During all of ;his time the dry matter was decreasing in the tubers and n the underground stems and stolons of these plants. This was probably because of the great demands for carbohydrates to maintain the large tops under high respiration conditions. As it has been repeatedly shown that the respiration o:' potato tubers is greatly in - creased by raising the tempera ure (75, 50, 59), the loss from the tubers in this manner was evidently great enough to ac - celerate the reduction of the d -y matter of tubers of starved plants. Supplying nitrogen to starred plants decreased the dry - matter content of tubers in a 1 series, so that it was lower than that of the tubers of the continual-nitrogen plants. The percentage increased in all Series after this initial rapid decrease. </seg>
            <seg id="p096">Development of the Potato Plant NITROGEN ABSORPTION Inorganic forms of nitrogen — nitrates, nitrites, and am - monia — while they may exert some effect on the plant pro - cesses by altering the osmotic concentration of the cell sap, are generally not considered as being associated with the life processes of the plant because they have only been absorbed by and have not been assimilated into the compounds that make up the protoplasm and plant structure. An abundance of inorganic nitrogen, especially as nitrate, may indicate that it is being absorbed in excess of the needs of the plant or of the ability of the plant to utilize it in building organic compounds required for growth. Ammon - ium may occur as a degradation compound but it seems that nitrates are not formed in the plant in this way (33). This inability to utilize nitrates may be due to the shortage of carbohydrates, which are also essential for building organic nitrogen compounds (64, 89-92), or it may be due to the inability of the plant to reduce the nitrates (35) because of insufficient light, improper temperature, or the deficiency of some element essential for the activity of the reducing sub - stance (34, 35). Inorganic nitrogen. — The data in Tables 20 and 21 reveal that ammonium nitrogen was present in relatively small but reasonably constant amounts. There is no evidence of a greater abundance of ammonium in plants to which ammon - ium sulphate was supplied in the nutrient solution (C, D) than where it was not used (A, B). Nitrate nitrogen varied a great deal in the various parts and treatments. When plants were receiving nitrogen salts continually, the percentage of inorganic nitrogen was highest in the stems and lowest in the tubers. In the stems there was a decreas - ing gradient from midribs and petioles — through stems, un - derground stems and stolons. The percentage decreased in the vegetative parts as the plants became older and in tubers when days were decreasing in length, but it increased in the tubers produced when day length was increasing. During short days with either low (B, C) or high (DS) temperatures, the percentage of nitrate or of total inorganic nitrogen was much higher in all plant parts (especially in stems) than with long days and high temperatures, indicat - ing that it was not being assimilated. Withholding nitrogen resulted in a greatly reduced content of inorganic nitrogen in all plant parts. Most of the de - crease was in the nitrate nitrogen. The decrease was rela - tively greatest in stems. Microchemical tests (page 94) showed this deficiency to have been apparent within five to </seg>

As nitrogen starvation persisted during the third period, the decrease generally continued at a reduced rate with little change during the fourth period, when plants were becoming senile. When nitrogen salts were withheld at the end of the second period, reductions in inorganic nitrogen were not quite so great relatively as when withheld earlier. This was prob - ably due partly to the decrease accompanying increase in age of continual-nitrogen plants. Percentages in these starved plants were very much the sane in all series, but they may not have occurred quite as rapidly with short-day plants. Resupplying nitrogen salts to starved plants at the end of the second period increased the percentage of inorganic nitro - gen to about the same level as in those receiving it contin - uously. Determinations on rooi;s of Series C and D showed a higher inorganic nitrogen content (dry basis) than in leaves when nitrogen was beinri supplied and a lower percent - age when it has been withheld, the latter indicating more rapid depletion of the roots. Microchemical observations of changes in nitrate content. All parts of the plants continuously supplied with nitrogen gave a positive test for nitrates, with diphenylamine, until the plants started to mature. I Strongest tests were secured in the aerial stems, especially in the stem tips. The tests in underground stems were weaker than in the basal part of the surface stems. Tubers gaVe lighter tests than stems and stolons gave the weakest tests of all parts. The tests 'with the short-day or low-temperature plants were definitely stronger than those with the long-day or high-temperature plants. These tendencies wers all borne out quantitatively by the macrochemical determir ations. When nitrogen was withhelc at the end of the first period m Series A, weaker nitrate tests were secured in the upper parts of the stem within five to seven days. After 12 days there was a pronounced deficiency in nitrates throughout the entire plant. At the end of 11 i days tests were secured only in the top 10 centimeters of the aerial stem and a week later practically none any place. Ni rates disappeared more quick - ie &lt;- i£ ing long&gt; warm day f than in the short » C001 days, but the general order of disappearance was the same. Starch congestion in stems increased before greatly reduced nitrate tests were secured (pages 115- 119).

            <seg id="p102">Development of the Potato Plant about one-half or one-third the time required with younger plants. Supplying nitrogen to starved plants resulted in a great increase in nitrate nitrogen within two days in the upper stem, in all parts in 12 days, while by 20 days the amount was apparently as great as in the continual-nitrogen plants. ASSIMILATION OF NITROGEN Assimilated nitrogen may also be considered as total or - ganic nitrogen, to distinguish it from total inorganic nitro - gen, since it is the total amount of nitrogen found after ammonia, nitrites, and nitrates have been extracted. Thus it includes nitrogen in all stages of assimilation from the early soluble and mobile forms to the final insolube forms which cannot be translocated without hydrolysis. Undoubt - edly the nitrogen fractions included under it are very dif - ferent in young plants or short-day plants as compared with old plants or long-day plants. In the younger plants much of it is found in the meristematic points where it aids in the development of new tissues, but in the older plants it con - stitutes a definite part of the more or less permanent proto - plasmic structure necessary for the normal functioning of the plant. When it is diverted from this function the life processes of the plants may be greatly altered. Relation of assimilated nitrogen to total nitrogen content. —The assimilated or organic nitrogen percentage was low in the stems and much higher in the leaves, being just the opposite of the very low percentage of inorganic nitrogen in the leaves and high percentage in the stems (Tables 22 and 23 compared with 20 and 21). In the leaves the assimilated nitrogen constituted between 90 and 92 per cent of the total nitrogen in short-day, low-temperature plants (B) and in - creased to 93 to 97 per cent in the long-day, higher-tempera - ture plants of Series A and D. In the stems only 50 per cent of the total nitrogen was in the assimilated form in Series B, compared with around 75 to 78 per cent in Series A and D. The importance of high temperature in nitrogen assimilation is shown in Series DS, where the highest per - centage of the total was assimilated in spite of a short day In the tubers there was a tendency for assimilated nitrogen to comprise a low percentage of the total nitrogen with short - day conditions and in all series the percentage of nitrogen that was assimilated decreased as the season advanced. When nitrogen was withheld at the close of the first per - iod, the percentage of the total nitrogen assimilated was in - creased in all series to an apparently constant level of 97 </seg>
            <seg id="p103">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 75 to 98 per cent in leaves and 90 to 95 per cent in stems. It was also increased in tubers, but less uniformly so. When nitrogen was supplied at the close of the second per - iod to starved plants, the percentage of the total nitrogen that was in assimilated form was higher than with continual - nitrogen plants and lower thsm in the starved plants. The high percentage of unassimiUted nitrogen in the short-day, low-temperature series indicates why the plants of these ser - ies (B, C) failed to develop extensive amounts of leaves and stems. Assimilated nitrogen in various plant parts. — There has been very little investigation of the nitrogen content of the various vegetative parts of the potato plant. Wilfarth, Romer, and Wimmer (136) reported the highest percentage of total nitrogen in the leaves, followed by petioles, stems, roots, and finally the lowest percentage in the tubers. In all parts the percentage decreased with age, except for a rapid increase in the tubers during ;he period of maturation. The increase in total nitrogen at ttis time very possibly may have consisted largely of inorganic nitrogen absorbed by the tub - ers when plant tops were not synthesizing nitrogen com - pounds. They found little difference in the nitrogen content of tubers of different sizes except that it was slightly higher in tubers weighing less than live grams. They included the stolons with tubers in the analysis. Calculating on a dry basis, Appleman and Miller (5) found the percentage of total N in tubers, grown in Maryland, fairly constant at all stages of. development. The percentage of nonprotein and amino nitragen increased with increasing periods on the vines. Willaman and West (137) reported a higher nitrogen content in potatoes raised in southern com - pared with northern Minnesota, and also that those grown on clay soils had least nitrogen. Goldthwaite U-4) found that as potatoes were grown at higher and cooler altitudes the nitrogen content decreased and that irrigated potatoes had slightly less than dry-lard potatoes and that numerous irrigations tended to decrease slightly the nitrogen content, as did also production on the: heavier soils. Werner (133) also reported reduced nitrogen content in irrigated and in straw-mulched tubers, and a lower amount in immature than in mature tubers. Weigert and Stiehr (129) found that potatoes growing on nitrogen-deficient soils had r ot only a reduced percentage of assimilated nitrogen but aliso a decidedly lower percentage of amino nitrogen than when farm manure or nitrogen fer - tilizers were applied. Gericice (43) reports a conclusion </seg>
            <seg id="p104">Development of the Potato Plant which is significant in this investigation, that in wheat high protein content can be secured by supplying nitrogen during the late growth period of the plant or by curtailing exces - sive grain production which may result from applications of nitrogen early in the season. Berkner and Schlimm {lla) report increased protein content in tubers as the applications of calcium nitrate fertilizer were increased in amount. In this investigation the leaves always contained the high - est percentage of assimilated nitrogen when calculated on either the fresh or dry basis (Tables 22 and 23). The stems generally had the lowest percentage with tubers having an intermediate value. The percentage in underground stems and stolons was more similar to that of the tubers than of the aerial stems. The assimilated nitrogen percentage of leaves and stems was highest in the short-day plants (B, C, DS) on the dry - weight basis, but on the fresh-weight basis it was consist - ently higher in the long-day, high-temperature plants (A, D). The nitrogen content of the tubers acted in reverse order, the highest percentage occurring in the short-day plants if figured on the fresh-weight basis, whereas on the dry-weight basis the highest percentage occurred in the long-day plants. In Series C during the last period, when the days averaged 12.8 hours in length, the percentage was high on either basis. As the plants became older there was a general tendency for the percentage of assimilated nitrogen to decrease in all parts except the tubers. There it decreased for a brief early period and then increased steadily until the plants were ma - ture, except in the set grown in long days and abnormally high temperatures (D), where it decreased. The very great increase in nitrogen percentage during the last period in the leaves of all series except B was due to the death of many leaves and consequent increase in percentage of dry matter. Nitrogen in these dead areas could not be translocated. Withholding nitrogen at the end of the first period was quickly followed by a greatly decreased and continually de - creasing percentage of assimilated nitrogen in all parts of the plant. With age the trend was in the same direction as in continuous nitrogen plants. When nitrogen was withheld at the end of the second period the assimilated nitrogen con - tent of all plant parts was also reduced but generally not to as low a percentage as where nitrogen starvation occurred earlier and was more prolonged.

Undoubtedly the new - er stems and leaves did hav6 a higher nitrogen content but as they were not analyzed separately the increase is not ap - parent in the data. Distribution of assimilated nitrogen into various plant parts. — With a continuous supply of nitrogen available the greatest portion of assimilated nitrogen in young plants was located in the leaves (Tabl&lt;| 24, Fig. 26). As the plants became older the nitrogen in the leaves constituted a constant - ly decreasing percentage of the total; that of the stem was also decreasing but the amount in the tubers was greatly in - creasing. The nitrogen distribution (Table 24) follows in a general way the dry-matter distribution (Fig. 25) except that with the dry matter a higher percentage is located in the tubers and stems and less, in the leaves than in the case of assimilated nitrogen. When days were long and warm the percentage occurring in the leaves was very large and in the stems also relatively high, while the percentage in the tubers was quite small. With short days or low temperatures the nitrogen in the leaves constituted a rapidly decreasing portion of the total. Within five or six weeks after emergence over half of the total nitrogen was in the tubers, an almost inconsequentially small percentage in the stemiL and much less than half in the leaves. Stated in another w;iy, with the long days of Series A the ratio of assimilated n trogen in tubers to nitrogen in the tops was only 0.36:1, but with the intermediate days of Series C it was 1.96:1, and with the short days of B, 2.19:1. The trend toward nitrogen accumulation by the tubers as plants became older was most pronounced in the short-day plants (Fig. 27). 1 When nitrogen was withheld from young plants the shift of nitrogen from tops to tubers was greatly accelerated but again occurred to a more pronounced degree in the short - day plants (Fig. 27, Table 24). Withholding nitrogen from older plants brought about the same type of changes but with greater rapidity because of the greatly accelerated tuber growth. Addition of nitrogen to the nutrient solution of starved plants resulted in a slight shift toward the leaves but the percentage of the total n trogen in the tubers remained slightly greater than where nitrogen was continually avail - able.

Their data plotted against time show that in the later stages t'lere was a slightly lower rate of dry-matter accumulation an i of intake of nitrogen, phos - phorus, and potassium by the total plant but that the in - take by tubers continued in practically a straight line; that is, the tubers continued to absorb minerals at the same aver - age rate each day but they absorbed some of these and per - haps some organic matter from the plant tops, in which the amount decreased during the last period. They found no evidence that any of the nutrients returned to the soil. Berk - ner (lib) reported that the demand of the plant for N was exceeded only by that for K and that to a large degree the N intake governs the increase in dry matter. He found it to be taken up by the plant ti 1 the conclusion of the vegeta - tive period. When the nitrogen requirements are being investigated it is desirable to know how mtch can be procured from the parent seed piece. Denny (29) found, in Triumph potatoes, that by the time plants were above ground with fully formed leaves 50 per cent of the total nitrogen had been removed from 14-gram seed pieces and 33 per cent from 56-gram pieces. The plants continued :o absorb nitrogen during most or all of their period of existence. Plants 10 inches high with well-developed tubers had removed 83 per cent of the nitrogen from the 14-gram and 75 per cent from the 56 - gram seed pieces. By the tin e they were in bloom they had removed 83.1 per cent from the 56-gram seed pieces. By the time tubers were forming th&gt; plants had removed 50 milli - grams of nitrogen from small seed pieces, compared with 180 from the larger ones. Nitrogen was not removed as rapidly from Irish Cobbler sesd pieces. Starch was removed even more quickly and completely than was nitrogen. For the purpose of determining in this investigation when nitrogen was assimilated, the total amount of assimilated nitrogen in the plant at the time of maturity was considered as 100 per cent. The great sst percentage of the nitrogen was assimilated by the tops during the second period. In the tubers the greatest percentage of assimilated nitrogen was found during the third and fourth periods. When total amounts assimilated, Series A., B, and C, T on each date are plotted as percentages against time the rates of assimilation for the continual-nitrogen p ants in each series were after all very similar (Fig. 28). J The shorter days diminished the percentage of the final total nitrogen which was assimilated during the later per- T Series D data were not plotted becaus ? of the premature death of the plants. </seg>

Withholding nitrogen fron the nutrient solution at the close of the first period has jeen shown to have been a great stimulus to initiate tuberizstion with the long, warm days (A, D), to a slight degree with medium-length, cool days (C) and of little consequence with short days, regardless of tem - perature (B, DS, ES) because with the latter tuberization was already under way anc very limited protein synthesis caused top growth to be slow The withholding of an external nitrogen supply immediately diverted nitrogen away from the tops to the tubers somewhat in proportion to the extent that tuberization was initiated. The percentage going into tub - ers during the second period was approximately 35 times greater for the minus-nitre gen than for the plus-nitrogen plants in Series D, 10 times greater with Series A, but only twice as great with C and only a trifle greater with B. How - ever, during the third period the tops were losing nitrogen and then because of the vei-y rapid rate of tuberization in Series B and C, the small Amount of nitrogen in their tops was rapidly withdrawn. The performance of the minus - nitrogen plants in Series D was very unusual, because the tubers retained their nitrogen or perhaps added some during the periods when nitrogen was lost from the top, whereas when nitrogen was being supplied the plant tops were taking nitrogen out of the tubers. Nitrogen withdrawal at the end of the second period re - sulted, during the third period, in practically a complete ces - sation in elongation in stems of B and a less severe check in C, while with A there was still considerable elongation and in D elongation may have been accelerated. The gain in dry matter followed similar trends. With plants of this size and with tuberization well under way, total nitrogen assimilation was greatly reduced. Theru was no addition of assimilated nitrogen in the tops during the third period, except in 4D where it continued at a reduced rate with mean temperature at 92° F. In the fourth period at a lower mean of 85° F much nitrogen was assimilated in the tops. The validity of this very anomalous situation might be suspected, and the possibility of some experimental error should not be ignored, but the relative condition 3 3 compared with continued-nitro - gen plants can be understood partially by remembering that the leaves of plants from which nitrogen had been withdrawn survived the few lethally high temperature periods better than did those of plants receiving nitrogen at the time.

In the more recent work the opinion is held that glucose is the first sugar formed (22, 10) and that sucrose is the transportation sugar (10, 10a). Reducing sugars have generally been found at a minimum in early morning, increasing to a midday maximum, followed by a de - crease and then another late-a::ternoon or early-evening peak, followed by a more or less steady decrease (25, 22, 23). Sucrose varied during the clay about as much as reducing sugars (25, 22) but was generally less abundant (23). It seemed always to be abundant in leaves when tuber forma - tion began (25, 102, 22). Under controlled conditions Bush - nell (18) reported, for large plants, a higher content of re - ducing sugars than sucrose in leaves and stems, with greatest over-night reductions in the sucrose percentages. Its in - creased abundance in the stums at tuberization time (22, 102, 10) and the gradient from midrib to lower stem (10) harmonize with the idea of its being the transportation sugar. Clements (22) during long summer days with a diurnal temperature range of 8° to 30° C, reported lowest percent - ages of starch after midnight with a minimum generally at 8:00 A. M. The percentage then increased to a maximum in the late afternoon, though generally (depending largely upon light intensity) an almo t equally high or higher point was attained in midday. Davis and Sawyer (25) reported starch maximum at two hours before sunset but Bushnell (18), calculating from their figures, reports an increase in starch content of stems during the night but his own work (18, pp. 22-23) showed a decrease in polysaccharides over night. Improved illumination in thu greenhouse increased the car - bohydrate content of potato plants growing in incubators (18). Sucrose was found to be more abundant in a dry, warm season than in a cool, m&gt;ist season (22). Fertilization practice was reported (23) is not causing significant dif - ferences in sugar content, but Hartwell observed pronounced starch accumulation when essential elements were deficient U8).

When sucrose accumlates in excess concentration, hemicellulose is formed to remove it from solution. In a favorable year for potato production, hemicellulose fluctuated greatly, apparently functioning as a temporary reserve; but in a less favorable year, when it was more constant, it ap - peared to be a water holder, for as the percentage increased the leaves wilted less during a drouth period.

The high percent - age of sucrose in C was possibly due to sucrose being ab - sorbed more rapidly than it could be converted into starch. This more rapid absorption may have been possible because of the greater content of acid-hydrolyzable polysaccharides other than starch or so-called hemicelluloses (22). These compounds by developing more colloidal imbibition force may have made possible the absorption of a more concentrated sucrose solution. In turn the higher hemicellulose content may have been the result of a higher sucrose content when the tuber could not take the starch out of solution with suf- </seg>

The i slightly higher amount of poly - saccharides in the leaves of C may indicate slightly greater accumulation of carbohydrai es because of a lower respira - tion rate. Withholding nitrogen during the second period brought about a general increase in all carbohydrates except reduc - ing sugars in all parts of the plants (5A and 5C compared with 2 A and 2C). The sucrose content was not increased in the tubers of 5C but ths starch content was increased greatly. During this perioc the tuberization rate was in - creased about seven times in A but only one-half in C, by withholding nitrogen. According to microchemical observa - tions made during the period, starch congestion at the end of the second period was sti 1 increasing in the stems of 5A because of lessened growth, but was decreasing in 5C, though still greater than in 2C. This at the time of sampling, car - bohydrates were coming into the tubers at a decreasing rate instead of an accelerated rat (when figured as a percentage of the previous tuber weight or on a logarithimic basis as calculated by James (51). Furthermore these tubers whose growth had been stimulated early in the period were now larger and less meristematici (shown also by reduced per - centage of assimilated nitrogen), than some days earlier or than those of the continual-ni ;rogen plants (2C) . They prob - ably had developed a greater capacity to assimilate carbo - hydrates. The greater percentage of carbohydrates in the stems resulted mostly from sicrose increase. Very plausibly this might have been due to ;he greater concentration of the solution because of more cjtrbohydrates being transported without an increase in the capacity of the transportation system. The tubers of the nitrogen-starved plants of the short - day, low-temperature series had the highest percentage of all carbohydrates, but the tops were different. These plants were declining in vigor and their leaves were pale and less active photosynthetically (Table 5a). In 5 A the top leaves were relatively new and vigorous and the older, lower leaves were more comparable to those of 5C. As a consequence the younger tubers of 5A did not take in all the carbohydrates, and increased congestion occurred throughout the system. When plants were producing stolons actively but not yet forming any tubers (1A), glucose increased from top to bot - tom in the stem but all otherl carbohydrates decreased. After this initial period of very rapid stolon growth, there followed the period of very active top growth and very little tuber growth (2nd period). The rsducing sugars were highest in </seg>
            <seg id="p122">Development of the Potato Plant the top stem and decreased downward, whereas all the other carbohydrates increased downward (2A). This downward in - crease of more complex carbohydrates was accentuated by elimination of the external nitrogen supply (5A). The re - ducing sugars were highest in regions of growth; the other carbohydrates were associated with the reserve accumulation. These results were apparently in accord with those of Rosa (102). It is of interest to note that when calculated on the dry-weight basis the sucrose gradient was not steep but was in the same direction as the glucose gradient of 2A. This might be a characteristic of the transition stage with the in - itiation of tuberization. The acid hydrolyzable polysaccharides remaining after starch was removed were more prevalent in leaves and tubers of 1C than of 1A but less prevalent in stems. They gen - erally increased in all parts of all plants after the external nitrogen supply was withheld. In almost every instance the percentages of acid hydrolyzable polysaccharides on the fresh basis followed the same trend as those for sucrose, as pointed out by Clements (22). They also followed the fluctuations of starch percentages, except in tubers. They were more prev - alent than starch in stems, less in leaves, and very much less in tubers. The increased carbohydrate content of tubers from low - nitrogen plants and short-day plants may be partly due to the larger size of those tubers, the difference being of about the magnitude reported for starch content of tubers of about the size ranges involved — mostly 1 to 50 grams (136, 113). However, Weigert and Stiehr (129) report greatly increased percentages of carbohydrates in tubers when grown on soils deficient in nitrogen. Microchemical observations of starch accumulation. In the plant cells starch is formed whenever sugar accumulates be - yond the maximum amount that will remain in solution, al - though it has been suggested that hemicellulose is formed when the sugar concentration increases more rapidly than it can be converted into starch (22). This condition 'occurs in the cells because photosynthesis or movement of sugars from adjacent cells increases the sugar content beyond the needs of the cells or the ability of the cell to pass the sugar on to adjacent cells. Thus starch may occur in isolated cells or in groups of cells or in entire organs for either very brief or very extended periods, depending upon the adjustment of the plant to the situation or changes in the environment In the green and growing plant, whenever the surplus photosynthate is in excess of the transportation facilities </seg>
            <seg id="p123">Nebraska Exp. Sta. Research Bulletin 75 starch accumulates relatively close to the active photosyn - thetic area— first in the leave 3, then in the petioles and stems If the storage organs are not capable of receiving the reserve as rapidly as it is transported, the congestion occurs in the stolons, moving inward to tlie stems and then up the stems toward the leaves. In such plants- more starch is likely to be found m all parts and in greater amounts than where congestion is due only to the transportation system. In plants that are tuberizing rapidly the tubers may assimilate car - bohydrates as rapidly as the^ are produced yet there will be an excess of starch in some pkrt of the plant (and a different part) during practically everkr hour of the day. Hartwell (48) found that starch congestion increased when the supply of some essential mineral nutrient was deficient Congestion was generally greatest in the basal portions when samples were taken early in the morning. In a study made during mid-November, 1932, during sunny days with plants that were receiving nitrogen and were tub - erizing rapidly the starch content of the various sections of the stem was found to vary considerably at different hours of the day. In the lower stem it decreased from a very large amount at 9:00 A. M. to practically none at 4:30 and 7 -00 P.

This accumulation increased steadily to a maximum amount many times greater than that of the continual-nitrogen plants (Fig. 29). After that it decreased rapidly till very little was visible, and finally, when the plants were almost dead, practically none was seen.

With the am &gt;unt of photosynthate thus in - eviably reduced, all of it and a little more could be assim - ilated by the tubers, until finally the stems were cleared of starch (Figs. 29 and 30). $till later more carbohydrates were translocated than were manufactured daily. The first starch deposition occurred in the endodermis, after which it was most likely to be fouid in the inner cortical cells, then almost simultaneously in the parenchyma of the peri - cycle and that adjacent to the outer and inner phloem, then m the Markkrone (9) or parenchyma that might be consid - ered either xylem or inner phloem, then in the outer pith the central pith, and finally ii the medullary rays through the xylem. When starch disap peared the order was reversed. Most of the starch disappeared from cells inside the cambium before very much was taken oi.t of the cortex. When the volume of the stfems and stolons was small in proportion to the total leaf volume as in Series B, the space available for temporary storage (cortex and pith) was also greatly reduced. Then when the amount of reserve carbo - hydrates was increased by reducing growth, the starch con - gestion was more apparent than if the stem had had a greater area, even though there was only a slight increase in car - bohydrate as a result of a slight reduction. This is probably why the congestion appeared to be most rapid in Series B In Series C the congestion wks not so early, because more of its carbohydrates continued, to be used in growth which was more prolonged after nitrogen was withheld than in B, but finally when growth practically ceased the congestion was greater. When days were long and warm (Series A), the stems and stolons being very thick, the leaf/stem ratio was low; and, growth having continued for a considerable time after nitrogen was withheld, s arch accumulation was a more gradual but more extensive process than in the short-day low-temperature plants. The more rapid disappearance of this accumulated starch might have been due to the much higher respiration rate at the higher temperature. With long days of medium temperature (D) growth was very ac - tive for ten days following nitrogen withdrawal, but then, when the supply of N availablfe for protein synthesis was ex - hausted, starch accumulated -with extreme rapidity and dens - ity throughout the entire ste:n in spite of increasing tem - peratures (Fig. 31).

In those stolons growing toward the surface this tapering thickening did not occur and the apical inch was almost devoid of starch. Several things may have contributed to this very great accumulation of starch, when respiration was very high. The reduced growth rate not only made more carbohydrates available for reserve but it also brought about a "hardening" process and a more xeromorphic condition such as thicker cuticle, heavier walls, etc., which enabled the leaves to survive this period of ex - cessive heat when leaves of high-nitrogen plants wilted and burned — and thereby maintained a relatively greater photo - synthetically active leaf surface.

Research Bulletin 75 5 5-24 V -6-5 f&gt; Fig. 31. — Starch accumulation at two periods in the underground portions of plants receiving different nitrogen treatments in Series D. In Lot 5 starch ws s scarce near tips of stolons, the tops of which were being co verted into leaf-bearing shoots. Withholding nitrogen for six days (June 5) resulted in an easily perceptible increase in the accumulation of starch in the under - ground stem (Lot 4 compared with Lot 3) but its addition to N - deficient plants resulted in a barely discernible decrease (Lot 5 compared with Lot 7). (For tuber production by these plants, see Figure 20, and for plant 1ops, see Figure 5.) carbohydrates were being manufactured and quite evidently less were being used. These underlying causes enabled this set of plants to produce the maximum crop of tubers at the end of the 52nd day. Much of the daily tuber gain, occurring when those of other treatments were losing weight, came from the accumulated starch in the extensive parenchyma of the stolons and stems. Practically all of this starch had been removed when the series was terminated. Changing the nutrient solution to minus nitrcger at the beginning of the third period brought about the same type of starch accumulation as did sarly nitrogen withdrawal. In plants that were still making considerable growth (A, C, D) the accumulation was more ratrid but to about the same rela - tive extent. When plants were not growing (B) the increase in starch accumulation was relatively slow. In this series the surplus nitrogen held in the tissues of the plant enabled it to maintain a more adequate chlorophyll supply for a longer time.

There was an immediate response in increased carbohydrate manufacture, and starch accumu - lation resulted for a period (Fig. 30). Accumulation was reduced rapidly by activation of growth of tubers, so that they could assimilate carbohydrates more rapidly, and by re - duction of reserve through renewed growth of tops (latter not applicable in B where response was least of any series). In Series A with medium-length, warm days the reserve starch was depleted rapidly because of rapid respiration and the immediate top growth initiated when nitrogen was avail - able. The previously initiated tubers were able to store all the reserves that accumulated from these new leaves, hence congestion was no greater than in continual-nitrogen plants. In Series D with nitrogen addition there was an initial in - crease in starch in stems already severely congested. This was probably, due to the rapid improvement of the photo - synthetic machinery before growth was sufficiently under way to require much carbohydrate material. Accompanying or immediately following this extreme accumulation, tuberiza - tion was accelerated, but the succulent new growth that fol - lowed caused not only all of the reserve starch in the stems but also that in the tubers to be used up by the tops. This process was already under way on the sixth day when sec - tions sketched in Figure 31 were obtained. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS A. Potato plants grown with an abundant available nitro - gen supply under conditions favorable for carbohydrate syn - thesis were found to have been: 1. Vigorously vegetative but producing no tubers (or at least very small amounts of tubers very slowly) , when respir - ation and the synthesis of nitrogen compounds for new growth consumed all carbohydrates that were elaborated. Such conditions occurred with long, warm days in the early life of plants of Series A and D. Such plants were found to be relatively low in dry matter, sugars, polysaccharides and inorganic nitrogen, but high in moisture and assimilated nitrogen. The ratio of leaves to stems was relatively low. Stolons were numerous, thick, long, and much branched; many of them came to the surface and produced leaves. With a continual nitrogen supply in all plants there was generally a small amount of starch throughout the endodermis at the time the sprouts emerged but this disappeared almost entirely when leaves appeared. Little starch was thus found during the first few weeks after emergence except at the very base of the stem next to the old seed piece and just behind </seg>

Research Bulletin 75 supply the tuberization rate was accelerated for only a brief period, after which it dropped below that of the plants re - ceiving nitrogen and continued to decrease at a more rapid rate. In all series the withholding of nitrogen increased the ratio of dry weight of tubers to tops and decreased the ratio of leaves to stems. The most extensive carbohydrate accumulation and rela - tively greatest acceleration if tuber development, as a result of nitrogen withdrawal, occurred in the most vegetative plants, which had not been t uberizing (Series A and D) The dry-matter content of all parts of these vegetative potato plants was increased by the nitrogen deficiency, thus prob - ably accounting for the increased resistance of these plants to very high temperatures and their ability to increase the weight of their tubers when those on the nitrogen-supplied plants were being resorbed. When plants were weakly vegetative, succulent, and non - tuber-bearmg because of excessive respiration, the life of the plants was prolonged, because with nitrogen deficiency the carbohydrates were paitially conserved but not suffic - iently so to create a reserve sufficient for initiating tuberi - zation. With plants that w re weakly vegetative succulent and actively producing tubers (Series B) the withholding of nitrogen caused a decrease ii dry-matter content of all parts except tubers, where it increased. Carbohydrates increased only slightly and tuberization was accelerated less than in any of the other series. In fact tuber production per plant was never greater during any period than where nitrogen was supplied continuously. When plants were slightlv more veg - etative and less succulent but still tuberizing very actively the carbohydrates increased slightly and tuberization was ac - celerated slightly more than in the less vegetative and more succulent plants. A deficiency of nitrogen at;the time plants had almost at - tained their maximum vegetative growth resulted in prac - tically the same type of responses as when the deficiency oc - curred earlier. J C. When the metabolism oy the plant was altered by abrupt - ly supplying an abundance of nitrogen to plants that had not been receiving any during tik second period, the percentage of inorganic nitrogen was greatly increased while that of organic nitrogen was increased still more. In all parts the percentage was almost as gr&gt;at as in the plants that had re - ceived nitrogen continuously or sometimes even greater The prompt change m the color of the leaves from a very pale! whitish green or yellow to a deep green color indicated that </seg>
            <seg id="p132">Development of the Potato Plant the chlorophyll supply was re-established before growth was resumed. When environmental conditions were very favor - able for nitrogen assimilation and new growth of tops, as in long, warm days, growth was resumed quickly with a con - sequent decrease in the previously high dry-matter and car - bohydrate content of the plant and there was retardation of tuber growth. With the establishment of the new leaves there was again an increase in carbohydrates and tuberization. When conditions were less favorable for nitrogen assimilation and growth in top as at low temperatures and with short days, the small amount of new growth did not get under way for some time, but because of the prompt reinstatement of the chlorophyll supply and consequent increase in carbo - hydrate synthesis there was a slight increase in percentage of dry matter in leaves or even stems and a great increase in the carbohydrate percentage as well as a prompt acceler - ation of tuberization. During the third period (the first after N was resupplied) the tubers represented about 88 per cent of the total dry-weight increase with short, cool days but only 54 to 58 per cent with long, warm days. With the resumption of growth and increased carbohydrate - absorption capacity of the tubers, these accumulated carbo - hydrates gradually disappeared from the vegetative tops. The dry-matter content of the tubers in all series was lowered at once upon the addition of nitrogen, and although it increased later it never was as great as where nitrogen was contin - uously supplied. The total final weight of tubers was in - creased by nitrogen reinstatement but never was as great as when nitrogen had been supplied continuously or when the nitrogen deficiency occurred later in the life of the plant. However, when respiration and growth demands were great - ly increased by increased day length and temperature the addition of nitrogen to high-carbohydrate plants not only ex - hausted the carbohydrate content of the stems but also of the tubers, so that they decreased in weight even more rapidly than when nitrogen was continuously available. The assimilated nitrogen in the tubers was increased in all instances, but the greatest increase and highest percent - age occurred under the conditions least favorable for nitro - gen assimilation by the leaves and stems. Under these latter conditions the tubers were also receiving a very much greater percentage of the nitrogen assimilated within the entire plant than was occurring when conditions were more favorable for vegetative growth. </seg>
