            <seg id="p003">3 LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL To His Excellency, John H. Morehead, Governor of Nebraska: Dear Sir: Complying with the requirement of the law, I herewith pre - sent the report of the Public Library Commission for the biennium ending November 30, 1916. For sixteen years, the activities of this Commission have been exerting a quiet but far-reaching influence for the betterment of library conditions through - out the state. This influence has resulted not only in the establishment of new public libraries, but in stimulating the work of libraries already existing, in securing many Carnegie buildings, in developing library facilities in the state institutions and in furnishing traveling libraries for all parts of the state. I wish especially to emphasize the importance of the Library Commission as the public library for the entire state and to call attention to the wide scope of its services in cooperating with individuals, schools, woman's clubs, agri - cultural agents, debating societies, small libraries and the extension departments of the University by supplying books and printed material that could be secured in no other way. The demands from these sources far exceed the ability of the Commission to supply and indeed the entire resources of the Commission could be expended in this one phase of the work without meeting the demands of the people. I doubt if any other state department can show a greater direct service to the people in proportion to the appropriation avail - able. I commend the detailed report of the Secretary to your careful attention. Very truly yours, Malcolm G. Wyeb, President. December 6, 1916. </seg>

            <seg id="p005">5 NEBRASKA PUBLIC LIBRARY COMMISSION Secretary'* Report The report which follows covers the library progress of the state for the two years from December 1, 1914, to November 30, 1916. It has been a period of encouraging growth. More new public libraries have been estab - lished than in any previous biennium; the use of public libraries has in - creased; city councils have expressed their confidence in the library by granting larger levies; and librarians have been more earnest and resourceful in their endeavors to give their communities better service. The Traveling Library has been taxed to the limit of its resources by the demands made upon it and has reached through its loans the remotest parts of the state. Not only is the year's report encouraging in comparison with our own previous growth, but in examining the reports of other states, we find that we are keeping pace, in proportion to our population and resources, with the most progressive library states. The Library Commission. There have been several changes in the Library Commission during the biennium. Mr. A. O. Thomas, succeeding Mr. J. E. Delzell as State Super - intendent in January, 1915, became ex officio a member of the Commission. The term of Mr. F. L. Haller expired in May, 1916, and Mr. C. A. Sommer of Lincoln was appointed to succeed him. Miss Florence Waugh, who had had charge of the State Institution libraries since 1911, when the Commission took over the supervision of them, resigned in October, 1915, to be married, and Miss Nellie Williams of Geneva was appointed to her position. Mr. Haller at the time of his retirement was chairman of the Commission. The Commission met for reorganization on June 2, 1916, and elected Mr. Wyer chairman. At the same meeting the following resolutions were passed: "Whereas, Mr. F. L. Haller retires at this time from membership in the Nebraska Library Commission, after a continuous service since the organization of the Commission in 1901, during the last ten years of which he was President; and Whereas, his devotion to the library interests of Nebraska has been shown by his cooperation in making possible the establishment of the Nebraska Library Commission, by his active interest and enthusiasm in developing its work, by his loyal and wholehearted support of the plans of the Secretary, and by his wise counsel, sound judgment and broad outlook in all its sessions, Therefore, be it resolved: That the members of the Nebraska Library Commission express to Mr. Haller their deep appreciation of his services as a member of the Commission and their confidence that though no longer a member, the welfare of the Commission will at all times receive his hearty support." </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 The basement offices of the Commission were damp and dark and in many ways inconvenient. Realizing this fact, in September, 1915, the Board of Public Lands and Buildings assigned to the Commission three rooms on the fourth floor which have proved to be the most satisfactory quarters which the Commission has ever had. The Commission was represented at the meeting of the American Library Association at Atlantic City in 1916 by Mr. Wyer and at the annual meetings of the League of Library Commissions in Chicago in 1914 and 1915 by the Secretary. The Secretary also attended the meeting of the National Con - ference of Charities and Corrections in Indianapolis in May, 1916, to take part in a discussion of libraries in State Institutions. Centralization of State Library Activities. During the year efforts have been made to work out a plan for the central - ization of the library activities in Lincoln supported by the state. There are at present five such library agencies, the State library, and the Library Com - mission in the Capitol, the University library, the Historical Society library and the Legislative Reference Bureau library on the University campus. Those directly connected with the a/lministration of these libraries agree that, with the strong University library in Lincoln, it will be unnecessary for the State library to develop a general reference collection. Therefore, the plan sug - gested calls for the erection of a building at the University campus in which shall be housed the University library, the Historical Society, the Library Commission and the Legislative Reference Bureau; also the transfer from the State library to the University library of the collection of works of a general character and the maintenance of the State library as a law library at the Capitol under the control of the Supreme Court. Such a plan has received the approval of the governing bodies of all the organizations concerned and also the endorsement of the Nebraska Library Association. This plan would secure a logical, sensible and efficient centralization of the library resources of the state which would bring beneficial results to the libraries themselves and to all those who make use of them. Its special advantage to the Library Commission is plain. With the large book collection of the University Library accessible for special reference work, the Commission could serve its patrons far better than will ever be possible with any general collection which it can build up. Moreover if it is no longer necessary to buy books to meet a possible request, all of the book fund can be spent for traveling libraries with the hope of sometime being able to supply the demand. Public Libraries. While no systematic campaign has ever been conducted by the Library Commission to stimulate the establishment of public libraries in the state, an effort has always been made to create a general interest in the public library and to encourage every local library movement which a community initiates. Through cooperation with the library committee of the State Federation of Woman's clubs, library sessions have been arranged for district and state meetings of the Federation to enlist the interest of the best friends of civic </seg>
            <seg id="p007">7 improvement in Nebraska, the women's clubs. We owe the establishment of many of our public libraries to the club women and we have at present 35 small libraries, for the most part sustained through their efforts, which will undoubtedly eventually become tax-supported libraries. On examining the reports of a number of other states, we find that Nebraska makes a creditable showing in the number of tax-supported libraries in proportion to her population. Missouri has .76 libraries for every 100,000 population, North Dakota, 3.4, Minnesota, 4.9, Iowa, 5.9, Indiana, 7.14 while Nebraska ranks with Wisconsin in having 7.5. The past two years have been marked by unusual library activity. Twelve new libraries have been established, two libraries formerly maintained by associations have been turned over to city control while one library formerly independent has become a branch library through a consolidation of cities. This makes a net gain of 13 tax-supported libraries in the biennium and brings the total number of libraries up to 90. Adding the 35 libraries maintained by clubs and library associations, gives us 125 libraries in the state. There still remain 19 towns of 1,000 population or over which do not main - tain libraries. In 8 of these, libraries are maintained by clubs or library associations, and in 4, a strong public library movement is under way. Eighteen of our tax-supported libraries are in towns of less than 1,000 population. A slight increase is shown in the levies reported; the average rate being 2.3 mills this year as compared with 1.7 mills of four years ago. A growing appreciation of the library's value to the community is shown in the increasing number of gifts of buildings and books. J. W. Gilbert has presented the town of Friend with a handsome building at a cost of about $8,000.00; Mr. P. Graves has built and completely equipped a library for the village of Wakefield, as a memorial to his son, at an approximate cost of $10,000; and J. G. Brenizer of Broken Bow is building a very complete building for the town of Merna. Mr. Hector Maiben, a farmer living near Lincoln, presented the library at College View with $500.00 for books and the Lincoln City Library with $1,000.00 for the same purpose. The citizens of Harvard wished to make their library a community center and raised $3,000.00 to add to the $6,000.00 which they received from the Carnegie Corporation, to enlarge the building and equip the club rooms in the basement. The towns which have established new libraries are Arlington, Franklin, Gothenburg, Harvard, Ravenna, Stromsburg, Tekamah, University Place, and the townships at Arcadia, Loup City, Merna and Spencer. At Blair and Clay Center libraries already established have been taken over by the city. Through the consolidation of Omaha and South Omaha, the South Omaha library became a branch of the Omaha library. Fifteen new library buildings have been completed in the biennium and six more are under construction. The list is as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 COMPLETED BUILDINGS Since most of our libraries are too small to employ trained librarians, a special effort has been made to bring to them the experience of trained workers elsewhere. The Commission has sent to every library in the state the monthly Wisconsin Library Bulletin and the monthly American Library Association Booklist and has subscribed for a number of copies of Public Libraries and the Library Journal for which it has grouped the small libraries, too poor to sub - scribe for them, in circuits. A correspondence course of 20 lessons covering elementary points of library work is given to new librarians. In October, 1916, an experiment was tried in the way of a three days library institute for new librarians, preceeding the meeting of the State Library Association. This was not the usual library institute given over to informal discussion, but like the old-fashioned teachers' institute, it was a session for definite instruction. The program consisted of three one-hour lectures each morning on reference books, children's work and library ad - ministration, and in the afternoon visits were made to the various Lincoln libraries. The librarians of 35 libraries attended the institute and then stayed on for the Library Association. They went back to their libraries with well - filled note books and a great deal of enthusiasm, and undoubtedly the year's work will show good returns for their attendance. As our libraries increase in number and grow in size and use, there is demand for more training on the part of librarians than the Library Com - mission with its limited staff can give through personal instruction.

            <seg id="p009">9 time hag doubtless come when Nebraska should have its own summer library school. In the past our librarians have gone to Wisconsin, Iowa or Minnesota, but for two or three years most of the schools have been filled with their own librarians and could not admit students from outside the state. A six weeks course given by the State University with the cooperation of the Library Com - mission would meet a demand which is becoming insistent. Nebraska Library Association. The State Library Association has held two meetings, at Fremont in 1915 and at Lincoln in 1916. The attendance registered for the Lincoln meeting shows that there were present 42 public library librarians, 20 assistants from libraries of all sorts, 6 librarians of college, normal school or state libraries, 5 library trustees, 3 visiting librarians from outside the state, and 2 persons interested but not in library work, making it very representative of the library interests of the state. Excellent programs, a good attendance and a fine responsiveness from the librarians have marked both meetings of the Associ - ation. Traveling Libraries. While we believe that the goal to be aimed at in the library development of the state is a strong system of local public libraries, each supplying books to its own community, urban and rural, the attainment of such a complete public library system is many years in the future in Nebraska. In the mean - time there are two-thirds of our people without public library facilities and many more having access only to small new libraries with meagre collections of books. For them, the Library Commission must meet the immediate need through its traveling libraries. In considering the vastness of the field, our resources in a collection of 16,000 volumes is seen to be absurdly inadequate. Necessarily we are doing only a small part of the work which lies before us. We can only report that we are doing the best we can, and a consultation of the diagram in the front of this report will show that our work has at least grown with every increase of our resources. We have sent out in the biennium 51,372 volumes in response to 3,342 requests as compared with 40,590 volumes and 1,962 requests in the last biennium. These books have gone to 461 shipping stations to 88 counties, showing a very wide geographical distribution. The most notable addition to our traveling library collection was about 1,000 German books from which we made 26 fixed traveling library groups. These fill an often expressed want of small public libraries in German communi - ties which wished to supply German patrons with books in the mother tongue but which could not afford to buy enough books always to have something fresh for them. The Bohemians having been supplied with books a number of years ago and the Germans being now provided for, there remain two foreign groups for whom we should buy books, the Danes and the Swedes. The Danish people have petitioned the Library Commission for Danish traveling libraries, but no money being available it has not been possible as yet to meet their request. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 Special groups of agricultural books were made up for County Demon - stration Agents at the request of the Director of county demonstration work and are being loaned by the agents to the farmers in their counties. We have endeavored to supply the Home Economics clubs with books but it has been a hopeless struggle. After having bought as many books on their subjects as the funds permitted our supply is still totally insufficient. We are missing a fine opportunity for service to the people of the state in not being able to cooperate fully with the Extension Department of the State University in this work. Mrs. A. E. Davisson, who has charge of the Home Economics clubs, reported this fall, "The fact that country women were able to obtain these books made it possible for them to carry on a systematic course of study. During the past two years they have in several instances given up their work because the supply of books was exhausted," and Miss Maud Wilson, in charge of the Home Economics Extension work of the University, says, "Our work is greatly handicapped because the Library Commission cannot furnish a sufficient number of books to supply the demand."

The work of the institution libraries continues to be an interesting activity of the Library Commission and its progress shows a real need of libraries for the benefit of this shut-in citizenship. Rather than theorize as to the part books play in the lives of these people, we will confine ourselves to a few sta - tistics and then give the word of some of our patients as to what the libraries mean to them. There are three of the thirteen institution libraries from which we have been unable to obtain reports of circulation, though we know there is reading done in all of them, and two others cover only seven months each, but from those remaining our circulation for the past year is 45,457. This is for books alone, no record of periodical circulation being kept except at the peni - tentiary. &lt;£ For obvious reasons, the circulation at the penitentiary far exceeds that of any other place, 15,107 books and 9,257 magazines being exchanged last year. Considering conditions, it seems to us not an un creditable showing that the three insane hospitals report a combined circulation of 12,428. The boys at Kearney read 5,168 books last year, the children at the Orthopedic Hospital, 4,374 and our soldier friends at Burkett, 2,088. SSI 16,665 254 7,784 518 19,592 145 1,341 2,087 5,824 7 166 3,342 51,372 </seg>
            <seg id="p011">11 To give the more significance to these figures, it seems but fair to say that of the 4,700 inmates in all the institutions, but 1,800 are able to make any use of the libraries. In some, according to statistics from the Superintendents, the proportion able to use the library is as low as 15% or 20%. In others it reaches 80% or 90%. Bearing in mind the abnormal mental and physical conditions in several places, and the fact that institution life is a busy one for the able-bodied, these figures stand for more than the mere numbers signify. Though the reports of Superintendents show the per cent of high school graduates very small, with a great majority of the adult inmates below the eighth grade, it is gratifying to note the type of books which they enjoy. Nor has our standard of selection in any case been lowered on account of the educa - tional deficiencies of our patrons. Our aim is to consider carefully the nature of the foundation upon which we are building and in each book added there is a hope that the choice will be justified by its use among the people. From the weighty problem of trying to prove the abiding influence of good literature in the face of possible conflicts, to the question of the remedial value of books upon those mentally ill, there is a conscientious desire to adapt the books to the people in every instance. The combined number of volumes in our libraries is 13,191, most of which have been bought by the Commission since it began its institutional library work in 1911. The Penitentiary has 3,600 volumes, 1,100 volumes bought by us with 2,500 volumes previously in the library. Burkett has 2,020 volumes, also with many of earlier gift. The Orthopedic Hospital has 1,180 volumes and the School for the Deaf, 1,675. Due to its fewer years, the Tuberculous Hospital has the smallest book collection but it is developing into a very work - able one. There is great interest shown in the nature study books for which the patients made special request. The question of housing the institution libraries is an important one. Because of crowded conditions, it is not always possible to secure the most desir - able quarters but the fact that the best available locations have been given us proves the interest of the Superintendents. In some cases the library has been given the most beautiful room in the institution. Where it is not so satisfactorily placed, we are simply sharing the disadvantage with other de - partments. Plans for improved library quarters are being considered in some places. In others our hope has already been realized. At the Girls' Industrial School, the library is now placed permanently in the auditorium of the new building- At the Boys' Industrial School, the library has been redecorated and greatly beautified by new bookcases made by the boys. The library at the School for the Deaf has been moved to a cosy corner space. They also have new book cases which were made in their carpenter shop. At the Lincoln State Hospital, a reading room in the amusement hall has been opened, new shelving has been built, and for two hours daily the patients have access to the books and periodi - cals. This change in location has come about because the Superintendent, Dr. B. F. Williams, regards the book as a cura£ve agent and to that end he has emphasized the importance of its use. At the Home for the Feeble-Minded </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 and at the Tuberculous Hospital we have just moved into roomy, sunny quarters in their new buildings. At the School for the Deaf the choicest of locations is provided for the very little children. The time which the libraries are open for the exchange of books varies, according to local conditions, from one hour a week, two hours a day, to any hour of every day. In six instances there are reading rooms in connection with the libraries. In two others there are rooms elsewhere in which people may gather to read. Even with the cooperation of the Superintendent, with our books upon the shelves and the reader ever with us, the problem of an effective library is not solved. The books and the people must be brought together and that with unusual delicacy of touch. So we face the question of service along with all other departments of the institutions. At the Penitentiary, the Old Soldiers' Home at Burkett and the Ortho - pedic Hospital we have the advantage of librarians who do that work exclusively. At the latter Miss Eva Colby continues her efficient work and cheers many a little child by her story-telling. In the other institutions it is almost neces - sarily a combination position, which varies from superintendent to inmate, including matron, secretary, teacher, nurse, stenographer and telephone oper - ator. In spite of several changes within the past year, in almost every case we have enjoyed the conscientious service of faithful helpers without whom our libraries could not have flourished. At the School for the Deaf, the Home for the Feeble-Minded, the In - dustrial Schools for Girls and Boys, and the Industrial Home for Women, the teachers have given very generously of their time and have materially in - creased the effectiveness of our work. The assistance we have had from nurses and others in the Hospitals for the Insane has been the means of veri - fying the statement of physicians that books do have a therapeutic value. To all who have helped us we wish to pay tribute. Since we know that some of our institution citizenship will in time return to an unrestrained manner of life, it has been our policy to give some instruc - tion in the use of the library, — in classification, the use of the catalog, the charg - ing system, — that they may feel at ease in the use of the public library. To this we expect to give further systematic attention during the coming year. We have in two cases a more or less public organ through which we make ourselves known. At the School for the Deaf and the Boys' Industrial School there are creditable little papers issued, most of the work being done by the boys. In the columns of the Nebraska Journal, library notes appear from time to time and in the Industrial School Times we have a place each week. Because the nurse in the hospital is the person naturally in position to bring the book to the patient, a series of talks on Books and Reading was given last winter to the nurses at the Lincoln State Hospital. These included one on the use of the library, one on how to get patients to read, one on out-door books, one on popular books of non-fiction, and one on poetry. They were developed from a syllabus prepared by Miss Edith Kathleen Jones, Librarian of McLean Hospital, Waverly, Massachusetts, and covered a period of about three months. We feel that it was at least worth while to come into personal </seg>
            <seg id="p013">13 touch with the nurses on whom so much of the hospital library work must necessarily devolve. Moreover, we were rewarded by seeing some definite re - sults as an outcome of this work. In abbreviated form parts of these talks were also given to the nurses at the Norfolk Hospital for the Insane. As another means of increasing the interest in the hospital libraries, we tried an experiment of reading aloud to the patients in the Lincoln Hospital for the Insane. It proved to be a very popular diversion for both men and women and invitations to read on various wards were numerous. This was continued one afternoon a week all winter and became an entering wedge in the development of the work. Not only did some of the nurses begin to read on the wards, but our librarian now spends a part of library hours each day reading to the patients gathered in the library. It is a mistaken idea on the part of many people that the insane are unable to read or are too uninterested to care for books, but we think we can disabuse the minds of such by giving the patient's own word upon the matter. The opinion, too, is rife that they wish only the determinedly cheerful books, those which merely entertain, but one of our nurses in an eastern hospital tells of an insane patient who calls for the "big brave books, with problems of life to be fought." As proof that our patients are reading and are appreciative of the hospital libraries, we wish them to speak by means of the following letters which were collected recently from the three insane hospitals. These few are selected from many more and are in the exact wording of the patients who wrote them. "I must write you as I have been so much interested in the book Pollyanna. It was a great help to me because it makes me remember many things which I have to be glad about, even if I am locked up. I can be glad I am not in as bad condition as many about me. I am glad for my clean dresses and for the nurses and patient friends who are so kind to me. I am glad for the squirrels and birds that play among the trees." "Being a lover of good books, I have certainly appreciated the books which the nurses distribute from time to time throughout the different wards. When one can sit here in the State Hospital and read such books as the Efficient life, Alice and Phoebe Cary's poems, and so on, it gives the place a sort of homey halo after all." "There are several branches of the Nebraska Library and one of the most practical in its selection and use is the State Hospital library. It is composed of Current Literature and many volumes from some of our best authors, extra good works. Library day for the men comes hree times a week and is looked forward to with much anticipation by many on our ward. It would be re - gretted if we did not have a chance to make these regular trips to the library." "Having taken pleasure in reading many books in the library here at Ingle - side, I am very glad to mention my likes in regard to it. I like the books on nature most. "In God's out-doors," "The Alps," "The spell of the Rockies" and others I might mention. Many of the novels are so amusing that they are a great help in passing the time pleasantly. Many of the books point a moral such as "Up from Slavery" by Booker T. Washington which shows what a man can do if he has ambition. Books may do great good. 'May blessings be on the head of Cadmus the Phaenician or whoever it was that invented books.'" </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 "In behalf of several inmates on 24, allow me to express our appreciation for the privilege of reading the Ingleside state library books, either historical, Biblical or fiction as suits our mood. They indeed help us to while away many moments and instruct us when inclement weather keeps us indoors. We want to thank you for this pleasure and privilege allowed us." "In appreciation of the reading matter, books, magazines and newspapers furnished Ward II, I am permitted a word of praise. These literary and news advantages have been a source of great pleasure and diversion and no little fund of information during my three months sojourn here." "As I have never read in but very few books, until I came here, on account of close confinement I began reading the book, The price of the prairie. Thought that I would read some for pastime and the book became very interesting to me. Also started another but have not finished it yet. I certainly enjoyed the first but cannot get much interest from the latter which is Innocence Abroad." "I derive much benefit from the books insomuch as they pass the time pleasantly, leave one in a happy state of mind and give food for thought. I specially enjoy those dealing with home life, such as Grace Richmond's, Kath - leen Norris, and Eleanor Porter. I also enjoy those of travel and history." "Among the many pleasant advantages offered by this free institution, the library deserves honorable mention. Any one who is considered able is allowed to draw books and take them to his ward. Among the books which the writer has enjoyed the Oregon trail by Francis Parkman ranks first, as picturing the hardships of the early settler, with its fascination of style and diction which make it interesting as a novel. I also like the writings of Rev. Van Dyke in his "Little Rivers," "Days Off" and others vividly describing fishing and hunt - ing trips. What a difference between the pleasure of listening to choice liter - ature in the commodious library hall and doing all your reading in a ward, sur - rounded by a group of unfortunates who do not know what they say, nor how they say it, nor when! Surely the library hours are an agreeable change from the daily routine of our life of seclusion. All this is a step in the right di - rection, conducive to mental healing, resulting in self-control, accompanied by will-power." Publicity. The Library Commission has prepared an exhibit each year for the State Fair and has had members of the staff in charge to explain the work of the Com - mission to those who were interested. The exhibit of 1916, through charts, posters and photographs showed the library development of the state. This same exhibit was afterward sent to Hastings for the meeting of the State Federation of Woman's Clubs, and was used again at the meeting of the State Library Association and has since been loaned to the Pawnee City woman's dub for a "library day." </seg>
