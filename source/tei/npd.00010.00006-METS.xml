Sheep Feeding Experiments in Nebraska. (Second Experiment.) 

Bulletin No. 66, "Sheep Feeding Experiments in Nebraska," 
was published as the result of experiments undertaken in 1899-1900 
to determine the comparative value of different rations 
in fattening range lambs for the market. In that experiment 
alfalfa hay and prairie hay were compared when fed to sheep 
with three different grain rations. Corn, corn and oats in the 
proportion of three-fourths corn to one-fourth oats, and corn 
and bran in the proportion of about four-fifths corn to onefifth 
bran, were fed as grain rations. In addition a grain ration 
of five-sixths corn and one-sixth linseed meal was fed with 
prairie hay to Lot 7 in order to afford a comparison with Lot 
4. where only corn and prairie hay were fed. 

Bthe above experiment all lots fed on alfalfa and a grain 
i made an average gain of 32.2 pounds each in 98 days, 
the lambs fed on prairie hay including the lot fed linseed 
made a gain of only 20.5 pounds in 98 days. If we/ exthe 
lot fed linseed meal and corn with prairie hay, which 
gained 24.2 pounds, the remaining lots gained but 19 pounds. 
These results show an advantage of 52 per cent, in favor of 
the lots receiving alfalfa hay as compared with prairie hay on 
the same grain rations. 

The complete results of the test were given in Bulletin No. 
66 but the conclusions are here repeated. 

CONCLUSIONS FROM BULLETIN 66. 

6 Owing to the high price of $6.35, net, at which the lambs 
sold, all the lambs were fed at a large profit not withstandle 
high original cost of five cents per pound delivered at 
irm. 

2. The alfalfa fed lambs consumed 1.34 pounds of alfalfa 
hay and one pound of grain per day as against .88 pounds of 
prairie hay and .89 pounds of grain consumed by the prairie 
hay fed lambs.

3. The alfalfa fed lambs made fifty-two per cent, greater 
gains than the lambs fed prairie hay and the same grain ration. 

4. The lambs fed prairie hay with corn and 16 per cent, of 
linseed meal made 26 per cent, larger gains than the lots fed 
prairie hay with a grain ration of shelled corn, or shelled corn 
with 25 per cent, of bran or oats added. 

EIn these experiments the addition of bran and oats to the 
in the grain ration did not increase the gains, unless possil 
the case of the twenty lambs fed outside on alfalfa and 
with 25 per cent. bran. 

EXPERIMENT OF 1900-1901 

In order to test the comparative value of alfalfa hay and of 
sorghum or sugar cane for fattening sheep a mixed lot of 1_'.&lt; 
lambs were purchased on Sept 26, 19001 through Clay, Robinson 
&amp; Co., of South Omaha. These lambs weighed 50 pounds 
average at the time they were received. They were turned 
on pasture of rape and other feed and gained rapidly until the 
time they were placed on experiment. They were dipped in 
the meantime and throughout the feeding experiment showed 
no signs of either scab or ticks. 

On October 18 these lambs together with a small breeding 
flock were turned on a field of alfalfa during the day and were 
fed a small ration of grain equal to about one-third of a pound 
of oats each per day. After some days pasturing on alfalfa 
some of the weaker lambs commenced to die and the losses coutinued 
until nine lambs were dead when the sheep were taken 
off the alfalfa pasture on November 1st and no further In hood 
were incurred. In these cases of death there was no bloat and 
post-mortem examination showed no symptoms which would 
explain the cause of death. There had been no hard fr&gt; 
None of the home-bred sheep died, though on the same pasture. 

E -mortem examination of the lambs which died showed 
;sence of a limited number of tapeworms and as a prel 
those lambs that survived were drenched twice at intervals 
of two days with doses of a one-half ounce of gasoline 
in a small quantity of sweet milk. Their subsequent feeding 
showed that either they were not seriously affected with tapeworm 
or the treatment was entirely effective in destroying the 
worms. </seg>

SEPARATION OF LOTS. 

On November 22, 1900, six home-bred lambs were added to 
the 120 purchased. The 126 lambs were divided into ten lots. 
Seven of these lots were in open pens and contained twelve 
sheep each, while three lots were in covered pens with yards 
attached and contained fourteen sheep each. 

Ets 1, 2, 3, under cover and 4, 5, 6, in the open yards were 
n alfalfa hay and similar grain rations, the only difference 
: that three lots had shelter and three lots had no shelter. 

Ets 7, 8, 9, were fed on sorghum hay and grain rations like 
lfalfa fed lambs. Lot 10 was fed sorghum hay and a grain 
q of five-sixths corn and one-sixth linseed meal. 

The time between November 22 and December 8 was used to 
get the different lots on their several rations and to secure 
accurate weights. On December 8, 1900, the lots were under 

On December 8, 1900, these lambs were eating practically one 
pound of grain and one and one-half pounds of hay each per 
day. They had then been receiving some grain since October 
18 and were fairly well accustomed to the ration on which 
they were to continue. The grain ration'was increased as rapidly 
as we could safely do it without thelots refusing feed, until 
the lots on alfalfa were receiving one jand one-half pounds 
of grain per day and those on sorghum were on full feed. In 
feeding sorghum in this experiment and in feeding prairie hay 
the year previous we found that lambs would not take as much 
grain on either prairie or sorghum as where alfalfa was 
fed, but that the addition of linseed meal, old process, to the 
ration increased the appetite and consuming power of the

sheep. This was doubtless due to the increased protein in the 
alfalfa or in the linseed meal which helped to balance the ra- 

No changes were made in the ration for the first eight weeks 
but at the beginning of the ninth week the bran in the ration 
of lots 3, 6, and 9 was decreased from one-fourth to one-sixth, 
using sixteen pounds of bran with eighty-four pounds of corn 
instead of twenty-five pounds of bran with seventy-five pounds 
of corn. The experiment was continued without other changeuntil 
its close at the end of fourteen weeks or ninety-eight days 
from the time the experiment proper commenced. 

As these lambs had been receiving some grain for fifty days 
before December 8, beginning with one-fourth pound of oats on 
October 18 and increased to about one-half pound per day on 
November 3, and again increased quite rapidly after the lots 
were separated on November 22, some of the heavier lambs became 
too heavy for the market and would have sold better two 
or three weeks earlier but were held to try and finish the 
smaller and thinner lambs. It proved, however, that the lambs 
receiving alfalfa, which made the larger gains during the early 
part of the experiment, continued to make the greater gains 
Cring the last weeks of feeding so that the difference grew 
ire marked as the feeding continued. 

During the last two weeks the lots on sorghum ate very 
poorly, refusing to consume more than one and one-third 
pounds of corn per head daily except in the case of the lot receiving 
16 per cent, linseed meal with its corn. This lot ate 
well and made good gains. 

¦lots were thrifty and healthy during the entire experibut 
those on sorghum got rather tired of the ration and 
have improved could their ration have been changed. 

One lamb in Lot 6 died on February 28 from accident. As 
he weighed ninety-six pounds and was^ in perfect health the 
day previous it could not be charged to the method of feeding. 
Each lot was fed all the hay it would clean up but none in excess. 
The lots on sorghum pulled a small amount through the 
racks and wasted it but as the amount could not be exactly determined 
it was charged to the sheep. There was practically 
no waste of alfalfa. 

There was but one bad storm during the feeding season so </seg>

that little benefit accrued from shelter. The gain per head of the 
alfalfa lambs in the open yard was thirty-three pounds and that 
of the lots having a shed with an open yard was thirty-four 
pounds per head, for the ninety-eight days they were fed, 
which would indicate that there is little to be gained from 

housing during a season like the past winter. 

These lambs were sold on the Omaha market on March 19, 

1901. They brought $5.00 per hundred on a day when the best 
Colorado lambs sold at about $5.20. Some of these lambs were 
too heavy for the trade and a few were not sufficiently fat owing 
to the fact that the entire lot was sold together instead of 
selling the tops as they were ready. They made an average 
weight in Omaha of 87.2 pounds, showing a gain since passing 
through the yards September 26 of thirty-live pounds in 173 

days, not charging them with losses by death. 

The following is a financial statement of the experiment but 

Ethe selling price was very low this year the profit will be 
und to be small though suffiicent to insure profitable feeding.
