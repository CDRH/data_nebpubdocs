            <seg id="p023">NEBRASKA DA1RYMK.VS ASSOCIATION ADDRESS OF I'ROF. A L. HAKCKER. PRESIDENT Ob this the opening day of our twenty-fifth annual meetfn with pride we can say the Nebraska Daiymens Association stanc ligh as a benefactor of the industry it quarter century of its existence mar the state, the nation and the wor proceeding! of this association bear the advancement of the times. represents and of the state. The ks the best period in the history of Id, and the bound volumes of the witness that it has kept pace with Reflect for a moment on the gr. 'luring these brief yiars. We ha place as a dairy state to the tenth. •at changes which have taken place e grown from tne twenty-fourth Not only have we been given the .ream separator but there have been added to our farm equipment over 46.006 hand machines, which are turning out annually some »15.«00.00fl worth of cream, whi h is churned in the largest cream. t&lt;&gt; be found in the world and is sent as butter to the large cities of this and foreign lands. By this method we are now able to market as a finishe I product our cheap grasses and grains. We have been given the Babcock test, which is usea the world over to find, in a quick and simple way. the value of our milk and cream. Rural free delivery, the telephone, the electric power, the gaso - ine engine, the milking machine, the wireless telegraph, the control of bacteria, the cure of milk fever, the prevention of blackleg and of ■og cholera, trie great improvement in farm machinery, and a better understanding of the principles of breeding and feeding stock, have all come in this associations lifetime. Surely we have been blessed, and with due appreciation of all these good things we should celebrate »ur silver anniversary. Let us apply these improvements as rapidly as possible in our farm practice. A brief review of the history of this organization will bring to mind the many good works of its members. Our worthy secretary Mr. 8. C. BHMtt, has promised to give us a history of this work and am sure no one is better fitted than he. being one of the charter members of the organization and in active se-vice as an officer through all the years of its existence. It was a committee from this association that first started the agitation for a popular course in agriculture at the university The members, after visiting the Iowa and Wisconsin universities, recom - menderl to the regents that a short course in agriculture be given m this institution. In the early years of the farmers' institute, the association con - tributed funds and speakers to spread the teachings of improvements in farming. Committees from this association framed the bills and foa e laws of the food and dairy legislation. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">r\VKNTY-FIFTH AXNl'AL CONVENTION was the first of the societies of organized Agriculture to make regular plare of meeting the university farm. Through all the years of its work it has kept in the front rank with the improvements and new ideas of the industry. The association has from the beginning represented all the de - lartments of the industry and has endeavored to give to all its best ounsel and patronage. In this it has recognized the close relation hat must exist between the producer, the manufacturer and the con - umer, and that to accomplish the greatest good there must be mutual understanding and co-operation. It is a pleasure to report that hrough all times the association has enjoyed perfect harmony among ts members, and it is hoped that this concord may abide. We are grieved to here mention the death of ex-Governor \V. A. Poynter, who on April 5, 1909, was suddenly stricken while making plea in the cause of temperance before Governor Shallenberger and large assembly of temperance workers. Governor Poynter at the ime of his death was a member of the board of directors of this ssociation and a dairy lecturer of the state farmers' institute. The plendid work of his life will always remain a benefit to the state nd an honor to his name. There is much for us to do as promoters of advanced dairying to put the industry of the state in the position we believe it ought to occupy.

With hese two great foodstuffs given to our cows in the proper rations, we need have no fear of competition.

There is, however, a consoling hought in the old saying that "it is an il. wind that blows no good." 'he winter certainly has reminded us of the need of putting up food or our stock. The silo now is a paramount issue with the stock keeper, ine old but common practice of turning milk cows into the orn stalks through the winter nas long been condemned. Now the north wind with his icy breata has called a halt, and we are forced o consider a cheaper, wiser and more humane way of feeding our animals. The silo wi.i give us a cheap succulent stock food in winter and in summer. It costs less than $2 per ton and is wortn $5, based on present prices of hay. It doubles the value of an acre of corn and s always in a handy place for feeding. It makes profitable winter iairying and enables a dairyman to keep more cows upon his farm.

These produced in l»09 an average of twice as many pounds of butter per cow as compared with 1885 and we manu - facture thirty times as much butter in our creameries as in 1885. Whether this association is entitled to much of credit for the rowth and development of the dairy industry in the state during the &gt;aBt twentv-tive years it might be difficult to determine, but it can be said that the association has at all times kept in close touch with i phar&lt; : of the industry, has always encouraged the use of better methods both in the improvement, care and feeding of dairy cows and n the improvement in the quality of the dairy product. The annual eports of the association are a complete history of the dairy industry f the state for the past twenty-five years and are rich in knowledge nd advice in regard to the better methods.

For milk, the most perfect food known, when in its pine and normal state, has frequently become. through unsanitary handling, a medium for the distribution of filth and Infectious diseases. Milk is the one article of food in which diaeaw may lurk without giving suspicion in taste, smell or appearance. Dairy "ugh of vital importance, and although its practice Increasing, w still too lightly regarded uy the majority of those who handle milk for human consumption. Where the milk supply is han- dled under average erietlnj conditions the subject of dairy sanitation from the standpoint of the distributor and tne consumer is a source of continual aggravation, and even whare the buaineaa is properly eon- ducted, constant vigilance is required Judging from existing conditions in the burns and dairies of 1 farms that I inspected in Ma viand last y. ar. and a similar number ir Nebraska during the past four months, a vast improvement is neces - sary. The majority of the barns lack light and ventilation. Their partially decayed wooden floors are soaked with liquid manure, which retain a strong ammonia odor, and form a trap for infectious diseases underneath. Nuni.rous ledges collect dust and loose hay mows allow chaff to sift through. The close, moist atmosphere caused by lack of lation makes a hot bed for tuberculosis bacteria. Improved sani- tary conditions materially aid in the eradication of tuberculosis and other (I-s. ases. The milkers, as a rule, are not cleanly enough. Some of them sail! milk dirty cows with wet hands, and only half cool the milk before it leaves their farms. When the animal heat is retained in ailk for an hour or longer, no amount of subsequent cooling will entirely eliminate the musty tajte thus acquired. Where milk or &lt; ream is allowed to retain this flavor, and without stirring, it freez. and is thawed out by Beans of a steam hose at the creamery, an autopsy or post-mortem would reveal an odor and flavor of the reniair in the (an that would make the buttermaker think he was robbing the undertaker of a job. In the summer time it is even wor Some dairymen still deliver such uavored milk in cans from which it is poured into the consumers' receptacle in the dust lad. n at phere of the streets. This milk contains bacteria from uncleanly sources which reproduce with almost miraculous rapidity in warm milk, and by the time this milk is consumed by children, the gern ar. there in such numbers as to frequently produce disease or hit tinal disorder. These bacteria, when in their proper place in nat :• useful in decaying humus matter and returning its fertility to the soil. When anything in nature is taken out of its normal saner* it usually create* a disturbance. Here is an excellent example of this phenomenon. The putrefying bacteria continue their work the same in the digestive system of the child as they do in the manure pile, and produce a noxious and dangerous effect Epidemics of typhoid fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and other </seg>
            <seg id="p032">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 31 infectious diseases have thus been distributed through an unsanitary milk supply from time to time in the majority of our large cities. In 1908 two epidemics of typhoid fever broke out in Chicago, which were traced directly to the milk supply of that city. In the city of Wash - ington ten per cent of the typhoid fever cases have been traced to the milk supply. Dr. A. F. Htse recently found virulent tubercule bacilli in 17 out of 107 samples of milk taken from the general milk supply and the spread of infectious diseases The demand for a better milk for babies has induced an improve - ment in the general milk supply. A vast improvement is still neces - sary. Dr. Lederle of New York City, in his paper before the Interna - ional Milk Dealers' Association in Milwaukee, last October, said: "As matter of fact there is not a city in the world whose regular milk upply is suitable for infants." This is partially due to its unsanitary ondition and partly because of the necessity for its modification for uch purposes. Milk, produced under unsanitary conditions, is not only impure n itself, but transmits its impurity to cream, butter, cheese, ice cream, nd other diary produ ts manuiactured therefrom. The skill of a mtter-maker is largely dependent upon his ability to eliminate from he butteer bad flavors that exist in the cream from which ir is hurned. As technical knowledge in dairying becomes more general, and ealth officers and inspectors increase in number and efficiency, dairy ondttions gradually improve. Pro-ressive proprietors of distributing lants with sufficient capital have installed pasteurizers, which in the lands of competent operators, destroy the disease germs and most of he other bacteria present, 'i uis milk is bottled and distributed free rom the street dust anu is a material improvement over previous methods. Pasteurized milK, however, does not usually agree with delicate infants under six months of age, and certitfied milk should be ubstituted in all such cases. u'here enough capital is involved to properly equip and employ rained men on dairy farms and in distri outing plants, a better quality of milk and methous of distribution have Deen obtained. Wealthy men and philanthropists, who take a fancy to pure bred cattle and pure milk, are establishing farms in every state, where such stock and certitfied milk is being produced. An excellent example of this is that of the Friesland Farm of Dr. B. B. Davis, located seven miles west of of New York City. It is estimated tnat the cities of the Vnited States consume 40,0ii0.onn quarts of milk daily, it is also estimated by government statistics that 10O00 people die annually from tuberculosis, 14 from typhoid. 11.000 from diphtheria. 4.000 from scarlet fever. 41 babies under two years of age, are victims of diar-hota. and one-third of all babi« s born, die before they are three years old.

I am not condemning the home dairy syst&lt; m. The system in itself s all right for the purpose for which it is intended, but the product rom thi3 system should be either promptly consumed at home or the work should be carried on as Prof. Haecker is teaching it hi re, in a lodern and sanitary manner. This includes proper washing and sttrili - ation of all utensils with which the milk comes in contact, clean milking, proper cooling, and prompt delivery to the consumer, the reamcry. or the distributing plant. I- rompt cooling is most necessary, ot only to eradicate the animal flavor, but to check the growth of acteria. which would otherwise double their numbers every twenty minutes. Wholesome clean milk can be produced in a simply con - tructed barn if th? barn utensils and milk are kept clean, nl our istributing plant we grade, filter, pasteurize, cool, bottle and place he milk in a re frigerator until delivered. Here the problem of sanita - ion is ever present. All bottles and cans are washed as soon as empty, r immediately upon their return to the factory. This is a saving of abor. washing powder and cans, for the longer they remain unwashed. h&lt; harder it is to wash them, and the greater the danger of ruatingr nd of contaminating milk which they afterwards contain. Creamery oors should be made of the best Portlani cement and sloping to a utter. We have found, however, that when full milk cans are fre - uen'ly rolled over a cement floor, they wear holes in it where milk nd water collect. This unsanitary condition is best remedies by re - lling with a cement and placing over while soft perforated iron plating hich strengthens the surface of the cement. All corners of the floois f creameries, dairies an 1 dairy barns should be rounded to eliminate laces for dust to collect and to facilitate cleaning. Sterilization of bottles, prevention of dirt from getting into them before filling, sanitary method of capping the bottles, neatness of pack - ge. icing of bottles in refrigerator cases for delivery, are items which eccrsitate most careful daily attention. Fanitary milk tubing only hould be used to conduct milk from tanks, pasteurizer, separator, etc.. o the bottles and the bott'er should have a close fitting cover to pre - ent any dust from falling into it. A capping machine only should &gt;e used for capping the bottles, and the bo'*les should be well iced for ummer delivery. When these precautions are taken and there is 3till omplaint. the fault nay i vually br trace 1 to negligence on the part f the consumer. The bofles are frequently left on warm porchea. in warm rooms, or emptied into warm dirty or unsteril dishes several lours before using. When thll milk sours, the milk (!( aler is blamed. The average consumer also judges milk by the amount of cream in the eck of the bottle. Pasteuriza'ion above 160 degrees F. de-'roys the hysical composition of milk which is not entirely restored by cooling, nd only a small proportion of the cream rises there-after.

            <seg id="p035">34 NEBRASKA DAIRYMKNS ASSOCIATION pasteurized at lower temperatures, the cream line is destroyed and its appearance is deceiving. To insure a perfect sanitary milk supply. the producer, distributor and consumer must be educated along the lines of dairy sanitation. Sanitation in one stage of the preparation of dairy products is not sufficient. Pasteurization of milk at the distributing plant will not prevent the spread of tuberculosis among animals on the farm. Neiher will it entirely eradicate a bad flavor obtained there. When the :al publir educated to the importance of dairy sanitation, lealth officers will be supported, and where politics do not interfere, will enforce laws regarding it. Those who do not comply with the reg - ulations of the milk ordinances, will be forced out of business. We will all be glad to see them go. I believe that the business will then be eft chiefly in the hands of those who have completed a course in dairy - ng at one of the State Agricultural colleges. When the number of such men becomes adequate to fill all positions as managers and overseers of he dairy herds, dairies, distributing plants and creameries, pure, wholesome milk may be produced at a minimum cost. Quality will reg - ulate the market demand, and those who will not produce pure milk will be obliged to consume it at home or feed it to their hogs. Hogs, however, have been found to be of all domestic animals, the most susceptible to tuberculosis. While they would not likely be affected merely by unsanitary milk without the disease germs, there is great danger of such milk becoming infected with tubercle bacilli. There will, therefore, be but one alternative for the future dairy - man, and that will be the option of producing pure, clean milk or of quitting the business. The time is not far distant when milk produc - ion, transportation, and distribution will be under strict federal, state and municipal control. Every farm producing milk will be operated under a permit. There will be not only strict requirements in sani - tation and cleanliness in all operations, but producers will be taught methods by which good results will be commercially obtained, lnspec - ors must learn to be tactful, and those whose premises are inspected mist learn to regard the inspectors as public benefactors, rather than a public nuisance. Health officers, physicians, veterinarians and milk dealers should co-operate to enforce the dairy ordinances. To display an unwilling - ness to do this would indicate questionable methods in the operations of any such person.

I would like to ask Professor Meliok what he thinks about that method of bottling milk? Mr. Chairman, that method of bottling is no nprovt -merit over delivering in cans as you can see. because opening bottle and putting the milk in it from the can would be just like utting it into the consumer's receptable right in the street, and I do ot think that that should be allowed. Bottles should be sterilized efore the milk is poured into them because if you have bottles washed ut with warm or cold water they would not be bacilli clean, even if on can't see the dirt, and if you carry a bottle around empty you have very opportunity to have it become contaminated before it is us. Mr. Sehwager: We might add to the city ordinances of Omaha. There is one strong point that I think should be brought out on that m -liimeiit tisi.

Little. Benson. Ni biaska I am not an agricultural architect but a dairyman and in taking p the subject of dairy buildings my aim shall be — not to offer dimen - ion plans for buildings — but to consider the buildings as they affect the Iteration.* of the modern dairy plant with its herd. The arrangement f the buildings and their construction naturally direct the practices pplied in the care and management of the herd. It is this part of the ubject 1 wish to treat, for proper housing is the first essential in the »re of livestock. The barns furnish a nome for the cows. They are lso the workshop where milk is produced. It is ee3ential therefore hat they snould be adapted to this particular purpose. The location of the buildings on the farm and their relative posi - ion is of primary significance. They should have good drainage. &gt;roper windbreaks to the north and by all means be free from con - aminating surroundings. The "eneral arrangement ri'ist necessarily &gt;e regulated to suit the purpose for which the different buildings are ntended. yet simplicity, convenitnee and app&lt; arance should be main - ained throughout. The size of the enterprise, the market, etc.. will argely control the size of the buildings, yet there are certain rules that must apply in all cases. First of all. the barn must be a dairy barn and not a shelter for all he stock on the farm, including the chiekt ns and hogs. It should be a place where milk can be produced in a sanitary manner, and where every rule, pertaining to cleanliness, can be followed. The floor jhould &gt;e made entirely of cement with a layer of tar and tar felt in the stall loor to cause non-conduction. i he corners and sides where the wall and floor meet should be covt A. The inner walls and ceiling plastered with cement. This is a sanitary measure that will speak for itself. The construction is not expensive and milk can be produced- here that 8 fit for human consumption. The ceiling, above a'.l things, should be clean. Supporting beams furnish crevices for dirt and break the cir - culation of air. The length of the milking barn can be arranged to suit the size of the herd, allowing three f &gt; i t six inches for each stall and a five or six-foot alleyway at each end. The width should never be ess than thirty-six feet. In the floor plan this amount of space would </seg>

A width of thirty-eight r even forty feet would be better the additional space being added to le alleys and feedway. It is hard to make too much space here. A ood distance between the walls and gutters is always an advantage, specially whtre visitors come often, and a roomy feedway i3 certainly convenience. In regard to stalls, the Drow and Bidwell types are oo. , but expensive. They also fill the barn with too much material. prefer the iron sianchioiu with pipe supports and partitions st t in enient. They are comparatively cheap, simple and add greatly to the eanly appearance of tne dairy barn. An overhead track is convenient, mt 1 \&gt;T( fer floor trucks for carrying both litter and feed; they are just s handy as the track and do away witii the unsightly dun collectors &lt; ar th« ceiling. There should be a door leading out from each side f this barn, one for litter, the other to the milk room. At one end wo doors should lead into the yards, at the other a central door should ad to the feed rooms, root cellar and silos. This arrangement with ne cows facing towards the center is preferable to having the cows acing outwards on account of its greater convenience in feeding and realise the temperature can be regulated more easily without drafts Irectly en the cows. The other plan has its admirers, but I have tried &gt;oth. and the above are the conclusions drawn from my own experience. In regard to lighting, ventilation, drainage, etc.. I have hrird the leory advoca'f i that since the dairyman does most of his work by arti - cial light, windows are of little value. This is a mis'ake. no matter what the habits of a dairyman may be. We must have sunlight in the am — plenty of sunlight. It should strike every part of the floor jome ime during tne day. Sunlight is an enemy of pathogenic disease and his is sufficient reason for a continual row of windows to be built into he walls. Naturally then, to obtain the greatest amount of sunshine ne feeding door would be towards the north and the milking barn would face the south. These winuows should drop inward at the top nd have metal projection at the sides. These side piects allow the window to open about eighteen inches and all the air to pa3s along the eiling to the center of the barn. Having opposite windows open and tie prevailing winds blowing north and south, the two currents of air will meet and travel downwards in front of the cows. This means of ett'ng air into the barn la sufficient during the summer months but in orthern climates where the temperature of the barn must be con - rolled, the "King" intake is a valuable addition to the ventilating sy *- em. It can enter the side wall'at the ba.-e of the window, travel up the wall through the ceiling and open directly above the feedway. Sixteen - nch outlets naving telescope slides, which can be lowered to within ightet n inches of the floor should be installed behind the cows and un out through the highest point of the roof. One air flue on either ide for every forty feet in length will easily carry all the carbonic gas rom the floor. </seg>
            <seg id="p039">NKI3RASKA DAIRYMAN'S ASSOCIATION n in the feed way should slope in such a manner that i! tan be flushed into the ■'utters. The gutters should drain towards -•lit 11 end of the barn and lead through the wall to an outdoor trap, t.itme to a large ceptic tank. From the barn to the trap this * ill be at the surface and merely covered l&gt;y a plank lid. This in - suns a free drain at all times. A wide cement approach at the end of the tiarn is a great advantage and should never be lift out of the dairybarn plan. It furnishes a place where the cows &lt;an clean their feet upon entering the barn and adds greatly to the cleanliness of the barn-lot. I have described the details of an idtal milking barn, because it is the most important part of the dairy plant. It should in all cases be a part of or built contiguous to the storage barn: here we should have the ft ed bins, silos, grinding and cutting room, an ample tool room and means of producrng power, in the arrangement, the silos and feed bins should open into the feedway; in fact the entire plan should be I on convenience. The hay loft may be either above the milking barn, or over the storage barn or over both. The young stock, the bull, the calves and tin- lying-in cows should, housed in a separate barn, er in an ell off the storage am. This aids materially in convenience, and when a number of eifers are developed on . .e farm this additional space is necessary. he young stock should have stanchions and stalls similar to the milk -iiace is needed. Tne bull should be tied in an open stall, here he can see everything tha.. is going on. The high boarded box tall has ruined more bulls than any other one factor, and should never e used for this purpose. A merry-go-round exerciser, placed in a pro- I yard, will regulate his physical condition. The calves do well in mall box stalls, two ln.de ones in each pen. These pens can be built n a row with removable partitions, thus making one long runway for ummer use. Proper quarters for the young stock are too often neg - 1. Winter dairying is necessary for the business, however, and inter calvts make the better cows. They can also be developed to maturity more cheaply than summer calves. This branch of the busi - rtainly worth looking into. To meet the standards of a good airy, the dairyman must henceforth depend upon his own breeding o keep up the milking herd. The dairy b ed heifer is a money-making ropoFii inn and should be treated as such. The size and equipment of the dairy depends for the main part ipon the market. Where more than ten cows are milked, the farm Mould by all means have a separate dairy house. Plenty of pure air and sunlight, some means of refrigeration, washing equipment and a steam boilt r are the requisites aside from the apparatus required n caring for the milk product. The dairy house should be adjacent o the milk barn and at the same time not too far from the young ■tock barn. Skim-milk is bulky and should be handled accordingly. The outside finish of the buildings may be of any material that </seg>

'1 he building site will of course, shape the ground plan of the buildings and the builder's opinion w..l govern a number of minor points, but purpose, convenience, health and comfort should be shaped into every part and are truly as important as a good founda - tion. Having proper quarters, caring for the animals is a compara - tively simple matter. The year should first of all be divided into two leriods — winter and summer — and a special system of handlinr used during each period. System is a fundamental necessity in business and should always be adhered to in the dairy. Considering the winter period first: The cows should be kept n over ni"ht and allowed out of doors only on bright sunshiny days. A regular daily routine snould be adopted, and the closer this system s followed the be'ter. The first work in the morning should be watering, carding tne cows, cleanin* the udders and milking, then eeuing should commence. Silage or roots should be fed first, then lie grain ration and later chopped hay. If the grain ration is heavy little chopped hay should be added to lighten it. Rough hay or traw should always be found in the bunks outside. In the afternoon lie cows should be put in the barn and handled much the sime as uring the morning, the last chore at night should be watering and eeding uncut hay. It will pay in almost every instance to milk three lmes a day, especially during the first few months of lactation. The ncrease of milk flow by this pra»''ce will pay at the lowest rat - ents an hour for labor besides permitting of heavier feedin« and better development of the cow at no additional expense. The temperature of the barn should be kept at from 42 to 50 egrets Fahrenheit. The air should always be fresh; pure air is of ital importance. An animal might live for several days without ood, but remove air entirely and life will remain only a few minutes. 'Be plenty of clean, dry bedding; it is always at hand on any western arm. Straw is the most common material used, but in its absence hopped cornstalks, always plentiful, are very efficient in absorbing moisture. The bedding causts comfort, and comfort is everything, atisfactory results can never be obtained without heavy beddinc. even lough heavy feeding is practiced.

By this method we hoped to s'iniulate thought throughout the state along dairy lines, and in particular to turn the attention of our people toward some of the vital subjects of the dairy. First of all. we believed that the silo was one of the most im - &gt;ortant subjects now before our stock-keepers and therefore we made one of the subjects of these essays the question concerning the silo. Is the Silo a profitable equipment for our Nebraska Farmers?" The other two subjects introduced were "Would a Nebraska Farmer be to ent"r the dairy business?" — the thought of it. I don't recall ust the wording, and the other was, "How should a farmer conduct he dairy bus'ness?" Those were the three subjects of these essays.

Both told me, we have not tried it here — both told that they put in the first cutting of alfalfa while wet from a rain. Now. of course we do not know that the a quickest way to spoil corn silage is to put it in dry, and last yeir when we had that severe drouth our corn was a little dry and we turned the hose into the blower ai several tons of water. We must have rter and pressure to keep our ensilage, whether it be hay or corn. Mi mber: How dots alfalfa silage compare with corn silage? </seg>
            <seg id="p047">46 NEBRASKA DAIRYMKNS ASSOCIATION President Haecker: There is very little known about alfalfa ilage. Visit every library in the country and you will find very little n reftrence to this subject. Kansas has done something in that line, nd also several breeders. The main objection to putting alfalfa in he silo is the work of handling it. cutting it up with the feed-cutter nd imtting it in the silo. It is slow work. You can't put it in like ou can corn and a great many believe that they would rather run the sk and make hay of it. Of course it is a protein food. The Kansas iperimeot Station tried this; they put in their fourth cutting of Ifalfa. a load of alfalfa and a load of corn, alternating the two to - cther. The stock fed with this mixture would have a balanced ra - on as to protein and carbon-hydrate foods. The report of the experl - lent I never received. I was there, however, when they were putting in the silo and it did look very fine, but I don't know how it came ut. I do know this: that they did not continue the method. Now, he fourth cutting of alfalfa we practically always cure in this country nd it seems to me tlu re is no need of putting in a silo the fourth utting, and if we run through a feed cutter our alfalfa hay as we robably will do in a few years to come — a good many of us doing now — we needn't worry about the waste in feeding alfalfa hay. notice this winter our cows are eating the first cutting when they an get it.

Professor E. W. Hunt of Syracuse, who will discuss the subject of "Soil Fertility and Its Practical Relation to Dairying." In introducing Professor Hunt 1 wish to say that he is now with the Farmers' Institute, and has been for several years. Professor Hunt is a reformed professor like Pro- fessor Melick. he has gone back to the farm — it is a pleasure to state that the number is steadily increasing Soil Keiiiliiv and Its Practical Keliiti. n to Dairrin you have got to give him something that he can make b( ef out of liort i.-oay like you have heard Professor E, \V. Hunt. I want to take just a monn nt to get our grip firmly on a few fundamental facts. tl'lan's. In order to grow have to build new plant tissue. In t-r to build plant tissue they moat be furnishe.l material out of which they (an make this tissue. If you want to grow a beef steer. </seg>

If you want a cow to give milk you have got to give her something that she can make milk out of; she cant make milk out of nothing. Just so if you want a plant to grow, you have got to give it something that makes plant tissue, it cant make plant tissue out of noth Now. this material out of which plants build their tissue is not the soil itself. The soil is merely the container. The soil contains the plant food just as the 87 per cent of water in milk contains the 13 per cent of nutrient matter. If you should dissolve a couple of pounds of sugar in a gallon of water the water would contain the sugar but it would not be sugar itself, and just so the soil contains the materials out of which plants build their growth, but is not in itself plant Chemists tell of those materials out of which plants build their tissues, a part comes from the air and the rest cornea from the soil. If what comes from the soil is not returned to the •oil, there will be less remaining in the soil than there was in the first place. If this is continued long enough the scanty growth of crops will show that the soil is getting low in plant food or of the materials out of which plants build their tissues. Old settled portions of this State painfully show this condition Every crop takes a certain definite, easily ascertainable amount of this plant food from the soil. It is estimated that the average crop takes from every acrt acre from 60 to 80 pounds of nitrogen, about pounds of phosphoric acid, and from thirty to sixty pounds of potash, leaving U much poorer in plant food than it was before the crop was grown. Now. if this condition is continued long enough crop production will become unprofitable simply because there is not plant food enough to grow a profitable crop. More than forty year tant cropping in the older settled portions of this state has brought the danger line of unprofitable crop production in sight. The time has come — I might say that this process is going on all over this state — and the time has come, it has long since been when this matter of exhausting the soil of the material for plant growth should receive careful consideration from every inhabitant tthe state, but soil. ally from ev ry man who derives his living from Agricultural science is in its infancy, an-i I venture to predict that when the true science of agriculture comes it will concern itself less with showing us how to grow the largest crops in other words telling us how to rob the soil most rapidly and systematically, but will devote itself n howing us how to keep up the fertility of rr soil, or better still, how to restore its original condition.

And yet in this computation of the loss of $70 000,000 the burning of straw piles does not enter in, so that I may say that I am safely within the truth when I put the loss of plant food at $70,000,000 for one year. Is it any wonder that scientists will say that the time will come f this process is not arrested when future generations will not have &gt;read to eat?. How long are we to go on in this state, taking 70,000,000 from our soil and casting it to the wind or the waters very year without completely exhausting the great heritage of the uture? Why in Nebraska if the state treasurer gets away with a mall part of this sum we go after him and give the governer a hance to pardon him. Don't you think that future generations will hink, and have a right to think, that the governor should have had chance at us too? This is a matter for serious consideration by the state and by the nation as well. We cannot go on robbing the soil in this way. Pe future has a certain inalienable right to the fertility that is in that 1. We think we own land, but a warranty deed can never give us more than a life use of the land we call our own. The further use of it belongs to ture. We received it in trust for the great unborn future, and it is our duty, and it should be our highest privi re. to transmit that trust unimpaired to the future and we must it. This process of soil robbery must be arrested at any cost, for it threatens the prosperity of the state and it imperils the happiness and welfare of our children and our children's children Agriculture is the basis of all our life. It feeds and it clothes the world, and without it the world would go naked and starve. If agriculture should cease in a short time every other form of activity ndustrial, commercial or social, would fail for want of sustenance Th€ r forms of activity are very useful and are very conven- ient and are very helpful, but at the last extremity of life we can Et along without them. We can do without the teacher, the doctor ! lawyer, the preacher, or any other of the professions, but we must ve agriculture because we must eat in order to live. It is the one indispensable calling on the face of the earth. The prosperity of a nation depends upon agriculture and if this is true of the nation at large, it is peculiarly true of Nebraska for this is an agricultural state. We have practically no mines and no forests. The soil is our only resource. The question then of maintaining the fertitlity of the soil becomes the greatest economic problem now before the people of r state. We have other problems grave enough, but this problem keeping undiminished the capacity of the earth to yield its increase romes the master proDlem of them all, because it underlies them all. Gentlemen, the dairy cow, with the cream separator and the hog as accessories, solves that problem. There are other methods of solu </seg>

In pure utter fat there is absolutely nothing that came from the soil. It is irated sunshine and air. In exporting it. you export othing from the soil, yc.u just give the outside world a taste of what ebrarka sunshine and air are like.

Scientific men may point s the way but gentlemen, the practical solution of this question has ot to lie with the man who is next to the soil, the man who knows hat the smell of fresh turned earth is like and lov. I am asked sometimes what will the world do for its supply of ereals for food if farmers market nothing but live stock and dairy roducts?

Member Bowers: I believe the subject which Professor Hunt las taken up is one that immediately concerns us all. The people rom the East are observant of certain wasteful methods which our ebraska farmer sometimes practices. The time is coming in raska when with farm land worth from $100 to $200 per acre, that ( will have to put a stop to the wasteful methods. There is no ques - on of doubt that you can't get something for nothing and if you xpect to maintain the fertility of the soil you certainly must put omething back. Reading lately in one of our papers I noticed that he commissioner of agriculture in New York state made this state - ment: That between tne ytais INSn and 1IM the depreciation in arm vahus amounted to $1&lt;8, 000,000. .Vow we in Nebraska at the ■t tint are en the up grade in farm values.

This is no dry subject and 1 believe Proft ssor Melick this morn - ng in handling those slides, told us to take the lid o!f; now we don't ake the lid off in Lincoln. But the fact stands that that is one of the best methods of maintaining the fertility of the soil, tnrough the dairy ow and incidentally the hog. This question is vital and 1 believe that topic arc coming to realize i». They are commencing to get manure &gt;rea&lt;!ers in large numbt is.

Prof. Hill: I am from Illinois. Some time ago I was at the tate university. I called on Dr. Hopkins, who is, I believe, the lead - ng soil specialist in our experiment stations. I bad quite a long onversation with him and got some very new ideas. One of the hings that Dr. Hopkins had been advocating for Illinois and similar ocations is a system of grain farming without cattle, contrary to our dairy principles. He has the figures at hand so that he can explain and prove to a person that the supplemental source of food is the </seg>
            <seg id="p054">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 53 oM; that the animals are not producers of food, but that they are merely transformers of food and therefore the cow, the steer and the og cannot render to the human being that which the soil produced riginally because in working up that food and transferring it to the nimal. some of that food and a good deal of it, is wasted by not eing properly digested. He says that these animals waste from three - ourths to four-fifths of that matter in the process of digestion. Now, I anticipate that you are likely to read some of tl he dairy papers, and it may be possible you are not converted to what 'rofessor Hunt has been telling you here, therefore I take this mo - ment to give you another explanation of this. Dr. Hopkins' reasoning nd deductions are merely on paper and in figures. He has sort of aken it for granted that the American is going to subsist on ke some of the Asiatics do. That would be the greatest food produc - ng product of the soil. Perhaps next to rice come potatoes. Now. radically, we could figure out on paper that in that way the farmer •ould be producing the greatest amount of human food to the soil nd therefore economically he would be fulfilling h,s duty the best. Ve would not take into consideration the practical fact that America nd Europe were not subsisting on a vegetarian diet alone, and that is hy I believe our dairy farms will continue to thrive because we must lave a large proportion of our food in an animal form. Dr. Allway: Last year we had some very interesting data rought from the University of Illinois, which caused us considerable isturbance. because it was strictlv scientific subject and of in' &gt; us as experiment station men. We can imagine that some tin he not distant future our descendants will bo reduced to such a state, lthough it is entirely improbable, that they will be unable to eat meat &gt;roducts and at that time it will be extremely interesting to consider low they can get along without them. Professor Hopkins" idea is lat there are a great many men who do not wish to go into the dairy usiness and do not wish to keep cattle, but that they do wish to aise grain and he is advocating a system by which they can do this ithout depleting the soil. It is not a thing that we can arrive at at le present time as well as we can the other. Mr. I). C. Lyon: In Southern Ohio after we quit letting the straw &gt;ile rot down in the field after the stock had run round it a little in he winter time we adopted the system as recommended by Professor Hunt here, of hauling it and putting it in the barn lot and allowing he stock to work over it, the growing stock, not necessarily the dairy toek. We have had less of fertilizers to buy in the last few years. Ve are now frequently able to sow the field of wheat without the use f commercial fertilizer.

Land is like a machine. You have got to put in something n order to keep taking something out of it. You can't run a cotton - mill without putting in raw maerial; you can't run a shoe-factory without putting in raw material; no more can you proceed year after ear to take crops out of your land without putting something back. And it is fortunate for Nebraska that that scientific fact has been dis - overed in time and before our soils have become exhausted and we would be forced to pay the penalty. Gentlemen, let us by all means, f we do not do another thing, make ourselves realize day by day and year by year that this question of conservation of soil fertility is the biggest question before the farmers in this country today. (Applause.* Professor Hill (of Chicago 1'niversity ) : i have been extremely nterested in the entire discussion this afternoon and particularly in he most striking and strong presentation of this vital question which •rofessor Hunt has given us. 1 tnink there is no possibility of exag - gerating tne importance of this subject and the thing which I wish o add to the discussion this afternoon is this: That in all the older ommunities, in all the older parts of this country, the time has come when we have to look after these problems. The question with you 8 whether you will wait till you are absolutely forced to it or whether you have intelligence enough to control, and ability enough to do, the hing while it is easy. Will you wait till you are absolutely driven or will you go on robbing your soil, exhausting your resources, which nature has lavished upon you, until you can no longer make your iving?

Now, during the past year I have been very much interested in •coming acquainted with these little fellows that we can't ses with he naked eye in the soil, and I have been more and more convinced lat these little fellows — we ought to cultivate their acquaintance nd find out just exactly how we can assist them to do their work. ow, we have found out this: that perhaps more than almost any other lace in the I'nited States, that here in Nebraska we have natural con - ltions that make it so happy for these little fellows to live and do it ir work; that perhaps we are more favored than most people that e can set the machine going at full speed pretty readily. And this ear I have come across some very interesting things. I did not hear he address of my friend. Professor Hunt, but I know the kind of ddresses he gives and 1 have been to my good friend Regent Whit - ore's place and ft en the big results of what he has done with the use f manure, but all that these good people can do is just to assist i ittle fellows that are hidden in the ground to do their work. And hen we do that, when we are co-operative instead of interferers with atural law. why we will succeed, and that is all we have to do, to get land in hand with nature. Now. when a man lets his manure pile uild up in one plan . or burns over his stubble or destroys his straw nd things of that kind, he is destroying that which will supply the Mary material to put countless millions of the little fellows at ork. that will assist him in making fertility. If you can get in tune ith this kind of thing as you walk round over your field — remember hat the little fellows that are hidden away there if you will feed hem and make things happy for them and pleasant — that they are ust waiting, just anxious to do the work that God said that they hould do. After all, farming, the real science of farming, is to go land in hand with nature, and what happier life can we carry? What reatt r joy can we have in this world than to be assistants in God's reat laboratory? We will get material recompense, gentlemen, lots f it. but think of the other recompense that comes to us in the joy f being assistants rather than interferers with the great natural &lt; lit me that Cod runs this universe upon. I was deeply impressed last night in listening to Professor Hill's ddress; he advanced some splendid ideas and I want to say right lere. if we could just live along the lines that he suggested and seek -operate with nature, and when we haul out on our fields manure hat we have an object in doing it, that we are doing it because nature emands that we shall do it to accomplish certain things.

'he fact that he has left his great business in Omaha and has come nd is attending the sessions of the week in these meetings getting cquainted with the work of the university and is here this afternoon, hows his interest, and 1 feel as though I would like to have you, Mr. President, and the assembled body, meet Mr. Haller of Omaha, who omes, I am glad to say. with Mr. Coupland and myself to attend the meetings of organized agriculture. Regent Haller: I want to say that I have great pleasure in being tere because I am interested in what you are doing from two points f view: One is because I represent a wholesale implement house, nd it makes me smile every time you mention manure spreader (ap - lause), but more particularly for its ereat importance to the com - munity in general. My attention was first drawn to the question of soil conservation and the work that the agricultural colleges and the experiment sta - ions were doing, by the fact that I was fortunate enough or unfortu - nate enough, rather, to be on the finance committee of the National Corn Association and it was my business to help raise the money for he exposition and also to raise the premium list for two years. I was perfectly amazed and astonished to Irani how much had &gt;een accomplished in a few years by the Iowa people in raising the yield of corn per acre. Professor HoWlen's work was first called to our attention, but when I found that by a little bit of study and follow - ng the advice of the agricultural college people that the farmers of llinois and of Iowa had within five years raised the average yield. I &gt;elieve, of corn per acre. 7 bushels, and when I thought that we were an average of 1(1 or 13 bushels, I don't know just exacuy how much, behind Iowa and Illinois, on land that is I think the superior of any - uing in the world for the raising of corn. I conceived the idea that anything that a city man could do to help the thing along was good. So I went out among the men in the city and I said. "Here. I suggest that we do something for the farmers" instead of as heretofore we lave said to the farmers, "Here, come in and let's see what we can do </seg>

You can mould the opinion of many, hold up the standard of dairying in the clear light of cold, hard facts, and encourage the practice of dairying along right lines. You, 1 believe, have recognized that to do this requires knowledge, and the inspiration of that unity of thought and purpose epitomized in suih a gathering as is now be- fore me. To get this knowledge and this inspiration you have come andar uere, an previous addresses and the in- terest showr t come n vain.

From the cheaper ands of the west to the older, more densely settled portions of the east le same thought is quite pronounced. Breeders of pure bred beef trains, the only ones who can get returns on high priced lands at nt market prices for his product, are seriously considering the •reeding of pure bred dairy cattle. The demand for male sires of the K&gt;ef breeds has fallen off, and it is not uncommon to see a dozen or more mature bulls offered for sale, where once they were picked up lmost as quickly as they were born. Everywhere throughout thestate lere is a demand for dairy bred cattle, both pure bred and grades, demand which is indicative of the puhe of ■ people who are begin - ing to see the light of dairy possibilities undiminished by any shadow f that otuer industry which has. not only in this state but other tatts. attempted to throttle, by fair means or foul, the interests rep - el by tin members of this association. Ifrnrrance of dairy possibilities and dairy practice in some parts r this state is. to me. amazing. At one place when I spoke of milking le dairy cows over ifiO days in the year the question was raised as to ne hralthfulniES of such milk for human consumption. The people of a. Via are sat sfieti with cows, many of wnicn do not yield one undred pounds of buttenat during the year. i ney are satisfied to uy what an known as Iowa dairy cows. The fact of the matter is hat these so-railed Icwa dairy cows are i.ie cows now being eliminated &gt;y the Iowa farmers who are fast getting pure breu dairy stock. They. le people of Iowa, no longer are content with a cow which produces paltry 140 lbs. of but.terfat. and are willing to stock our Nebraska arms with three boarder cows. An improvement over our own stock, ou say. but what a small gain. Such advance along dairy Urn ike attempting to cut down a full grown oak with a pen knife. As to icir fitness tor the work of producing butterfat cheaply, and educat - ag the people up to the possibilities of profitable dairying by use of le dairy cow, they are as useless as a barrel of sand in making a ope, each strand of which must do its part in bearing the strain put pon it. Whin I see our people in Nebraska trying through the use f beef breeds to produce cream 1 invariably think of a sign hanging p in the office of our worth commissioner which reads thus: "Don't saw wood with a hammer.' The people of Nebraska have got to learn that they, if they are to - succeed in the dairy business, must use those breeds of cows which are the products of the best thought of hard-headed farmers of past centuries. This change may be slow, but it is the inevitable result of competition which ever becomes closer and keener. It is our purpose </seg>
            <seg id="p062">TWENTY-FIFTH ANM AL CONVENTION 61 f to hasten this day, and the work of tais association in the spread of dairy knowledge will from now on meet in the future with more ready acceptance at the hands of the people than heretofore. Now is the time to strike a body blow to this uncouth, ungainly, paralyzing crea ture, "Ignorance of Dairy Possibilities and Practice," which stalks abroad throughout this state mis-directing the efforts of an intelligent people who are striving to reach the higher plane of intelligent farm practi To make our effort more effective we must have unity of purpose and harmony of ideas. Whether we are connected with a large or small plant, as manager, superintendent, or operator or in any way connected with the dairy business, directly or indirectly we have one common fight nd, one common platform, and that is the ncouragement of better dairy practice and the clearing away the mists of ignorance wnich becloud the minds of our people. Let us unfurl the banner "Nebraska for Dairying" and marching with brave front over- come the forces that are opposed to us. 1 believe that in the past. we were inclir irink within ourselves, or leave it to the other fellow. Very excellent work has been done by the few while the many were content to stand aside and watch the battle. Each individual here before me should go forth and boost for dairying. All are needed by each one In this connection, and I speak more particularly to operators of cream buying stations, makers in creameries anu those who come in direct contact with the people, there is a vast need for information along dairy lines. In tne matter of sanitation there is no use in calling for cleanly methods in the handling of cream on the farm if the r ceiving station under unsanitary conditions. I have been in. am stations where floor was clean, glassware was clean, tinware bright and shining and everytning in first class condition. I have also been in stations where I was actually ashamed that I was a dairyman. You say that in these stations that the cream did not come in contact with this dirt, which was very true, nevertheless, there cannot be the least question of a doubi. that the condition of the station or creamery which comes under the observation of the producer is a very large factor in the production of good cream and eventually good butter. little elbow grease on the handle of a floor broom is often a very ective lesson to prospective customers. What is true of sanitary conditions is also true of the knowledge fthe possibilities of dairying in general. with her 600.000 milch ws Nebraska now stands tenth place as a dairy state. The value of dairy products during the past year amounted to nearly $40,000,000. « ithout .ncreasing the number by a single cow this amount could ?asny be doubled. By juoicious breeding, feeoing and weeding the output per cow could easily be raised to 250 pounds of butterfat per cow. Nebraska is essentially a dairy state. Corn and alfalfa, the desire and dream of the dairyman, are here in abundance. There is </seg>

As a matter of fact, the production of fat per cow under average arm conditions are but estimates. There is need for more light on his point. We are forced to go to other states for most of our infor - mation as to data concerning production. This association could not o better than to urge upon the legislature to provide sufficient funds o encourage the organization of a few cow testing associations pro - nicci the information as to cost and production become available to his association. If that is not possible each member of this associa - ion who is situated that he could do so could encourage one man to a record of his cows. If each station operator could so arrange t the results would be of immense value to the dairy interests.

These could be t. &gt;y the operator who could make out one report for the patron and ne for the association.

The nformation gltaned in this way would astonish the people and rouse hem out of that sleep of indifference which keeps them in bondage. I believe also there is need for further assistance to our dairy Mtmiasfcmer. The men under his employ are far too few to I he &lt;!eu:an&lt;;.s of the work they are called upon to do. There is a f going past our stations and creameries if our golden butter product of Nebiaska's fields and meadows, is to be up to the standard which this association desires. Laws must be made and enfi \hich will rtach production and care of cream on the farm. In the rovince where I was born a force of thirty instructor-inspectors are t work. Their duty is to inspect creameries and cheese factories, but t gm.i further. The law provides for the prosecution of car* irty conditions of the farm. They first point out, on first visit, i -Ih;ii1,1 lie made and if action does no follow pn - inn will. 1 believe in education, but I want it backed up by the trong arm of the law. Every advance along sanitary lines has he result of law and law enforced. The percentage of people who are areless and indifferent in the handling of dairy product is small. Vhy should the better class suffer? 1 believe it the uuty of the members of this association to create a. sentiment favorable for the passage of legislation to provide our ■ommissioner with a force of at least twenty men to enforce such aws as are now on the statute book. Further, these laws should !&gt;•■ supplemented by other laws which will result in placing our dairy •roduets beyond the suspicion of a doubt as to their suitability as a ood for the human body.

This could &gt;e done during the four summer months at which time the ten.pera - ure conditions are most favorable for producing cream of poor qual - ty. In looking over the history of this association, I believe that at ne time the grading of cream was strongly urged as a solution of the uality question. In theory this ought to have worked out, in actual ractice it was a failure. The only other solution is, as I have men - ioned before, education backeu up by the strong arm of the law. Better railway facilities might for some points still be proti' I would desire at this time to draw the attention of this associa - tion to certain, salient features in the present dairy situation. They are as follows: The time for the propagation and extension of dairy knowl - ge has never been more favorable than at the pr&lt; sent time. t2nd. The need of harmony and unity of thought and endeavor the stimulation and encouragement of better dairy practice, in the lection, breeding and feeding of dairy cows. 3rd. The need of realiable information as to the production per cow under average Nebraska farm conditions. 4th. The cultivation of sentiment favorable to such legislation as shall raise the standard of dairy practice in this state. t'.th. The strengthening the hands of our commissioner by pro - ding more assistance to do the work he is called upon to do and iforce such laws as may be hereafter provided. In conclusion I wish as a member of this association, endeavoring o extend dairy knowledge in the state, to express my appreciation of he work of Prof. Haecker of the university for the work he has done. There are few men who can step into a dairy barn and say, here, out of so many cows ten will average over 50u pounds of butterfat. Still, ewer are those who can produce a Katie Oerben. His work in the building up of the dairy here at the farm has been an inspiration to us all, and an encouragement to every one who has the dairy interests of this state at heart. Through his influence and leadership the dairy nterests, supported by other large sou led, brainy men, has now be - ome a full grown industry. The early work of this association is beginning to bear fruit. Twenty-five years of patient earnest endeavor nas seen a vast change; may the next twenty-five show a record qual to those which have just passed. The President: I know that Prof. Bower's experience in other airy sections of this country has given him pretty broad views, but would like to hear, as we have the time this morning, some discus - ion on the points that Prof. Bower brought out. It seems to me we annot let it go by, and we ought to be able to bring out some thoughts along this line that will help us all. Mr. J. D. Ream: For the benefit of myself and a few others, we want to have the experience of some dairymen to tell us their method </seg>
            <seg id="p065">64 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION t securing the right kind of a dairy cow, and for the building up of a iry herd. The most economical and best methods of securing a od herd. bThe President: That is a question perhaps that is asked the it by men who really wish to improve their herds. Who will lure to give us an answer? Mr. Roberts: There are many dairies around us here in this ounty and a great many of them are disposing of their calves. I have seen on the other hand some who are picking up now and then one of htse calves. I am in the milk business, and 1 cannot afford to keep my calves because we will soon have too many. I think there is a plendid opportunity for somebody who will pick up these calves from tie dairymen and take care of them until they mature and ascertain what they are worth, if they are best fitted for breeding, especially ' it is of a particular grade. I will agree to give all my calves to uch person, at a very reasonable price. They will undoubtedly pro - uce more than the average dairy cow. It should be their effort to secure heifers. 1 think with some little investigation along that me, we might all have a chance to improve our own herds. I believe we could raise a few of the best ourselves. Then, after you get heifers, the most important part in starting ut right to build up your herd, is to get a good dairy bull. He must be produced along right lines. He should have a dam that showed er ability at the pail and churn. Not only the dam, but the grand - am also, all along down the line. A great many people make the serious mistake in starting out, by not getting the right kind of a sire. [« is half of the herd. You must have a sire that has a backing t hind him. a sire that has been bred along the right line. That is the nly way you will evi r establish a good herd. A cheap sire and one hat has not a good record behind him, better be dispense! with at ho start. A Member: The Eabcock test and the testing of every cow's milk surely is another of the best ways of building up our herd. In hat way we can ascertain what each cow is doing, whether she is roving profitable or not. I believe in ge'ting a good start in the matter of the selection of our cows as another mtans of building up ur herd. I believe every man and number here appreciates the ini - ortance of thise things. I would like to reply to the question asked. 1 have thought more bout the inquiry, whether it would be profitable to go into the airy sections of Iowa and buy up some heifer calves. My judgment would be that while they would have to become acclimated, whether hey would be free from tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is generally import - ed into our state and these calves might not be free from it. There would be a danger encountered in regard to buying heifer calves of men selling milk. There are men who go into the market for cows, nd feed them heavily as long as they give a good quantity of milk, </seg>
            <seg id="p066">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 65 and then -dispose of them. You should know when purchasing the calves where they came from. I think the only safe way would be to get as good a cow as you could get in your locality and then to get the right kind of a sire. It is not long to wait until you wilt know whether the calf is likely to prove a profitable cow or not. I think that is the only practical way in which to get a good dairy herd. tThe President: I believe that on account of tuberculosis, gentle - n here should take care in regard to bringing cows in from another te. Prof. Little, what is your opinion on this subject? Prof. Little: 1 think there is only one way to get a good dairy i rd. and that is to go at it systematically and work up to a paying usiness gradually. For instance, in Douglas county, the producers' ssociation will begin on the first cf March, a cow contest associa - ion. The design is to have Prof. Haecker send us a man who can ake charge of the work of supervising it. There are some twenty - ve dairymen in this contest. The herd will be tested under the upervision of this man to be sent by Prof. Haecker. He will visit ach herd once a month, test the cows, neigh the milk and mark heir record. In that way we expect to find the good cows in each of he twenty-five herds. We will then know which the poor cows are. "he poor cows will be shipped and the good cows kept, an 1 in that way our herds will be improved. Feeding is a viry important part of the dairyman's work, and knowledge. In fact, I think it is as im - portant as breeding. I think we should save the young stock. It fs impossible to find good dairy stock at the present time. On the mar - krt at Chicago, you will find almost any class of cows selling around $80, from that to {inn and $120. If you go to men in this businea* who handle dairy cattle for the trade, you will have to pay |7~&gt; per head for a car load and let him pick them out from what he has to sell. If you select your own cows , you will have to pay much more, jod milch cows at the present time, •d them. (Jet a good sire and save So it is almcst impossible to buy g and the only proper way is to brei all heifer calves. The President: I th.nk Prof say for him that he went clear to for cows and it took a lot of time. . Little struck the keynote. 1 will ■i\ of New York state looking II.' found in sections, where they had the most dairy cows, that there was the place where they were the highest, because they knew what a good dairy cow was worth. 1 will saw as far as Douglas county is concernel. that the dairy - len there have started something that will help to solve .the great uestion, how to get good profitable dairy iowj. Those in the dairy usiness there are going ta stait up a testing association. It will be lie first one established in the sta'e of Nebraska; the first one in his western country, as far as tfcat goes, and there will be a goodly umber of herds in it. We are going to- have some data that will be f great value. It is equally possible to double the production of our </seg>
            <seg id="p067">66 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION rs by a little better method of feeding, and a little better method selection. A Member: I started out four years ago. I went out and bought ock cows. I paid as high as $40 apiece for them. For two years e worked on the farm, me and my hired man, to get the best results. 'inally I said we would test these 18 cows and see what they are oing for us and find out where we are. To our surprise two of those ows that we thought were the best only tested — one of them 2.38 per ent and the other 2.40 per cent. We figured out what those cows ere making and ascertained that it took both of those cows to make dollar a week. t Another little bit of a skinny cow we didn't think much of, we nd was making $2.20 a week. So I believe the only way to get at at our cows are producing is to test them and in that way learn at they are doing. tMr. Elliott: There is no better foundation for a dairy herd than i so-called native cow. She is acclimated and hardy, she is or was in 1 early days, a good milker and if properly mated and developed uld in a few generations be the ideal dairy cow of the plains. A serious mistake is made in all lines of breeding in not persist - ently following the same breeds. We too often use in succession males of different breeds in the vain hope that we can combine in one animal the good qualities of all the breeds, instead thereof we lose the good and perpetuate the undesirable. It is said that the "Male is half the breed"; intensely bred he is much more, he will be prepotent to a degree superior to females with whom he is mated and from him during one season we have a number of progeny instead of only one as from the female. tit is a mistake to breed from a young bull. Many of the best our sires are sacrificed just when approaching their greatest use - lness. Make a personal selection — do not buy anything under two years old. and one can often gt t an aged bull that has been tested, at a tempt - ng price; see his (iam. Is she a good producer and perfect in form •nd udder? If possible see his grand-dam, pedigree is a good thing when combined with a good individual. Bear in mind that a sire is more apt to reproduce the defects of his ancestry than their good qualities. When the young thing is born we only have the foundation of the cow that is to be. It is born with great possibilities by inheritance, but bad management will dwarf those possibilities while care and in - telligence will develop them. Never keep a delicate calf. It is handicapped from birth. In line of building up a great digestive capacity a strong, rugged frame and vigorous body. In dairying, as in most other occupations, suc - cess follows persistent, intelligent effort. While failure is assured by following the lines of the least resistance. </seg>

Bouska Mr. President and Gentlemen: I rejoice in this privilege of peaking to you on this subject and getting it started. Next to being great man, perhaps, is to stand in a great man's shoes. I am a great eal like a preacher who said that he took for his sermon wh;u le Lord told him or put in his mouth when he spoke, and that he epended upon the Lord for whatever he had to say. I was informed y telegram one or two days ago that I was expected to say something pon this subject at this time. Since thin 1 have been riding on the rain and away from home most of the time and I shall have to depend pon what I know and cannot tell you anytiiing I don't know. ( Laugh- Oleomargerine legislation had its impetus or revival about ten ears ago. At that lime the National Dairy I'nion wa3 organized and made a strong effort to secure desirable legislation. This effort wa» uccessful in securing the present oleomargt rine law. The ess f this federal law was a ten cent tax on colored oleomargerine. a tax f one-fourth of a cent a pound upon uncolored and a clause that made lie party liable only where the coloring was done with the intent to efraud. That was not in the original bill, but the fight to put it here was a very hard one and sonic concessions had to be made, enator Foraker succeeded in getting this clause through. The authors f this bill were the dairymen. It was worded from the dairymen's tandpoint. About two months ago at a meeting of the National Dairy 'nion. held at Washington. President Taft assured our representatives hat there would be no change in this law without the dairymen being uly notified and given proper opportunity of presenting their case and having a hearing before any change was made. tHe said that he was aware that this law was the dairymen's law d for that rt asm no change would be mait unless the dairymen were tified of it. This is an important point to bear in mini when we me to consider the way this law has been enforced. Ltt us inquire for a moment into the eft ■ of this law. </seg>
            <seg id="p069">68 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION will present some facts that 1 have observed. Let us make the trip rom the part of Chicago where I live to the office where I do business, * distance of about six milts. At the time that the price of butter began to go upward there appeared very conspicuous signs in the mall grocery windows here and there and sometimes a butcher would xhibit a number of large attractive signs. Isusually they were "Reg - ular sixty pound butter tubs with signs around on all sides of them eading like this: "Minnf sola butter. IS cents a pounds"; "Illinois Dairy. .:! cent* a pound'; "Iowa Dairy, 21 cents a pound." Sometimes rocerynen would have butter from other states such as Wisconsin, Ohio and Indiana, making up a variety of prices the highest being bout from two to four cents lower than the wholesale price of good utter in Chicago, and then th.se other prices gradually grading down. li.se grades of butter were not known to the commercial trade; they ere made for that special purpose. Often some of that product ould be exhibited. That would be another indication that would roust- suspicion— a number of rolls of butter all the same size, same olpr. gotten up in the same way. We all know that you cannot get number of rolls of dairy butter and have any kind of uniformity o them. Anyone observing wou.d notice the label left on the tub with ist enough of it left so that you could inspect Mm label. This took lace all ov. r the city. To Mill further impress upon me the importance of this policy, he city of Chicago is very large and extends for a number of miles, rom where I was living away on the south side to the a ntral part of if tit y i-.ud extends some sixteen miles further westward and north - ard. As 1 eaid. 1 observed a number of groceries scatter. J all through he city, although there are large department groceries that are natur - lly patronised a great dtal by everyljoly. the small grocery is able to -s when ver there are a number of dwelling hous. i. because le will forget to buy something down town ami tiny will then go &gt; a small grocery and buy batter. There are a number of small roceri.s scattered throughout the city. You »ee by this how difficult to in any way control the sale of oleomargarine in that way where winning to sell it all through these large districts. Another evidence of the increasing sile of oleomargarine is in hat I hav. had to .at at the various places where 1 have gotten meals uring the last lew week.-;. I have been traveling through Kansas, :ado and festers Nebraska. I believe the best place was at Con - ordia. Kansas. In one of the bes-t hotels, Abilene, they are. serving leomargarine. That was right here in the west among the farmers nd producers. These are facts that I have observed myself and it is long with other evidences that the eale and consumption of oleomar - arine has been increasing greatly this fall. When the price of butter began to mount upward there came an inquiry to the butter wholesalers nd joblers in Chicago for oleomargarine from m» n who were not andling it at that time and it was said tint a great many people </seg>
            <seg id="p070">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIAL CONVENTION 69 wanted to buy oleomargarine instead of butter. They made inquiry about it of grocers and then grocers tried to buy it from the jobbers where he was accustomed to get his main supplies; that is, these wholesale dialers in dairy products in Chicago seem to be the regular channel n of the product. That ;3 the reason the grocer looks to them. As a result of the inquirers, wholesalers and jobbers began to handle oleomargarine. This will give you some indication of how the oleomargarine law has not been very effective. Let us inquire a little here why it has not been effective. There are tw asms for it. In regard to the coloring of the butter, it is y to prove the indention to defraud in the coloring of oleomar- garine in order to show or prove a trespass of the law. This has been the la a great many acquittals in oleomargarine trials as bees the authorship of the law and the way be administered. It is the dairymen's law — the national dairy union, of various dairy interests was its author. The people in Ne- braska Iowa and other of the producing statt s were the onti mostly interestt 1. This law is expected to operate mostly in 'he large cities such as Chicago, New York. Pitteburg and Boati n. and not so much out here in the west btrau.se hen we have mostly producers. It is to operate in the localities where consumers are. Like t very other law the accused has the right of trial by jury. The jurymen will be chosen from t tizens of that city. They are the consumers of butter and oleoni arine and they are going t render a decision from the con sumers' standpoint. Thertfore. I say if we art to have the most efficient law we will have to have a law that is framed from the con- and not like the present one. You would like to w have your industry protnted but you cannot have it protected by a court tter consumers. They will have to have a law framed from their view point. The question then before us i What sh Id be the real purpose of such a law? Should it be to pro tect the dairyn able them to make more money than they would make otherwise, or to prott rt the consumer so that he could get what he asks for; and, in that way, let the dairy business, the cattle and margarine business stand upon their own actual ni» rit. If we had the case right here among the dairymen we might be enabled to enfor aw, but you cannot do it. You have to depead upon the court and jurynun in large cities where they are made up of butter consume enforce the law. That is the fact, and you cannot get away from it. 1 think there has been too much of a dispo the part of dairymen to get clannish and to take views that sitior are simply beneficial for the dairymen's interests. There have been some bat things said against the Internal Revenue department, and. I feel in some casts, without sufficient inquiry into the actual facts. The Internal Revenue department has charge of the enforcement of the present oleomargarine law, the law has been ineffective, and therefore, a great many have claimed that the Internal Revenue department is to Anotl it has t( </seg>

The Internal Revenue department says that hey have more difficulty with the oleomargarine law than any other aw; that half of its force is engaged upon the oleomargarine law and he other half engaged upon all the other laws that the Internal Reve - nue department has to deal with. The law has been the source of a great deal of financial loss in many ways to the department because hey have to carry on all inspection and trials, and carry on all these irosecutions. The Internal Revenue department claims that they are not a police department for the enforcing of laws, but that they are a Revenue collecting department. One reason why they have not shown fmuch intertst in enforcing the oleomargarine law is because the venue from the uneolored product is only one-fourth of a cent a pound; and there is very little to be claimed by bringing an action for the enforcement of this law with a number of small groceries •i.:l all through the little nooks and out-of-the-way places in large eitie*. It is easy to enforce a law like this where it applies to large establishments, and there is no great difficulty in enforcing this fw right at the oleomargarine factory. They are usually large ones ill &lt;asy to find, but there are very few of them in the whole country, le difficulty has been in getting at the trouble after the oleomar- garine leaves these factories. After it leaves the factories it scatters all through the large citus. to the eating places and to the groceries and retailers, and to those who want to make greatest profits. Now and then a person is found out, tried and perhaps convicted airl put at the business. Pretty soon another man is attracted by the po£3i- bilities of making money and he goes into it. so there is a constant "Topping out of these cases here and there.

The idea of different ways of coloring their product, of putting it up in a certain kind of package, in a certain Shape, and shipping it in a certain way with a certain brand or stamp; all these have for their purpose a spirit of avoiding this ditficulty with mall dealer so as to have that product put up in these original packages at the big factories We have vi ry stringent laws governing the sale of origiml pack- ages that would have a tenclen, y to do away a great deal with the r kulty of the tale of oleomargarine at the little plat 11 is customary in me. tines of this kind to pass resolutions on the oleomargarine qucstioa. That has been done at a great many dairy meetings of various kinds. There could have been great im provement made in such resolutions. It is cus'omary. or rather, it rally happens, that in meetings like these, there is a large number dairymen assemble! and there is no lack of dairy feeling and en- thusiasm on tills subject. Resolutions are drafted to give the radical expression of the dairymen's union; and they are drawn up in a short time and usually passed by a unanimous vote, by accla- </seg>

The result is that utions are radical and do not quite agree, •an be asked for. The result of They ask for the utmost limit that his has been that they don't quite all agree. Some ask for a some - what different thing than others, besides, the wrong impression is given in being too specific and in asking for exactly a certain tax on a ertain color, they impose upon legislative bodies, the duty of doing ust that one thing. It takes away from the legislative body the zeroise of their judgment and gives the impression that the legisla - ors have not as good judgment as they have, or the men who elected hem, and that they have to give them instructions what to do. There is a great danger in making such resolutions too specific. think the best way is to make the wording of such resolutions in uch a way that they would be asking for the main thing — for in - tance, a law that would prevent fraud upon the consumers, and not o say just exactly what kind of a law it should be. We do not know li the details of enforcing these laws and the difficulties that may &gt;e encountered, as you have seen. It is true, it is desirable for the airymen to pass such a rt solution, but my advice has been upon the way such resolutions have been worded, that they should be worded in general way so that when a number of such resolutions get into a egislative body they will appear more uniform; they will be appar - ntly asking for the same thing and agreeing upon it, and will not be iving the impression of instructing those legislators just exactly what they ought to do. Another way la by common education. In this move the oleomar - arine interests have preceded us. This past fall a number of very ttractive articles have appeared in the St. Louis papers. I'sually this rticle occupies about a column, very well written and telling how lean and wholesome oleomargarine was and so on, and showing the dvantages of oleomargarine. It told of all the evils of butter, how ear it was, about the dairymen's trust for the purpose of boosting he price of butter, of the filth and disease germs that butter harbors ■ — everything that could be said and done to prejudice the consumer against butter and all that could be said in favor of oleomargarine. Nothing has been done to off-set this by dairy people. These articles in the St. Louis papers were paid articles. We have had some experience from the dairy standpoint in at - empting to have articlts published in big Chicago papers. It is easy o have something published in small citits and towns: those papers Ten solicit your publications. Not so with large influential papers in arge cities. It is difficult to have an article published in those papers. t must be something startling, or else be paid for. In the case of many large papers in big cities there are certain interests who. in some way, patronize them with big paid advertisements and they succeed n getting articles printed while others from a general standpoint rd and are published in the daily public*- </seg>

The past season has proved without question that a person will take better care of his own personal property than he will of a borrowed article, ■ ially when the article is a cream can and when it is so easily borrowed. This law has also induced creamery companies to equip their stations so cream cans may be cleansed. By these improvements they have added very much to the Eanitary condition of their cream stations. I venture to state that a greater average of No. 1 but'er and less of No. 2 was manufactured by the creameries this past year than during any preceding year. I give the greater part of the credit for this excellent result to th's can law In June we issued three bulletins on various points of interest to the dairy industry; one to the cream patrons, one to the cream operators and one on sampling and testing.

THE SILO Prof. A. I Haecket The silo is not an experiment Twenty-five years ago its use was id of preserving stock food. Since ant of new findings so much as we farm of the things already known. t we have more of them? This is ist confess is a difficult matter. It ensilage has no market quotation ound to be a good economic mrthu oday in our rural affairs for the wi re for the simple application on the f the silo is a good thing, why don he question, and to answer it I mu lay he due in part to the fact tiiat nd therefore of no commercial vah; ) kno« that here is a farm produci rtat market..; of this country bought e. It certainly is a happy thought t Hat can not bt cornered. If the an 1 Bold msilage as they do wheat t nd corn. I am sure there wr.uld be move sil&lt; s on the farms than there re today. A farm* r or a man in business must have a base of values n Iks crops or waits in order to figure the profits in his undertaking. As the farmer has no market quotation given him for ensilage or gures to base its cost of production, he certainly has a poor oppor - unity to kain the true vah;e of the silo. I therefore believe the best ay to encourage the use of the silo is to teach its value as a food for tock and certainly ascertain the cost of corn ensilage. A ton of good su°"ar beets and a ton of corn ensilage have about the same feeding value, as found by six different experiment stations, and. as a ten of beets is valued at about five dollars, we have here a value for silage based on sugar beets. As corn ensilage is fed for its roughage and for the amount of digestible carbohydrates it con- tains, it can be so compared with differ* nt kinds of forage. A ton of clover hay. on this basis, is worth about three tons of corn ensilage. and a ton of clover hay is worth from $10 to $16. This gives us an- other comparison, and we may say that corn silage is worth from $3.50 to |5.0i per ton. There are other values of corn ensilage which are difficult to measure, but which are true values, nevertheless. These may be t( rmed as succulency, aid to digestion, convenience in feeding soil fertility, economy of storage space, stock carrying capacity of land and keeping quality of the forage The succulent quality of a food is hard to estimate; as, for exam- Value nl Corn K.n»il;iu&lt; </seg>

We are not suffering forty cows at ation. One n an went up into the silo, threw down the ensilage, put it into the feed arrier, and fed forty cows in thirty- five minutes. To feed the same fodder corn required two men and a team one and a quarter he arc where they had to go to the field and got the fora haul it in, and throw it into the it k. yard or rack. When we consider t 1ND days of barn feeding, this is a large it i'he economy age for foi er is seldom considered, but at this time of high ilding it is of no small importance. A ton of corn ensilage in a thirty-five ft 3t silo requires about fifty cubic feet ace. while a ton of hay in a mow require* about four hundred cubic feet. This means that hay quires eight times as much space for storage as corn ensilage. Tc ut, cure, and put tame hay into the barn costs about $1.50 per ton, w hile to put corn ensilage into the silo costs about 64 per ton he keeping quality of corn MS lage is another factor which adds to its value, for experiments hav hown that it is good for several rrs after being stored. When we consider all the me of corn ensilage and the present rit prices of foodstuffs, it is safe to plac its value at $6 per ton Cost ol I'rotfucin Corn NiluKc Having given a value to corn e its cost to the farmer, and in compiling the following tables I have beer, obliged to take averages, as no two farmers report the same fig - ures.

That silo held th'ee hundred tons. The material </seg>
            <seg id="p084">TWKXTV-FIFTH ANKl'AI ONVENTION tave silos do blow down, but some of them have blown down two or hree times, but of all the stave silos they have in Iowa, they have had o be put up once. When a stave silo blows over you have the staves ut a great deal additional work. Those who are farming on a per - manent basis 1 would say to you that you should build so that you o not have to do this repair work. If you are building for yourselves r your children do not construct a lumber silo. You should con - truct either a concrete silo or a hollow-tile silo or brick. Where the materials for building the concrete silo are easily available, gravel or rushed stone and sand, where you can get the material at a reason - ble rate, if taere are a number where thev can on-nneratA ««v h«if a number where they can co-operate, say half in that silo did not cost me quite HOO.W0 at that time and the labor was not very neavy. As this silo was in the center of the round barn it fitted into the plan. It was not only easy to build, but we did not have to line the outside of it, that was simple. We constructed the silo as we did the others. From my experience I should say it was probably more economical and more satisfactory to build a stave silo than any other ':ind. The difficulty with stave silos is that in coun- tries that are windy anu where there is a great deal of drought and winu, unless you are very careful with the silos and unless you have them well tightened and bolted down, the silos go down. I know on a number of extensive farms where stave silos have gone over, two went over last year. Both of them were well anchored. One of them was lathed and plastered or cemented on inside. It makes them stronger to be lathed and plastered or cemented, holds them in better shape, but it does not keep them from blowing over. If the staves are allowed to get loose they go over easily, so, unless you are in position to look after your silo carefully, right alon , you may ex- pect it will go over occasionally — if you build a stave silo. At the station in Iowa they tell me of the stave silo record for five years. For five years the silos had blown over on an average of but once in five years, of all the silos they have a record of; that don't mean that all a dozen or ten, the proper silo to build is a concrete silo. I think a c with the present prices of lumber with materials for concrete reason- ably cheap, by co-operation it is possible to build concrete silos as economical as it is to build a lumber silo. If you have to pay twice as much, however, for the concrete as you do for stave silo, or any other form of lumber silo, it will still be as economical because if it is put up right it is there forever. It requires no attention, requires no painting, there is no depreciation on it. I have here a few photographs of concrete silos, also of some tile 8ilos, which I will be pleased to exhibit. would advise you to buiij a stave silo if you cannot get any er. but if you want permanency you will build with concrete or hollow tile. It is not the part of wisdom to build them of any kind of lumber. Of course. I think a stave silo is the best kind of a wooden silo. If you build a modern silo you will construct with water </seg>

It gives plenty f pressure and we haw it conveniently arranged for watering our took and sending the water to the house. If a number of farmers •ere to club together and build the concrete or hollow form silos, you an get a silo frame; it is six feet deep and requires six men on a silo, is 1 s feet in diameter, you can build six feet per day. Kach morn - ng you raise the frame and build another six feet. The cost of the ilo will will be the cost of the material required, the labor of the men for six days with six feet of the silo each day.

We have a silo in ach barn; they are six inches thick all tne way up. Question: I would like to ask in regard to the concrete silo: in severe weather with the mercury down to 10 or 1 r&gt; below zero, how much will ensilage freeze on the inside of a cement silo? r: We have ours arranged so that it does not freeze Question: Do you have any cold weather? Answer: Yes; and we had some of the coldest weather, but here 8 tl&gt;' -I have no picture of it. 1 am sorry to say. We have barn 156 feet long by 40 feet wide and a silo at each end. We have le well at one end of the barn with pipe running right through the &gt;arn up to the silo, which is also a supply pipe for the cattle. (The peaker here described the system he had worked out for protecting is silo from freezing by the use of the warm water pipes) and added hat in that way we have worked out a very satisfactory ventilating n to keep our silage from freezing. t Question: In case where not in position to build both a cement o and a barn, which would you recommend? Answer: If I could have but one I would have the silo. Of ourse. where materials come high and one person has to build one lone, it may come high, but it is the best in the end. I would say hat the size in diameter is not so important. You could build a 12 - oot silo as easily as you could 18 or 20-foot silo.

We have heard today that in the corn stalks of he state, as at present used, forty million dollars' worth of food alue is annually going to waste, food value is going to waste that f used judiciously could be saved and applied to the production of ood that is needed by our fellow men of the towns and cities. Today verywhere we hear of associations being formed pledged to abstain rom the use of meats on account of their excessive, almost prohibi - lve cost, yet we know that as produced, the farmer does not receive ny too much for them. If, however, by the saving of that which is now wasted, and feeding it judiciously, the farmer could sell at a less price and yet receive the same or greater profit. The consumer would receive food at less cost and the producer have an extended market for his product.

Succulent foods are not lily digested but they materially assist in the digestion of the y part of the ration. By siloing the corn crop it is all saved in the best possible shape or feeding to stock. Also we have it in a convenient form for feed - ng; cows can be kept under cover and comfortable, a factor in profit r to be lost sight of in feeding all animals, but especially the airy cow. The silo is a necessity on account of the high price of and. By it the eighty acre farm can be made the equal of the one lundred and sixty acre one, in production. On these corn and alfalfa ands there is hardly a limit to the amount of food that can be pro - uced when manure is saved and applied and intensive methods ollowed. To revert to the silo. The size of the silo should correspond to the amount of stock kept. Silage must be fed from the top and a little should be taken from the surface every day or at most every two days. The silo should be deep rather than large in area; a safe rule is to have it two feet deep for one in diameter. silo fourteen feet in diameter and thirty feet deep will hold tween ninety and a hundred tons, and is perhaps the ideal size for small farm, two of that size being preferable to one very large one. [Cows will naturally be more confined during winter, where silage fed and the silo should be so placed to insure handiness in feeding, should be so placed that when feed is thrown out it will be near e heads of the stock, if they are tied up at the end of the passage ly for instance, if room be scarce the passage may be the manger, y three feet wide, cattle eating from both sides. Corn is the ideal crop to ensilage. Silage should not be fed alone, a full grown steer or cow will profitably use 35 to 4 3 pounds of silage and alfalfa or clover hay at will; it can profitably be fed to i ;.nii horses as well. Sheep fatten rapidly on silage and alfalfa, giving as good returns as when fed on corn or screenings. !A variety of corn should be grown that will give the greatest nount of stalk and perfectly mature the grain and it should be put to the silo just when it is fit to cut for the grain (well dented), it at this stage it should not be allowed to wilt before putting in. corn gets frozen or wilted by hot winds put in at once, and if very y, water, particularly the top third of silo. A crop of corn will ■Id from 8 to 20 tons of silage to the acre. In all lines of btuineca it is a safe rule to follow to depend more for our profit on reducing the cost of the product, than on artificially ng the price received. Again, it must be apparent to everyone that a system of hand- ling food and of feeding, tliat was the btst under conditions that entjr years ago when foods and lands were low in price, will it under present conditions of high priced food and lands. a </seg>

When a man begins to think about dairying and thinks seri - ously on the subject of dairying, he will begin to think seriously about a silo. I do not know how much corn at this tinrp is laying under the snow in the state of Iowa. I have heard it stated that it was ■ ut of the crop. One farmer said that he was out picking corn in six and seven indies of snow and that out of ten bushels the rabbits got one and he got nine.

You can utilize the common field corn if you have no other, putting it in the silo just when you would put it in he shock, putting water in at the same time. Last year we put up our silage — we did not get our silo built until pretty late, until the orn was nearly frosted and dead. We went on putting it into the ilo and putting in water from the windmill; and we had just as good silage that year as we ever did when it was put up under ideal con - itions. It is possible to take corn fodder out of the field today and »ut it in the silo, and by putting on water enough it would keep ne. I have never done that myself. We would have done it this pring had it not been that we sold the farm.

The largest and best result for many is a long way off. No man ought to keep a cow that gives less than butterfat. A successful dairyman will not keep (cow that does not give him 300 or 400 pounds. (Applause.) The President: We are very glad to have this advice from a man who has been working along conditions similar to eastern Ne braska all these years. I am glad he mentioned the subject of silage lor beef cattle. I have always thought that silage was hardly proper for the beef steer, at least not as much so as it was for the dairy </seg>

As a matter of fact in Illinois. Iowa, and some half dozen other experi - ment stations, they tell us that you can make cheaper beef on corn ensilage than you can on almost any other kind of feed. The President: I want to rail on a gentleman right close by who 1 know built a silo. He is a farmer and he built a silo through the advise of one of our farmer institute workers and it will be a good thing for us to hear from him. Member: The chairman has referred to me by stating that I was a farmer, but gave no name, but I want to tell you that I am a armer. I live out here 150 miles west. Through advice and earnest pplication to the dariy business and the talk given us at a farmers' nstitute meeting a little over a year ago. two members of the asso - iation were persuaded and convinced that the silo was the thing to ave. I feel that I should give credit to that gentleman and he was no less a distinguished gentleman than Mr. Elliott of Ontario. He s the gentleman who converted two of us westerners to build a silo. Ve had a little Methodist meeting program here at the beginning of his session, and it seems to me that further advancement in this business would be to continue with a little more Methodism, I mean n the way of having experience meetings. I would like if anyone hroughout the state, if you can do so, to tell something of his expi-ri - nce in the matter of his silo within the past year. I am no conven - ion speaker, nothing of that sort, but if you will ask a few questions will be pleased to answer according to my experience. Question: How much did your silo cost you? Answer: We began at the bottom. We had to work up in xperience and knowledge. The first thing my hired man, my son nd myself, got a tape line and described a circle and excavated he dirt within that circle. 17 feet in diameter; built a wall one foot hick. We excavated three feet deep and brought the wall up one oot above the ground and on the outside we raised the dirt. Then anie the silo. Two of us built silos. I don't know whether it would te proper to tell what they cost, but I will say that counting the cost nd our labor in, we figured that they cost $300, 16 feet diameter by 0 feet high. Question: What will it pay on the investment Answer: I don't know; I have not computed that. I think it will pay for itself 100 per cent or more. Question: How many acres does it take to fill it? Answer: Out in the west we don't have the very best yield, but we put in what we call about eighteen acres of corn and we were a ittle late about putting it in, in getting started soon enough, so that our material was fully ripened. In filling it we had a barrel of water and used a stream of water continually when the machinery was in operation to wet the silage. </seg>
            <seg id="p094">rWKNTY-FIFTH ANNIAL CONVENTION 93 Question: How do you like the sil Answer: I am like everybody else; feed silage to everything ex - cept the hired girl. Everybody can eat silage at our place. We feed it to the hogs, to the calves, to our horses and our cows. Question: Is there any danger of the silo blowing down? Answer: I don't think so; it has not blown down yet. (Here the speaker described the manner of filling the silo.) Question: Did you have any blower Question: How about the spoiling of the silage along the sides? Answer: In answering that I can only say there were two of us bat built silos: we live only about sixty rods apart. We did not ave the same help and conditions in one case that we had in the ther in regard to filling and tramping down, but when my neighbor ame to open his and feed it out, there was some spoiled silage around he outside for about five five or six feet deep and in from the edge rom eight to sixteen inches. When I got into my silo all I had to o was to skim off the top and I found good silage. L Question: I would like to have you tell me why one spoiled and e other did not. L Answer: I could not tell as we did not have the same person do - e work in each silo. Question: Which one was filled first? Answer: The other fellow's was filled first Question: Did he put in as much water as you did? L Answer: Not quite, because he did not have things so handy d the water barrel sometimes got empty before we knew it. Question: How was the corn for ripeness? Answer: It was fully ripened, that is, it was time to cut it. It was cut after my neighbor cut his or about the same time. We filled his during one week and the next week moved over to my place and filled my silo and used the same distributor in each case, but did not Answer: No sir. ' Question: What was the size of the cutter? Answer: I don't know the size, the knife was similar to the one described by Mr. Klliott. The knives run through the center and are about fourteen inches long. [Question: How much power did it take? Answer: I used six-horse steam engine and did not use full power. Next year I propose to have a twenty-horse steam engine and ten or a dozen men and do business. Question: Would it pay for a man who is not a dairyman to have a silo? Answer: Yes sir. Question: What kind of a silo do you recommend, a stave ailo or cement? Answer: I hardly know how to answer that question. We are contemplating putting up a cement silo. </seg>

We also give the horses corn in addition. I might say in addition to the ensilage we are feeding some straw now because we have no hay. I The President: Mr. H. C. Young built a large silo a year or so o. He is here and we would like to hear from him what he has say in support of the silo proposition. MR. YOINC Mr. President and Gentlemen: It is hardly possible Mr. Presi - dent, that I could say anything in addition to the many good things that have already been said. I was converted to the use of the silo through the influence of the state dairymen's association two years ago. The first year I had too small a silo, just large enough to keep me interested and not large enough to get the best results, and last summer I built another one 20x36 feet. I don't know of anything about the farm that can come any - •here near in value the kind of feed that we get from ensilage. I •ant to emphasize one or two things — it is a mistake that most armers or dairymen make in putting off building a silo. The tin. uild a silo is right now. Don't wait; you have been making a mis - ake for lo, these many years, in not having one. Don't put it off ny longer. If you are short on corn crop and the corn don't matn.v. ou can cut it up and put it in the silo for feed, and it is almost equal o the corn itself. They say tnat ensilage made from corn, even if it as not matured, makes splendid feed. In filling the silo I don't thk\!&lt; oo much stress can be laid on the injunction in having it tho - ughly tramped. The' gentleman who preceded me, said that in om- f the silos the ensilage kept perfect while in the other it did not. think this is due to the fact that in the one case it was not tho. - ughly tramped. The first year I made a mistake in this respect but n the second year 1 kept two men or three men in the silo tramping nd I wet it down with water and I don't think we will find any rouble with it spoiling. Question: Did you tramp it on the outside edg bAnswir: Yes sir. The inside will almost take care of id another thing. I think it is well to go back after the silo has ttled and fill it up again. Question: Do you consider a distributor a valuable featur Answer: Yes sir, a distributor goes in at the top and scatter! it; the conveyor is the apparatus or part that carries the ensilage up Question: Do you recommend a stone or stave silo </seg>
            <seg id="p096">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNIAL CONVENTION 95 Answer: I don't know of anything as good as concrete. A stave silo will not begin to last as long as a concrete one. Question: How much liquor do you ever find oozing from the sides? I Answer: I have never found any liquor oozing from the sides f my silo. I gave it two coats of paint and the ensilage comes out l fine shape and the cattle lick it up clean. The President: I will now call on a gentleman who is connected with the experiment station farm here. We are very proud of him. I don't know that he has ever spoken at a dairyman's convention, but I hope he will in the future because we consider him a very valu - able man — Professor L. W. Chase. MR. CHASl Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Convention: Professor Haecker has asked me to assist in this discussion and to boost the silo proposition.

But it is hard to get the silage out of the ilo. It is much easier to put the silage in the silo which is above he ground with a machine than it is to lift it out of the under - round silo by the bucketful. So, considering these, the different eatures along that line, one thing with another, I am not so much in avor of the silo that goes into the ground unless it might be built n the side hill and would say not to put silage into a silo where you lave to lift it out. Then in regard to the construction of silos; you lave heard here from one of our friends who has put up a stave silo, lat he built a wall and then set the silo on top of that. Everybody hinks the silo ought to be perfectly smooth on the inside. I would say not to have any notches or jags on the inside and have it smooth n the inside, and when you put it up your staves will be drawn up ght, especially when you put silage in. Next year it dries out gain and you will have to look after it or it will drop off the founda - on. I would advise making a foundation either perfectly flat clear cross and setting the silo on top of that, or dropping the silo back ne, two or possibly three inches away from the edge. Another hing not to have the pit too low below the top of the foundation. In egard to putting up home-made silos be careful that you have every tave plumb as you go.

Barber — Lewellen, Neb Farm dairying, one of the chief phases of agricultural pursuits, is of growing importance both to the dairyman and to the consumer Pie main question of the industry is. What are the essentials nece ry to make farm dairying prontabk ? The foremost of these are: I. The man The herd; its selection and management. The facilities for handling the herd and its produce Tin Man A1 " thing depend! upon the ability of the man. He must ave an instinctive liking for the dairy cow. not from mercenary mo - ives. but from a real love for the animal. The dairyman must be a lan of untiring patience and sound judgment. He must be conscien - iously dean in his work and regular in his habits. He must keep iniself posted and up to date and conduct his dairy on business prin - iples. The most important function of the business end of the dairy 8 the selection and management of the herd. Tlu. Herd The herd must be chosen from the standpoint of profitable cows. he selection of the breed should rest upon the result of a careful tudy of the market and local conditions. Is the demand for cheese, or butter for babies or is it for general milk supply? No dairyman hould select butter producing cattle when his milk goes to the cheese actory or a sanitarium. It is not necessary to have pure blooded took, although it is a very desirable aim, but it is necessary to have vpe. The dairy cow's function is to produce milk and if she is of such type that she uses her energy to any other purpose she is unprotit - ble. Another element equally important is the bull. The bull should be an animal of pure breeding, of strongly mas - culine characteristics and from record-making ancestry. He must be of pure breeding in order to hold the herd close to the desired type; he must be masculine to insure prepotency and as a rule to insure a greater per cent of heifer calves and he must have the ancestry in Uu-gnl and Host l &gt; a&lt;ki.B«- Display by Creamem Tin- KsMiilials of ProfltaMf Kami Daiiyin </seg>
            <seg id="p104">TWHXTY-FIFTH AXNTAL COXVEXTIOX 103 order to impart the milk-producing qualities. The cost of such a bull s of trivial importance when compared with the results obtained from the animal. He is an all-powerful influence for upon him depends not only the perpetuation of the herd, but the betterment of the herd also. But the founding of the herd is only part of the business. The dairyman must manage the herd on business principles also. The feed is of primary importance. Here the cow is the unit. The quality and quantity of the milk depend, in a large measure, upon the ood. With this in view, her ration should be determined by her capacity and her individuality. Xo fixed ration can apply to all cows but certain foods of the ration are of practical importance in the pro - duction of milk. The most important of these is ensilage. Xo dairy - man should be without a silo. Besides furnishing a cheap food it fur - nishes a necessary food, for it takes the place of the summer grass in winter and also provides a means of storing corn fodder. Another essential Oi dairy management is to make the cow com - ortable. The cow should be properly housed. Xo cow can do her duty at the pail if she has to spend all her energy in keeping warm or in hooing flies. Her surroundings should be clean, well lighted and dry. Any condition which irritates her is to the dairyman s loss. The cow must not be abused. She should be fed. milked anrt attonrt t n r»-- should be fed, milked and attend to reg- ularly. A third essential to management is the time of freshening. Win - er dairying is the most profitable for at* that time of the year milk is n greater demand, the prices are higher, labor is cheaper and it helps o equalize the farm work. The cow will milk longer and will pro - uce more milk. By starting her lactation period in the fall the fall - ng off due to the change from summer to winter feed is avoided and when the spring grass comes the flow is stimulated. By the time short asture, dry weather and flies arrive she is ready to dry up anyway nd the loss in milk is of little consequence. Calves dropped in the all are better than spring calves for by the time they can be taken n* from milk the new grass is ready for them. tThe final essential to profitable herd management is the testing the herd. The work of each cow should be determined and only most profitable individuals kept, thus improving the herd year ;r year by a careful weeding out. The Facilities for Handling the Dairy The pleasantness of the work of the dairy hinges on the facilities or handling the herd and its products. Economy, time and labor hould be the question. All practical sanitary conveniences of stab - ing, feeding and milking should be adopted. The manure should b« handled as conveniently as possible. Such devices as carriers and preaders not only save time and labor, but get the manure on the and in the best condition. </seg>
            <seg id="p105">104 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'8 ASSOCIATION The facilities for handling the milk are also of economic im- portance. The utensils should be sue! h that they are not hard to clean. It is necessary to have an adequate and fitted with separator, refrigeration and milk house, well lighted all such apparatus which will aid in getting the produce on the mark as soon as possible and in the best condition Thus with the ever-growing demand the dairy farm run by the man who has a feeling for hi cows, whe arefully selects his type and realizes the importance of the bull; \vh( produces his milk with a view to the public health from cows whlcl are thoroughly enjoying life, will not Only be a profitable dairy, but will be a credit to itself, ie community. a pleasure to the owner, and a bl ■ssing to t following are the names of partit who contributed to the Nebraska Dairymen's Association essa\ est t tiger.

This is as I understand it. the basis agreed upon, although some of the accompanying facts may be of equal or greater interest to some who see this report. The pi rsonnel of the cows and their owners is as follow tin the following tabulated forms some items are self-explanatory hili' others In ar explanation kAll items of f( ed were weighed out except that of hay. The tount of hay consumed was derived by counting 1 V* pounds hay r day for every ion pounds live weight during the time hay was fed. The hay was valued at $8 per ton. the price paid delivered in he barn. Silage was valued at $2 per ton, somewhat more than its ctual cost. Bet ts wire valued at $5 per ton. the actual cost de - ivered in the barn. The grain ration was made up of corn chops, ran and oil meal in the ratio of 3 lbs. corn to 2 lbs. bran to 1 lb. 11 meal, the coin costing .'i6 cents per huslul. the bran $18 per ton, nd the oil meal $32 per ton. Pasture was counted at $1 per month. per head. The butterfat was placed at 27c per pound and the skim milk solids at IVfct per pound. It will be seen by adding the fat column that the ten cows aver - aged 371.5 lbs. fat, whicn. valued at 27 cents, makes an even $100 each from the fat alone. By adding up the column headed profit, we find that there is an average of $76 each of production over cost of feed. Name of Cow Breed, Age. Owner. Address. Ricka . . Holstein . . H. C.

I know of no one cause which will so steadily in - erfere with the work as the fact that the people on our farms are not icrmanently settled there, with a full and positive determination that t is to be their home and the home of their children and of their hildren's children. It is not our object in life to beautify the farm nd to make it what a home should be. The day that we begin to ealize the value of the ownership of land as a character builder and he dignity that goes with the ownership of land, the natural noble - ness that comes from living on the land which we own ourselves, that ay, I believe, will be the beginning of a great movement for the bet - ering of the dairy industry in the Mississippi and Missouri valleys. t is the one industry which can always be depended upon to sustain he home and to maintain it. Then a breed or family of great dairy ows which economically use the roughage of our farms in the produc - ion ot butterfat will be a necessity. There are no reliable statistics as to the production of the average ow &lt;&gt;f tin- state of Iowa. Here and there statistics have been gath - red from creameries that would indicate that they would make about 4ii to 1"ii pounds of butter a ynr. There art individual cows in the tate that are making 70fl or BOO or 10(1 poundl of butter in a year nd there are whole herds of cows making 300 to .".mi poundl of butter in a year, and I want to y to yen that there isn't a herd of lit to the owner and a source of en built up along one line and that not only what his herd was yield - ■ he-ru was yielding and until that ing, but what every individual in th was dene, no n al progress was r ai n dairviiis Latterly another movement ha had for its object the giving of g&lt; lit b&gt; c n I &lt; fun in my state which al publicity to the facts that are in competitive tes«3.

We are now having the benefit of newspaper discussions and newspaper cartoons on the pro- duction of the Iowa cow.

In this it&lt; rature which is acceptable to every farmer, there is information or uch stupendous value that if it could be brought home to the average armer of the Missisippi Valley, it would increase the material wealth f this country so rapidly as to be beyond calculation Let me illustrate what I mean, and I am going to use these facts laced by Professor Bckiea of the Missouri Experiment Station. You emember he tells the story of four bulls that were used in that herd nd" a record of the daughters of those four bulls. Three of the bulls ept the herd substantially at a standstill, one increased the produc - on of milk a little and decreased the percentage of butterfat; another ecn ased the amount of milk and increased the amount of butterfat nd the other held them about the same as th« y were, both as to but - erfat and to milk production, but one of the bulls increased the pro - uction of the heifers which he sireri over that of their mothers of an loo lbs. Now in those facts, there is a tremendous lesson. There no difficulty today for a fa-mer to buy a bull to head his herd from mother who has made 100 or 400 or 500 lbs. of butterfat. and if he willing to pay the price, he can buy a bull from a cow that has made • &gt;r 700 or 800 lbs. of butterfat in a y&lt;ar, and every bull of that nd which is placed at the head of a herd of cattle in our state, where e I eliminating the poor ones has begun along intelligent nes .will be a source of wealth, not only to the individual, but to the ommunity at large. Just for a moment, I want to go into the figures of the value of a bull that would increase the production of 100 lbs. as demonstrated by the Missouri record. Counting the average life of a milk cow at six ytars and the increase of 100 lbs. a year or (00 lbs., at 15c a lb., this would be $150.00 increase in the six years. If he was to sire 25 heifers this would be IS.750.M in actual increase in yield of butter - fat, which would be brought about because of his influence on the herd. This doesn't make an allowance for the increase in the value of the herd for breeding purposes afterward. It is perfectly plain when you go into the figures in the matter, that it is absolutely ruinous for a man to think of using anything other than the very best bull that he can afford to buy. </seg>
            <seg id="p116">TWENTY-FIFTH AXXl'AL CONVEXTION 115 I want to t fly on some of the things that are tssential in the head your herd. It will be impossible, probably, for all of you to realize your ideals, especially if they are high, but there are certain requirements in a sire that ar. y, and one thing, in my Judgment, is that the mother of the sire should be a great milch cow- that she is known by the records to be such and the greater the mother the greater the char r the n to sire what you want. If possi- ble, si 1 have a record for a year's production. In addition to the mother, if you can have the developed grand dam and great grand dam, the prepotency along the line that you are working, as indicated in the pedigree, cannot be overestimated. Personally. 1 care little or nothing about show ring commendations. While beauty of form is a commercial commodity, the inherent ability to produce butterfat at a minimum price is the one standard that must be adhered to and 1 stand prepared to change my idea as to what constitutes the ideal dairy form so that my opinion will be in accord with the record cows. Professor Fraser, of the Illinois Experiment Station, in his bulle- tin No. 14 0, emphasizes a fact which it would be well for all to learn and that is in nearly every breed there are two types and the two schools. There is the show ring man with his show ring stock, and genuine show udder must be compa genuine show udder must be compa ■t and closely attached, both I with no Indentations l&gt;i tween the and behind.

One of the leading exhibition herds produced only half as much per cow as did another herd bred for production alone. This here is the man who banks everything on production. I want to briefly quote from Professor Fraser's article. Bulletin No. 140. in re- card to Ayrshires. 'There are two types of Ayrshires in Scotland, ' he says, "the show type and the producing type. The show type has been developed for the show ring, and bred for beauty alone. The </seg>
            <seg id="p117">116 NKBRASKA DA1RYMK.VS ASSOCIATION' shows the folly of running to fads. As an illustration that show Ayr - shires are not producers, the ring of aged cows at the Royal Agricul - tural Show last year is a good illustration. The cow3 placed at the low&lt; r end of the show ring were at the head in the production class." " The t&lt; ndency of all the dairy breeds is to produce a type that is andsonie in the show ring and the innate quality, the one thing that o man knows ahout . but which in a measure is indicated in the form f the animal, but only in a nuasure. is the ability to produce butterfat long the lines that she is bred for, and I want to warn the man who s looking for a sire to head his herd, against the blandishments that o with show ring victories alone. If, on the other hand, show ring ualitit s art obtainable together with the highest possible records, no man will value them more than I do, but to breed up the herds of the v&lt; rage farm of the Missouri and Mississippi valleys, the sire should ome from the producing family rather than from the show ring amily. The production of butterfat is a manufacturing business. Your grain and your roughage are your raw material. Your cow is the ma - chine that turns this roughage into the finished product called butter - fat. 1 don't know why in the production of butterfat, which is a manu- facturing proposition, the same care production should not be guarded as why the same attention should not commercial organizations of the day. and attention as to the cost of in another kind of factories, and paid to detail as in the other The Ft nnsylvania Railroad keel a record and a history of every rail laid on its system, from whom it is purchased, its cost, its weight, he length of time it is laid and the amount of tonnage that goes over t.

In no line of business dots the cost of production of the product vary more than that of butterfat, as shown by the records. Michigan in her testing association, has shown the variation in the cost of butterfat from 9c to 26c a pound, and this wide variance has &gt;een substantiated in hundreds of other cases. I think the most up-to-date modern machine should be used for he production of butterfat, just as much so as modern up-to-date ma - chine for the production of any other product. I think the amount of raw material which it takes to produce this merchantable commodity should be kept track of, even though it is raised on your farm, even hough it is contributed largely by a bountiful Providence. I think every possible dollar in profit should be taken and every effort made as though you went in the open market and bought your raw material. </seg>

Your duty dots not stop there. It is your duty to try and improve the machine. The perfected machine is never the work of any one man. Rather the bringing together of a thousand ideas and ef forts all toward a common purpose. There is phenomenal progress being made in every field covered by the liberal arts. We. as dairy- ten. cannot afford to stand still. The champion cow of a few decades •nee. will trace to a hundred different ancestors, made great by the efforts of as many different people The modern dairy cow can be compared only to the modern up- to-date machine in the factory. She lessens the cost of production by increasing the output, and, like the tool in the well run factory, what she does and what it costs for her to do it, should be known. How profitable the modi rn cow may be made has been demonstrated in th European countries since testing association were organized where dairy breeds have been developed. In Holland, land rents for $20 to $60 an acre. On the island of Guernsey for $30 to $60 annual rental and rentals of this kind are common where there is a great breed of dairy cattle. Right alongside of land that is being tilled in the most intensive manner in the world, we find the prosperous dairy farmer. The Island of Guernsey exports approximately $400 worth of agri- ultural products annually for every acre on the island, and besides this it maintains a population of 40.000 people on an area of about to-thirds the size of a Nebraska township. Alongside of the inten ely worked little farms, we find the prosperous dairy farmer. On this little dot of land, about sixteen thousand acres or about two-thirds the size of a Nebraska township, there are 6,000 head of cattle and these cattle have been bred from time immemorial for one purpose, or rather for two purposes; butter production and the color of the oil. They prize the color of the product as much as they do large production. I have often thought it was their French blood tiat led them to devote so much effort to the appearance of the goods hich they produce. But that the color in the milk is a commercial hmmodity of very great value, experience has demonstrated. The movement in Iowa is not so much a movement in and of tself for the elimination of the poor cows, as it is an effort to find out where the good cows are on which to build up our future dairies. luaile, in his Survey of Agricultural Britain, says that the Ayrshire ow descends from the Channel Island breeds crossed on the native ows of Scotland, and if that is true, and I have no reason to question t, there is in the Mississippi and Missouri valleys an abundance of reat cows from which we can develop the practical dairy cow. If we </seg>
            <seg id="p119">118 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION know the best cows in every herd and use them as a foundation from which to breed up, a decade will not have passed before the production of the cows in this valley will have been Increased materially and our movement in Iowa and Wisconsin at this time is for one purpose, and one purpose alone, and that is to discover the good cows in every herd. From that moment, progress begins. If you know of the good cows in your herds, the cows that for 365 days are profit makers, the descend- ents from those cows, from a sire strongly bred in producing lines, will show a marked improvement. There is no reason why the im- provement should not be as great as in the experience of the Missouri — - — — ■ — — B rv»«** n rv ul iuc .uisauuil Agricultural College, where a sire increased the production of the daughters 100 lbs. each, annually, over that of their dams, and when you reduce it to figures of this character, the value of a great sire can be estimated One of the great difficulties that we have had to surmount is the thought embodied in every mans mind that he knows the value of the cows of his herd without going to the trouble of testing them. I want to say to you that you don't. I want to give you a few reasons which convinces me that no man knows without having had the dead line of weighing and testing on his cows.. The greatest cow of the Guernsey breed, Missy of the Glen, made 954 lbs. of butter fat in a year. Last ■ummer, I learned that this cow had made approximately 104 lbs. of butterfat in her ninth month of lactation and I went to see her. I made up my mind that a cow of such persistency carried the blood that I wanted on my farm and I inquired the sex of her last calf. They told me that it was a bull calf and 1 asked where it was, if I could •ee it. They said: "It isn't here," and 1 inquired further and lear ed that it had gone to the butcher. Here was one of the great cow of the world in the hands of a very intelligent dairyman and until her milk had been weighed daily, had be* ately, the priceless value of her blood ' (I and figured out accur- was unknown on the farm where Ee had been kept for four general ey kii.

Jacoba Irene's mother must have been a great cow. I understand that a m of Colanthe Johanna 4th, was ne-tenth what the same bull was •old before the cow was tested, for c ■old for afterward. Before Coiant anne was tested and made the phenomenal world's record of 998 lbs. of fat, she was a great cow, but her real greatness was not known until she had gone through the test. She was owned by one of the great dairymen of the world. The same was true of Jacoba Irene and the same was true of Missy of the </seg>

But in no case has the phe- nomenal cows of the herd been the cows picked to win before the con test The present movement is for co-operation all along the lines of true conservatism. While we are breeding and building up our herds we are learning as to feed and feeding and the practical things which produce results. We will not only breed up on cows; we will develop real dairymer I want to talk to you as practical people. The best shorthorn cow that there is on official record of production, made 514 lbs. of butterfat in a year. The best Holstein cow has made 99 8 lbs. of but terfat in a year, the best Guernsey cow has made 9"&gt;4 lbs. of butterfat ta year, as a four-year-old heifer, and the best Jersey cow 960 lbs. butterfat in a year. You will observe in these special purpose breeds, that the best cow made nearly twice as must as the best cow of the so-called dual purpose breed I am particularly interested in people wh to dairy, who expect to earn their money by dairying, and for that reason I discuss the merits of the special purpose dairy breeds. I want to ask you if you expected to go to the races with a trotting horse, would you expect what to me was, a pat question that was propounded to that gentleman by a Wisconsin dairyman: "Does Mr. Hill, in buying his locomotives o operate on his great system of railroads, think what they will bring or scrap after he is through using them, as one of the considerations when he buys them? I don't think he does, and now let me revert to find your horse anil develop him from the breed that never had an animal in it to beat four minutes, or would you expect to find and de- velop the horse with which to go to the races in those families that had produced trotters that have gone miles in two minutes? In other words, if you expect to go to the races to win the money on the track, would you breed to the Ohesdale or Norman horse, or would you breed to the American trotting horse? There are three breeds of cattle which have produced animals making approximately 1,000 lbs. of butterfat a year and when you are asked to choose sires to head your herds, I ask you to remember that there is a real race on, real compe- tition in sight and that is \p produce butterfat at the lowist possible ,ost. I remember here a few weeks ago reading an address by one of the great railroad men of the world, possibly as an operator and de- veloper of railroads, the greatest man that the world has seen, in which he denounced the special purpose dairy breeds and advocated the dual purpose cow for general use and his argument was based largely on the fact that at the end of use the carcass of the dual pur- pose cow brought more than the special purpose cow. I remember </seg>

Of course there is a possible item of extra feed to be considered there which isn't counted and there is also the increased value of tht herd because of their tendency to produce better cows in the futu and I think one offsets the other and leaves the net sum of $150 t offset the difference betweea the carcass of the special purpose cow and the carcess of the dual purpose cow and then, over and above that, I want to call your attention to the experience of the Elder Haecker and the life of the cow with the dairy form as against the life of the cow rm. He says: "Our records indicate that the cow having a ■ess growing heredity, under liberal feeding, remains in the dairy onl a few years, while the spare cows do good service to a ripe old age This is a mile post, don't forget.

During the twenty-live years which has measured the life of your organization I see that you have been increasing your numbers very materially. The cow population has in - creased over 2(Ki per cent, and 1 am told that the butter and cream product of our state has increased about 300 times as much as it was when you were first organized. We have with us this evening a number of the men who organ - ized this association. They were at that time in such condition that they had to borrow money for filing fee, and my friend. Dr. C. E. Bessey, had to join in order to form a quorum. As the years go by I am sure your numbers will multiply and prosperity will crown your efforts accordingly. Among those who helped to build up this association at an early day is a gentleman who has been prominent in the history of the state, who has been identified and is now identified with the state university, which is a permanent friend of the dairymen in this state; and I take great pleasure in introducing to you the first speaker, our friend, Hon. W. Q. Whitmore. Mr. \V. &lt; AVhitmore Mr. Toastmaster and Gentlemen: When you consider the outcome f the little meeting held twenty-five years ago and what it has been ound to represent today. I am glad of the opportunity to indulge in a ittle reminiscence. My friend here has given a topic and I will try nd not trespass. I cannot help but recall when twenty-five years go in this city, a handful of us got together, and organized the Ne - raska Dairymen's Association. A few months later in the city of ■"remont we held what was really the first meeting ever held by this rganization. We had to help us on that occasion, a gentleman from owa, one of the railroad commissioners of that state and considerable f a dairyman then. Also Governor Hoard of Wisconsin. With his nimitable wit and dry humor. Governor Hoard seemed to me to be more like Abraham Lincoln than any other man I ever met. 1 ften thought since that, perhaps the impetus which was given this rganization in that first meeting held in Fremont, was due more to the wit and wisdom of Governor Hoard mingled with his knowledge of airying and dairy conditions, than any other one circumstance. I ecall with pleasure many of the stones that he told. I am reminded f one he told about a woman suffragist; the question was asked what ould the party or the world be without women? Some one said "sacri* lie replied, not only that but that a NATION without women would te a stag NATION. I remember he spoke of the wit of the Irishman, who, when he was asked if he could tell what steam was, replied ' he same is what has gone crazy with heat." tl remember our first president was Mr. Bassett. After a year ■ofessor Wing, who had acted as secretary, removed from the state, r. Bassett was put in as secretary and J. Dickenson Avery, Manager </seg>
            <seg id="p131">TWKNTY-FIFTH AXXIAL COXVEXT1OX 127 f the first creamery in this state, located at Fremont, was made presi - ent. At the end of the first year this organization had discovered, as many other similar organizations have done since, that the secretary is he main thing and pretty much the whole thing, and so we put Sam tassett in for life, or during good behavior, which, in his case, is the same thing. (Laughter.) That being true, that the secretary was the whole thing, they got together and considered as there was no other uitable timber for president, they elected me. I never understood it, but I concluded that it was for the same reason as history tells us, that the early Revolutionary War was fought at the battle of Bunker Hill. They called it the battle of Bunker Hill because the battle was not fought there. I always thought that they elected me president because I was not there.

I was standing outside of the hotel, with a gentle - man, when there came along as charming a bit of femininity as ever man's eye rested on, of Irish complexion, of deep blue eyes and brown lair and beautiful form and grace. When she was about twenty-live r thirty feet away the gentleman caught her eye. She approached ooking at him steadily and he caught up courage enough to say, "I m lonesome, and you might speak to me." She said, "l would, sir, ut I am a bit shocked." (Laughter.) </seg>
            <seg id="p132">128 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION Now, gentlemen. I think I could tell you about the "Ideal" cow, iut I am a bit shocked in more ways than one. A friend of mine, a Holstein breeder, said to me one day. "Mr. Marsh, what would you onsider the necessary characteristics of an ideal row;" Now, do you now, I am going to make a confession. I looked him in the face nd said. "My friend, I don't know that I can tell, but if you come ver to my little farm. I will show her to you." He did not appreciate my remark as much as 1 did. But the .deal cow that I am going to peak about changes. We are making progress and the ideal cow hould be what we expect her to be. I In 1S72 one of the great organizations for the development of a iry breed of cattle was formed. In the book tiny first published they Id of a cow that made three hundred pounds of butter in a year, we make as much progress in the next tw&lt;nty-nve ytars as we have the past it will be necessary for us to change our ideas of what nstitutes an ideal cow. and I am ready to change my ideas of what e will be because we are at the dav. n of the day when we will make developments in the way of what the ideal cow should be.

I said to myself this is a delightful story about a cow and •ritten. too. by a charming Soutntrn woman, and she said, "Cows at clover, and sometinxs it was dangerous, and they had what she ailed "bloat." She said when cows are affected with bloat you must et at once a trocar and you must insert it on the right side behind the oro shoulder." In my lecture at Manhattan.

The past season has proved without question that a person will take better care of his own personal property than he will of a borrowed article. especially when the article is a cream can and when it is so easily borrowed. This law has also induced creamery companies to equip their stations so cream cans may be cleansed. By these improv ments they have added very much to the sanitary condition of their cream stations.

We are prone however to treat each with too little attention, too little respect I am unable to adequately tell you the messages of this most wonderful gospel. They are important and numerous. For the pres - ent occasion, I desire to refer only to that of the gospel as it deals with the agricultural growth and development of the state of Ne - braska. I contend that the cow is the basis of all agricultural wealth and development. That by and through fur proper use, Nebraska an attain her highest agricultural development, that her lands will reach their highest value and her itizenshi]i. Those of you who w trials of the years 189 &gt;er as to the position the cow took he battles of that period.

The only difference is. in at you are not in the same position to as willingly and readily knowledge her pre-eminence. Lands in Nebraska that sixteen years ago were worth $20 00 per ore, are today worth from $120 to »1S« per acre. What is the eason of this gnat increase in farm value? Do you understand if an you explain it? You know you have been growing rich. 1 be - • -ve it has come to you in such manner as that you have only half nderstood the reason. In former y&lt;ars the practice was to sell the orn and other products of the soil as raw material. But the facts re. that this has all been gradually changed, that you have been earning of new practices, that you have been drawn along in the ake of progress, that you have planted alfalfa, that you have built p a dairy herd, that you hive tod the product of the cornfield and he alfalfa field into the dairy herd and sold it from the farm in the tape of cream and butter, in the shape of meat, in the shape of ished food products. When you consider and realize that a ton of butterfat is worth rdinarily from $500 to $600, that it is the highest priced commodity ou have to sell from your farm and that in its production you use one of nature's plant food, but are adding to the fertility and wealth [ your soil, you begin understanding the Gospel of the Cow.

The statemt nt that, "All tions will stand or fall, hereafter as heretofore, according to their care of the one great resource, the soil, the one indispensible oceupa rn, agricultural," is sterling Cow Gospel truth and must striou3ly considered by -the Nebraska dairyman. It is the keynote to the policy of conservation. Dairying, the keystone of the arch of our agricultural wealth. That the duty of the dairymen, of the farmers, of ourselves lies in the direction of the conservation of the natural resources of our soil, there is no doubt. This can the better be done through dairying than through any other branch of agricultural activ - ity. I can conceive of no higher plane of duty, no better legacy to future generations in the years to come than that of conserving the fertility and productiveness of the soil It is folly for us to say, there is no limit to the depth and wealth of our soil, when we know that large areas are continuously being depleted by the growing of successive and abundant crops for the purpose of sale as raw material in cereals or forage. I believe it is being depleted more rapidly in one generation now than can be re- stored by several successive generations. The replenishing of the fertility of the soil, the adding to its wealth through dairying is the most practical,, the quickest, the surest and most beneficial way. It may require some considerable self - denial, possibly, a revolution of your present methods and manners of agricultural life, but it will give to posterity the rich and generous assurance of abundant resources in the years to conn I hope you will wake up to the fact that there is no branch of agricultural life that has the vitality in it that dairying has.

Another thing for the educational side of the dairy industry is, believe, that the press can do more than any other source.

Wing, secretary and treasurer, cannot recall the names of the other officers, but do recall that we ad a complete list, a board of five directors and fourteen vice-presi - ents. In the election of so many officers most 01 whom were not in ttendance at the meeting, we simply followed a custom quite common t elections in the early history of the territory and state, which might be illffstrated by the story of an election held in Buffalo county n the late 60's. At that time voters were required to register in dvance of an election as is now required in our larger cities. The lection precinct referred to comprised what is now both Buffalo and )awson counties and there were registered U voters; as the hour for losing the polls drew near it appeared that IT registered voters bad ailed to vote. A most public spirited citizen, serving as one of the udges of election, arose and said: "Gentlemen, there are 17 voters who ave failed to vote. 1 am acquainted with these men and know them o be good and true. I will vouch for them;" and picking up 17 bal - ots he deposited them in the ballot box. The judge knew these men ught to vote and if too busy to attend to the matter he did the task or them as a neighborly act; so in the organization of this associa - ion, we knew that these men ought to be interested and become mem - bers and hence we made them members of the association and elected hem to office. Twenty-five years a^o practically all milk used in making butter was set in shallow pans and the cream churned by land in a dash churn. In 1880 of every 216 pounds of butter made n this state, 215 was made on the farm, and in 1885 only one pound n ten was made in a creamery; hence everything connected with a reamery was new and novel, creating much interest and many re - marks. I doubt if half those present this evening ever saw a Fair - amb can, used for raising cream, used when creameries first were stablished.

Whel all my stand-pat forces have been spent, And I've insurged to quite a large extent; Have written on that subject many a screed, That men of sense would rather run than read, I oft emerge in triumph from the wreck To resurrect the spotted cow called Speck, And give my friends who read a chance to feast On the immortal virtues of the beast. Her milk, witu foam upon it, is a dream, There is. methinks. no quality of cream Surpasses that which comes in modern ran, Extracted by the separator plan. ins to me — I cannot say just why — The spotted cow called Speck can never die Because, as 1 aver upon my word. To me she represents the whole blame herd. She greets me when the milk man comes around; When butter sells at forty cents a pound, And puts me to the grocer-man in debt, I ste her then, but cannot raise the bet; And then, although I get it in ihe neck. Still I adore the spotted cow called Speck. The Toastmaster: Other organizations have their big men, and there are men who are large physically speaking; we have a big man here this evening, but he is small in size. He will speak to us about Moving Pictures — Mr. George E. Haskell. Mi. (ieorge K. Haskell. Mr. Toastmaster and Gentlemen: 1 asked the committee, when I was notified that I wa3 on the program this evening, why* they put me on for. and they said for "ballast." Some one has said that we are all walking phonographs and register with fearful accuracy everything we see, touch, feel or expe - rience. I wish tonight that I could reproduce some of the impres - sions that this phonograph has received during the major portion of .he life of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association. The scenes have shifted, however, very rapidly and one impression has run into an - other to such an extent that the picture is somewhat blurred, and perhaps. I could best describe it by the motto I saw in the office of a friend. "Life is just one damn thing after another," or, perhaps, by the description or mental picture a friend received wiiile gazing from the window of a rapidly moving train. He said the telegraph poles ooked like a picket ft nee: the corn fields and the bean fields looked </seg>
            <seg id="p149">TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 145 ike succotash. So with the impressions tonight. At first we think hey are all of grief, turmoil, strife and contention, trouble and dia - ouragement, but if we dwell upon the picture a little while we can •ee the more cheerful things; we can see the faces in these pictures of men who all through the life of this association have labored un - easingly and unselfishly to improve conditions as they found them. They have tried to benefit all ilassts, the producers, the manufac - urers and the consumers, and then among these pictures there is one hat we recognize in every such picture during every year of the life of this association and it is that of our worthy Secretary. (Applause.) I also see the faces of many who during these years have been ngaged in the manufacture and distribution of dairy products. We. who have been on the firing line of this commercial battle — and it las been a real battle— while we have had to fight with all our might uring the years of our actual commercial existence, we have appre - iated, probably, far more than all others, the fact that we were Hied to an association whose secretary had no selfish interest and ould. work for harmony with all classes. The association has been a great power in this state for the reason. I believe, that it is a place where all of the interests can come together and face the strongest ompetitors and yet can get in on common ground. It has been a &gt;lace where friendships have been formed of long standing. The Secretary has been a friend to every member of this association and very member of this association has been a friend to the Secretary. My sentiments on this occasion are best expressed in the follow - ing quotation: "Make new friends but keep the old — those are silver, these are gold. New friends sip like new wine, age will mellow and refine: Friendship that has stood the test of time and change is surely best. Brow may wrinkle, hair turn gray, friendship never knows decay; Make new friends but keep the old — those are silver, these are gold." TKe Toastmaster: Gentlemen, we have approached the last num - &gt;er on our program and it is with pleasure we note the fact that the hancellor of the university and the head of agricultural education in he state is here with us. The university has always been our friend, ta chancellor has always been like a brother to us all. The educa - ional forces of this state recognize that, if agriculture, dairying, if any industry is to achieve that which reasonably can be expected of t, that education must go hand in hand with the practice work. I herefore introduce Chancellor Avery of the university, who will peak to you on "Science with Practice." Chancellor Avery Gentlemen: There is bo special reason, it seems to me, why I should speak to you at all on this subject, because I see before me the cream of the dairymen of the state — the best dairymen in the country. In this connection I am reminded of a little incident in </seg>
            <seg id="p150">146 NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION which our toastmaster figured as the hero of the occasion. One time when acting as a substitute he asked Johnnie how to spell cat. "Don't you know." says Johnnie. "Yes," said our toastmaster. "Well then, why in thunder do you ask me about it." But to proceed with my subject, "Science With Practice," per - aps the best example came to my attention when I dropped into the aborafory of one of our colleges and talked with the gentleman in harge. He was trying to work out the cause of one of the funda - mental laws of the universe, the theory of gravitation, yet he was the ne who has done more for the dairy interests than any man in the ountry. perhaps I might say than any man in the world. I allude to rofessor Babcock of the I'niversity of Wisconsin. (Science with Practice' ) We have an illustration nearer at home. About fifteen ears ago as a young instructor I was teaching a class in organic hemistry. One of the farm professors said to me, "Do you see that oy with the straight black hair? He is a member of the faculty, our nstructor in dairying in the school of agriculture. It would never o to flunk him." I heeded the suggestion — in fact I marked him excellent," and I would call your attention to the fact that the re - ents of the university, the people of the state, and finally this asso - lation. have been putting "excellent" on the work that Professor Haecker has done in the state ever since that time. Professor Haecker began work in an old wooden dairy building. He is working in the same building except a number of years ago it as veneered up with brick. With such a professor as we have we ught to have a plant worthy of his attainments, and I hope that the ext legislature will make such provision for the needs of the univer - ity that it will be possible to erect a dairy building to cost $40,000. uch a building would be in harmony with the ability of the professor, nd in keeping with the needs of the state. Honorable Henry Wallace las told us how progressive they are in Kansas, how the class laughed hen he told how a writer in an eastern magazine had described the ntroduction of the trocar. Here in Nebraska we not only understand tiese things, but we are of an inventive turn of mind. We do not imply laugh at others' mistakes, but our students are beating new aths. For instance, when Professor Haecker was lecturing on the rocar one of the students suggested — "Professor, why not leave it ermanently in the cow most subject to bloat, attach a whistle to it o that when bloating begins in the herd you could go in and drive hem out before any damage was aone?" tin closing I would express the hope that all members of this sociation will, without neglecting the other interests of the uni - rsity, impress upon the public the necessity of adequate mainte - nce for our splendid dairy department. </seg>

It leads the highest record ver reported in the state of Nebraska by over IN pounds of butter nd is a performance of which any breeder can well be proud. This ow is seven years and one month old. so that she freshened last when six years of age. Her breeding might be termed of the St. Lam - ert and Combination strains. She has had but two calves. With her rst calf she milked- three years and with the second calf mad. plendid performance here recorded. The estimated butter in this record is figured on the basis of a 6 2-3 per cent over-run, which is the experiment station standard. Figured to the 80 per cent basis — 80 pounds of butterfat in 100 pounds of butter — which is often given, would be 853.9 pounds of mtter. This record was made under conditions which could be dup - icated on almost any farm. No special care was given the cow, but as Mr. Hunter reported he took her care with the balance of the herd, but naturally she wu given more feed as her capacity gave evidence that she could handle t well. Mr. Hunter has submitted the following report concerning he amount of feed consumed by his cow. As all feeds were weighed, he record may be considered quite accurate. He has used for values what he actually paid for feed and where forage was grown on the farm has figured its actual cost of production. riil of the Jersey Ciiw. (ilendin's Baby. umihmI Kayiiidiiil.

Had ler milk been sold on the Lincoln market at the average price of 8c er quart, the product would have brought $490.40. Several of the Lincoln dairies have been selling, during the year for 10c, and surely uch milk as this cow produced was well worth 10c. On such a basis er earning would have been $613 for the year. Of the great records made, Dut few have equalled the perform - ance of this cow and as she is soon to freshen, her record does her even more credit as it was made under conditions which every breeder wishes his cow to perform. bMuch care was taken in verifying this performance and the Dairy partment of the Experiment Station sent several representatives weigh and sample the milk during the different periods of the test.
