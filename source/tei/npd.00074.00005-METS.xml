            <seg id="p003">LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL December 1, 1932. To His Excellency, CHARLES W. BRYAN, Governor of Ne - braska: In compliance with the laws of the state of Nebraska, I have the honor to submit herewith the official report of the Department of Labor for the years 1931 and 1932. Respectfully yours Cecil E. Matthews, Chief Deputy Labor and Compensation </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Lincoln, Nebraska, December 1, 1932. To His Exellency Governor Charles W. Bryan, Capitol Building, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Governor Bryan: I have the honor of reporting to you herewith, the records of the De - partment of Labor and Compensation as provided by law, for the bi - ennium of 1931-32. Insomuch as the compensation records are compiled as of July Ist of each year, it is impossible for me to report for the year 1932 m com - pensation matters at this early date, however, all other data covers the records of the Department up to the present time. Two years ago the Labor Commission requested a biennial appropriation of $46,000. However, m your wisdom you declined to ask a legislative appropriation for that amount, but instead requested an appropriation of $36,000, which was given this Department. I am happy to report to you that the cost of conducting this Depart - ment and administrating its affairs m a careful and prudent manner for the past 17 months, justifies me m informing you that the total appropriation needs of this Department for the biennium of 1933-34 calls for the sum of $30,500, or a reduction of 15 per cent under the legislative appropriation for 1931-32 and 35% per cent under the request - ed appropriation of the previous head of this Department as shown m his annual report. I am sure you will be gratified with this report and that it fully vindi - cates your attitude m your fight m 1931, when you made a rugged stand against the increased demands Upon the tax dollar of the Ne - braska taxpayer, as made by the interests then found opposing re - trenchment m appropriation matters. This Department has operated the past 17 months with two less em - ployes than formerly - - one of those employes being a Code secretary. In spite of the decreased number of employes to handle the work of this Department, the fact remains that the year 1931 witnessed 10 per cent more compensation cases filed and heard than any previous year. Salary reductions made m this office saved the taxpayers of Nebraska for the year 1931, the sum of $2,568.09. Other savings m the matter of maintenance and supplies have exceeded $2,000.00, which of course, means double that sum saved for the . biennium. The labor situation, because of unemployment, has been full of human tragedies and heartaches. Not m the history of the laboring man of this state, has he been confronted with such hardships and disappoint - ments and his family so meagerly provided for at his hands. In spite of it all, he has proved his quality of citizenship and his moral worth to society, m the loyalty he has. shown to his government m spite of the disheartning and humiliating condition under which he has lived. Em - ployers m every nook and corner of this state have sought heroically to do their part to alleviate the unemployment situation. Only m oc - cassional instances have employers dealt unfairly with distressed labor - ing men. While Nebraska has a female labor law regulating the hours of female employment m certain lines of labor, there are no regulatory hours as relates to male employment and m certain quarters the hours of such employment have been unfair to labor. I therefore suggest that a fair and just limit of continuous labor In one day, be placed upon all in - dustries aside from agricultural, m the employment of male labor. I respectfully call your attention to another abuse that has arisen, that has to do with labor employed m the beet fields of this state. Under the </seg>
            <seg id="p005">contract system m vogue, the employee must await as late as December 15th to collect his full wage m the beet fields. Too often he finds that his employer has issued orders to the sugar beet companies to pay other obligations he has created and the laborer finds nothing left to pay him and his family for his summer's work. The employer many times Is insolvent. It appears to me that a just solution of this state of affairs is to make the sugar beet company which contracted the beets, recognize the labor claim of the employee as a first lien upon the beets he has helped to grow and harvest. The following compilations from the card record system of this De - partment shows the following compensation records as relates to in - jured men for the years 1930-31: Medical Compensation 1930 " Cards - $332,382.35 $407,555.16 Lump Sum and other Settlements 100,133.77 Total $332,382.35 $507,688.93 1931 " Cards - $305,881.42 $307,413.38 Lump Sum and other Settlements 129,273.40 Total $305,881.42 $436,686.78 1930 - Total Medical $332,382.35 1931 - Total Medical $305,881.42 Difference $ 26,500.93 1930 - Total Compensation $507,688.93 1931 - Total Compensation 436,686.78 Difference $ 71,002.15 1930 - Total number of accidents - 21,902 1931 - Total number of accidents - 18,498 Difference 3,404 1930 - Total number of deaths 76 1931 . - Total number of deaths 39 1932 - Total number of deaths 40 You will note m the foregoing that the amount of compensation paid m 1931 is $71,002.15 less than m 1930. This will be accounted for when it is noticed that there were 3,404 less injured employes m 1931 than m " Prom the above figures we also arrive at the following comparative facts as relates to where the policy holder's premium payments went on the average, to all the injured employes for the year 1931 : To the injured employe, as compensation $23.60 To the hospitals and doctors as per medical 16.53 At a glance ie will be noted that hospitals, surgeons and medical prac - titioners received an average of $15.17 m 1930, which was increased to $16.53 m 1931, per injured man. The compensation rates to the injured man were lowered because of a decreased wage scale, but the costs of medical and hospital did not follow the economic trend, but m fact were increased $1.36 per Injured man. This is not a creditable showing m be- </seg>
            <seg id="p006">half of the medical profession of this state and apparently, will not be corrected until the aid of a new Medical Fee Schedule is invoked. The medical and hospital costs for the injured employes for the year 1931, lacked only $30,804 of equaling all the compensation payments made to 18,498 injured men. I mention &gt;wÂ« fact so that employers of labor throughout the state may know where a large portion of their compensation liability insurance payments go. The economic situation demands and this commissioner hopes to so adjust this excessive cost upon the backs of the employers of labor, that there will be no such picture of excessive medical costs m compensation matters revealed m future reports of this Department. For your further information and as an interesting comparison, be ad - vised that the administrative costs of the Labor and Compensation De - partment per injured man m 1931, was 81 cents per each injured em - ploye reported. The legal end of the compensation division finds the following interest - ing comparisons; which have to do with the cases heard and passed upon by the commissioner or his assistants, where the employer and employee could not agree, but submitted the matter for ascertainment to the Compensation Commissioner: Petitions filed December 1, 1930 to December 1, 1931 .....520 Petitions filed December 1, 1931 to December 1, 1932 479 Decrease 41 Awards entered December 1, 1930 to December 1, 1931 282 Awards entered December 1, 1931 to December 1, 1932 242 Decrease 40 Dismissals entered December 1, 1930 to December 1, 1931....171 Dismissals entered December 1, 1931 to December 1, 1932....237 ' Increase 66 Appeals from awards Dec. 1, 1930 to Dec. 1, 1931.... .". 115 Appeals from awards Dec. 1, 1931 to Dec. 1, 1932 117 Increase 2 Appeals from Dismissals Dec. 1, 1930 to Dec. 1, 1931 45 Appeals from Dismissals Dec. 1, 1931 to Dec. 1, 1932.. 66 Increase 21 In the above picture will be noticed a decrease m claims made for compensation of nearly 10 per cent as compared with 1931, the high year. Also there were correspondingly less awards made, There was, however, owing to the stress of the times, a greater effort made to settle claims after appeals were taken and as a result more settlements and lump sums were made m 1932 than m 1931. Approximately 85 per cent of all appeals taken were settled or lump summed before reaching a higher court for decision. This is one of the abuses m compensation matters that should be elimin - ated. Employers and their insurance carriers m a majority of cases, appeal solely to the end of securing a settlement on a more favorable basis than the award granted, with no intention of having a higher court decide the matter. The Compensation Act of this state should abate such practice m the interest of the injured employee or his de - pendents. One other matter of grave import as relates to the Compensation Act of this state. It has to do with the excessive costs on appeal from the District Court to the Supreme Court. In compensation matters fees for </seg>
            <seg id="p007">transcripts should be reduced to the actual cost involved m transcribing and not upon the statutory rate now prevailing, which is unreasonable and unfair to the laboring man found appealing. The Supreme Court should be available to him at the least possible cost. The Compensation Law should carry an amendment m another par - ticular and that has to do with the supreme court's interpretation of Section 48-115. This section provides that "every person m the service of the state or of any governmental agency created by it, under any appointment or contract of hire, express or Implied, oral or written, but shall not include any official of the state, or of any governmental agency created by it, who shall have been elected or appointed for regular term of office, or to complete the unexpired portion of any regular term." The supreme court holds that the above provision prevents a street commissioner who has charge of the light and water system of a city, from coming within the provisions of the compensation act, despite the fact that many cities have carried compensation insurance covering their employes, only to find that when a water and light commissioner met with accident, the insurance company denied liability and hid behind the court's interpretation of said provision. This section should be amended go that Injustice to the injured city employe will no longer be possible. CECIL E. MATTHEWS, Chief Deputy Compensation Commissioner. </seg>

            <seg id="p011">NEBRASKA PUBLIC LIBRARY COMMISSION Secretary's Report December 1, 1930 to November 30, 1932 i Two changes m the membership of the Commission occurred during the biennium. The five year term of Miss Edith Tobitt of Omaha ex - pired m December, 1930, and Miss Annie C. Kramph of North Platte was appointed by Governor Weaver to fill the vacancy. Miss Tobitt served as president of the Commission throughout her term of mem - bership. Judge Charles B. Letton, state librarian, died May 1, 1932. Mr. Letton became a member of the Commission m 1927. Mr. George H. Turner, who succeeded Judge Letton as state librarian, therefore be - came a member of the Nebraska Public Library Commission. Miss Nellie Williams, a member of the staff of the Commission since 1915 and secretary since 1921 resigned m September, 1931, and was later married to Dr. William C. Beaven of Hannibal, Mo. Miss Nellie M. Carey of Hastings came to the Commission as secretary October 1, 1931. â  The resignation of Mrs. Edna Booth Pagel, m charge of the travel - ing libraries since 1925, was accepted to take effect August 1, 1932, and Mrs. Harriet Hotze Hawn was appointed to take her place. In addition to the secretary the staff consists of Miss Dorothy Wood - row, reference librarian; Mrs. Hawn, assistant m charge of the travel - ing libraries, and some part-time help from students. ACTIVITIES The work of the Commission is divided into three main activities: promoting the establishment, growth, and improvement of public libra - ries m the state, loaning books, and the supervision of libraries m the state institutions under the Board of Control. PUBLIC LIBRARIES Assistance to libraries can be given most successfully through visits and the secretary or some other member of the staff does as much field work as funds and time permit. During this biennium 88 visits were made to public, school and institutional libraries. In many of the visits the secretary met with one or more members of the library board to discuss local library problems. As part of the field work, the secretary attended each of the five district library meetings held m May, 1932, at Fairbury, Wahoo, Nor - folk, Kearney and Scottsbluff, and had charge of the round table discussion of various library problems at the morning sessions. Through these meetings she came m contact with 157 librarians and trustees, and- also visited a number of libraries. In spite of the economic situation m this biennium several new libraries have been started, and others have written for information and help. Many questions m regard to library laws, methods, and other problems are answered by correspondence. 3 </seg>
            <seg id="p012">The number of tax-supported libraries listed this year is 161 an increase of 21 for the biennium. While many of these report only a small income, the amount listed does not indicate all of the help re - ceived, since rooms, heat, light or janitor service are often furnished A number of other libraries listed this year under Association Libra - ries are on the border-line, and no doubt will soon be on the list of tax-supported libraries. BOOK LOANS Each year brings many new patrons to the Library Commission. In this biennium there has been a marked increase m the number of re - quests from schools, particularly rural schools. It is impossible to *v Â£ equests with the Present book collection, and the reduction of the book fund for the biennium July 1, 1931 to June 30 1933 from $6,000 to $2,500 has been a serious handicap. Most of the re - quests come from small schools which are unable to furnish sufficient books for the children to have the necessary supplementary reading. The reference work continues to occupy an important place m the days work. Books, magazines, pamphlets and clippings are sent out m answer to inquiries on a wide variety of subjects; The Library Commission is the only place to which many people m Nebraska can turn for this information, and numerous letters of thanks show appre - ciation for this service. Searching for the right material, addressing, wrapping, weighing and stamping the packages of necessity takes a good deal of time Practically all of the books loaned by the Commission have to be packed or wrapped, since the majority of the patrons live at a distance The books go to even the most remote parts of the state. During the biennium books have been sent into each of the 93 counties m Ne - braska and to 599 communities. Since the traveling libraries are checked for three months, this means that many people have an oppor - tunity to read the books before they are returned to the Commission and the number of volumes checked from the Commission gives little idea of the total number of times the volumes circulate. INSTITUTIONAL LIBRARIES Since 1911, the Commission has had an appropriation for providing books for those confined m the Institutions m Nebraska under the Board of Control. The Commission buys, catalogues, and rebinds the books, but someone connected with each institution has charge of loaning the books. The circulation reported for this biennium was 97,263 volumes. PUBLICITY Beginning January 1, 1931 the Commission has published a quarterly bulletin, the biennial report being published as one issue of the bulletin. The bulletin aims to provide m each issue articles which will be of practical application to libraries m Nebraska and to eive news of the various libraries. â¢Â£ n Â» September, 1932 &gt; the secretary gave five radio talks over Station WCAJ, m which she told about the work of the Commission library conditions, and offered suggestions for reading. In November 1932 she gave one talk over Station KFAB m the interest of Book Week. ' 4 </seg>
            <seg id="p013">From time to time articles have appeared m various newspapers m Nebraska telling of the [work of the Commission or of the help the local library has .received through visits, loans, or m other ways. Exhibits were furnished for the annual meeting of the Nebraska Federation of Women's Clubs m Chadron, Oct. 11-13, 1932, and for the state meeting of the county superintendents of Nebraska m Lin - coln, Feb. 16-18, 1932. BUDGET The budget for the expenses of the Library Commission for the biennium from July 1, 1931 to June 30, 1933 is $19,200. A reduction was made m the following items: Book fund, $3,500; Institutional libraries, $2,500; Salary fund, $4,800. This reduction has materially handicapped the functioning of the Commission, but by careful at - tention to every detail of the administration of the funds and the most rigid economy, the Commission has continued to serve its three-fold purpose, although it ha^ not been able to give the service it could have given with an adequate fund. Many requests could not be filled be - cause the books were not available. SPECIAL NEED FOR BOOKS "The message of books was never more needed, not only for en - lightenment and strenghtening the mind, but for spiritual sustenance and inspiration, to awaken faith and courage, the will to live and achieve," says Mr. M. F. Gallagher, chairman of the trustees section of the American Library Association. Recognizing the special need for books during a period of depression, the Library Commission has made every effort to supply them, particularly to communities which were without library service, but where there was a great hunger for books, and to supplement the service given m other places. That the public libraries are doing their part m supplying people with reading material is shown by their annual reports which are given elsewhere m this bulletin, and which show mounting circulation records. Nebraska, however, still has a number of counties without public â¢ libraries and many other places not within reach of a library, for Nebraska is a 'state of wide, open spaces and scattered population. The Nebraska Public Library Commission, now thirty-one years old, is filling a place not filled by any other organization m Nebraska. 5 </seg>
