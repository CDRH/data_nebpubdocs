870. On April 17. 1871. that building was destroyed by 

and almost immediately thereafter the erection of the 
in building was begun, the site being located June 17. 1871, 

nd the building opened for the admission of patients November 

us additions have been made to the same, and 

we have a splendid structure, with a capacity for the acconi-

pened for the admission of female patients; this addition 

mated capacity of 200.

iiade for the reception of male patients, and it will be necessary 
or the coming legislature to make an appropriation for a build- 

ng in connection with this hospital for these cases. It would 

leeni that the same should conform in a general way with the 

lew building now nearly completed for female patients, and an 

ppropriation of at least fSO.OOO should be made for the contruction 
of the same. It is imperative that this provision be 

ide. as. even if its construction be pushed with the utmost

HEALTH. 

Though the overcrowding has greatly interfered with the su 
essful treatment of many cases, and increased the danger fro 

epidemics, yet the general health of the hospital lias been coi 
stantly good, and during the last year nearly perfect. In Jul 
of the past summer, coincident with and immediately followin 

M w 

the period of protracted high waters in the two creeks be twee 
which the hospital building stands, a few cases of moderate! 
severe malarial fever occurred, but these cases were of shor 
duration and all speedily recovered. The epidemic of typhoii 
fever which has annually visited the hospital seems now ro hav 
been eliminated, and for the tirst time in many years no oul 
break occurred, only two or three isolated cases developin, 
among the patients, and no employees were affected. I hav 
long believed that much, if not all. of the typhoid occurring 
during my residence at the hospital was due to the use of wate 
contaminated by the addition of the infected ice cut from Sal 
creek. At the beginning of the present year fresh water fount 
were placed in convenient localities, and the use of ice wate 
discouraged by example and command. 

T)uring the bienniuni two small outbreaks of smallpox hav 
occurred in the city near by. Immediate vaccination was prau 
ticed on all susceptible persons, and the hospital completel; 
isolated by quarantine until all danger from contagion was past 
As is usual in such cases, a little fault was found with the man 
agement for the strict adherence to the quarantine, to The in 
convenience of the would-be visitors to tin- hospital, but. witl 
the full endorsement of the Hoard of Public Lands and Buildings 
the same was strictly enforced. During the early part of Hit 
biennum there was much danger to health from imperfect plumb 
ing and poor sewerage, which, assisted by pipe leakage in man; 

places, formed pools of stagnant water and endangered tli 
health of the institution. Much credit is due r-» the force n </seg>

the position of the one who has the work in 

are now operating twelve departments, each one 

der a separate head, and that individual alone is held responds 
for rli&lt;- conduct of his or her portion of the service. I have 

¦arnestly insisted that all employees of the hospital should do 
heir full duly. Any political favoritism which may have ex- 

isted in the pasi has been entirely eliminated, and every employee 
lias been required to devote his entire energy to the best 
interests of the patients, and to the furtherance of the welfare 
of tin- sraic No shirking of duties has been permitted, 
and each one has been required to do all the work of his department 
which could be accomplished during the period of time he 
has been employed. 

Never in the history of the hospital in any one biennial period 
lias there been so large an amount of repair work done. This 
was necessitated by the somewhat run-down condition of manv 

the departments. Nearly $4,500 from the various funds of 

reneral repairs, paints and oils. cash. etc.. have been expended 
n the purchase of paint and new material for the improvement 

ol' the building and grounds. None of these funds have been 
drawn upon for the payment of employees, as has been universally 
the custom during past years, but every dollar, not still 
in rlie treasury, has been expended for material, and the same 

'teen applied and put in place by the regular employees of 
hospital tone. I invite a careful perusal of the reports 

from the various departments, which are appended hereto, as 
from them only can any conception of the large amount of repair 
and new work put in be obtained. Many of these repairs were 

langeroas places, repaired the

The number of amusements provided for the patients has be* 
greatly increased during the past biennium. A well organiz* 
orchestra has been formed among the employees of the hospim 
who have at all times been ready to furnish us with the best 
music. Dances have been regularly held at the amusement h;i 
during the season of the year appropriate for such exercise 
besides many entertainments consisting of concerts of varioi 

kinds, displays of Btereoptieon views, phonographic concert 
and theatrical exhibitions. It is but just that at this time, ai 
in this public manner. I extend my thanks to the many kin 
hearted and liberal people who have so willingly assisted n 
in furnishing amusements for the patients.

of the patients lias been kept up in connection with other out 
side exercise, and the wards can be emptied of patients in a 
little more than five minutes. The terrible holocausts in several 
similar institutions during the past few years should incite 
us to make every possible provision for the prevention of a like 

occurrence here, and I would advise the procuring of several 
hand extinguishers, of efficient pattern, and the placing of the 
same in convenient places throughout I lie house. 

NEW BUILDING. 

A I the last session of the legislature $40.lKMi was appropriated 
for the erection of a new building for female patients. The bill 
making the appropriation provided that the same should be of 
fire-proof construction. As soon as the appropriation was avail 
able, in the summer of 1S99. the State Board of Public Lands 

;;nd Itnildings. which controls the erection of all buildings, called 
for competitive plans, which were submitted and promptly acted 
upon. The plan offered by Roberts &amp; Woods, architects, of 
Lincoln, was accepted. As early as the full plans and specifica- 

tions could be prepared, bids for the construction of the buildin 
were called for, and it seemed for a time that none could b 
erected because of the meagerness of the appropriation, but lat </seg>

While much trouble has been experienced during past years 
make*. The usual appropriations for the running expenses of

lmon for deficiency appropriations to be asked for, the 

priations for the past biennium, though practically the 
as those for former periods, have proven entirely sufficient,

considerable extent of the hospital farm makes it possible to 
handle a good deal of stock, and with the careful attention 
which has been given to the farming operations the same have 
been very profitable to the state, and, as a result, considerable 
sums have come into the above fund. Under the rules of the 
Board of Public Lands and Buildings, which provide for the 
management of the cash fund, amounts due the hospital have 
been paid in to the steward,. and disbursed by him under the direction 
of. the superintendent, for such articles as were neees- 

t&gt;arv for rlie use of the hospital, and the purchase of which 
was directed from time to time by the Board of Public Lands 
and Buildings. A large amount of this money has been used 
in the purchase of material for repair work about the hospital, 
and each month vouchers showing every item of expenditure 
from this fund have been made up and the same submitted to 
the state Board of Public Lands and Buildings for their approval, 
in the same manner as are submitted vouchers drawn 
on all other funds. The steward's report contains a statement 
in detail of the balance on hand in the cash fund December 1,

STATE HOSPITAL FOR INSANE. 

ENGINEERS REPORT 

From July 1, 18!»9, to November 30. 1900. 

To the Superintendent of the Nebraska Hospital for the Insane: 

On the 1st day of July. 1&gt;!»!». I had the honor to be appointed 
engineer at the above named institution, succeeding • Martin 
Robertson, who had had charge of the plant for the preceding 

t&lt; ur years. Soon after my appointment it was determined to make 
quite extensive improvements in the lighting and heating plants, 
and plans and estimates were immediately prepared and the 
material bought. The first work undertaken was on the lighting 
jilant. Beginning at the dynamos new lines were laid to the new 
luarble switchboard, which is 40xfi0 inches, outfitted complete 
with volt meters and ampere meters, with the necessary switches 

lor. controlling the four different lines From the switchboard 
new lines were laid to the center, using 1,670 feet of 000 cable. 

iblet board for the control of the different parts in th&lt; 

lain building was placed in the center and has proven to be 
ery useful. The old lines of wire in all the buildings were re- 

placed with new wire, and new sockets and new lamps put in 

ice. A new line was run to the barn, requiring 2,400 feet of 

No. lit wire. New lines have been run to different parts of the 
building, including the cold-storage, officers" kitchen, etc. In 
making these repairs there has been used 4,593 feet of wire of 
different sizes, besides those enumerated above. i&gt;40 feet of drop 
• &lt;ii(l. and 245 rosettes. 715 cleats. :*,(» shades. 4:'. switches. 100 
knobs, push buttons, and much other material. Electric bell connection 
has been arranged from the building to the engine room 
and between the various floors and the center. The result of 
the improvement to the electric plant has been a great saving 
in coal consumption and the production of a first-class light', with 

f but very few lamps as compared to the number burned 

before these repairs were made. 

The large fire pump in the engine house was put in good repair 
with but slight expense. The hot water supply of the instiunion 
having been not only deficient in quantity, but expensive 

heat under Hie old system, wan changed, and a large new tank </seg>

            <seg id="p030">

LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT 

made from a discarded boiler, which nowfurnishes an almudance 
of hot water at all times. At the new pump house, a consider 
able amount of work has been done in patting in the minor de 
tails, which were not provided for in the original contract, ant 
refining some of the weak points in the new work. A ureal 

deal of work has been done in the main building. The old w 
tank on the fourth floor, in which the water used in the ce 

formerly stood from one to three days before use. has been sej 
ated from the system and direct connection made with the in 
for the supply of the center, thus constantly fuinishin- u'&lt; 

high pressure steam. While the radiators were all designed 

a double pi]&gt;e system, but few of them were connected up w 
the return, except b.y large bleeders, which lead to a const; 

instan 

loss of steam, and did not give proper circulation to heat them 
throughout. Every radiator has been supplied with a return pipe 
carrying direct to the large return in the tunnel, with the result 
that all of them are now properly heated. The building can 
now be warmed with a much lower steam pressure. New valves 
have been put in wherever necessary to separate the water or 
steam supply from any portion of the building. The radiator 
Work occupied four months' time. 

In connection with the erection of the new building it was 
necessary to move 150 feet of the six-inch water main, as well 
as 145 feet of one of the fire mains. These were moved and the 
lire main extended some considerable distance, involving a cost 
of fl20 for the same. In making the repairs to the steam and 
water plants there have been used 230 feet of pipe, from three 

fresh water. To this main has also been attached ; i cnmenii 

Irinkiuj: fount in the main hall. 

All of the hath tubs on the wards have been anaPired w 

top feed pipes, as it was found that the return tluw fn.ni i 

•ouuections at the bott was constantly liiiii^lin- with the si 

ply at the drinking faucets. 

By fat- Hie heaviest work has been the refitting of ihe heati 

plant. On the large return pipes were placed three naps, ea 

of 1,(MM» feet capacity, while on the main steam pipe was plai

same. In repairing 

ilers it was found that much of the leakage and trouble 
i mi had been due to the joints having been imperfectly 

ted. and practically the entire plant has been gone over and 
of the connections refitted. In the laundry two new washer 

¦yliuders have been put in and all of the belting replaced by new. 
Also a new wringer basket put in place.

MASON'S REPORT 

To Dr. Coffin. Suj&gt;eriiitendent of the Nebraska Hospital for the 

I lisa nc : 

I beg to report the following repairs and improvement made 
y this department during the period from May 1. 1899, to 

November 30, 1900: 

As s&lt;» much of the work done has consisted of small repairs 
md patchwork, but few of the larger jobs demand special attenioii. 
In almost every one of the thirty-three rooms in male ward 

1 there were large bare surfaces. These "have all been plastered. 
In all I have plastered 925 yards of three-coat work. A itabstan 

unnel. three feet deep, with solid brick walls, was built 

ii the boiler house to the laundry, lodging the steam and* 

water pipes. The foundation to the greenhouse has been rebuilt, 
lite grates under four of the large boilers have been raised and 

reset and the fire-boxes of all of the boilers have been^relined 
with the best Laelede fire-brick. Where old floors in any of the 
basements have been taken up they have generally been replaced 
i&gt;} cement or tile. Considerable new brick walk has l&gt;een laid 
but it has been impossible to keep these walks in go»&gt;d condition, 
because of their destruction by the drayage to the new building. 
The chapel walls, which were in a bad condition, have been re 
plastered where necessary. The stone work on the main building 
should have been repointed years ago. and all my time available 
ha* been devoted to this work, but much still remains to be done, 

as the entire job would require several months. Careful attention 
has been given to the sewerage system, and wherever 
defects or deficient capacity has been discovered, the same has 

en corrected. 

In making the repairs for the above nineteen mouths. I have 
used, in material: Plaster. 7.500 pounds: stucco. £.000 pound?; 
brick, 7.100 ; fireclay. 2.200 pounds; sand. 48.500 pounds: lime, 

2«'O pounds; cement. 200 pounds: firebrick. 2.300: rock. 7,900
