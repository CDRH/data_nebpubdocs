While the results of a single exjierinient are not at all con I live, the indications are that it is easily possible to give to«&gt; _re to fattening cattle if large and economical gains an i red during the finishing process. The excessive bulk of this erial. no doubt, makes it impossible to get into the animal the nutriment that is required for the largest gains. Further np. ioo much bulky material in the form of silage may be a dra me when steers are l&gt;eing finished for market.

            <seg id="p041">41 PART II BREEDS AND TYPES OF CATTLE AS FACTORS IN ECONOMICAL BEEF PRODUCTION. In i-onpariaooa of rations as described in this bulletin and ii a targe nalcr of other Bxpertawat station reports, it is apparent that one combination of foods is capable of giving much larger and more economical gains than another. This dif fcma in the foediag value of rations is generally attributed to i lit- composition of the foods in the ration, the relative proportion * concentrates to roughage, and the palataltility of the material. jreal deal of invest igational work has been done to determine • \;ilin' of foods iii various combinations, but very little lia- Uiti dune to show why one animal uses his food to much better advantage than another and therefore produces meat with greater economy. That there is a wide difference in the capacity of in - 'lividuals to make gains is shown by referring to the tables pnb - cl cm previous pagea of this rej&gt;ort. It was for the purpose of securing data on the relative '•apaeity of individuals to make gains that separate records on the ■ •onsunied and gains made by each steer were kept Refer ting first to Table 1. page t, it will be seen that the eight calves in Group I of the first experiment made daily gains in the follow iag order The Angus 1.78 pounds, the Jersey l.(J8 pounds, the llulstein 1..14 pounds, the four Shorthorns LM to 1.64 pounds i average 1.4C.I. and the R"d Poll Lit pounds. In Group II the two Bolsteint made daily gains of 2.10 pounds and 2.20 pounds (average 2.15), the Hereford lJfl pounds, and the five Shorthorns 1.67 to iso pounds laverage 1.71 i. In Group III the Jersey made a daily gain of 1.57 pounds, the two Shorthorns 1.36 to l.."&gt;4 pounds i average 1.4. r &gt;). the three Herefords 1.11 to IMS pounds i average 1.35). and the Angus 1.2!t pounds. Attention is here called to the fact that an Angus was the largest gainer in Groap I and another Angus steer the smallest gainer in Or— p III. In Group IV the Hereford gained \M4 pounds, the Red Poll LM pounds, the two Guernseys LM and LSI pounds (average 1 .41), and the four Shorthorns 1.:57 to 1.75 pounds (average IM). la Group V the four Shorthorns gained 1.40 to I 81 pounds (average 1.67), the Bolattia l.r&gt;4 pounds, the Here - ford 1 411 pounds and the two Red Tolls l.i:t and Lfit i average I SI ■ In Grmip \"I the .lersev trained I .Hi pounds, the two </seg>

The gains in both inents want 1 alfalfa was fed were larger, less eaatty, and niiiili more profitable. These experiments, supplementing what had previously i KH .|, found, show that beef can l&gt;e produced in Ne ;i lower cost and with greater profit on a combination in plant and alfalfa hay than on any other combination - 'vailaMe in the state. ■These experiments show that corn silage gives larger an shredded corn stover when each is fed with corn-meal Ifa. and for l&gt;eef production is worth ♦»&lt;» per cent more per ■&lt; din stnxer has a valnp 80 per rent as great as prairie hay. |H«rtinn c -nnsumed is fully as valuable.
