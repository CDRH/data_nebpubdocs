            <seg id="p031">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 31 MAYOR MILLER'S WELCOME ADDRESS While greeting you today, my memory carries me back just forty years, to the day I came to Nebraska and Lincoln. I do not know whether at that time Nebraska had a horticultural society; but I do know that in this part of the State there was little evidence of the work of the horticulturist. There were a few trees, chiefly cottonwood, soft maples and boxelders; but shrubbery, ornamental plants and flowers were conspicuously absent. Even blue grass was almost unknown; and I think that up to that date the click of the lawn mower had never been heard. But what I noticed particularly at that time was the almost total absence of fruit. Wild gooseberries, wild strawberries and wild grapes, and, late in the summer, windfall apples from Missouri about completed the list. I sorely missed the trees, shrubbery, flowers and fruits, because I had come from a section of the country where all these things abounded, and because, as a boy, I had been taught to cultivate and enjoy them. To plant and watch the growth of flowers, fruits and vegetables has always been to me a great delight; and I envy those of you who are devoting all or most of your time to that sort of work. I wish very heartily to congratulate you upon what you have accom - plished, to urge you to further experiments, and to predict for you greater success in the future. I want to speak very briefly about Lincoln — your city as well as mine — and what we should try to make it. For the past few years we have made substantial progress in erecting two groups of University buildings, one group on the City Campus and the other on the Farm Cam - pus; and both groups are very creditable. Within a year, the new Capi - tol, for which the legislature has so generously provided, will probably be commenced. I believe that a majority of the people of Lincoln will try to have our citizens, individually and collectively, keep pace" with the State in making this the most beautiful capitol city of the West. I welcome you, therefore, to your own Capitol City, in the name of all the good people who are fortunate enough to have Lincoln as their home. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT PRESIDENT L. C. CHAPIN'S ANNUAL ADDRESS In the President's Annual Address it is usual to review the work of the year just past and try to look into the future to outline and recom - mend it's work. As to the year 1918-19, with the Nation at War, the Society and its members have done much to aid the people and the lessons taught them will bear fruit for years to come. Our food stock has been increased ma - terially in both quality and quantity by intensive gardening, the care cf old orchards and the planting of new ones. This has been done thru t) r, press, our own magazine, and the County Agents, yet I fear not all has been accomplished that should have been, for we must keep up with the lessons and influences begun during the stress of the War. The work yet to be done necessitates that some means should be worked out to bring home to the people of our State what the Nebraska State Horticulture Society stands for and the results of using its free services toward the end that Nebraska may occupy the place it is entitled to in fruit growing. We have passed the time of experimenting and from now on we should devote our energies to encouraging the growth of only such fruits as we know are successful in the soil and climate of Nebraska. Also I believe we should make a strong drive for the Home Garden. Now while food stocks are high a garden will aid largely in reducing the cost of living and thereby save ourselves and the country much anxiety. Too, a garden, well kept, is a pleasure to its owner. A few flowers in the garden also adds to its beauty and the gardeners joy. We have accomplished quite a little in the past year, but we have real - ly only begun to see what should be the results of our work. Let us then keep up with that which we have so well started along these lines and try to emphasize to others their importance if they have not already been in - terested. </seg>
            <seg id="p033">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 33 COMMERCIAL GRAPE GROWING J. P. Hess, Council Bluffs, Iowa . The limitation of my subject to the commercial point of view brings into prominence the great commercial grape for this section of the country — the Concord. The sturdiness and hardiness of its vine, which resists both drought and freeze its unfailing production. The convenience in gathering, for the picking season of it extends over three weeks, its pack - ing qualities and most of all its excellent flavor makes it so far above other grapes, as a commercial product, that, I believe, I am safe in say - ing that 95 per cent of the vines in commercial vineyards are Concords. In selecting the site for a vineyard, hilly ground should be preferred and the slope should be toward the south. This will give the necessary air ventilation which is needed because of the dense foliage and the hot sun for ripening. Any soil that is not too poor and a clay subsoil will do, but it should be free from hard pan as the deep roots protect the vine during drouth. The first few years after planting give the young vines a chance. Keep the weeds down with frequent cultivation and hoeing out of the rows. This should be continued after the vine matures and during the entire life of the plant. Without cultivation there will be no success in growing grapes. Next in importance is pruning. In this connection I quote Prof. T. J. Maney, of the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station, who has made a careful study of our vineyards near Council Bluffs. If you recommend the long system of pruning, I believe, it should be for trial for the present, although I am almost convinced that it will be the best system for the growers in southwestern Iowa to follow in future pruning. It is used in practically every other region in the United States where American grapes are grown. "I believe that it is first necessary to establish a strong body, which I have marked 'A.' The canes, 'B,' are the last year's growth. The spurs, 'C are last year's growth, which has been cut back to one or two eyes so that they will produce a strong wood growth, which will be used next year for the fruiting canes." See cut, "Grape Pruning," other page. </seg>
            <seg id="p034">34 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT Two purposes are aimed at in this system of pruning, a maximum yield of fruit and the growth of a new set of canes to bear fruit on the following year, when the old fruit bearing canes are cut back to spurs and the renewal process constantly carried on. There is only one other question involved and that is the vitality of the vine itself and this, I think, is what Mr. Maney has in mind when he speaks of the system being on trial for the present, but I know of vineyards where the system has been carried on for a dozen year, where the parent stalk shows more strength and vitality each year, and in fact, more vitality than vines pruned by any other system. Grapes, Florence, Nebraska There is almost no limit to the life of the Concord vine. I have actual years first-hand knowledge of one vineyard near Council Bluffs that is 37 years old, and the original vines are still in excellent bearing condition and apparently as vigorous as ever. The grapes in our county are very free from disease or insect pests. Leaf hopper is a pest only where lack of cultivation allows the weeds to grow under and about the vines. Borers can be eliminated by careful pruning and cutting away all canes where they appear and burning them. Black rot appears only where rows are too close together or on level </seg>

            <seg id="p037">37 ground and in a wet season. These are the only diseases or pests that I know of. We do not spray. But actual results are after all, what count and these are most encouraging. One grower this year from a five acre vineyard produced and sold through the Association 7,269 eight-pound baskets, an average of 1,454 baskets per acre, and realized a net profit after paying all expenses, in - cluding his own labor and use of his team, of over $150 per acre. This result is slightly higher than the average but can be attained with any vineyard properly lcoated and cared for. The average production is a little better than 1,000 baskets per acre. The average price per basket of grapes, handled through our Association since it has commenced busi - ness, is $0,183 per 8-pound basket. Our Association has been very successful in handling our grapes. It has handled our fruit during the past year at the remarkably low cost of 5 2-5 per cent. Our manager tells me that the demand is constantly in - creasing and as long as this condition exists there will be no danger of over-production. The Association has orders for 30,000 young plants, mostly Concords and a few Moore's Early to be set out this spring by Association members. We have not yet gotten into the really big business in grape growing and we have no grape juice factory, nor the acreage to justify it. How - ever, we have done enough to prove that the opportunity is here and all that is needed is for more people to engage in the business of grape grow - ing. I know of nothing that gives a better return on labor expended with greater certainty. Our crop of grapes has never been a total failure, and the result of Prof. Maney's experiments show the possibility of get - ting larger returns by applying latest methods of culture and pruning. The very satsifactory returns received by those now engaged in the business and the increase in acreage arranged for bids fair to make the grapes an important asset in our horticultural production, and every effort to promote the industry is not wasted. </seg>
            <seg id="p038">38 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT PEARS I HAVE KNOWN In discussing the question of Pears that I know I must of necessity be limited to the number of varieties that I grow and am familiar with. And these varieties have been selected for several reasons. First we select for seasonable varieties and also varieties that are well adapted for use of eating fresh or for putting up in the several ways best known to the house wife. In size we do not choose the very large varieties as they blow off so badly nor do we choose many of the smaller varieties as they do not Bell on account of size even tho the quality be of the best. The tree to my notion that makes the best bearer and that comes into bearing earliest is the dwarf varieties, that is pear grafted on quince stock. This tree should be planted from two to four inches below the graft or bud so that roots will form from the pear stock when you will have the early bearing qualities of the dwarf variety and the longevity of life of the standard trees. cannot always be done as some pears do not seem to do well on quince as they do on their own pear stock. The selection of trees as to dwarf or standard and we are ready to select varieties and get ready to plant. kMany who have seen our little pear experiments think that we have ted too close but as I maintain that my object is to get fruit and ve in a measure succeeded, I am satisfied with the result. I am inclined to think that 16 feet each way is about the right dis - tance but if planting only a few trees they may be planted much thicker but must be planted in a single row so they can be sprayed. I have a short row of pears of the Duchess Bartlettte and Lawrence varieties planted like a hedge row that fruit every year while trees of the game varieties isolated by themselves have not done so well. Another block planted six feet in the row show good results earlier than those planted farther apart. While those planted about 16 feet each way at fifteen to twenty years old are beginning to interlock and doing better than isolated trees of the same varieties. So, I am a convert to close plant - ing but whether because of better sheltered condition better fertilization or what I leave my readers to settle for themselves. The first variety I know is the Clapps Favorite an early variety rather large very sweet and juicy ripening in Nebraska from August 15 to Sept. 1st. This is one of the best all purpose pears we grow. Is a hardy tree good foliage and holds its fruit well. Following the favorite are several varieties that ripen about the 1st of September but all of which may be kept some time by picking and laying away to ripen in a cool place. And in fact all peras should be picked a little green because if left to ripen on the tree many will core rot as the pear ripens at the core first. The Bartlette known to every one who knows what a pear is needs ro introduction and is perfectly at home in Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p039">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 39 The Duchess a large rather coarse pear does fairly well but like all of the larger varieties drop badly with wind. The Lincoln a rather new variety has proven fine for me. I only could get them in the standard variety but it has proven a splendid bearer and is a very good pear can be picked rather green and ripens up sweet and juicy a very good canning pear. A little later the Flemish Beauty comes along a fine pear recognized everwhere for its splendid flavor but one that does not dwarf well and consequently have had to plant standard trees and thus a little slow in coming into bearing but when they come one feels well paid for the wait. The Benwe Hardy or Brown Berwre another good cooking pear large in size and a good bearer but not so good to eat out of hand as the Flemish Beauty. The Sheldon comes about this time hut I am not very partial to them as they blow off so badly. The quality is good and if they were well protected they might do better than mine as they are more ex - posed than some other varieties. Later comes the Lawrence and the Loui Bonnell both good keepers and pood all quality pears being good from September 15 to October 1st. The little Secke or sugar pear should be in every garden or orchard for its fine quality. They run too small for commercial value. There are several other varieties that I have tried to try out but failed. The Sud - dith, one with a seal on it to prove its genuineness and direct from the introducer has grown for many years and this is the first year it has had a bloom on it. But we must not condemn the introducer. of fruits under other conditions if they do not succeed in our climate and environment for if we did we would have harsh things to say of people who gave us the Rhode Island greening and Spetsenburg apples and the long line of sweet cherries and other fruits that succeed so well where the environ - ment is right. OLD AND NEW ORCHARDS Oak Davis, Editor, Kuralist Mr. B. R. B. Weber, Sec., Nebraska State Horticultural Society, Capitol Building, Lincoln, Nebr. Dear Mr. Weber: The "Home Orchard" idea appeals to me. Twenty-five years ago I helped my father set out a home orchard. I was a mere lad but old enough to help mark the plat and set the little trees, about sixty in all. How interesting it was. I could almost taste the big red apples. The trees grew to be eight and ten inches in diameter, even tho they were planted on the divide in Furnas county where in years gone by it was </seg>
            <seg id="p040">FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT 40 almost an annual occurance for the hot -winds to chase each other in rapid fire succession across the rolling prairie. I have eaten hundreds of luscious apples from that orchard. The trees are all dead now — but let me explain. When father bought those trees, horticulturists and nurserymen did not know as much as they do now about the adaptability of trees to certain sections of the state. They did not know as much about pruning and spraying as now. Father's orchard was seldom if ever pruned and I am sure it was never sprayed. Disease had gotten too strong a grip to save it. Hundreds of farmers in Nebraska went thru similar experiences. Their orchards grew rapidly, produced well for a time and then died. But this is not discouraging to me. I believe the "Home Orchard" idea should be preached in every county of the state. The information that is available now on the planting and care of orchards in Nebraska should make it possible for the home orchard to live and to produce sound and delicious fruit. I went to the fruit stand yesterday to buy some apples. The variety that would best suit me were 15c each. I have eaten hundreds of Ne - braska grown apples of equal quality. This is the best argument that I can offer in favor of the home orchard. I am much pleased that you have started a state wide campaign to interest farmers in the home orchard idea. I assure you my best efforts in bringing this to the attention of our readers, not once but many times. Also I believe you could count on the loyal support of all editors of agri - cultural papers, daily papers, weekly papers and trade papers in this state. All are anxious that Nebraska- shall take a leading part in the production of fruit. Sincerely yours, Oak E. Davis, Editor. SOME ACTIVITIES OF THE DEPARTMENT OP HORTICULTURE Spraying R. F. Howard The Department of Horticulture has each year for the past fifteen years attempted to determine the best means of controlling the pests that are troublesome to orchardists in Nebraska. It has attempted to determine not only the costs of spraying but the materials and times of application as well. It has been deemed advisable at this time to present a summary of this work together with what we consider as good practice. The principal insect and fungous pests for which we should spray in Nebraska are codling moth, curculio, canker worm, apple scab, apple blotch and sooty blotch. It has been found that the codling moth does not deposit its eggs in the orchard for several days after the trees are in bloom. Entomologists have found that it requires from eight to </seg>
            <seg id="p041">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 41 twelve days for the eggs to hatch. It is therefore unnecessary to begin spraying for the codling moth larva until the calyx application. Even this application is from one to three weeks before the larva of the codling moth begin doing damage to the fruits, but it is deemed advisable to in - clude Arsenate of Lead in the calyx spray in order to get some of the arsenical poison on the inside of the calyx cup while it is open. There are two and sometimes three broods of worms in Eastern Nebraska. It is impossible at the present time to make a definite statement as to v/hen the differen applications should be made for maximum effect in controlling these worms. It has been demonstrated that an August application is probably necessary if the first and second broods have been fairly heavy and particularly if the season has been a hot dry one. The number of applications necessary between the calyx application and the August application depends largely upon weather conditions and the thoroughness with which the material is applied. The writer is of the opinion that on an average year the calyx application should be fol - lowed within two or three weeks with another application about the middle of July and on a hot dry summer an application near the middle to the latter part of August may be highlly advisable. The plum curculio does a considerable amount of damage in Ne - braska not only to plums but to apples as well. The adullt beetle makes its appearance in the orchard in early spring and feeds sparingly upon the expanding buds and foliage. Eggs are deposited singly beneath the surface of the young fruits three to five weeks after the fruit has set. The larva are thus hatched out under the skin of the fruit. It is there - fore out of the question to attempt to kill the larva by means of contact or poison sprays. The larva of the plum curculio emerge from the fruits three or four weeks after the eggs hatch, go to the ground, from an earthen cell and transform to the beetle stage. The adult beetle ap - pears the latter part of the summer and feeds upon the fruits until the approach of cool weather. The beetles that appear in late summer do not lay eggs until the following spring. They pass the winter hibernat - ing in or near the orchard in such hiding places as trash piles, brush heaps, wild plum thickets etc. There are two or three things one may do in order to reduce the damage from this insect to a minimum. Since the adult beetle feeds upon the plant in early spring, it is advisable where the curculio is troublesome to include Arsenate of Lead in the applica - tion of spray that is made before the flowers open. The arsenical sprays that are used later in the spring for codling moth will aid in holding this pest in check. If the orchard can be disked or cultivated in mid-summer at that time when the curculio larva are in the ground, a large number of these pests will be destroyed before they reach the adult stage. This is the principal reason why the curculio is doing so little damage in our cultivated orchards. It is advisable also to destroy all litter and brush heaps and other hibernating places in and near the orchard. </seg>
            <seg id="p042">42 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT Canker Worm The spring canker worm sometimes does serious damage in the apple orchards of Eastern Nebraska. This insect pupates in the soil and the wingless adult female crawls up the trunk of the tree and deposits its eggs upon the branches. These eggs hatch into small "measuring worms" about the time the leaves are well expanded. These worms feed upon the leaves. It is not uncommon when this insect ap - pears in abundance to see a tree almost wholly defoliated within a few days. Prompt and efficient work is necessary when this insect appears to keep it in check. Arsenate of Lead, 3 to 4 lbs. of paste to 50 gals, water thoroughly applied is effective against this insect. Usually the spraying for codling moth will attend to the canker worms but it is sometimes necessary to spray for it before the calyx application. Apple Scab This disease is carried over winter on the infected leaves. The tem - perature and moisture conditions in the spring that will cause the tree to begin growth will also cause this disease to disseminate the spring spores which cause the initial infections in the orchard. Under favorable weather conditions we are apt to have the initial infections about bloom - ing time though we do not usually notice the disease working on the foliage and the fruits until two or thre weeks later than this. These in - itial infections on the foliage will within a few weeks produce spores capable of making further infections in the orchard. Under favorable weather and moisture conditions a light initial infection may cause a severe epidemic later in the summer. Most of the damage from this disease occurs in spring and early summer. On an average season we may discontinue spraying for this disease by July. If the weather con - ditions have been conducive to its growth it is advisable to include the fungicide during July. Lit has been demonstrated not only in this State but in many others t the first application of spray should be applied after the individual flowers of the cluster buds have expanded but before the individual flowers have opened. This is ordinarily termed the cluster bud or "pink" spray. Undoubtedly there are certain seasons in this state when this aplication may do but little good but on the other hand when we know that there are certain other seasons when this application may be largely responsible for saving the crop, it is beyond question advisable to spray early for this disease. The later applications such as the calyx spray and two or three weeks later are usually sufficient to hold this pest in check. A series of experiments extending over a pciod of six years have t conducted with a view of determining the most effective fungicide introlling this pest. Bordeaux Mixture, commercial Lime Sulphur :clf boiled Lime Sulphur have been tried. Bordeaux Mixture and </seg>
            <seg id="p043">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 43 commercial Lime Sulphur appear to be equally effective. Self boiled Lime Sulphur was found to be less effective in controlling this pest than either Bordeaux or commercial Lime Sulphur. Apple Blotch This disease has within the past five or six years been rather gen - erally distributed over the Eastern part of our State. Such varieties as the Missouri Pippin, Northwestern Greening and Mann are particularly susceptible to it. Other varieties such as Ben Davis, Gano and York are moderately susceptible. Jonathan and Winesap are very resistant. This disease attacks the foliage fruits and twigs. It forms a cankerous growth on one and two year old wood as well as the fruit spurs. These cankers enable the disease to pass the winter. These diseased twigs serve as a source of infection the following spring. Unlike the fungus that cause apple scab, this disease works prin - cipally the latter part of the growing season. The spores that cause the initial infections on fruits and foliage are probably not disseminated until approximately a month after the tree has been in bloom. Five or six weeks after the fruit has set the first infections on the fruits and leaves may be noticed. They first appear in the form of more or less in - distinct threadlike strands radiating from a central point. Later this area may become brownish in color with or without a distinct margin. These characteristic blotches on the fruit may emerge into each other causing a brownish discoloration of the skin and rendering the fruit unfit for marketing. The first application of spray for controlling this disease should be applied two or three weeks after the calyx spray followed with another about the middle of July. It may be necessary to put on a third appli - cation, depending upon weather conditions. It has been demonstrated that Bordeaux Mixture is much more effective against this disease than the Lime Sulphur sprays. Sooty Blotch Sooty Blotch is a fungus disease that may do a considerable amount of damage on certain varieties when the season is particularly favorable for its growth. It is more apt to attack fruit in low, wet places where the humidity is greater and where sunlight is restricted. Either Bor - deaux Mixture or commercial Lime Sulphur is effective against this disease. The applications necessary for controlling apple scab will or - dinarily control this disease. The following spray schedule for apples is to be recommended: 1st spray — (curculio and apple scab) — Apply after the cluster buds of the apples open but before the individual flowers expand. Use com - mercial Lime Sulphur, 1% gals, to 50 gals, water. Unless the orchard is cultivated or free from curculio injury include Arsenate of Lead at the rate of 2% lbs. of past of 1% lbs. powder to each 50 gals, of spray. </seg>
            <seg id="p044">44 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT 2nd spray — (for scab, codling moth, curculio and other leaf eat - ing insects). For effective work this application must be made be - tween the time the flowers begin to drop and the time the calyx lobes close. Use Lime Sulphur and Arsenate of Lead. 3rd spray — (For apple scab, applo blotch, sooty blotch, codling moth, curculio.) This application should be made two or three weeks after the second, with Lime Sulphur and Lead Arsenate. IX apple blotch was present in the orchard, the previous season it is advisable to use Bor - deaux Mixture instead of Lime Sulphur on such varieties as Missouri Pippin, Northwest Greening, Ben Davis and Gano 4th spray — (Far codling moth, curculio, sooty blotch, apple blotch and in some cases for scab.) Use Arsenate of Lead. If blotch is pre - sent, use Bordeaux Mixture. If there is no blotch and the season has been conducive for lace infections of scab, use Lime Sulphur. If the fruit and foliage is free from disease infection-;, omit the fungicide and spray with Arsenate of Lead alone. 5th spray — This application may or may not be necessary, depending upon whether or not the season has been conducive for a late brood of codling moth worms and for late infections of scab and blotch. Thsi can only be determined by a careful inspection of the orchard at the time. New Spray Materials Dry Lime Sulphur CThe Department of Horticulture has for the past two seasons at - pted to determine the effectiveness of dry Lime Sulphur as com - pared with liquid Lime Sulphur. Owing to the unfavorable seasons of 1917-1918 it was impossible for us to determine with any degree of accuracy the fungicidal value of dry Lime Sulphur. A larger and more comprehensive test is being made in a commercial orchard for the season of 1919. Dost Spray The states of New York, Michigan, Deleware and Missouri have re - ported from time to time upon attempts that have been made with dust as a means of controlling insect and fungous pests of the orchard. These efforts have met with varieing degrees of success. The latest report from the Michigan Agricultural Experiment Station indicates that apple scab and the codling moth may be controlled by means of Lime Sulphur and Arsenate of Lead applied as a dust. Though a summary of the work they have done for three years shows that the Lime Sulphur solution was more effective than the dust. The Department of Horticulture is this year comparing the dust with dry Lime Sulphur and both are being compared with Lime Sulphur solution. We are using the dust preparation known as the 85-15 formula. It consists of 85% finely ground Sulphur and 16% Arsenate of Lead. </seg>
            <seg id="p045">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 45 GREAT IMPROVEMENT NEEDED IN APPLE PLANTING Father Harriqon, By E. H. Smith, York The next few years should show the greatest amount of apple plant - ing the world has ever known. A new industry in the great enterprise will be noted. There will be great improvement in the quality as well as the quantity demanded. The last 50 years have witnessed the introduction of some of the finest apples we have. The Wealthy, the Ocabena, Grimes Golden, De - licious and many others are of recent introduction. I well remember about 60 years ago an old man — a farmer — came into the Illinois Hor - ticultural Society with a big jacknife and a large golden apple. He proceeded to cut off slices for us to sample. We voted on its excellent quality and it was adopted. It was Grimes Golden, which is one of the richest and finest we have. About this time the Jacob's Sweet was originated in the East, which proved to be one of the best sweets. Speaking of sweet apples, it seems that it is the crying want of this age. We want our trees to be growing sugar. Stock fattens fast on sweet fruits and if we can make our trees raise sugar in large quantities we are getting great re - turns from a little ground. Especial attention should be given to this industry. Trees that are not bearing very well should be grafted to sweet apples and all the while we should be on the search for new varieties. Seeds of sweet apples should be planted by the million and every effort made to improve the quality. There has been a great lack along this line. While we raise apples of high quality like Jonathan and Grimes Golden, we also need those with a great deal of sweet in them. Thus a small area will pro - duce apples very acceptable to the cook and to the stock also. The tremendous impetus given to fruit growing by some of the recent introductions ought to be a matter of great encouragement. Think what interest some of the later ones, like the Delicious have awakened. It is as cheap to raise a good apple as a poor one and when our fruit growers wake up to this fact great results will be accomplished. The amount of money raised from a small piece of ground is almost fabulous. When, instead of raising twenty dollars worth of corn, you get hundreds of dollars from apples the planting of aples should be encouraged. There is going to be an immense call for fruit trees in Europe. We must be ready for the call. We need to find out what kinds do best in France and then prepare for the market. We ought to donate them by the million and then sell millions more. We should do our part to rejuvenate and re-create the desolations caused by the robber nation. Instead of seeing how much we can destroy, we need to see how much we can do to render the earth more beautiful and fruitful. This will largely be the mission of the next fifteen or twenty years. One should be ambitious to be, not a soldier of war to desolate the earth, but a soldier of peace to beautify it. It is astonishing how much a </seg>
            <seg id="p046">46 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT single good man can do to make the earth happier and richer; but it is more amazing to see how much a human fiend can do to desecrate it and devastate it. This, of course, will be the world's great war. No one will want a repetition of it. It should be the duty of every one to plunge in and do his utmost to restore the waste and the loss and this is going to be done. It should be the highest ambition of the American thinker and worker to carry on this stupendous work so that one coming to visit us in ten or fifteen years will see what a different world this is, a world clothed with beauty; a world burdened with fruits and with flowers, with new things coming on continually. Again, think what improvements have been made along the lines of flowers. The Canna is of but recent invention, first raised for its beauti - ful foliage and then grown for the beauty of its flowers and these being improved from year to year, one man alone making forty thousand crosses, and the rewards are rich. Great improvements have been made in fruits. I stood once by the little old Concord vine in Concord, Massachusetts. I took hold of a heavily burdened branch and shook hands with it as tho it had been a mother, and I said, "You great, little mother, you little realize what you have done. Whole trainloads of vines have been sent from your branches. What quantities of wines have been pressed from your fruit. You have produced carloads of fruit and for all we know, you are in but the be - ginning of your great work. Other fruits have been propagated from your branches. Your history is something sublime and doubtless hun - dreds of other vines of equal and suoerior value will be Droduced by you." In strawberries great improvements have been made also. I visited the experiment station of Minnesota and saw some of the new creations there. The ground seemed covered with great crab apples. I never saw such a sight. At the experiment station they were producing wonders, and great success will yet be achieved. Berries of immense size and luscious in quality are in the back ground and will yet come to the front. So all along the lines we note the possibilities of improvement. kWhat victories Hanson has achieved in plums, and whichever way turn we see an army of intelligent and alert men ever searching something new an something better; and they will find it too. When we look at the marvelous strides in the development of the peony we can hardly believe our eyes. My last view of a beautiful flower on this earth was Brand's Richard Carvel, and it was the most beautiful thing I ever saw on earth. It was of marvelous fragrance and of surpassing beauty, and I carry with it a memory of the most delightful flower I ever saw in bloom. C. S. Harrison. Oct. 12, 1918. </seg>
            <seg id="p047">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 47 TIMELY FACTORS AFFECTING THE WESTERN NEBRASKA POTATO INDUSTRY H. O. Werner, Extension Horticulturist Secretary Nebraska Potato Improvement Association The commercial potato growing industry is one of the youngest yet also one of the most premising of all of Nebraska Agricultural indus - tries. In the hif h altitudes (3000 to almost 5000 ft.) which prevail in the western half of the State, climatic conditions prevail that are favorable to potato production and which are similar to the climatic conditions especially so far as te ,:perature is concerned, of the more northern States as the Dakotas, Minnesota and Wisconsin. Potatoes constitute the most reliable crop to grow by clean culti - vation mehtods throughout this vast western region. Consequently potatoes are ture to Lecome of increasing importance as time goes on. From the crop of 1918 between 4500 and 5000 cars of potatoes were shipped from Western Nebraska Counties. Box Butte, Sheridan and Scottsbluff are the leading producing Counties at present with Brown, Morrill, Kimball End Dawes Counties rapidly becoming of more import - ance as potato producing Counties. The industry promises to be of im - portance in Garden and Ceheyenne Counties. The We tern Nebraska commercial potato crop is worth around $3,000,000 per year, which is about the value of the total apple crop and about threa times the value of the commercial apple crop. The total value of the potato crop for the entire State ranges between $12 000,000 and $13 000 000 psr year. Nebraska ranks as thelOth to 12th State in point of total producticn. Several m vements are on foot which will tend to make the western potato crop a more staple and less uncertain financial proposition. ' 'p to the presant tim?, as a result of the rapid growtli of the industry in a new country little attention has been paia to markeing. grading, storing and other important practices. The results have of course created considerable dissatisfaction. The potato grading law which was recently p-ssod by the Legislature which requires .ill car lot ship - ments of NebrcsVE potatoes to be graded will assist !H"catiy in stabil - izing the market rnd raising the standard of Nebraska potatoes. A movement is on f~ot to organize a chain of cooperative potato w; rehouses in the North Platta Valley. When established these wai'ehouses should be the chief fret r rt the various local shipping markets. Manufacturing plants for utilizing cull and surplus potatoes will probably be estab - lished. They will prrvide a ready market for cull potatoes and mate the enforccmort r ■ - rading law a more simple matter. At th-; present time there is a natural potato flour plant in operation at Rushville, llii Sheridan Co., Nebr. </seg>
            <seg id="p048">FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT 48 Western Nebraska Potatoes for Southern Seed Purposes During recent years a considerable quantity of Western Nebraska grown potatoes have found their way to the southern markets for seed purposes. Results secured in the southern States by potato growers and at the various experiment stations in cooperative experiments that were carried on, show that Western Nebraska potatoes when properly grown are as good for seed purposes as those grown in the Dakotas, Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan. In the States of Louisiana, Texas and Oklahoma where the Triumph is the most important variety there is a market for about 200,000 bushels of seed potatoes each year. In the States of Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas and Eastern Nebraska about 3,000,000 bushels of seed potatoes are secured from the North each year. The varieties grown in this group of states are chiefly the Early Ohio and Irish Cobbler and Triumph to some extent. Where Improvements in Methods Can Be Made Oestern Nebraska potato growers need to pay attention to several ant matters in order to be able to successfully compete with the potato growers in the older and more established regions. Marketing appears as the one big problem to the average grower. Little improve - ment however, can be made in marketing if the product marketed is not graded or of the quality the market demands. A first class product is essential to securing the best price with any system of marketing. No effort will be made in this paper to outline a system of marketing, but a number of improvements in present methods will be suggested, which when carried out will influence the marketing of the crop very con - siderably. Seed Potatoes for Western Nebraska Potato growers suffer considerable loss because they do not select their seed potatoes more carefully. The careful selection of seed potatoes is one of the most certain ways to permanently increase the yield and improve the quality of the potatoes. Many of the cull potatoes re - sulting from grading. can be eliminated by using selected seed that will not produce culls or that will produce very few. In selecting seed potatoes anywhere or at any time it is well to have some definite stand - ard. The following nine points could well be taken into consideration as such a standard: — 1. The lot of see d potatoes should all be of one Standard market variety, true to the type of that variety and without any mixture of other varieties. 2. The potatoes should be free from all serious potato diseases and practically or entirely free form all of the minor diseases. </seg>

            <seg id="p051">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 51 3. The potatoes should be of a good vigorous type, that is, they should have strong well developed eyes evenly distributed over the tuber. 4. Potatoes of normal size for the variety should be used. Little potatoes should never be used unless they are known to come from a field of good vigorous and high yielding potatoes. Cull potatoes should not be used for seed. 5. The shape should be that demanded on the market for the particular variety. A strain with many off shape potatoes or many rough and knobby potatoes should generally not be used. 6. The potatoes should be uniform in regard to shape, size and the other characteristics. 7. The potatoes should have been stored under proper conditions. If the temperature, ventilation and other things have not been properly looked after the tubers are liable to be weak and often injured by diseases resulting from improper storage. 8. The potato seed should produce uniformly strong and vigorous plants characteristic of the variety. 9. The potatoes should uniformly produce high yielding hills of medium sized potatoes of the proper variety characteristics. The best way to produce seed potatoes coming up to that standard is to produce them yourself in a seed selection plot. Various methods of doing this are outlined by the Horticultural Department of the Uni - versity. Copies of such outlines can be secured on application to the department. Grading Potatoes Until last fall when the Food Administration required all potatoes to be graded and inspected, very few Nebraska potatoes were graded. The reason was, as claimed by the producers, that the buyers did not pay sufficiently more for graded potatoes to pay the expenses. Un - graded product never sells as quickly or for as much money as a graded product. Recognizing this fact the Legislature passed a potato grading law which received the support of the Nebraska Potato Improvement As - sociation. The reputation of Nebraska potatoes can be greatly im - prved by careful grading according to the specified grades. Potatoes Must Be Handled Carefully The most prevalent method of handling potatoes in western Ne - braska has been in bulk by means of the open wagon box and potato scoop. Probably this one practice has been the cause for the bad repu - tation Nebraska potatoes have in some places. In handling potatoes </seg>
            <seg id="p052">52 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT they should be handled as a perishable vegetable product rather than as coal is handled. Rough handling is responsible for a very large part of the dry rot which causes much loss each year. Controlling Dry Rot The organism that causes dry rot is prevalent in most if not all Western Nebraska soils. Consequently the organism can be found on the surface of practically every potato. However, as long as it is only on the surface it does no damage, but if it is allowed to get in con - tact with the raw flesh of the potato it will start to work. The dry rot may start in a scratch, cut, bruise, or where a knob was broken off. As long as the surface is kept whole and uninjured, there is very little chance of the dry rot starting. A low temperature in the storage cellar will check the growth of the dry rot. The storage cellars should be thoroughly cleaned out and disinfected with any good disinfectant. Handling Potatoes in Crates rOne of the best methods of handling potatoes to prevent bruising is means of crates. Instead of dumping and scooping the potatoes they can be handled carefully and quickly by means of crates. An investment of $100 in a set of crates would probably more than pay for itself in re - duced losses from dry rot, providing of course the crates are used pro - perly. Sacks are a great deal better than the bulk method but are pro - bably not as efficient as crates. The prevalence of dry rot is the reason why Western Nebraska po - tatoes are discriminated against in the markets. It is also largely re - sponsible for the lack of storage facilities for the proper handling of the crop. More careful handling of the potatoes is sure to bring a large measure of relief along this line. Storage Facilities Necessary Farm Potato Storage Facilities Every potato grower should have under his control storage facilities for his entire crop of potatoes. This storage should preferably be on his own farm so that at digging time the entire crop can be put in a safe place Long hauls to town at digging time prolong the digging season by taking the teams out of the fields. They also thereby are the cause of con - siderable loss almost every year by field frost. The man who depends upon marketing his potatoes direct from the field to the buyer generally secures the lowest price. When potatoes are safely in storage on the farm the grower can grade them as they should be graded and can market them whenever he sees fit to do so. A large amount of farm storage reduces the market </seg>

A good farm storage cellar with a capacity of 4000 or more bushels can be built for about 10 to 15 cents or less per bushel of its capacity. Every potato grower should have such a cellar. capacity. Every potato grower should have such a cellar. Advantage of Storage Facilities in Town A large potato cellar or warehouse in town along the railroad is very desirable especially when cooperatively owned by growers. It can be used as a means of storing a large quantity of potatoes and for sorting, grading and loading many potatoes not stored in the house. From such a warehouse potatoes can be loaded in the coldest weather when the market is generally at its best because of the inability of farmers to haul in their potatoes. Storage Facilities Needed to Supply Southern Seed Market In order to take advantage of the southern seed trade, especially that of the far South where Triumps are planted, it is necessary to have good storage facilities that will make it possible to ship out potatoes in January and February. The States of Missouri, Kansas, Iowa and Eastern Nebraska that use Early Ohio and Irish Cobbler mostly, buy their potatoes during March and early April. For this latter market farm storage may be satisfactory, but when considering the bad roads in spring and late winter and the frequent cold spells, it is apparent that a warehouse along the track to which potatoes can be hauled during the late fall and mild days during the winter, has a great advantage. Some good method of storing and more careful handling of the potatoes together with more attention to seed selection and disease control are essential to the successful production of seed potatoes. Seed Potato Inspection Service Recognizing the possibilities of developing a seed potato industry in western Nebraska and also recognizing the possibility of more satis - factory returns from a superior grade of seed potatoes, the Horticultural Department of the University through the Extension Service is institu - ting a system of Seed Potato Inspection. Any potato grower who is rais - ing a standard Variety for seed purposes in Western Nebraska who agrees to live up to certain simple requirements can receive the service if he applies before July 1st. One field inspection and one bin inspection will be made. All growers having potatoes that meet the prescribed require - ments will have their names placed on the "Recommended List" which will be circulated wherever seed potatoes are bought. </seg>
            <seg id="p056">56 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT Potato Variety Trial A number of varieties of potatoes are being grown in Western Nebraska, but in most sections there is considerable doubt concern - ing the best variety. The Horticultural Department is inaugurating a series of variety trials at different places in the State, most of them in the western part of the State. At each of these places ten standard varieties will be tried out on uniform sized plots. The seed potatoes used at the various places will all be from the same lots, so that the re - sults at the various places will be quite comparable. Until some definite results are secured from these trials, the recommendation is not to go into new varieties on an extensive scale. To briefly summarize, Nebraska has a very important and growing industry in the form of the Western Nebraska potato crop. The status of this crop can be improved by more attention to seed selection, by more careful harvesting and potato handling methods, by better grad - ing and by more and better storage facilities. There is a big market for seed potatoes in the South. Western Nebraska potatoes of good quality are qualified to compete with those from other Northern States. The Horticultural Department of the Umveisity is carryinK on two pieces of work oi considerable impel tance to western potato growers, viz: — A seed Potato Inspection Service and a comprehensive Variety Trial. Better methods and united efforts will assist g:e.\t'.y in improving the market and establishing a good reputation for Western Nebraska po - tatoes. IRRIGATING THE GARDEN Prof. Geo. W. Hood The question of irrigation is an important one. There is perhaps as great an opportunity to increase crop yield by the use of water as there is by the use of fertilizers. When we stop to think that our vege - tables, for the most part, are composed largely of water and many of them as much as 90 to 95%, it ought to be clear that water can do as much to increase the yield as plant food, because all plant food is entirely lost unless it is brought into solution which can only be done by water. It has been demonstrated beyond a doubt in sections where the rainfall is as much as 40 or more inches yearly, that irrigation pays and surely in a section of the country where the rainfall is under 30 inches, there can hardly be any question of its value. In the carrying on of a number of tests to determine the value of water and the best method of applying it, it has been conclusively demonstrated that the value of water cannot be over emphasized. While irrigation is profitable to all crops, there are certain ones which res- </seg>

            <seg id="p058"/>
            <seg id="p059">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 59 Some of the best crops to irrigate and which respond excellently are onions, cabbege, cauliflower, and potatoes. These are all staple and im - portant crops and by the timely application of water the yield can be more than doubled which is an important commercial factor. The method of applying water varies and must be determined largely by the type of soil with which you are working. As a rule sandy types of soil can be handled more easily than a heavy clay soil and the method of applying water to heavy soil is different. On the lighter types of soil, surface irrigation is satisfactory and gives good results but surface applied water in a furrow on heavy land should be avoided because the soil puddles and then bakes and is detrimental to plant growth. One of the most practical as well as the most satisfactory ways of irrigation for either heavy or light soils is by the over-head method. This method is commonly called the Skinner System. The Skinner Sys - tem operates by having a line of pipe supported either on a line of posts or suspended on a cable fastened to a post at either end. The suspended method is preferable, I think, because the pipe can be raised about 7 feet above the surface of the ground, which permits of plowing and cultivating with horse implements and no obstructions are in the way of the implements. The water is distributed by this system through little nozzles which are placed 4 feet apart in the pipe and when in operation a small stream of water is thrown from each nozzle which breaks up into a fine spray and falls gently to the ground in the form of a rain. This method of applying water does not cause the soil to pack and can be used success - fully on any type of soil. The distance the water can be thrown depends upon the height of the pipe and pressure of the water. The best results are usually had with water at 30 to 35 pounds pressure and the line elevated about 7 feet high, which will throw the water far enough to cover a space about 60 feet wide. The fine spray which comes from the nozzles falls gently to the ground and never causes the soil to crust or bake and is really nothing more than an artificial rain. The amount of water that can be distributed depends upon several factors, but under ordinary conditions about one inch of rainfall can be produced in from 8 to 12 hours, depending upon water pressure, the wind and the distance apart the nozzles are placed. The value of the irrigation system rests in the fact that you can have water at a critical time, which often means either failure or suc - cess of a crop. Another advantage is seen, in that when transplanting you can immediately turn on the water as soon as the plants are set, which insures practically a full stand, where without water you often lose as many as 50% of your plants, should the weather turn off dry before the plants become established. Many of our vegetable crops are shallow rooted and for their best development must have frequent rains, because their roots do not penetrate deep enough to make use of the water lower down in the soil. Where water is available and can be used </seg>

            <seg id="p062"/>
            <seg id="p063">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 63 at a critical time, large yields are always the result, barring accidents. Irrigation not only increases the yield but it oftentimes forces crops to mature earlier and you get a better price on the market. Every grower knows how plants are held back by the lack of rain - fall and often delays the maturity of crops from a few weeks to a couple of months and in many instances the crops are total failure. With water at your disposal a failure of this kind is impossible. In fact irrigation is nothing more nor less than an insurance and no business man ever thinks of doing business without insurance, and the question naturally arises can the gardener afford not to protect his interest by this kind of insurance. THE UTILIZATION OF HOME GARDEN PRODUCTS, WHY AND HOW Miss Lucy M. Sprague, Assistant Demonstration Leader University Farm The man who lives on the land, learns to love the land and its fruits. When he has labored for fertile, well tilled soil, has counselled with the best authorities he can find as to the varieties to use, has placed each where the soil and the slope and the sun are just right, has fought in - sects and weeds until harvest arrives, he finds that he has put so much of himself into his corn or his apples or his garden, that they are a part of himself. Disasters to them hurt him, not just his pocket. In fact, they hurt him when his pocket is not hurt at all. He likes to follow mentally that selected portion of his crop which he markets, on its road to the consumer; and when he learns that his cabbage was towed out into Lake Michigan and sunk, that his apples were thrown into the gar - bage incinerator, that his potatoes were thrown on the dump and covered with kerosene lest someone might eat them, his soul burns with righteous indignation. Food Production is no child's play, it is a man's work. Food shortage is no trifle, it is life and death. When an over-production of food, and suffering from want exist at the same time, he feels that something is seriously wrong, but scarcely sees how to remedy it. This condition exists. It is not a war problem as we well know. The war has merely stimulated clearer vision. The Department of Agriculture has been collecting statistics. We have had to fill out all kinds of blanks and answer an army of questions, whose importance we did not always understand. But from it all comes this definite piece of knowledge: out of one hundred per cent of vege - tables and fruit grown to maturity in our country not quite fifty per cent reaches the table of the consumer. It is high time we were seriously studying the utilization of garden products. We are now supplying practically all the fruits and vegetables used by our population of one </seg>
            <seg id="p064">64 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT hundred million, and doing it on forty-six per cent of what we raise. It would seem, then, that we might with the remaining fifty-four per cent supply another one hundred million. We are not so selfish in our thinking as we were two or three years ago, and even that time it would have seemed wrong to us to be flinging food away at such a rate as this while others were starving. Now it is simply unthinkable. There are also some very practical reasons why this suffering of others is our own affair. The first is the result upon any people of hun - ger, awful hunger, such as these millions are now beginning to feel. If your own Government had so mismanaged its affairs that you had to feed your mother and your growing children and the tiny ones at your side with bread made of flour from worse than doubtful grain, adulter - ated with ground bark of trees, leaves, twigs, dirt from the roadside— any thing to make up bulk; if you and your friends hunted thru the stable droppings for grain that had passed thru the intestines of animals, ■■Bj&amp;T^:™. Home Lawn with which to quiet the gnawings of hunger, how would you feel toward that Government? Wilson is right. "Hunger does not breed reform. It breeds madness and all the distempers that make an ordered life im - possible." We have been giving freely to win the war, but unless these people are fed, this war is only the beginning of awful scenes which we in self protection must help settle. It is cheaper to feed than to fight these poor suffering, distraught people. The other reason is this: every once in a while the world is swept with an epidemic which carries away a dreadful total of lives as it passes from one country to another. They used to be called "Visitations of God", "The Wrath of God", and such names. Today we know that they are the result of hunger and dirt. Those who are eating the things of which I spoke are breaking out with boil-like sores all over their body, </seg>
            <seg id="p065">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 65 whose festerings add to their woe. Wherever there is a corner of this world where hunger, dirt, ignorance, and vice have full sway, there is a breeding spot for influenza, Asiatic cholera, typhus fever, bubonic plague, and a long list of miseries which know no respect of person, and which bring home to us very plainly that all men are literally brethren. So much for the why, now let us see how. The program of Hoover calls for no terrible privation on our part, no heroic self-sacrifice, but good business sense. We may eat whatever we choose, but no more of it than we need. Stuffing oneself is all right for a hog, which becomea more valuable the more he eats, but is scarcely the thing for a brainy human. Hoover also asks us to save for others what we do not need ourselves. School Garden Let us study the leaks in our present method. We will find four large and many small ones. First in the manipulation of the markets by unprincipled men, who buy valuable foods and destroy them in order that they may force a higher price for what remains. This is a matter to be met by law and its enforcement, which in turn are produced by public sentiment. If we have definitely ceased to measure success by dol - lars, if we shall prove to remain true to the visions of patriotism which our eyes have recently beheld, this leak will be forever stopped. Second, unavoidable loss is sustained when perishable vegetables are shipped in quantities. As an example of this in January of 1918, eight million pounds of potatoes were sunk in New York harbor because they had been frostbitten in shipping. It was a heavy financial loss that was not wholly necessary. Frozen potatoes contain practically as much starches as ever, and it can be separated by the usual methods. But as a food loss it was total. </seg>
            <seg id="p066">FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT 66 The danger of frost, of heat, of wilting in dry wind, and moulding in wet weather, surround the shipping of all foods with a high water content. This means practically all of our garden products. If we re - move this water before shipping, we have eliminated these losses and have also diminished the cost of transportation. Another leak is found in the method in use in marketing certain vegetables. Cabbage is a notable example. The heads are trimmed to the quick in the field, loaded on wagons or trucks, and taken to the rail - road. Here they are shoveled into the car leaving behind a great heap of leaves, once perfectly good food, now bruised and soiled — mere refuse. Arrived at their destination, they are once more handled by the schoop and loaded on trucks. Another layer or two of good leaves makes a great heap of waste in and r round the car. At the commission house ' t-Z _./'.'■. , rs/s&amp;mmmm School Garden father layer is lost. At the retailers more follow, while the housewife :1s compelled to reject still more. I am inclined to think that this 8te must amount to more than twenty-five per cent of the crop as left the field. And this dees not touch the loss by decay. Any one familiar with the atmosphere of the commission house knows that this loss should be considered. Cabbage may be successfully dried. As it has both in bulk and in weight is very great. potato, which ranks second among the vegetables in the amount pro- A fourth leak is the lack of stability in certain markets. If we were in the South, I should probably illustrate by speaking of the sweet </seg>
            <seg id="p067">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 67 duced. In our own state, however, this place is taken by the Irish potato. Early in 1917 potatoes were selling in Lincoln for $4.25 a bushel. In 1918, potatoes of fine quality were fed to stock, rotted in storage, or were hauled into the hills to return to their original dust. The result is easy to see. First a scarcity, then an over-production, a continuous evil chain. If in some way we can stabilize this industry so that the pro - ducts of one year are available later, the planter is sure of a market. There are signs that this problem is soon to be solved. The demand for potato starch became loud shortly after the opening of the war, since our supply had been drawn almost wholly from Germany. Immense quantities are used by cloth factories, laundries, etc. Today, in all the great potato growing sections, starch factories are at work which are Resetting a Plant using the culls. Other industries demanded potato alcohol. The bakers claim they need at least ten per cent potato flour to make their best bread. But while these methods help the grower, they do not relieve the con - sumer, who needs this vegetable in his dietary, and frequently finds its price exhorbitant, especially if he be a city dweller of small income. How may he be served? Drying is one desirable means to this end. Potatoes to be dried should be cleaned, freed from their skins, sliced or sub-divided, exposed to a rapid current of air, which is mildly heated if possible, and then stored in air-tight containers. In flavor the dried potato is scarcely distin - guishable from fresh. With the water removed, we do not have to con- </seg>
            <seg id="p068">68 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT tend with frost, mould, rot, or loss by spoilage or shrinkage. The potato contains a little over three parts of water to one part of solid fod. We can easily see how greatly both weight and bulk is reduced. This in turn affects the ease and cost of transportation. Drying, then, will enable the potato grower to market all his crop in every year. It will place his crop in the hands of the consumer in a desirable form and at a reasonable price. It will make the fat years feed the lean, and greatly assist in stabilizing a most important industry. Practically every vegetable and fruit in common use, is also desirable food in its dried state. It is not likely that we shall ever be willing to forego the delight of having these fresh the year round, even if the cost is necessarily higher; but on the other hand neither is it necessary to pay this high price or go without. Not all of any crop is suitable for long distance shipping. This does not mean that the remainder is not good for food, but that it must be used immediately. There is ordinarily more of this grade than can be marketed where it is grown and much is never gathered at all. If it were dried, which can be done very cheaply, and then packed in suitable containers, it will keep for years and stand any amount of transportation, while heat and cold, moisture, and insects will have no effect upon it. Here again we have benefit to the producer, in adding to the amount which he can market without tilling an additional acre; and advantage to the consumer, in that excellent foods are pre - sented to him much more cheaply than he can buy them in the fresh state at certain seasons of the year. He finds also that their flavor is better than much of that which is offered to him as fresh in the market. Then there are the small losses — small, but so numerous that the total is really surprising. To illustrate. One of the least considered things in the garden is the head of early cabbage that bursts. In this condition it is unmarketable, and deteriorates very rapidly. It would be under-stating it to say that a dozen cabbage heads are lost in the average home garden. Even a small town contains a hundred such gardens in and near its borders. This would make a total loss in the community of 1,200 heads or about 3,600 pounds of food. To this may be added later any heads of fall cabbage which the owner may not care to store or make into kraut. They will probably be heads that are not desirable for storage or shipping although still in prime condition. This would easily equal our summer loss making a total of 7,200 pounds. Under the past conditions this could not be avoided. Today, however, we know that we may remove from it the 6,840 pounds of mere water which it contains and have left, 360 pounds of pure food, which will then keep indefinitely and be marketed at will. So that without planting an additional cabbage seed, or killing an additional cabbage worm, the owner has gained considerable profit. Onions are another fruitful source of waste. The proposition which prove good keepers is not particularly high. Unless most carefully crated and stored even these fail us and become a foul mass. We may deplore the fact as we will, but the beautiful onions which we gather </seg>
            <seg id="p069">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 69 in July are not easily marketed in most communities, because all who care for this vegetable, plant it abundantly when the first fine frenzy of gardening is upon them. Untold bushels rot in the ground every sum - mer, which might have been dried. In the fall the culls must be rejected altho good for immediate use, since they are not good keepers. These too may be dried and thus another leak stopped. With no more of hoe - ing and weeding a larger per cent of the crop may be marketed. In January the pumpkin, squash, and other stored crops may be sorted over in the home cellar and those which show signs of spoiling may be dried. One may balance the labor of drying against the labor of carrying out the loathsome remains in the spring, and put down the resultant food as pure profit. We have been rather proud in the past of being wasteful, have felt that the other countries which were held up to us as models of economy and thrift were rather ridiculous, as well as being decidedly close. But to-day we can scarcely keep our own self respect, and continue our past courses. If we are to look in our mirrors every morning without a blush of shame, we will set ourselves diligently to the task of saving and turn - ing into the world's supply the larger part of that fifty-four per cent which has been a loss in the past. To my mind drying is a plug that will fit many of these leaks. It may take three forms: commercial, community, and home. Our state which is almost purely agricultural, should have more than one com - mercial drier. Why should food no better than ours, be grown and dried in California, Washington, Oregon, Utah, Idaho, and with much expense of advertising and commission and transportation be offered to us in this state. It seems a little like offering to sell Rockefeller a gallon of gaso - line. There is one point in drying that has not been tried in this state that seems to promise very interesting results. It has been known for some time in Government circles that sugar beets could be dried and kept until it was convenient to make them into sugar. The drying in - creases to a very noticeable degree the amount of sugar they contain. One hundred miles is counted the extreme limit of distance over which it is profitable to ship beets to a refinery. Drying makes it possible to greatly increase the distance as the weight is so much reduced — nine pounds out of ten being water. Then.too, it enables the refinery to run for several months of the year, instead of at high speed for a few weeks. The increase in sugar may be counted on to pay the cost of drying. The farmer at a considerable distance from the factory, has now an opportunity to grow a crop which was formerly unavailable; the refiner finds it possible to greatly increase the amount of his output; and a sugar hungry world is glad to profit by their product. This much has already been done in New Jersey. I regret that I am not an authority on commercial driers, but it would seem to the ordinary mind that these drying plants, scattered here </seg>
            <seg id="p070">70 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT and there, might be used during the summer months for the drying of all manner of vegetables and so extend their usefulness. The Community Drying Plant is peculiarly a Nebraska device. It was originated by C. W. Pugsley when he was Director of the Extension Service. It has been tested in some twenty different towns in this state. The reports from these are enthusiastic and announce an intention of continuing the work indefinitely. This is certainly the best recommend - ation which could be given any undertaking. It demonstrates clearly the need which existed and the wisdom with which this need was met. The plant consists merely of a box open at both ends, containing a set of wire bottomed trays. One end of the box is covered with wire screen. At the other end is placed an electrically run exhaust fan, which pulls the air the length of the box and incidentally thru all the trays. If heat is desired, it may be applied at the intake. Food will dry in about twenty-four hours, the time depending slightly on various con - ditions, such as original water content, amount of food in the cabinet, rate of motion and temperature of air, and humidity of external atmos - phere. The plant is owned by the community, any person who wishes may use as many trays as he pleases, paying a small fee — usually about five cents per tray. Different foods are dried at the same time with no apparent interchange of flavor. The one exception is onions, which we have placed next to the fan, and dried at the same time as other pro - ducts, with no ill-results. A superintendent spends certain hours a day at the plant. It may run continuously or certain days a week as the community decides. During the summer of 1918, gardening conditions were the worst for many years in most parts of the state. In spite of this and the added fact that many plants did not get to running until late in the season, and the natural deliberation with which people take up new things, about seventeen tons of fresh material was dried this summer. Some work is still to be done in "getting the habit" of using dried foods. The new re - cipes sent out by the University make this very easy. The campaign put on last summer for Community Drying Plants aroused much interest in home drying. Several home dryers appeared on the market. I would like to mention particularly one which is not to be patented or marketed, the working plans of which may be obtained before long from the University. It was devised by W. H. Campbell of Mullen, an enterprising County Agricultural Agent, who gives his in - vention to the state. It is a series of trays, which may be clamped to - gether so securely that the set may be carried or hung up anywhere without danger of slipping. A simple device makes it possible to sus - pend it securely from a window sash. It is insect proof, light, and easily adjusted. It was designed to place in an open window allowing the breeze to blow thru. It has been used very successfully this winter, suspended over a register in a Mullen store. kThe winter demonstration was very interesting, a pumpkin weigh - forty pounds was peeled and sliced which reduced the weight to </seg>
            <seg id="p071">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 71 thirty-four pounds. Twenty-hours suspension seven feet above the store register completely dried it. It then weighed two pounds, twelve ounces. Later it was found that one ounce makes one pie — and excellent pies they proved to be. A few words in conclusion. Three powerful influences, charity, self - protection, and profit are combining to change our past habits. What new methods in utilization of our garden products may be developed no man can forsee. It is a time of testing; a testing of methods and a testing of men. Those which are not of real value in our new life are bound to be retarded and soon forgotten. The Horticultural society is the court before whom these theories are tried. The people look to you to weigh the evidence and render the decision. Success to your efforts. PLUMS L. O. Williams This is a simple short word, but it is one that may be enlarged up - on as a topic. There are plums and plums; they vary from the small wild plums that are found in the thickets along our Nebraska water courses to the big European and Japanese varieties that are found on our fruit stands dressed up in tissue papers and packed in dainty baskets. There are also special varieties of this fruit that are prized especially at this season of the year when our governors and other state officers and our legislators are taking possession of their newly acquired pos - itions. These political plum trees have been given their annual shaking but the crop is never sufficient to meet the demands of our ever ambitious office seekers. I am not here to discuss politics, however, so let us "plum forget" them for the present. The Americanas The plum that I can discuss with the most satisfaction and ability is known as our native wild plum. While in scientific horticultural it is known as Prunus Americana, nurserymen and professional fruit growers often speak of this class as our "Americanas," referring by this term to the many varieties that fall under this general family. The European and other foreign varieties are classified as Prunus domestica. Fruit growers are naturally ambitious to grow for the market such varieties that are most attractive to the consumer's eye and purse. The big blue and still larger and more attractive red or mottled plums of the foreign varieties are the ones that attract such attention. Our experienced growers, however, have learned that "not all that glitters is gold," nor that size is the best surety for quality and hardi - ness. Our plum orchards of the great middle wast have been strewn over and over with the wrecks of these foreign plum trees. </seg>
            <seg id="p072">FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT 72 r Amateur growers still continue to buy these "big blues" at the hands the professional tree agents, but the practical fruit growers and the honest nurserymen have become wise to the fact that loyalty to our own native American fruits and institutions is the only safe and sane course. Ten or twelve years ago I planted a plum orchard of about 300 trees, mostly Americana varieties, but with a few Europeans to try out. The latter class was all killed out within four or five years, while the native varieties are still at their job of producing plums. The Original Natives Most of us are familiar with the wild plums that are found in ever diminishing quantities along our wooded streams in Iowa and Nebraska. I have some very vivid recollections of the days of my boyhood when we Unkept Tree went "plumming." Some seasons we would find them by the wagonloads. All we had to do was to shake the trees and gather the plums up by the bushel. They were all sizes and conditions, found in these fruits, but I can recall some very choice ones that were found in these native thick - ets. My mind pictures some of these as being as handsome in color and as sweet and juicy as our cultivated varieties of this day. I remember that we began the propagation of some of these choicest natives, taking buds from these fruiting trees and inserting them in the native seedling stocks. Many of our now most popular varieties were discovered in just this way from thirty to forty years ago. I call to mind the names of two varieties that were "found" by our nurserymen in the thickets near </seg>
            <seg id="p073">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 73 Council Bluffs, Iowa. They were the Baldwin and Forest Garden, the latter being one of our standard sorts in the plum orchards of this day. The "Wolf" is another native that comes from the wilds of Page county. The "Wyant" was introduced from an Iowa thicket about thirty-five years ago and is now one of our very best and most popular varieties. "The Shab hale fungus Stoddard" came to us from the woodlands near Des Moines, I believe. The "De Soto," "Rollingstone," "Surprise," and others were introduced from the plum thickets of Minnesota. Father Terry's Seedlings Special mention is due here to the work of H. A. Terry, whom I knew in my earlier days as Father Terry. I used to visit him occasionally at his home at Crescent City, Iowa, located a few miles above the bluffs. </seg>
            <seg id="p074">74 Father Terry was widely known as a plum specialist and occasionally called by his critics as a plum crank. The peony was also one of his favorite pets, and many of our finest flowers of this popular perennial were named by this veteran fruit and flower specialist. Mr. Terry's principal work, however, was with the native plums. As I recall his plum orchard, there were about fifteen acres devoted to the propagation and fruiting of these trees. He was credited with having fruited about 1,500 native seedlings and crosses. From these true natives, Father Terry is credited with having introduced one of the first and best of our full blooded Americanas; namely, the Hawkeye. I have eaten fruit from the original tree at Mr. Terry's home and have grown and sold many bushels of this fine large plum in the past twelve Numerous seedlings of Mr. Terry's were named by himself. Some of them were commended by the Iowa Horticultural Society for general propagation. I recall a few of these which became popular among the planters for a period dating back about twenty-five years. Among them were the Hammer, Downing, Milton, Cheney and Terry. His first one, the Hawkeye, and the last named are two that are widely propagated by our western nurserymen today. Only a few of the numerous varieties introduced by Mr. Terry were the result of crosses, in which our na - tives were used along with the Chicasaw varieties like the Wild Goose. So far as I can recall from memory there were no crosses of any value that resulted between the natives and our European varieties. Father Terry's faith was pinned to the native plum as the foundation for hardiness and reliable bearing, and it was largely by selection of true American varieties and their cross fertilization that his work in improving the plum was performed. Even the Chickasaw varieties, of which the Wild Goose was a representative type, and which is semi- American only, have never proved hardy enough to be handed down either as a seedling or in its crosses, with an untarnished record to the plum planters of today. Plums Hybrids and Crosses While Father Terry was known as a specialist with plum seedlings, Theodore Williams of Benson, near Omaha, was recognized by the hor - ticultural world as a hybridizer. He was often called the "Burbank of Nebraska," "Wizard of Horticulture," and the like. While Mr. Williams worked very freely with the plums in hybridizing and crossing them, b field or laboratory embraced quite all the orchard fruits of this !. I visited his experimental orchard about twenty-five years ago saw numerous apple, plum, peach and pear trees that were all </seg>
            <seg id="p075">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 75 cut up with twigs of other varieties and species, worked into these tree tops by means of "twig budding." This process of twig or scion budding was entirely new to me then, as it was to most of our fruitmen and nurserymen. In a paper which Mr. Williams read before a meeting of the Ameri - can Breeders' Association held in Lincoln and published in the report Canker of the state horticultural society the principles and methods he used for obtaining the most desirable crosses and hybrids were fully described. It will be found on page 141 of the 1906 report, and is worthy of a special study. The complete results of this wizard's work among the fruits and flowers of his realm are not available in any special report so far as I know. </seg>
            <seg id="p076">76 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT So far as his work among the plums is known today, we have but one variety I believe that is recommended for general planting today. This has been named the Omaha and has been shown by that name at our state fairs for a number of years past. This variety I believe is a true hybrid between the Americana and Domestica or European varieties. The Omaha is similar in both origin and general character to the Bur - bank. This latter is a hybrid, the result of crossing a Japanese plum with one of our American natives. Were it not for the American blood in either of these two varieties, there would be no possible show, in my judgment, for their existence in the commercial fruit market of this country. Their zone for successful fruiting is limited to the more temperate latitudes south of us or to the Pacific coast climes. Neither of the above varieties are to be found on the recommended lists of the state society. They should be classed only "for trial." The Hansen Hybrids tProf. N. E. Hansen of the South Dakota Experiment Station is te well known as an originator of hardy fruits, among which his plum hybrids stand out very prominently. His work in crossing the plum was centered upon the native Americanas and the sand cherries of the western part of this state. For the conditions and environments of these cold dry plains of the Dakotas there is no question' that these hybrids are filling a needy and urgent place. The Dakotas have been found too severe in their winter quarters for the usually iron-clad native plums. Hence, the need for calling to its aid the true native sand cherry of the cold northwest. I am trying out the merits of some of the Hansen hybrids. I have seen the fruit of several varieties, viz. the Sapa, Toko and others. They are not my ideal either in tree or fruit. The trees are too small to be con - sidered along with our vigorous full-blooded American varieties like the Wyant, Wolf and Hawkeye. We cannot expect anything but a dwarf from the cross with the sand cherry. What is true of the tree is also true of the fruit. The Compass cherry is one of our best combinations between the two species. This tree attains an unusual size for one of these hybrids, but the fruit is too small to associate with our genuine plums. The tree has not proved hardy enough on my grounds to be worthy of a place in a well ordered plum orchard. I have consigned the last one of these Compasses to the brush heap. What Varieties Are Worthy? In the published reports of the state society there can be found a complete list of recommended varieties of all fruits for this state. Each </seg>
            <seg id="p077">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 77 one of the nineteen districts has a special list compiled and revised from year to year by a committee of experienced growers. I would commend this list to every prospective planter. In looking through these lists for the several districts I find that the American varieties predominate very largely. There are a full half dozen varieties of Americanas that appear in nearly or quite every fruit district. These leaders are Wyant, Wolf, Forest Garden, Hawkeye, Stoddard and DeSoto, all strictly full-blooded Americans. The Wild Goose is frequently named, but it cannot be relied on as hardy because of its southern origin. Unkept Orchard Both the Wild Goose and Miner belong to the Chickasaw class from the Texas country and hence cannot be relied upon altogether. The Miner, however, is deserving of a place in every commercial plum orchard because of its general vigor and hardiness of tree. It stands well to the front among the older trees in my plum orchard, while the Wild Goose - was among the first to drop out. The Miner has a wonderful capacity for bearing when well fertilized by means of mixed planting with other varieties. It is the last one to ripen in my list, and this gives it a special value, for the real lover of jams and jellies never tires of our native plums. When the earlier varieties are all gone, they are all the more hungry for the last chance for more plums, and the Miner meets this demand very satisfactorily. </seg>

Hoppert In many sections of the State a great deal of interest has been shown in the past two years in the planting of new orchards. Many bearing orchards have died as a result of neglect, dry weather and disease. Many others have been so weakened that they will probably not continue to bear much longer. Home grown fruit was very scarce last year and this year the prospects are not much brighter. Con - sumers who at one time grew their own fruit are sorely vexed when they are asked to pay from $4 to $6 a box for apples or $10 to ?12 a barrel. Complaints have been. made that much of the stuff would not keep, that it was not up to standard in quality and uniformity. These experiences have brought many people to the conclusion that they will have to grow their own fruit or go without. It is encouraging to notice that many of those who are planning an orchard, write in to the Experiment Station or ask their County Agents for information. Most general farmers are not sufficiently acquainted with the varieties and the orchard practices to go ahead blindly with the matter. They realize that it might be a waste of time and money to plant $200 land and are willing to listen to the experiences of others in the matter. With the idea of serving just such prospective home ot - chardists the writer has prepared a minature model orchard to send to the County Fairs with the Extension Service Exhibit tent. The County Agents have plans and recommendations furnished them. The matter of new orchards is given considerable discussion at pruning demonstra - tions during the winter. The purpose of this paper is to supplement the other work in Hort - icultural Extension; to embody briefly the important points regarding the planting and care of the home orchard. </seg>
            <seg id="p080">80 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT One Acre is Sufficient Size of Orchard The writer '8 experience of the past four or five years with home orchards has been that the larger ones are more apt to be neglected than the small ones. By large is meant orchards of 100 to 300 trees. The small orchards, those of 15 to 50 trees are more apt to be sprayed and pruned because the work will not seriously interfere with general farm work. An acre devoted to fruit will, with proper care, supply the average family's needs. Possibly % thereof should be planted to the tree fruits the rest to grapes, goooseberries, currants, cane fruits and possibly strawberries. I The proportions of different fruits with planting distance are given the able below. kit is well to arrange the pears at one end of the orchard in order t these may be kept in sod without seriously interfering with the t of the orchard. Pears should be kept in sod because in this manner their growth will be checked and danger from pear blight will be re - duced. Location The location of the orchard is quite important in some sections of the State. In Western Nebraska where moisture is scarce the best re - sults have been secured in the old creek beds and canyons. In eastern Nebraska it is better to choose higher ground in order to insure air and water drainage. In northern Nebraska the experience seems to be that orchards on a steep nor*h slope are apt to freeze out, and in southern Nebraska a south slope is more apt to suffer from drought.

            <seg id="p081">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 81 Time of Planting. The spring is usually the best time to plant trees in Nebraska. They may be planted in fall in a wet season, however, in southeastern Ne - braska. Trees should be ordered early enough to assure early delivery. Should they arrive before the frost is entirely out of the ground they may be kept in a cool damp cave or they may be heeled in outdoors. The object of the practice is to prevent drying out of roots and tops. When the frost has left the ground the trees should be planted. Dig a hole large enough to hold the roots comfortably without crowd - ing and deep enough to put the trees 3 or 4 inches deeper than the tree stood in the nursery. Throw a couple of shovels full of moist surface dirt into the bottom of the hole and place the tree in the hole. Turn the tree in such a way as to leave at least one sound branch on the south side. Lean the tree a little to the southwest. Then throw in the dirt stamping in solid about the roots. Don't place tin cans, potatoes, oats, or nails in the bottom of the hole. These materials will not as is some - times supposed, help the tree survive the transplanting. They may even be detrimental. Pruning If one year old whips are bought they should be headed about 2 — 3 ft. above the ground. If two year old stock is bought the trees need a more severe pruning to help bring them through the first year. When the tree was dug two thirds of the roots were removed. It is quite im - portant to equalize as much as possible the tops and roots. This is done by pruning the tops. It is well to have 3 or 4 main lateral branches in such a way that there are no crotches and no two branches the same height from the ground. Cut off the others being sure to leave one on the south side to shade the trunk. Leave a central leader to shake the center of the tree. Now cut the branches back to 10 or 12 inches, be - ing careful to cut to an outside bud in order to spread the tree. This cut should be made with the highest part of the cut just above the bud. During the summer the small branches that grow toward the center of the tree may be rubbed off. The second year crossing branches and branches growing into the center of the tree are removed and the new shoots at the ends of the branches headed back to seven or eight inches. The purpose of this heading back is to prevent the branches from becoming too slender and to form strong side branches. Thereafter the pruning is pretty much along this same line, namely removing crossing branches and branches growing into the interior of the tree. As the tree grows older, say 4 or 5 years after setting, a second whorl of branches may be started above the original three or four. </seg>
            <seg id="p082">FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT 82 Cultivation The object of cultivating the young trees is to force them along in their growth so that they may develop a large bearing surface. Cultivation acts as a stimulant. About the most practical method of cultivating th eorchard is to plant cultivated crops between the rows of trees such as vegetables or corn. Then as the crops are cultivated the trees are likewise cultivated. The crops thus grown pay for the rent of the land and the cost of cultivation. Such crops as small grains, grasses, cane fruits etc., had better not be planted. Where grasses and small grains are grown between the trees there is apt to be considerable injury to the lark from buffalo tree hopper, an insect which feeds on weeds and grass and slits the bark to deposit its eggs. Clover may be grown between the trees if a strip three or four feet on each side of the trees is cultivated. Tree Protectors r Rodents such as mice and rabbits are frequently quite destructive young trees. They seem to develop a taste for the new bark es - pecially of the apple trees, to such an extent that they strip the bark off as high as they can reach. To prevent this type of injury, the trees may be wrapped with 18 inch chicken wire or with corn stalks, tar paper, burlap, etc. Wire wrappers cost a little more than the other materials but they can be left on for five to eight years without injury to the trees. Ma - terials such as tar paper and burlap keep out the light and are nesting places for injurious insects. THE PASSING BEYOND OF "FATHER HARRISON" C. S. Harrison was born at Edmeston, Otsego county, New York, Nov. 24th, 1832 and died at his home at York, Nebraska Feb. 23rd 1919, in his eighty-seventh year. This remarkable man, human dynamo, veteran horticulturist, en - thusiast, optimist, always eloquent, urging, appealing and advising the upbuilding of horticulture in its broadest sense. Through his influence the uplift in horticulture has been, and will always remain a great factor in Nebraska. He planted and created new varieties that have added a wealth of bloom to our state. We can see him on the platform — his powerful figure, his energy, and his wonderful word painting carrying the audience with him and leaving the impression that he talked from the heart, and his great love of the beautiful. He loved work. Not alone did his active brain work but physically he labored to the utmost, often sixteen to eighteen hours a day.

We will miss him but yet we will commune with his even after he has passed away through his many books, which he so carefully prepared during his active life. We will read his books and follow the advice given in the priceless articles written by him on the Phlox, Iris, Peony and many others. In this way we will live near him and be reminded of the good things he left all of us to enjoy. 'lamer Harrison" Resolutions passed by the Nebraska State Horticultural Society in memory of Father Harrison. Resolved that in the demise of Father Harrison our Society has lost a most useful member, the State a noble character, and horticulture an indefatigable, untiring friend. And, that a copy of these resolutions be recorded in our annual re - port, and a copy be sent to his family, and that his picture be hung in the Hall of Agricultural Achievement, with other notables, with ap - propriate ceremonies.

August 22, 1919 On October 9, at 9 a. m. the Secretary of the Interior will open to entry at Powell, Wyo., a tract of land containing 79 farm units in the Shoshone irrigation project. The irrigation system has been constructed and water will be available for preparing the land thi» fall. In order to file on one of these farms it is necessary to execute a water right application upon a form provided for that purpose, and to deposit therewith five per cent of the construction charge, which .has been fixed at $90 per irrigable acre. Such water right applications may be filed with the Project Manager of the U. S. Reclamation Service in person, by mail, or otherwise, within a period of five days beginning October 4, 1919, to and including 9 a. m. October 9. Where there are two or more water right applications for the same farm unit a drawing will be held to determine the successful applicant. Unsuccessful applicants will have their deposits promptly returned. The remainder of the construction charge must be paid in fifteen annual installments, the first of which shall become due and payable December The Shoshone project embraces about 150.000 acres in northwestern Wyominp is a region of great scenic beauty and healthful climate. More than 33,000 acres included in 624 farms are now in cultivation and in 1918 produced a crop valued at $1,370,000. Numerous transfers have been made at prices ranging from $200 to $300 per acre for improved ranches. General farming, livestock raising, and dairying are the lead - ing industries. The principal markets are the local towns of the pro - ject, Billings, Montana, Omaha, and Sioux City. Excellent transporta - tion facilities are furnished by the C. B. &amp; Q. Railway line and branches, which extend throughout the project. September 22, 1919. From National Automobile Chamber of Commerce, 7 East 42nd Street, New York City. </seg>

WEBER Amateur Editor, First Year "NEBRASKA HORTICULTURE" NOTICE Secretary Porter goes to War. rOur secretary has done a commendable act in offering his services the Government. Mr. Porter goes to Fort Riley, January 5th to enter a training camp. The Board of Directors at a meeting December 28th after congratulating Mr. Porter on the action he had taken, granted him leave of absence for the period of the war. B. R. B. Weber was elected acting Secretary of the Society. Mr. eber has had extensive experiences in Horticulture in Colorado. He has been superintendent of the State Farm orchard for the past three years. R. F. Howard. Editorial "Don't view me with a critics eye, just pass my imperfection bye." Editor. OUR BOW OR SALUTATION In accepting the position of secretary of the Nebraska State Horti - cultural Society, I find myself, over night, a full fledged editor of the "Nebraska Horticulture." It is rather a sudden change from the orchard to a position where one is expected to know everything — and tell what he knows in a way that others will understand him. It reminds me of a story about General Grant; one evening he was passing a building where a labor meeting was being held, and "dropped in" to hear what they had to say; the General took a seat in the back row in the corner, hoping to avoid notice, but the chairman recognized him and insisted that he make a speech. The General thanked him for the honor, and said that although he could make an impromptu speech, he very much preferred a week to think it over, and if they would wait till the next meeting he would make a few remarks. So in time I may be a kind of an editor, but it might not be until after many of our readers have gone where good editors go. But all editors are good (fellows), and I have often followed their advice — especially when I decided that they were right. I followed the advice of Horace Greeley to young men to come west and grow up with the country, coming to Nebraska forty years ago. While I have strayed — and at one time was almost stolen to make it interesting and profitable to every member of the society — let us hear from everyone who is interested and has something on his mind. </seg>

Thanking you in advance for your co-operation and assistance in making our paper of the greatest possible benefit to our society, I am yours. THE (SO-CALLED) EDITOR P. S. This thing has grown to such length that I feel I should change from my bow to my first epistle to pomalogists? B. R. B. Weber. The Annual Meetings Of "Organized Agriculture" is a thing of the past (37 in all) and one can hardly realize what good is accomplished by these organizations — by exchanging thoughts and having the best equipped men in their certain field who have made great research diving to the very bottom to te able to instruct those who do not have the time, to bring it to us as it were, in a "nut shell." Some who have not seemed to realize what this all means to our great commonwealth, sometimes say the money spent in experiments and study could be better spent in some other ways. But they simply have not looked into it close enough to realize its very great importance. To illustrate: take for an example Prof. Cooper's experiment on "Canker Control." I take this for I know he put in months of faithful time studying and working on this, not only on the tops of trees and their branches — but dug many ditches and worked on the roots, and when he had proved to himself what he had learned, could come before the society and present it in a way by Cird and picture that he could stand up and face the most skeptical and swer their questions without hesitation by yes or no. Now let us ask the question: was not all of this time well spent, and would we ever know this if he or some one else had not done the work? And we could </seg>

The orchardist or farmer could never have this knowledge and would be fighting in the dark. Let us have more light is the cry that thrills the progressive. "After an attendance which broke former records, the apple, corn potato show at the city auditorium under the auspices of the horticultural section of organized agriculture closed at 4 o'clock Friday afternoon. Many of the exhibits were bought by individuals and some of the largest by merchants. One bought the apple display of the state farm and resold it to eager buyers. One apple grower, to show that he was a good fellow, gave away considerable fruit to a crowd of boys. The treat stopped when the boys formed an "endless chain" and at - tempted to get more than one apple each. The price offered for fruit and vegetables and corn were awarded to the winners. The total attendance was 15,500." Help If those wanting help of any kind or those who want work of any kind, will send their wants to us, we will try to get them together absolutely free. We will thank you for the names and addresses of those you know who are interested in better Horticulture. There is so much waste in faulty apples,. that the question arises, cannot the state council of defense or some other organization who have the authority, command that this fruit be made up into vinegar. Thous - rs of dollars could be conserved in this way. They tell others what to why not the men who have fruit? Lincoln's Birthday, Feb. 12, '18 I knew him personally when a child. We children that he played with never thought he was homely. He had a big hand and foot, but a bigger heart. He loved children. But with that gentle, sympathetic spirit. He was firm as a rock and never sanctioned wrong for a minute. He was proud enough of his country to fight to preserve it. By older folk he was known as Honest Abe — by us children Uncle Abe. He learned to write with charcoal, later participated in the greatest debate in history. Every time I pass his monument I want to take off my hat and read that greatest speech made by that greatest American at Gettys - burg. We have just received the copy from the stenographer, Miss Ethel Flood,, of the complete report of the annual meetings just held, which in our opinion, and of all we have asked, that it reflects credit to any one of the profession.

All pruning wounds should be disinfected and covered, since the spores of blister canker must always gain entrance thru wounds. These and other facts of interest to apple growers are con - tained in Bulletin No. 161, "Methods of Controlling Blister Canker," just issued by the Nebraska Experimental Station. The bulletin is written in a popular style and is well illustrated. Free copies may be obtained by writing to the Bulletin Clerk, University Farm, Lincoln, Neb. Breaking a Bad Habit A number of methods have been suggested to keep hogs from eating chickens. Several have recommended the very sensible plan of feeding oats or tankage along with corn. They claim the hogs want variety and protein and the pian seems to work well. Some have advised the feed - ing of salt pork (fat) to the offending hogs. One friend kills a chicken or, if necessary, several of them, cuts them open, seasons them well with cayenne pepper lets hogs eat them and keeps them from water for several hours. Another attaches a few inches of very light chain to the hogs nose by means of a ring. Others put a ring in front of each ear and suspend from these a piece of tin or leather large enough to cover the hog's face. Pomology Fascinating I can think of no subject more fascinating than the tree and fruit. Often we forget how much the tree is like a human being; there is life, the body, the trunk, the arms, its branches, the feet, its roots and blood, its sap. The tree has habits that require care from the start or it goes wrong, like the boy sowing his "wild oats." If it is allowed to run wild for a very long period of time, it will become entangled with bad com - pany that pulls it down and "saps" it, and it is a hard task to restore such a tree to its proper shape and replenish its lost vigor. But it is not necessary for the boy to sow "wild oats," or for the tree to become the prey of the brier, etc. What could be more fascinating than the grow - ing and caring for a good tree — unless it should be caring for a boy — and if properly cared for from the start it is not much trouble to make either, or both of them good. But if you let them have their own way, come in contact with "bad company" — as many do — you will find it an up-hill business to line either up again on the proper level. Just a few illustrations of the "fellow" who knows and can tell in fluent language just how to raise a family, or a tree — but himself fails to do either properly. We have all met men who could tell just how to raise a boy — but would not point to his own boy with pride; then the people who preach "cleanliness is next to godliness," but would not invite an inspection of their own back yard or basement; and the one who admonishes that we should always keep "sweet" and have a "smile that never comes off," but it is better not to hear them talk in the home or orchard when they think there is no one near; or you may have noticed </seg>

In all such cases one cannot but feel that shame should take the place of sham — but let us see how it is with the fruit man. How often the fruit man goes to the winter meetings and fruit show and decides that he knows all about caring for fruit trees; he exercises great care in making his choice and places an order for trees of the very highest quality — he has learned that it pays to plant the best available stock — and then in perfectly good faith he has firmly determined to give HIS trees the advantage of everything that results from the most careful and painstaking care. But how about it when the trees are delivered during the busy spring season — does he forget the good resolutions made when he selected and placed the order for his stock. Have we not seen him, apparently forgetting all he learned, grab the spade and hurriedly dig a hole half the size it should be, mash the roots together like a ball, jam dirt in till the hole is full — never at - tempting to press it firmly about the roots, and notwithstanding a dry season completely forgets to properly water the tree. Later he pastures his stock in the orchard which results in breaking and other - wise destroying the trees. And yet this man will not hesitate to advise you that "it don't pay to put your land in fruit." In the cold light of reason we can all agree that such a man would profit by having a guardian. An we have all read of the father who would lead you into the barn - yard and glibly give you the pedigree of all his stock — sire, dam, age, etc., but if you ask him the age of his bright little son who has followed him, he carelessly says you must ask the boy's mamma; and also of the young lady who applied for a position as maid, and noticing a dog nicely blanketed and bedecked with bows of ribbons, hesitatingly as - serted that she did not like dogs and would not want the job of dressing him — whereupon the lady curtly informed the prospective maid that no one was permitted to care for the doggie but herself, and that the duty of the maid would be the care of the baby. . . And so we find that often the child and the tree are treated (or mistreated) alike, and yet good results are expected. But let us get the idea thoroughly impressed upon our minds that no matter how much we may know, or how weak we can tell it, if we do not put such knowledge into practice in the care of the child or the tree, the knowledge is in vain, and the boy or the tree will suffer. But I suggested there is something fascinating about pomology, or fruit growing. Let us start at the nursery: first we go to the top of a healthy tree (of the kind we want to grow) and cut off a thrifty scion of last year's growth, then take a root off another tree, split them both carefully and just alike and push the two together like two pairs of lips kissing — wrap them together and lay them in bed (of sand) as though married; later when you take them out the two are made one. We call this grafting. Is this not fascinating.? In due course of time </seg>

(I have on my desk a book containing 197 recipes for cooking the apple.) In the course of the life of the tree the doctor conies with his medicine (spray) that we must apply outwardly. This is fascination — I do not mean the material but the work of applying it at just the right time and place to keep away all bad company that, if permitted, will do harm to both the tree and the fruit; here you use the spray gun, like shooting the bird in the eye, so as not to spoil the meat. Then still later comes the picking — and it must be done just right or you may ruin the crop, and possibly steal next year's crop at the same time. Then finally comes the packing in barrels or boxes — and this too must be done with care — but the work is all very fascinating.

The High Cost of Patches (Zim in Cartoons Magazine) There is no economy in patches. You may have a frugal wife who persists in patching your trousers, but you always feel miserable and degraded in such garments. They make you feel like a thief, or like 30 cents in counterfeit money. You are forever trying to hide them from view. Now, if ladies wore patches in the seats of their — dresses, you'd entertain the same disgust for them as the general public does for you in your patches. I have worn them myself and I know how uneasy a man feels in good society when he expects each gust of wind to fan his coattails aside, exposing his wife's needlework. A patch in the seat of your trousers, if it be accidentally exposed in public, will reduce your market value 99% per cent. If you cannot afford so sudden and enormous a decline in your stocks and are not prepared to cover margins, you'd better accept a fool's advice and unload your holey belongings upon the ragman before your wife gets out her darning needle and patch We Take Issue I think a good many fruit people will take issue with the above. If conservation means anything it means neat patches — on the orchardist and farmers' pants — as is said above, it would be "a fool's advice" to go up into a thorny tree with a fine pair of pants and silk socks. For the first time he came down there would be a place for a patch, and if he would go home on a car he would be hiding behind some one or holding his hand over the hole. The patches my wife puts on, instead of making me "feel like a thief" thrills me with the thought that I married a saving machine. I kiss her for it, and go out to show </seg>

Another Good Man Leaving the University Prof, of Horticulture, J. R. Cooper. Does it seem a mistake, or too bad, that as fast as our men get where they are most useful, having worked out experiments that are appreciated by the schools that are looking always for the best, are allowed to take them — because of a few dollars. I know personally the earnest efficient effort Prof. J. R. Cooper, horticulturist, has put into this work for the past three years and be - lieve it will be hard to fill his place EDITORIAL Nebraska Press Association We attended the annual meeting of the Nebraska Press Association for the first time. Met a lot of the "boys" I have known and got ac - quainted with many more. Some of the old members wanted to know what business I had there. I told them I did not have to grow from a "devil" to editor, as many of them did, nor did I have to sling (and pi) type for years before I could even be a reporter, nor was I an editor because my father had been an editor, but that I was a "natural born editor," just "over the top." These state editors are a fine bunch of men; and they all seemed to thoroughly enjoy themselves while in Lin - coln, especially at the banquet given by the Lincoln Commercial Club. As the winter session is a purely business session, they all went at the good thing in a business way. The talented glee clug or "Wrecking Crew" made merry business for the members who are about to be forced into the political arena by their friends — of course, against their will — but subject to draft for the good of patriotism. Some of the songs showed wonderful composition (?) and hints (?) are worthy of space in this magazine.

The telegrams received by the "Wrecking Crew" were clever; they were surely 'hits right off the bat" — wish we had space to include them in this write up. But seriously, we must not fail to mention some of the speeches. Mr. Ross Hammond's speech was full of interest; coming fresh from the trenches in France his vivid word picture of the war zone was captivating. The address of welcome by Mr. Sawyer at the banquet encouraged all to feel safe while in the city. Mayor Miller's address of welcome at the association meeting was full of good words, and was fully appreciated, as shown by the hearty applause. Governor Howard's response was replete with verbage and style original and such that no one need try to imitate. The speech of the retiring president, Mr. Perkins, will hold an honored place in the records of the associa - tion. Space forbids mention of many other fine speeches. The gover - nor's speech at the banquet was thoroughly enjoyed; with true (?) stories he illustrated "how others see him" — like this: "He had trans - gressed the law in Omaha by cutting corners in crossing a block, and upon being halted by a policeman tried to apologize, but was ordered to pass on, while the officer soothed his feeling by saying that he knew he was a "country boob" as soon as he saw him. Several members evidenced very great interest in being WATCHED and "pocketed" the same tokens of respect and esteem. This is not Horticulture — but it is "Nebraska Horticulture" and we stand for both. It takes a mighty conscientious man to tell the difference between when he is tired and when he is lazy.

I have often grown 5 and 6 crops on same land. This utilizing space means conservation. You can't stir the soil too often or too deep, especially if dry, at least twice each week, whether top is growing nicely or not, and does but little good only to scratch the surface. One good, deep hoeing is worth one-half dozen times over with a little garden plow. Spraying and Prnuing Almost any paper you pick up tells about the importance of pruning and spraying, which shows what a change have come over the people in the past few years — brought about by experiment and practical examin - ations, and this cannot be to strongly emphasized — you can learn how, when and the material to do this properly — by asking for an "Extension Bulletin No. 29, by Prof. J. R. Cooper, University Farm," free. The taxpayers are paying for this and every one interested should have it in his home. If you do not know how and when and the materials your work will be a failure. Speaking About Change I Saw This Somewhere George Washington ate with his knife.

It commences Monday evening, May 20, and closes Saturday morning, May 25. This Congress is open to those who attended the Congress last year and to all Nebraska boys and girls who have completed, since June 1, 1917, one or more of the pro - jects of work outlined by the Extension Service at Lincoln. The Junior Fanners' Congress is a short course in agriculture and home economics lasting one week. The daily program will include visits to places of interest about the State Farm to give the boys and girls an idea of the nature of the work being carried on there. In ad - dition, talks will be given dealing with different agricultural and home economics subjects. It is a week of school at the Nebraska State, Farm, an unusual opportunity for the boys and girls to get some information as to the work being carried on at the State Farm. To all those boys and girls who have won free trips to this Con - gress this year there will be no expense. To those who did not win a. free trip a fee of not over $6.00 will be charged to cover actual ex - penses while in the city. This will include board and lodging be - ginning with supper, Monday night, May 20, and including breakfast Saturday morning, May 25. In addition, it will include necessary street car fare in taking such trips about the city as are arranged for by the Extension Service. Each boy and girl, not winning a free trip, will of course pay his or her own railway fare and other expenses en route. Committees will meet all trains on which delegates will arrive and the boys and girls will be continually under the supervision of competent, persons. More detailed information will be published later concerning the pro - gram and other details of the Congress. Address all correspondence regarding the Congress to Arthur G. George, Ass't State Club Leader, University Farm, Lincoln, Nebraska. War The war is a frightful thing in many ways — and some of the things that are claimed to be official. We can hardly believe to be true. And this is not altogether the horrible thing about Germany. But the outrageous things the investigations are bringing out of war profiteers. Such as J. F. Heany viz., the Powerful Packers, and the maneuvers of the railroads, etc., and because a man not a profiteer tells about "Barnacle Committee," he is kicked out to give notice to others that the dear servants of the people will protect them from insinu - ations by bridling the tongues of publicity, and you are already branded as an outcast.

The paths across the State House lawn, right er the signs "Please Keep on the Walks," is the evidence. EDITORIAL Reputation vs. Character CWe have been asked to write a story alone our line of work. And reason we have christened it thus — I've seen head lines sell well, and are read, if nothing else in the paper is read. And we are anxious that some part be read. While we have told lots of stories — when a boy — we have never tried to write one before. But we think we have a better reputation now, and would like this to continue. But there is a wide difference between reputation and character. Others may think you have a fine character, and later find to their sorrow the mistake. How many times have we seen this in public men. They talk nice and act well until we feel they are entitled to our support, but when it conies to the acid test, we readily see the difference between reputation and character. Often we see a man that has studied and read what others have said about Horticulture till he has a flux of words that would surprise you, yet if you would send him to the orchard for five apples of ten different kinds he would fail utterly. We know this for we have seen it tried, and we will at least stake our reputation on what we are about to say in this story (that is a truth). First, we want to hold the attention of the young men till they may realize that they are missing a chance of their lives in not making a greater study of the orchard and garden (for that's my business) . There is always an opening for those who have embraced the required know - ledge and if you climb to the top round of the ladder, you will find a good salary, a most charming business, and in a sense, are perform - ing a great benefit to mankind. The first thing is to know (if not already) that the state has provided all the equipment in one of the best collegs in the United States to make it possible to "go over the top." You are paying your share of the tax to make this possible, and right now, there are openings awaiting your finish, so it is a good time to get into the swim as the "water is fine." The best thing to do is to go to the state farm and get in touch with Professor Howard and Professor Hood. Ask hem all kinds of questions, for they will gladly give any information available. The same can be said of the agricultural college. We knew a man who took the full course, then went to his country cousins to tell them how to farm — knew all about the soil and crops — but when he was sent to the farm for a team, he tried to put the collar on upside down. They sent him to the field for a harrow and he brought back a disk. </seg>
            <seg id="p131">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 131 This was no discredit to him, for he was raised in town and had no practical knowledge. We could go on and show that you may have a splendid reputation for any kind of work but you must have practical knowledge or it is uphill business. We had a letter from a soldier friend, who was a graduate from college, a football fiend, and a man of whom all were proud. They gave him credit for two years' cadet work that he never did, and the first time he saluted an officer, he made such an error that (in his own words) he was bawled out before the whole com - pany by the officer: "This is the kind of men they turn out from the state university after two years of drill." Our soldier lost his reputation and hurt the standing of his college. Yet, he was in a sense, not any more to blame than the college, and while it is absolutely necessary to have this book knowledge, the practice is of great benefit. The men at the head of our Horticulture Department are men who have dug their way there, thru the practical by sheer muscular and mind force (and would not doubt that you would find this the case in other colleges) and thru years of book experiments, tests of all kinds helping to make a finished product from what might have been considered raw material ( such as was Mr. Lincoln). The old lady said "books are all right, but a little common sense is not to be sneezed at." Now I don't know how much space I am expected to use, but if you get my object in this crude original way, I shall be satisfied. It is a bid to increase interest in pomology — and while you must have theory, you will profit by working it out. The good book says something like this: 'Faith without works is dead," and we don't want any dead ones in Horticulture, and if your character is right, you will have the reputation — so it's up to you. Tussock Moth The city is performing a great work to eradicate this pest, and has put new life in the tree lover. Many of us can remember when a tree was a "thing of beauty and a joy forever." But since the cities have become parks, we have grown careless. I don't know how much ground was covered in the drive, but you can yet see thousands of them be - tween the state house and O street, that would be much better if in the fire and these are not hard to reach. County Agents "County agents throughout the state are starting a concerted move - ment for the eradication of the gopher. So many of the agents have been laying stress on the matter that it now seems to have assumed state - wide proportions. The week of April 8-13 has been set as the time for beginning the campaign. In many of the county papers the formulae for preparing the poison have been published, as well as the method of application. In the western portion of the state, one water users' as - sociation has spent as much as $14,000 in one year in this work and this year they have secured a specialist who will have charge of gopher eradication over the whole district." </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT This is worthy of notice to everyone. We have advocated this by speech and pen for years. It was talked at the state farm and then in the Journal. Afterward we learned the reason those who brought in many scalps could get no pay. The legislature had passed a bill paying a bounty of 10 cents per head for same. But it seems it was left with the commissioners whether they wanted gophers or conservation of this enormous waste, and while not particular about $100 to feather some other nest, they decided the 10 cents was too big as a thing for them to sanction. This was also talked of in our annual meetings. But no com - mittee was appointed to wait on them. They told those who brought scalps in that it was worth that to their own farms, yet some did not own the land, and others told them as fast as they caught them they came over from neighbors that did not catch them, but to no avail. But we feel that any farmer and farm organization will back up this drive by the co-agents. Spraying We see this word so much these days that it seems everything has been said that can be said on the subject. But it is of such importance it will do no harm to have some of the things repeated — and resaid again. And as we have not written on this subject — and only know of its bene - fits by practical knowledge, and demonstration — and while I can't make as vivid a picture as the professors, and others have done, I can tell in a simple, original manner what I know and think about spraying. First, I find that many people have the idea that spraying is only to free or rid the tree and fruit from worms, fungus, etc., and do not seem to realize that it not only does this, but also protects the tree itself — and adds not only clean fruit, but more bushels. I have seen an esti - mate of a correct record of four sprayings made in a large orchard which cost less than 40 cents per tree. Every other tree was left unsprayed and the fruit from the sprayed trees brought $4.00 per tree more than the others, and you can sell an apple that is perfect and good size when you can't give a poor one away. I have many times taken apples from the state farm to the stores. They would say, "chuck full," "can't handle them," etc. I would say they are from the state farm better look at them, and almost invariably they would say "I will have to have some — but must hide them till I get rid of the others that were small and wormy" (they would get twice as much for ours). The first spraying should be put on when color is shown on the blossom — and not yet opened up. This is for scab, canker worm, curculio and other pests. Use lime, sulphur and lead arsinate. Keep your spray rod or gun in constant motion. Generally a down stroke hits more in the right spot. But will have to throw it underneath a few that are near the ground and drooping. Make a direct shot at every blossom, leaf and the trunk itself. The second or calix spray is put on about three weeks later. This is for the codling moth, worms and scab, and the brood from the moth etc. You can repeat this in about three weeks again. But another should be put on about July. You can use Bordeaux mixture if you prefer it. But </seg>

But if you will only ask, we will send you a bulletin covering the whole matter — formulas and all. And let me add that if you are not going to care for the orchard, cut it into wood and conserve that much coal, and sow the land to wheat. Don't neglect the spraying by saying you are too busy, as there is nothing more essential and will bring better results. Better say you have not time for the other things. I say this because I am in earnest about it. Conservation If you have a large hog lot that you can plow up and put in oata, and later sow rape in the oats, you can harvest the oats and have some fine pasture for hogs and sheep and chicks till it freezes. Pride That Pays While the back yard and basement must be kept clean on account of germs — there is nothing adds more to the home than a nicely kept lawn and some nice flowers. If you own it and want to rent or sell it, it means money in your pocket. You will sit on your front porch and hear many exclamations of passersby, "such a beautiful home." "I like that, and others — and your pride answers to the suggestions. It costs but little in work or dollars — and you will soon have your neighbor fall in line, and others will follow until you will have many talking about that beautiful part, and will drive visitors to see it, as everybody wants to keep up with the Jones. All this brings us to the point we want to emphasize. LISTEN. Look on page 130, class N. 3 of the state fair premium list, and you will find some premiums to be awarded by the horticultural society at the state fair for well kept lawns, gardens and orchards — which appeals to those who have an eye for art and beauty. It is not the value of the prize that counts, but you will be proud to be able to say, "I just took a little time and trouble to make my lawn, garden or orchard look nice and be profitable — and I took a picture of it five different times while it was growing, then took them to the state fair and they were placed in an exhibit of this nature and I carried off the prize and feel quite chesty I tell this to my friends." Is it not worth while to help the fair by helping yourself? Of course it is— 'go to it." Appeal for Help We have asked everyone interested in our magazine, and the work we are trying to do, to send us articles, or information to show where improvement can be made in the building up of horticulture in our state. And to those who have questions bothering them, not to hesitate to send them in so we can try to have them answered.

But it is only because we need this information, and we have such confidence in the men and interest in this work, that has been done at the agricultural college — by actual experiments and tests — that we just want everybody to know it. For what has been done there, others can do, and the heads of depart - ments are always ready to show. But as they are feeling that way, it is your duty to jump in and help us out.

Did you see all those women during the late session of the legislature, sitting in the galleries knitting to win the war, while keeping in touch with the workings of that body on the soldier voting law, sedition law, and all other essentials to win the war? Have you seen on the steam and street cars, women busy knitting to win the war? I have seen them walking on the street and knitting to win the war. Have you seen them at the Y. W. C. A., the Red Cross and the nurses all doing their part to win the war, and many other places all over the nation, not to mention the work being done in the homes and not only by women but by girls and boys— doing not their BIT — I don't like that word — but doing their BEST to win the war? Have you stopped to realize what all this means in dollars and cents — and a thousand times more in protecting and saving the lives of our noble boys at the front? We have been thru the state farm orchard and found the plums, pears and early crabs full of bloom. Some of the early varieties are in - jured and will likely fall off. Apples are alright. The Oldenburg and many others are well loaded. The latter kind are hardly along enough to tell. However there are some that will not have as heavy crop as last Spraying Potatoes With Bordeaux mixture will increase the yield. But to get the beetle you must add Paris Green or lead ar senate.

            <seg id="p137">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 137 EDITORIAL Honor Nebraska Builders We had the privilege and pleasure of attending "Nebraska Hall of Fame" meeting at state farm last week. The beginning of the History of Early Nebraska and the men who have achieved an honorary place, bringing out of "The Great American Desert" as shown on the early maps, most miraculous results in so short a time, and like is said about the war. We are just beginning to show what will be achieved later on. Space forbids only a mere mention of the meeting. There was the unveiling of the portraits of five of the great men who made the fight against all odds to start the desert to bloom as a rose. J. Serling Morton, Robert W. Furnace, Chas. E. Bessey, Isaac Pollard and R. H. Daniels. All but the latter (who made this a fine stock state) were trees, fruit and flower men. Morton's name echoes around the world, as the in - troducer of "Arbor Day." There is only one Furnace, great for trees, a great editor, and with Morton both statesmen and held many positions of trusts while of opposite parties and very active, they were always warm friends. (This is one achievement that many politicians have never accomplished.) The world knows Dr. Bessey as the great botanist, but we know him as the father of many of the great achievements and university has attained and his absolute unselfishness. Pollard is the synonym of apple in Nebraska, and his son is treasuring that reputa - tion, but beside this, he was a great lover of trees and flowers of every kind to beautify home. You will find at his home almost any kind that grows in this climate, and such care has been taken of his apple trees that many of these planted over 40 years ago are still bearing. Daniels was a great pure Shorthorn breeder and surely the first to try in Western Nebraska. Had some very hard years and all kinds of trouble, but he had a wonderful bull dog tenacity to hold on and proved to the world a success. Mrs. Thomas Andrews, after a short talk, submitted manuscript of the early life of many in the Republican Valley, which will be made a part of the record of the society. As each portrait was reviewed, a tribute was paid to their memory. J. Sterling Morton Jr., of Chicago responded to his grand father's in a well chosen address. A. E. Sheldon presented Mr. Furnace and if Mr. Furnace could have heard what he said he surely would have felt he was repaid in appreciation for all the struggles of his early strenuous days. Just one sentence in his address: "The victory of this war will be won by what men such as Morton and Furnace proved that this part of our country can feed the world." Dean E. A. Burnett responded to Dr. Bessey. He said, among other things, feelingly — "Dr. Bessey more than any one else laid the foundation for a great institution and proved that not only can an </seg>
            <seg id="p138">138 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT economic strength be built from latent material resources, but that character can be built from latent material of the soul." Ernest M. Pollard, son of Isaac P. presented his father's picture. He said it would have been much easier to sit and hear some one else perform this duty (and we could all realize that), but his address was timely and full of meat from the very inside that others could not have been acquainted with. Some might have made it in more glowing terms, but the kind, simple way he told the story thrilled the audience — nothing of the boastful — but what his father did for Nebraska was because of his natural courage and unflinching interest in this commonwealth. Mr. Harvey of Omaha was to respond to Mr. Daniels, but could not be present, but sent manuscript for the occasion. The portraits were accepted by E. P. Moore in behalf of the board of regents in a splendid speech. President Bassett's address was mostly a business talk but was made resting and full of good suggestions. Lit gives me pleasure to say I knew of these men personally, have seen the fruits of their earnest efforts grow, blossomed, ripened into fruitful achievements, that will continue to bear fruit, while their faces have passed from our view (only as we look on these pictures). Their names never will be forgotten. Nearly 40 years ago I had the privilege of a very pleasant trip to the great world's exposition at New Orleans with Dr. Bessey and while many in that party were much younger, he was as jolly a companion as were among us, and easy the one most looked up to. It is in keeping for me to take a little space re - ferring to these men and this meeting, because they are all fruit men except one, and Mr. Pollard, a naturally born and by adoption, a real horticulturist, I only wish I could give the addresses in full as would interest every Nebraskan. Now to cut this short, I want to say that they were all 100, percent Nebraskans. May 18, 1918. Pardon Us But we have many compliments from our near friends — both verbal and written and from others whom we have never known, such as this one from American Fruit Pub. Co., Rochester, N. Y., and we appreciate them and in this way want to thank all of them since we never write an editorial, but we feel our inability and crude original style, having such a wide circulation even across the sea. B. R. B. Weber, Lincoln, Nebr. Dear Sir: Permit me to say that you are getting out a very creditable society publication, one which should do much to keep interest in the organization affairs active and thus maintain and extend membership. </seg>
            <seg id="p139">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 139 Are You Patriotic or Just Playing It I Can you realize how many million dollars goes up in smoke from your mouth? Do you realize how many million dollars are spit out be - tween your teeth? Have you stopped to think how many dollars you chewed up in gum? Do you think of the gasoline you are using for pleasure that can be saved for business and how much is spent in the playing of games and put into trifling picture shows? These are only a very few of the things that are absolutely worthless and some even ■worse, as they are harmful, and you have not the patriotism to give them up in this struggle between life and death. What hypocrites we mortals are. Just as well acknowledge it, and be honest. Pests There are many thousands of these and Professor Bruner can tell them by name and their occupation. A few of the most common are divided into two classes, viz: Those who do their meanness by chewing. These may be handled by spraying with Paris Green and lead arsenite. You can destroy with kerosine emulsion. For fungus you use Bordeaux mixture. While we do not have space for these formulas, you may re - ceive them by dropping us a card. Another Call For Help As we have said in former issues that we are willing to serve as best we can in trying to make our paper interesting and profitable as far as our ability goes, and you need not be afraid that you will be blamed for the editorials; as you will not find any others that can sling English in our original way, in telling what we know about Horticulture. But we need help and you who know and can tell it much better should </seg>

Several have promised us articles and never give them, but when we call for them they say, "we have been too busy to get our mind on anything but the every day grind, but will get it next time," etc. But when I get my proof sheet there is one editor what I can point with pride to, and that is my little pocket scissors, if I have plenty of good pasture to pick from. Early Lettuce Last fall after my lettuce had gone to seed in the garden I piled up the old stalks, cultivated the land thoroughly then threshed out the seed from the stalks on this and later covered the bed all over with mulch of leaves. In the spring when the ground thawed out about 3 inches I raked off the cover and had lettuce on the table long before any was grown from seed sown in the spring. In this way you save the resetting from hot beds and get it earlier. Spray Nozzle We have been asked relative to the best kind of nozzle to use in spraying. We have used a good many kinds. In our opinion there is but little choice, at least it's not so important as to the kind, as to get the spray in the right spot regardless of the nozzle. If you prefer to eat jell with a knife rather than a fork or spoon, its all right, just so you get it to the place you are driving at. I heard of a little boy once said, "Jell was too nervous to eat only with a spoon." You most have the right material and properly mixed and if your disk is small you will need to use your rod much slower than if disk is larger. While we don't advertise anything I believe you can save more with the "Spray Gun" called by some, "Fruit Fog." I suppose they are in the market. You can do the work in the same time and a little easier to handle than the long rod, and saves one man, can have a wide mist spray, covering the whole side of the tree or in an instant change to a strong stream reaching a very high top or a lapping branch. If you think it advisable, try one. I was afraid of it at first because it was a gun and thought it might be pro-German. As they think of a gun for everything and while it will not kill every time you pull the trigger, even with lota of force and would not carry up 70 miles. The main idea is to spray the most with the least material and shortest hours. Especially this year of </seg>

Often at two years old, it gets to be an inch in diameter, red and very juicy, fine for jell. Cross Pollination Is becoming to be a general thing. In mixing varieties they should be of kinds blooming at same time of year. It is said that self pollin - ation acts as in breeding, and light bearers is the result. I am asked about shade trees for lawns. The Russian Olive Stand drouth and heat and are attractive. The blossoms are very fragrant. Sycamore, Hackberry and Elm are all good. I can't tell whether it is in the engine, or the soil, or the driver, or in the fellow on the tower that causes it to rain every time we be - gin to spray, and often have to go right over it the second time, as it is washed off before it drys. We have to mud it then with something more or less than 10 pounds of mud on each foot. As we can't lay off in this business for the bugs won't wait for their meals. This year only a shower but did come. Braces for Overbearing Trees While it is harmful, it is also amusing and very inconvenient to go into an orchard that has been braced up with forks and sticks under the heavy limbs, and often these at the outer ends, are breaking down, and many apples laying on the ground still hanging to the branches. There are a good many ways to prevent this if you begin in time. While the fruit is small and branches upright, take a piece of strong' twine, run one end of 'it through a piece of rubber hose, tie this around the center of the tree near the top leaving the loop of hose quite loose around the trunk, then slip on another short piece of hose and take this down to the full branch below and throw it around it just in front or outside of a limb, or little beyond where the fruit will balance it as it is matured. Run it through the piece of hose and bring it up around the limb snug so it won't rub as the wind blows. Continue in this way till you have laced all the heavy limbs up to the trunk like lacing a shoe and this will all be out of the way and mostly out of sight. Will not injure the trees. The hose will give a little, and much cooler than to put sacks or bunches of paper around the limb, and no place to harbor insects, as you have often seen when setting out new trees of any size to brace them with wires anchored to the ground and fastened around the fork above to anchor them. Another kind of brace can be used to advantage if taken in time. Many trees not properly headed branch out in two forks and are almost Spraying vs. Rain </seg>

But if you watch carefully you can often find two limbs growing toward each other over the forks (not neces - sarily on a level). You can braid or twist them together across or be - tween these forks lightly and they will finally grow into a natural living brace rope and save the tree. I have seen whole orchards of pears braced as above with the twine. sfiuma, stamens Struwbcinj Many Want to Know About canker and its control and we can't have a bulletin with us all the time. If you tell them they forget it and so will tell in few words something about it and if there are any one who ask, we can send a bulletin. It is not hard to find and know blister canker. The name blister tells the shape and its action and canker if changed just a little to a word more common of later years, by changing the letter K to C, cancer. You will more quickly recognize this deadly foe, and while we don't believe in too freely use of the knife cure on man, there are times when it is all that will save him and when we begin in time you don't need to go so deep to cut it out or later to cut it off. KNow this is just exactly the same with the tree. If you begin when first shows, you can cut it out whether one inch or more deep. If it has gone through the limb, you may have to cut it off to keep it out of the trunk, and it may be saved when one-half through the trunk by gorging it all out. When you play the surgeon on the tree you must see that your tools and the wounds are thoroughly cleansed with corrosive sublimate, 1 part to 1000 parts of water, or 1 part carbolic acid to 500 water. Then cover all with liquid asphalatum. Coal oil is good to cleanse tools. Then use Bordeaux mixture or commercial lime sulphur. If for moth use arsenite of lead either paste or powder. No. 2% to 50 water powder 1% pound. </seg>

If not, it is well to know this simple way since everything is so high. Where the split or break comes, take a piece of common tire tape, begin to wrap around the hose one inch beyond the split. Make about one - half lap each round to one inch beyond the split. Then wrap back to the starting point, making a double layer over the break and you will be surprised how it will last. Profiteering Is much talked — and should be, and then something else done. The consumer is the fellow that feels it. You tell the farmer you can get a certain portion of some of the wheat he grows — you tell the coal man how much profit he can take on a ton of coal, and so many other things, but have you ever heard how much profit the man who sells autos makes on a machine. We have, for we have a friend in the business, and this government must know— and as a friend gave it away to me I will not give the name, but y*u will have no trouble to find out what the profit is. It is enormous, and all this money goes out of the state, much of it for cars for pleasure, joy rides, etc. Is this business too big for the government to fix the profits? There are many other big things that means so much. But seem to have some pull or cinch on the inside. Such as the breweries and dis - tillers. That business and question of the amount of grain and fuel they are permitted to use, is so preposterous that any sane person can absolutely see no excuse for those who have the authority to stop the damnable thing, and how they have the audacity in the face of this, to continually shout through the biggest megaphone and other channels to conserve the necessities of life, and give sanction to this hellish thing, that not only unfits our soldier boys, but makes them wallow in the mire of dishonor — don't waste while your wife saves. Wise Men's Minds Change Speaking of the war, Samuel Gompers now says, "I was made ill when I see or hear anyone suffering the slightest pain or anguish and yet I hold that it is essential that the sacrifices must be made that human - ity shall never again be cursed by a war such as the one which haa been thrust upon us." Theodore Warburg: "Can we afford to shake hands with the unholy thing — dripping with blood of innocents — known as Germany? Can we afford to make a pact with a deliberate violator of laws, human and divine." Mr. Bryan says, "Before the government acts, discussion is proper, after action obedience is duty. There is no reason why any one should discuss that which has been done. It may require some to hold their peace rather than risk creating discussion or discard. Speaking of the </seg>

It is the cleverest statement yet made of the terms of peace, and ought to make a profound impression on the world." - Mr. Taft says: "The allies cannot concede peace until they con - quer it. Germany left no door open except that which led to war. The cancer, if not to consume the body, must be cut out." Clarence Darrow says, "It may be the rich and poor, capital and labor, Catholic and Protestant, all classes, as we come together in one great common cause. Will serve each other better when the war is done." I Last week we had a very strange thing occur right on the front walk the state house. Hundreds viewed it. None had ever seen anything ; it. It was an army of worms about one-half inch long and traveled stamens . sTuj ma. pistil Currant or rolled in a mass together. They had a glassy appearance, and would move only in bunches. When knocked apart, they would stop and sulk or possum, for a time. Then, as they began to wiggle, would soon fall over each other till entangled in a ropy mass and then move on, the lead getting heavier as they proceeded. They had come from the ground and traveled about three feet on the walk by 8 a. m. We named them I. W. W., as they seemed to be traveling without anything in view. And when checked, had no friends or any thought of home. They were like one family. When we called Professor Bruner, he at once said they were known as Railway worms, and always travel in this manner. They do no damage, but develop into the little gnat fly we see around the barn yards and feed on fungus and deposit their eggs in de - cayed stumps and under the surface of the ground. Patriotism LWhen a man tells us how many Bonds and Thrift Stamps he has ked out, you know the war is a good thing for him. He is not giv - ing a cent, but receiving — having only found a safe security. But the one who has no bank account, borrows and pays interest on it, using that much less food and clothes, is the one that REALLY gives. Sacrifice </seg>

But ask Providence to help you The interest to raise On Bonds that you have purchased Then you deserve the praise. The Best Investment in the World From whatever angle it may be considered, an investment by an American citizen in Liberty Bonds or War Savings Stamps is the best investment in the world. The money so invested goes to the Government, which loans some of it to our allies; all of it is used in one way or another, to maintain, support, arm, equip and make victorious our armies and our allies in Europe. Surely no American money could be put to a better purpose. Here is an investment of our country, an investment in the efficiency, strength, safety, and success of our fighting men on sea and land. Shock Grain Have you ever tried to shock grain with a pitchfork? If you get used to it, you will never do it any other way. Lovers of Beauty It is not too late to again call your attention to one of the most important phases of our state fair premium list. Because it not only helps the fair but helps you, and your home surroundings and increases the interest of your neighbors to keep in the front row. It is a little thing but means much. You're subject to a premium if you have nice lawn, orchard or garden, if you will take a picture of it five times during the season and place them on exhibit at the fair.

Begin now. Talk Much In our last issue we wrote so much editorial we fear you got tired of it. But a good portion of it was to arouse others to help us out - those who know and can tell it in better language. No two tell things alike, yet both may be familiar with the subject. Our only object in getting out this paper is to try not only to make it readable but to interest and instruct our patrons in horticulure. And you can hardly go wrong by writing on almost any phase of the work, and often an - swering the questions on our desk better than we can and placing it where so many can have it, and save the scissors. Woman's Work Ever since we listened to the lecture before our society at last winter's meeting by Prof. Julia Vance (State Farm) when the hall should have been filled with housewives and only a half dozen were there, I have wondered if we make it plain that our society is not only for the men but for women as well, and that there is hardly an address that is not in some way interesting to women. Now if I am right about fis, won't some of our good brothers take this matter up and make campaign to get them to come out, at least to some of the meetings that will be especially for their benefit? If so, say "Yes", and let us arrange our program so they can do some of the talking. They like to talk and we know it, and if they have this opportunity it will increase our attendance. No only their presence will not only increase our attendance but to be honest, don't we all like to be around where they are? Now let me call your attention to a few subjects women re- </seg>
            <seg id="p147">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 147 spond to at the meetings in Canada: "War-time economy. Is a woman's time worth anything? Country lift as I found it. How women can aid agriculture. The vegetable garden, Poultry, Country work, Responsi - bility of courtship, Home dairy, Canning and drying," and many others. We have women that can give you something that will equal any of these and eager to tell about it. What do you think about it? As I look these over I wonder why we could not have a Woman's Day on the program. Mr. Lincoln said: "A mother is the greatest thing on earth." And I think we will find lots of them over the top if we have followed our mother's advice. Apples The outlook at this time for apples is very discouraging. The esti - mate in the western part of the state is 10 to 20 percent, caused by the late freezes. I have only been in the state farm orchards and others near by, and find they are dropping badly. They have grown slowly, and very uneven. The foliage is light and puny. I think 50 percent would be a fair estimate here. In the South where our large orchards are, competent men tell us that from 40 to 50 percent is all we can count on. And northeast the oldest orchard men "say not half crop. And many trees have hardly enough vitality to venture out at all. So it behooves all to conserve to the limit. Not one apple must be lost. Either can, dry, or make into cider. Children can pile your culls and ciders, and we believe we can get cider men to come and get them and pay for them or take them on shares, as they have asked how and where they can get into touch with them. I have agreed to ask for the address of those who wish to make an arrangement of this kind. While this may seem early, it is not. DO IT NOW. You know you will have no time then, and they must know about how many to arrange for. I will keep the names on file. As Abe would say: "Who remembers when the country boy would go to town and the city Dudes (I guess the name should be spelled with a small letter) would call him all kinds of names and derisions, such as Boob, Country Jake, etc." Times have changed, and the city kids yearn to get into the fanner's car and go out into the country and get just one square meal. And the girls want to keep house for the farmer and not trust a salary for what they eat and wear. Cat Worms Have been playing kaiser this spring. There are, over 2,000 kinds, and one will lay several hundred eggs. They transform under the ground. The moth comes out in mid-summer. They feed mostly at night. Cut plants near the surface of the ground. Some kinds climb trees and destroy buds. Clean culture, then burn all refuse; deep plow - ing helps. Place paper bands around newly set plants, poison on bran, or a bunch of newly cut clover. With Paris Green or arsenate of lead </seg>

Weber, Room 407 Capitol Bldg., Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Weber; Thank you very much for your letter of the 4th, enclosing copy of your State Horticultural Society bulletin in which note is given of the very pleasant afternoon we had together in Lincoln. I appreciate very much what you said of my address. To tell the truth, I was rather at a loss what to say at the meeting, as I could not consider myself at all qualified to speak on subject of Nebraska agriculture in a gathering which included men like Mr. Pollard, Mr. Bassett and Mr. Sheldon, so I took the subject which is uppermost in the minds of all of us and on which I had done a great deal of speaking in the preceding two months, that is, the war. I think it a wonderful plan to perpetuate the memory of the men who did so much to make Nebraska the fertile and productive state which it how is by hanging their portraits in the State Agricultural College. I know of no monument which would please them more. With kindest regards and many thanks, I am, Yours very truly, Sterling Morton. WAR is OUR BUSINESS; we can't win by carrying it as a side line. Stop, Look, Listen Are you ready for the BIGGEST FAIR Nebraska has ever had? Do you know that this is the Semi-Centennial Exposition of the Ne - braska State fair?

Not one of your family can afford to miss it You should take everything of every description and put it up against the other fellow. Not only for the premium, but to show your patriotism. To prove to the world that we lead in products to feed the world as she has shown herself proud at all great stock shows throughout the whole country. And in every phase of this horrible war. Don't do it simply because it is your duty but because of the great pleasure it will give to every 100 percent citizen of this splendid commonwealth. </seg>

Northern New York, Michigan, etc., more favorable. Weather from now on will decide the crop. Southern, Deleware, Virginia, Kentucky, etc., a decrease of 30 percent indicated at this time under last year. Pacific coast, Utah, California, Colorado, etc., decrease 30 percent on account of frost. Canada, increase over last year, which was light and poor in quality.

Garden and Drouth When choosing a subject for an editorial, we want to write on some leading question of the day. And in our locality, aside from the war, nothing is more talked of, on the car, or on the street, or in the home, seven days out of the week, wherever people meet, than the one we have chosen. We go to sleep and wake up thinking about it, especially the new War Garden beginner. Perhaps, after their first attempt, just to see, as it were, the drouth take the good things right out of their mouth*, as they were be- </seg>

To make and keep a "Dust Mulch," to conserve what moisture you have. The main thought is "Dust Mulch." This retains the moisture from the soil below. Keep this up, no matter how dry the season, using any kind of tool you may have, and especially after every shower or heavy dew, but not while the plants are damp. Work the "Dust Mulch" as if each shower was to be the last. You can hardly believe how much drouth some crops can endure if each shower is conserved. If you can just soak it to a good depth and then will keep it "Dust Mulched" it will help some, but surface sprinkling is of little value. Sun scalds may be protected by hanging some light cloth material over them on stakes, such as burlap. You can conserve land for late garden, such as string beans, sweet corn, radishes, lettuce etc., but see to it that this land is kept clean, and in dust mulch condition all the while. And you will be astonished how quickly it will produce fresh, palatable truck. An - other way I keep a dust mulch garden is to plant my rows far enough apart for another row between, and keep this thoroughly worked and moist while working the first crop. And when this crop is about gone, plant this ground, and later reverse, and have the first row ready, and so on. I have repeated radishes five times in a season in this way. This surely conserves where ground is limited. You can raise two crops of different kinds on the same ground, such as turnips, rape, millet, cane etc., which will follow most any crop, such as early spuds, sweet corn, beans, peas, radishes, lettuce, etc., making two gardens out of one. But be sure not to let any weeds go to seed in the fall, to harbor insects, and make double labor next year. It has been said that a 3-inch "Dust Mulch" is equal to three inches of rainfall. A Plant LIs a very small thing, but it feeds the world. It takes its food and k from the soil, air, sun and water. It takes up everything in its reach. Like the cow tied to the stake. But the plant can't be moved like the cow. So it is up to you to take food and water to it, and not let it starve and die, for we will need every ounce of food we can raise from the garden, orchard and field, till the kaiser has been crushed. War and Food are the two greatest words thought and talked about by the whole wide world today. Will we do our part to make the world safe and sound for Democracy? Don't Forget the Big Exposition To help boost this, the greatest State Fair in the world, we will depart a little from our usual custom and ask a word from the different departments who have no such mediums as ours. As we are all work - ing for the same thing — to win the war — you can't use this slogan too </seg>

But they have been giving it lots of water and it takes it like an old topper, as they keep a stream flowing into the sand pit about her roots almost constantly, and it seemed to be cheered up a little, when a stroke of lightening took a notion to play aiser Bill on it, and threw a bolt into its huge trunk and blew a chunk ou tof her. But like all Yanks, she proved too tough, so he made a hasty, but orderly retreat, leaving her in a fair way to re - covery, as the Red Cross nurse has cared for her wounds. They have just saved one or more sycamores that were famishing for drink, and are now looking good. New and Old Orchards — A Serious Problem This subject seems to be pressing on my mind just now, and I am sure it is worthy of an editorial from a better source than this, but if you have not already noticed the old orchards fast passing away, we feel it is our duty to cal your attention to the first old one you are passing, and the next and the next, and so on, and stop and reflect, and ask the question, "Where is our fruit coming from in the near future, if these orchards are not transplanted?" Providence has seemed to favor us in a way, as perhaps we have never since we used our corn for fuel, or sniped our brush along the streams, needed this for fuel. And if you met a fellow going for a load, and he asked you where you got it, the answer was, section 16 or 36, the nearest school section, as there was a law against cutting even a sapling on homesteads (if it was found out) and just now the dead and dying trees are needed to conserve coal and WIN THE WAR. And we were not altogether to blame, as no one then knew the best kinds or how to take care of them, as we have learned from our great agricultural colleges. Later, came the pests and fungus canker, etc., then the pruning and spraying and many of the trees were too old be - fore we brought ourselves to believe it was worth the price, even though it would do what everybody knows now to be a fact, and that any one can have a good orchard and know how to keep it now. And we would be to blame if we let the same thing occur again, for we must have new orchards since we know what a portion of Nebraska is as ah apple state. One of our county agents, who has noticed this, </seg>
            <seg id="p152">152 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT was just talking to me about this very thing; said we ought to get to - gether in some way by a called meeting, or in some meeting that is already called by the county agents, and make an effort to get a large number of farmers to look this seriously in the face and agree to plant at least a family orchard and care for it in a proper manner from the planting to packing, and have our county agents agree to have some one who knows how to care for them, to keep them posted. Even while growing, the land will support itself, and when in bearing show them it will be the most profitable land they have, and they will want to try it on a larger scale. At this proposed meeting have the very best equipped man or men to discuss the subject till these agents would get the fever, and in turn call meetings in their counties, of both women and men to form an orchard party, or club of some kind, that would promote interest in the fruit industry in every portion of the state where it wil prove a paying propositition, and we have men that know this, just as they used to know where Milksick was located (always just across the line). The only difference they always wanted to be out of it, and in this, all want to be in it. And most of the state will pro - duce fruit of some kind, at least for family use, in the years the weather is favorable. If something is not done, we will soon be without apples here and prices will be so high most of us will have to do without. Do you know that we have 50 county agents in the state who are anxious to do anything to help make two blades of grass grow where now only one grows. Under the extension service of the State University, besides the officers and supervisors and clerk, this is an army we must use to its capacity. Would it not be the proper thing for the county agents to call a meeting during the State Fair to consider this proposition, or bring it up at some meeting already called? Of course I can only suggest, but if you could see this thing as it is, or as I see it, I am sure some action would be taken. The Mowing are the names of the officers and county agents and addresses. If you are interested talk with them about it now. </seg>

Pride Goeth Before a Fall LHave you noticed how many people are carrying a basket on their ? This is one of the many proofs of patriotism and good sense the war has taught us, and we will never forget. For while it took this to teach us to conserve the horse and gas, it was ridiculous to know the many unnecessary calls for little articles. I was told only yesterday, when talking this matter over, that calls had been made for a spool of thread, and another for one onion, saying rush. That cost the grocer much more than the article was worth, and we paid the bill. As in hundreds of cases, the people that buy and carry always get what they want, and see it, and if not at one place they go to another. Those who trust the phone get what is left, as they can only send what they have. If they had only tin sandwiches and they wanted ham. But since they have once learned this, they will never return to the old way, as they know they have been beating themselves and others, to a small extent. So the war has done some good in this. Sale for Grasshoppers I have just received a letter wanting grasshoppers in great quant - ities from a firm in California. Some can remember when this would have been a God-send for Nebraska and this country, but it has been a lone time since we have seen so few grasshoppers as this year. Would you not call a fellow a slacker who will allow many loads of manure to go to waste? You can see this very thing within the city limits. It is said that manure scattered in August or September is twice as effective as when hauled in winter. The Kaiser Says "Woe and death unto those who oppose my will.

Secretary Weber urges replacing orchards in Nebraska that arts dying out. See what a fire a small flame kindleth. L"The big semi-centennial exposition is a thing of the past and every - y is pleased with the way Providence has smiled on vs." said Sec - retary B. R. B. Weber of the state horticultural society. "The horticul - tural society was simply amazed at its own display after such discourag - ing reports from all over the state, but are pleased to note that in a year having the longest drawn out drought and severe winter, Nebraska can make such a showing of fine fruit." "There can now be no question in a seasonable year, and the proposed drive that has been started from our editorial, "Old and new orchards a serious question," has brought to us words of cheer from many sources, who promise help in a publicity campaign to bring the real situation before the whole state." "Editor Davis of the Ruralist Independent Farmer, Editor Pugsley of the Nebraska Farmer, Editor Kittell of the Nebraska Farm Journal, Omaha, and the State Journal, have already offered their services to help boost the good cause along and we feel that many other papers, dailies and weeklies, will be anxious to lend a hand when they realize how the old orchards are passing away and so few are being replaced with new ones. "The extension service of the State University with the county agri - cultural agents are taking hold in earnest, and there are over fifty of these in the state. At a meeting of the society, Prof. Howard of the horticultural department of the state farm and the secretary of the state horticultural society, were appointed publicity committee, and they will be glad to hear from anyone who is interested in this matter." "To thost who have not yet noticed the passing of the orchard I can give you in short, what I could give you by wholesale evidence, had I the time or space. Marshall Bros., among the oldest and largest fruit men in the eastern central portion of the state, say that in fifty years they have not had so poor a crop, and many of the trees will never leaf out again. Eunice Haskins of Richardson county says that many orchards that commonly produced six or eight cars will only produce one car this year." "The central fruit growers association last year handled $117,000 worth of apples. This includes several organizations, E. M. Pollard is president, C. E. Dwyre, vice-president; G. S. Christy, secretary; and A. M. Shubert, treasurer. They with one accord tell us the same story." Abe Martin would say, what has become of the old tree agent every spring and fall, with a book full of pretty fruit pictures, and sugar coated tongue and soft soap voice, who could talk you almost </seg>
            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 157 to sleep on the kinds of fruit you should buy, no matter what the lo - cality, and on his return trip pointed (rather with pride) to those trees that the stock had browsed on thru the winter when the grass was covered with snow, or some of them that never started to grow, and show you how those trees at least, must be reset. At that time we thought that any kind of a tree was all right for any part of the country, and would grow, no matter what kind of soil, or location of the orchard. But that time is past. Too many boys go to the agricultural college and have taken the horticultural course and cannot be fooled as we fathers were. They know the kind of trees to plant in the state or part of the state, and out of the thousands of kinds, only a few varieties will make a profitable income, and that some of the best growers, and most prolific trees are not now grown because so subject to disease. It is like turning a man with the small pox at large on the street car, or a cholera pig with a well one.' "So as you now are going to try a new orchard, if you don't know these things, go to the men that do know and find out and start right. A man said to me yesterday, "I am going to plant an orchard in the spring and I will come to you to know the kind of varieties." I said "All right, if I can't tell you, I will take you to one who will, and it won't cost you a cent." The old Nebraska orchards are dying according to B. R. B. Weber, secretary Nebraska State Horticultural Society. Where is our fruit coming from? Are we going to ship it in boxes and barrels forever? Nebraska can grow as good apples, pears, peaches and plums as grow anywhere, providing we take an interest in our orchards and prune and spray. Thousands" of new orchards should be started in Nebraska next spring. Experience has been a great teacher in telling us what kind of fruit to plant, and how to care for the trees after they are planted. Our horticulturists would not recommend the same variety of fruit for Phelps county that they would for Richardson county. Our pathway is lighted now. We need not grope along in darkness. "An orchard on every farm" is a good slogan — State Journal. The Nebraska State Horticultural Society has commenced a cam - paign intended to induce people to plant new orchards. The creditable showing of fruit at the state fair, made in the face of discouraging crop conditions during the growing season of the present year, has caused officers of the state society to start a campaign to encourage the planting of new orchards to take the place of old orchards in Nebraska that are passing away. The society requests persons interested in the subject to write to Prof. R. F. Howard, state university farm, Lincoln, or to Secretary B. R. B. Weber, state house, Lincoln. — State Journal. If I were a painter, I'd paint a picture of a farmer seated in his favorite chair, in a comfortable room reading his farm paper. Near him I'd place a bowl of choice apples; suposedly of his own growing.

Plant a home orchard next spring. — Nebraska Ruralist. The commercial apple crop in Nebraska may be less than one-fourth of a full crop this year. There was a light set of fruit and later, damage from hail and drouth. The good effects of tillage in a dry season like this is demonstrated by the crop in a certain Richardson county orchard. — Dec. E. R. Ranielson, Ed., Bulletin No. 260. Orchards Net $263.00 An Acre After Spraying E "Spraying may be all right for the man who has a large orchard, I cannot afford to spray my home orchard," says the average farmer has only a few trees. The University of Missouri College of Agriculture, through its ex - tension service, wanted to know whether or not he could afford to spray his home orchard. Consequently a series of demonstrations were ar - ranged last year in ten Missouri counties which represented every section of the state. The ten home orchards represented in these demon - strations totaled 1.2 acres with 50 aple trees to the acre. The average production from these orchards last year after deducting the cost of spraying chemicals and labor was $263.21 per acre. All had been neglected and were never sprayed until the season of 1917. "This demonstration work has proved that home orchards as well as commercial orchards can be sprayed profitably," says a bulletin issued recently by the college. "It has made the orchards the most valuable and paying acres on the farm. It has proved further that just as good apples, peaches, cherries and plums can be grown nowadays as during the time of the early Missouri settlers." First Letter Received After Editorial Came Out, New and Old Orchards a Serious Question B. R. B. Weber, Sec, State Horticultural Society, Lincoln, Nebr., My Dear Sir: I am convinced that the concerted efforts on the part of your de - partment, the horticulture department of the University Farm, the four papers in this state and the extension department, along the lines of increased fruit production would result in a large number of orchards being planted next spring. I suggested to Prof. Howard, day before yesterday, when I met him on the street, that it would be a splendid thing for his department to get together and call a meeting of the farm paper editors. Prof. Gunnells rid Holland and as many others as you feel ought to be called into such meeting. I believe arrangements could be made for a strong campaign and I assure you my heartiest co-operation in any way you can use it. With best wishes, I am, Oak E. Davis, Editor. </seg>

Bliss in answer to a letter similar to the one I wrote you and feel that the idea of concerted effort would be commendable. Campaign for Home Orchards The State Horticultural Society, the State Horticulturist and the Department of Horticulture of the University are laying plans for a home orchard campaign. The experimental stage in orchard growing has passed. It is now known what varieties are best suited to Nebraska. Some varieties have greater disease resistant power than others. Con - siderable knowledge of disease control has been gathered. In the last five years hundreds of home orchards have died in the state, thru lack of moisture and thru neglect. To replace these orchards with varieties of fruit best adapted to this state will be the object of the campaign. The Department of Horti - culture of the University is planning two bulletins as a part of the cam - paign. One will set forth specific suggestions for arranging and plant - ing a home orchard. Another will suggest Nebraska varieties and tell how to care for fruit trees. Nebraska Farmer, What Mr. Pugsley says I am taking this opportunity to thank you for the splendid co-opera - tion you have given the Agricultural Extension Service in the state of Nebraska. In no other state have th editors given of ther time and space so liberally as in Nebraska. I wish to commend to you my successor, Mr. Chas. E. Gunnels, who will assume the duties of Director of Extension, beginning July 1. Mr. Gunnels was formerly a teacher in the College of Agriculture, a success - ful County Agent in Seward county, and is at present County Agent Leader for this state. You will find him a good co-operator. Yours very truly, C. W. Pugsley, Director Extension Service. The State Fair, A Howling Success Many things too numerous to mention were enjoyed by the throng. The "Gov't Army and Navy display," was perhaps the biggest drawing card. The building was far too small. After 9 o'clock a. m. till closing, you could hardly get thru and get a glimpse of implements and equip - ments of war. Then the marvelous hog palace that some thought would be large enough for years to come, including sheep, were full of hogs and had to use some of the old sheds. Of course a hog is a gentleman now found in high society, and only occasionally therefor certain reasons too delicate to mention. The autos, implements and machinery of every kind showed marked improvement. And we can all be justly proud of the past 50 years. And begin a vigorous campaign for the future cen - tennial. But I presume that not very many of us will take an active part in that celebration for certain unavoidable reasons. </seg>
            <seg id="p160">160 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT The California Flame Bush "Can any good come out of Nazareth?" In thinking about an editorial, this flame bush has been in my mind since war necessities are bringing out so much good from what we have considered bad. I have been wondering if we do not have about the agricultural state college a kind of "Burbank Wizzard," who can find out in some manner if this bush cannot be made useful, for man or beast, as it thrives in any kind of soil and weather. It might be cut frequently, siloed — or in some way tried out as the sunflower has now been. The man that can do this has made the conservation of food a monument to his memory, and the realization of "the desert blossoming as the rose" in my humble opinion. Sunflowers for Silage Experiments with sunflowers to determine their suitability for silage are being conducted in the western United States by the Bureau of Plant Industry, in co-operation with state experiment stations. There are indications that this crop may be specially useful in regions where the growing -season is too cool for the production of large yields of silage corn. The experiments were begun in 1917 at Huntley, Montana, and Scottsbluff, Nebraska, and the first year's results led the investi - gators to extend the work to other points this year. In 1917 the yields of sunflower silage exceeded those of corn silage the same fields from 50 to 100 percent. Yields of more than 20 tons per acre were obtained under irrigation. Preliminary feeding tests have indicated that the sunflower silage may be submitted satisfactorily for corn silage, but directly comparable results have not yet been obtained in sufficient volume to justify a full statement as to the comparative values of the two feeds. Hot Weather Causes Apples to Son Scald Recent hot spells combined with an unusual lack of moisture in the soil and air is responsible for a kind of sun scald in apples according to botanists at the Ohio Experiment Station. Samples coming to the station show that the sun-side of the apples have a condition similar to water-core, although the spots are blackened to some extent. The loss is due to physical reasons and cannot be remedied. A similar condition has been found in many- plants during the past dry season by botanists. Tipburn in potatoes is given as a comparative illustration. According to the specialists the hot weather causes an excessive evaporation of water from trees or vines, which, if not met with a corresponding amount from the soil will cause the cells of the plant or its fruit to break down from the heat. Unusually dry weather of course has disturbed the equilibrium of soil moisture. </seg>
            <seg id="p161">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 161 This condition with apples leaves the meat of the fruit in a broken down condition; the samples show no particular evidence of sun-burn on the skin. Build Potato Flour Mill The first potato flour mill in Nebraska and the second in the United States is to be built at Gordon, Sheridan county, by the Farmer's Union Potato Grower's Co-operative Association. Articles of incorporation were filed Monday with the secretary of state by C. A. Sorenson, legal representative. Mr. Sorenson was accompanied by A. D. Shipp, secre - tary-treasurer. The capital stock is $200,000, divided into -.4,000 shares of $50 each. C. H. Segrist of Gordon is president. Mr. Shipp said that the machinery had already been ordered thru private parties and would be turned over to the association when it arrives. It was the original intention to build a potato starch factory. Money for this purpose had been raised, but investigation caused the men to change their mind. It was found that to make the starch factory a paying proposition a daily grind of 2,000 bushels was necessary, and there is no guarantee of that many spuds being available for the pur - pose. The margin of profit is also smaller than in the potato flour busi - ness, and so the change was made. It is proposed to spend about $25,000 in building a mill to grind the meal. About 600 bushels of potatoes a day is the capacity of one unit, and if the enterprise proves as satisfac - tory as is now believed it will be, additional units may be later installed. There is now only one potato flour mill in operation in the United States, up in Idaho. In Germany, however, there are several thousands and this one fact has been responsible for the fact that bread is still available for Germans, much of it being of potato flour in combination. Ames, Iowa, August 6, 1918. Mr. B. R. B. Weber, Nebraska Horticultural Society, Lincoln, Nebr. Dear Sir: On behalf of the Mid-West Exposition I wish to express our ap - preciation of the excellent publicity article which you gave the exposition in the August issue of Nebraska Horticulture. We hope that you will plan to attend the exposition and shall appreciate your continuing to call it to the attention of Nebraska horticulturists. We wish to have it made perfectly clear to all of our friends that this exposition is not merely an apple show. It is being promoted, as a patriotic effort to stimulate food production under emergency war conditions. This and the production of fruit and vegetables and the conservation of fruit and vegetable food products will be prominently featured. As a horticultural exposition, it will also include features of interest in floriculture and landscape architecture. We have just received assurance from Honorable G. S.

S. A. Beach. Lincoln, Dec. 23, 1918. To the Members of the State Horticultural Society: It has been deemed prudent, owing to circumstances over which we have no control, to postpone the regular program of our winter meeting, as all other societies have done. There will be no fruit display, but it will be necessary for the society to hold its business meeting for the purpose of auditing the accounts of the secretary and treasurer and to elect officers for the ensuing year. The law provides that the meet - ing shall be held on the third Tuesday of January. This will give all members due notice that for the purpose above set forth it will be held at the Lindell Hotel, in Lincoln, on the 21st day of January, 1919, at 9:30 a. m. A full attendance is desired, and we trust you will be present. L. C. Chapin, Pres. B. R. B. Weber.. Secy. Searching for Potato Wart I The Bureau of Plant Industry, endeavoring to combat potato wart, hich has appeared in gardens in eastern Pennsylvania, has sent six trained plant pathologists to survey the infected area and has several men from the state agricultural colleges engaged in the same work. Ten men from the Pennsylvania State department of agriculture and several others from the Pennsylvania State College of Agriculture are also on the ground. Lest You Forget We want another word on the "New Orchard Drive." I have been asked why I am so anxious about planting new orchards when probably I would never see them bear much fruit. This brought back to me the EXACT question I once asked my father, (who was a great fruit man). He gave bushels away, and made it a rule never to let a year pass that he did not put out fruit until he was -82 years old. It was a hot day, and I was a tired boy. He answered by pointing to our old orchard that was supplying us so bountifully, and said, "If some one had not planted these trees, years ago, would we have apples now?" That was enough and I never forgot it. And from that day I have realized why new orchards should be planted every year. So when I see on every hand orchards passing away, and so few seeming to realize it, I felt it a duty we owe to call your attention to the grave importance of the subject. And I was really surprised to see how the subject took, &amp;nd how m&amp;Ti v lctt 6i*sl I received fislcincr "whst csn we do etc '** Es— </seg>
            <seg id="p163">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 163 pecially the interest taken by the Press. I did not realize that oar little paper was read by some of these people. But if I could see reas - onable results from this proposed DRIVE that would encourage a start for good orchards under competent advice and once get them to the paying point and stop to think that this planting is not like grain. But stands for years if cared for, and that a small orchard may be had in a corner that might be waste otherwise. Then we will have com - mercial orchards planted by men that never thought of it before. And if this is accomplished an apple tree would satisfy the marking of my resting place. Now I seem to hear someone saying, "There he goes again; that secretary is daffy on this new orchard business." But since I have heard it said that Prof. Howard's hobby is potatoes, and when we know what he has accomplished for the potato interest in western Nebraska, and made that portion that for years you would not take as a gift, now sap - plying us with as good potatoes as in any country, not only for the table, but for seed. This having been fully tested. It doesn't make much difference what we call him. His corps of workers will tell you that he is there with the goods (using a college phrase), and to know that at Rushville, where not long ago that country was inhabitated with Three C's cattle, cowboys and coyotes. They now have the second potato flour mill in the United States that will care for the culls and also man - ufacture potato chips. Is not this enough to inspire enthusiasm in the most skeptic? Now, begging pardon for these random thoughts that I might not be able to get before you only that there is no strings on our editor and he says just what he thinks, and when the paper is out it is too late to call him down. So you are not to blame the society, as it is t individual epistle without waiting the consent of any other country earth. New Family Orchards In making our proposed drive, let us feel the pulse of every one that has about 200 square feet of waste ground, or about an acre, who will want some apples a little later on when our orchards are a thing of the past. To buy apples will be almost prohibitive — only for millionaires. Then organize a group in every county, a community club, or some other such name, which will enlist enough members who will agree to plant even a small orchard and care for it in a proper manner. One specialist can oversee the group from planting to the market. Then we will have the right kind of fruit and get the best prices. Many homes have more than an acre of waste land in lawn that an orchard would beautify more than any other acre they have when in bearing, and for many years a shady grove if properly cared for. Remember, you don't have to plant an orchard every year, as with corn and small grain., but with little care each year it is good for you and your children. But you hesitate be - cause you see old snags of trees, thick with brush, that has never seen a pruning knife or felt a spray. About the only apples we were familiar </seg>
            <seg id="p164">164 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT with was a Ben Davis, one that would not now be planted by any one who knows how subject it is to disease. It is said that a dog: is the worst thing to carry germs to living things and the "Ben" to its kind. You can set apple trees eight in a row twenty-four feet apart one way, thirty the other, and use less than an acre, or 200 square feet of ground. Don't buy of a peddler. Go to the nurseryman that knows how and what to plant in your particular locality. Then you have space for peaches, pears, plums, cherries and small fruit between the rows that you keep in good condition by only the necessary cultivation for the orchard proper. You may use some early apples as fillers if you will cut them out when they begin to crowd the permanent trees. Two-year - old trees will cost you about $3 per 100. You get good returns out of the fillers before they begin to interfere with the permanent orchard. Some apples may begin bearing in from four to six years; others eight years and up. We already have letters from some who have seen about our proposed drive, saying that they are ready to start an orchard under the conditions we propose, and there will be others as soon as we begin the fight in earnest, and they realize what it means to their larders and pocket books. Farmers' Meeting We had the pleasure of attending the farmers' meeting at the court house December 2nd in the basement. But the muddy roads did not prevent a crowded room, and while they were waiting for Professor Gunnels, the main speaker, County Agent Harrison, brought up many questions for discussion that would be taken to every county that has an agent and where the farmers wanted any certain subject discussed by competent speakers and demonstrations, naming many subjects that had already been planned. And right here we want to thank Mr. Harrison for naming as one of the subjects our proposed DRIVE for new home orchards. The crowd by this time could not nearly get in, so Mr. Harrison delegated Mr. Weaver to find another and more commodious room. He soon returned with an invitation to use the county superinten - dent's office, which was immediately accepted. Prof. Gunnels was ready, and perhaps it will be the last chance we may have to hear him. Like many cases in the past, when we get a man where he can do us the most good he is called higher up. So Prof. Gunnels has been called to Washington by the federal government. Pruning LIf you do not have time for the regular pruning you can surely take the dead and broken limbs, smooth the wounds, and paint the larger cuts to protect from disease and insects. And be sure to clean around the trunks of every tree to avoid the girding by mice when the snow is on the ground. Every man has a right to be a critic, if he can tell what is better, otherwise better shut his potato trap. </seg>

Weber, See'y Nebr. Horticultural Society, Lincoln, Nebr. Dear Sir Your editorial entitled "New and Old Orchards a Serious Problem" was read with interest. You have started a badly neglected movement and we gknow much good will be accomplished as soon as the word reaches the farmer. The farmer who has neglected his orchard and now views the stumps realizes that he made a serious mistake in failing to provide for the planting of a new one before the old one had disappeared. We are glad to note that some of the state papers have mentioned the movement you have started, and trust that the farm journals will take hold of the matter and present it to their subscribers. The purpose of he farm papers, as I understand it, is to give assistance to the farmer in the way of information that will aid him in building up home sur - roundings that will be a credit to the community in which he lives, to grow a better grade of grain, and to improve the quality of his herd. Information concerning orchard growing is just as important as the lines I have just mentioned and should be given the same attention by the farm journals. Your suggestion that the matter be taken up through the county agents is a good one, and we have written the people whose names appear in your article. After reading your article the writer got busy and sketched a rough picture which we are sending out to our customers. The point may be seen at a glance. Yours truly, Harrison Nursery Co., Wish you could see that sketch. — Ed. THE HORTICULTURAL MEETINGS Fruit. Potato and Floral Show to be Held at Commercial Club Rooms, January 20 to 23, 1919.

            <seg id="p166">166 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT Nebraska When we think of the second potato mill in the United States at Rushville and of the millions of dollars being invested in the greatest potash plants in the United States, is there any reason why the United States should not be proud of Nebraska? Plants at Alliance and Anti - och are in full blast, the latter costing a million dollars. They claim that next year thirty millions of dollars will be produced. The demands are strong and no competition. An Omaha company with one million dollars is just now breaking ground for a five hundred thousand dollar plant at Lakeside, and many other companies are organizing, and while Kaiser Bill would not let us have potash to make dyes during the war, our government forbids German potash entry into the United States, It is a poor rule that won't work both ways. — Ed.

These can be placed around the beds or pots, and when the slugs wriggle into this he soon dies. The fre - quent use of lime alone will drive them" away in time.

The Home Orchard "Keep the home orchard growing" would be the title of a popular song if the Nebraska Horticultural Society had its way. It is starting a campaign to induce people to renovate their old home orchards or to plant new ones. We have long been thoroughly convinced that commercal apple growing is a business requiring special training and experience and that the livestock farmer or the grain farmer better leave the commercial orchard to the man who is willing to devote his entire time to it. Com - mercial orcharding can and is being profitably carried on in territories on both sides of the Missouri river to a considerable distance both above and below Omaha. We predict that in the future many more com - mercial orchards will appear in this territory. We are also firmly convinced that the average farmer should have a home orchard in which he has a selection of a few fruit trees of all kinds coming into bearing at different seasons. Fruit is necessary in every diet. It is not only necessary, but it is tremendously pleasing to the palate and therefore adds greatly to the enjoyment of life. The farmer, no matter what his type of farming, usually eats what U_ rrynt\-c Tf ka J^g nn f rryrwxr tlio -fVnif \\O Will TlWlHaHlv Tint Vinttp ne grows, lr ne aoes noi grow me iruit, ne win prouuuiy not nave </seg>

Dear Sir Referring to your letter of the 15th will say that I took the matter of replanting the orchards and shade trees of this state up with our executive board at our meeting yesterday. We had considerable dis - cussion as to how this association could be of the most help in the circumstances, as we felt that we were not the most appropriate organization to foster this movement, although we are anxious to do whatever we can to assist the cause in getting a good start. Therefore, if you will let us know just how we can be of the mo:t effective help in this respect, we will be very glad indeed to cooperate with you. Awaiting your early reply, I am, Very truly yours, ADVERTISING-SELLING LEAGUE, Chas. L. Sykes, President The apple producer sits fruit buds on short, creeked, or irregular spurs two or more years old. In pruning, the object should be to in - duce the formation of new spurs and to save those already on the tree. Do not let a desire for regularity influence any one to cut off these ugly objects, for they are the source of the coming crop. If the growing conditions are good, these spurs may persist for many years, but if the sunlight is shut off they soon die. If they die or are broken, they can never grow again, and the only way they may be replaced is by training waterspouts, but this is a slow and uncertain process.

Organized Agriculture Called Off The meeting of Organized Agriculture, usually held the third week in January in Lincoln, have been cancelled on account of the influenza epidemic. The action was taken after the officers of the various agri - cultural organizations had been canvassed. Their sentiment was that the meetings should be called off or postponed. The action was taken with reluctance. Nebraska's Organized Agriculture is the biggest agricultural meeting in the west and probably America. Thousands of farmers make this week their annual vacation. Conservation of health and life is, however, in the opinion of the committee, of much greater importance than the education and value of the week's program. </seg>
            <seg id="p168">168 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT SUMMARY OF A FORTHCOMING REPORT ENTITLED "ECON - OMICS OF THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY." The following summary of a forthcoming report entitled "Economics of the Construction Industry," has been prepared by the Division of Public Works and Construction Development, Information and Educa - tion Service, Department of Labor, Franklin T. Miller, Director: In January, 1919, the Division of Public Works and Construction Development was organized as a branch of the Information and Educa - tion Service of the Department of Labor. Its purpose was to be the stimulation of the interest of the Nation in public and private construc - tion with a view to the creation of buffer employment for labor during the period of transition of manufacturing industries from war to peace production. It was charged with the securing of data for the use of the construction industry, but its activities were also to comprehend a study of the economic conditions affecting industry as a whole. In conformity with its purpose it has given wide publicity to the material which it has gathered on prices and price tendencies in the construction industry, and to such other information as it believed was of immediate value for the construction industry and for general in - dustry. Its findings are contained in "Economics of the Construction Industry," now in press. In the following pages a brief summary of these findings is presented, which it is hoped will provide convicition for those who, on the threshold of an era of business prosperity, still hesitate. On the basis of its study it has come to the conclusion that construction in 1919 can be justified on financial grounds. It rejoices to find such a widespread acceptance of its views as is evidenced by the remarkable resumption of construction activity of the last three months. It looks to public officials and private and speculative builders every - where to maintain or increase the present activity, for it feels that by so doing they will not only be securing a reasonable return on their investments, but that they will also be relieving the unprecedented short - age in housing, supplying needed employment, and allaying much of the Industrial unrest incident to a period of readjustment. The New Commodity Price Level 1. Most people believed that the high level of prices reached during the war was caused merely by the extraordinary demand for commodities which exceeded the supply. With the end of the war and with war de - mand a thing of the past, they quite naturally expected a sharp drop in prices and a price level approximating in a short time the prewar price level. 2. It was also commonly believed that the industrial capacity of the world had been greatly expanded under the stimulation of war orders, and that this expansion would bring sharp competition be - tween rival concerns in time of peace. Furthermore, it was thought </seg>
            <seg id="p169">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 169 that there would be after the war great armies of unemployed workmen, who would be compelled by necessity to accept work at low wages; that there would be sharp competition among the leading nations in inter - national trade; and that buyers generally, looking forward toward an era of lower prices, would postpone buying. In the light of these con - siderations it was but natural for people to expect a great fall in prices, and even to fear an industrial panic. However, the expected great fall in prices has not occurred, and it is not likely to occur for the following reasons: 3. The rise in prices during the war was not merely the result of a great demand for goods and of a scarcity of certain goods. It was largely brought about by means of inflation of the currency by the governments at war and by the neutrals, either by the direct issue of paper money or by the issue of bonds. Although war orders are now largely a thing of the past, the extension of credits still exists as a con - tinuing cause of high prices. There is little to indicate an early contrac - tion of credits. 4. World production in general during the war, contrary to a widely held view, was not abnormally large. This is shown by statistics of world production of leading basic materials of industry, such as coal, petroleum, iron, ore, and of cotton, sugar, wool, wheat, and other agri - cultural products. Consequently the abnormal consumption of goods for war purposes has depleted the stocks of commodities of the world. 5. Armies of unemployed, in the United States at least, have not materialized, and an actual labor shortage is in prospect. Wages are not likely to be lowered. 6. Buyers since the armistice, although showing a desire to wait for lower prices, have been compelled to buy to meet their daily needs. During the war, because of scarcity of commodities and high prices or because of patriotic self-denial, they did not buy in advance of need, as is customary in an era of rising prices. Consumers' goods are in great demand and retail trade is now moving in great volume. tmohipriceely ?inm.fdvingreatSoo bLSrlicaninpub 7. If the production capacity of industry should be greatly increased, lower prices would not necessarily follow. If there is a strong enough de - mand for commodities, prices need not fall, no matter in how large volume commodities are produced. There is every reason for expecting such a strong demand. The world is now suffering from a great shortage of durable goods — buildings, transportation facilities, and industrial equipment. Furthermore people, both in the United States and Europe, have a stronger desire for consumers' goods than ever before. This is true partly because of the scarcity of certain goods during the war period, and partly because of the new experiences through which tens of millions have passed, which awakened in them desires for goods and services they never enjoyed before. Along with greater production of goods there is likely to go further extensions of credits rather than con - tractio.n. Neither the credit system of the United States nor that of the world has reached the limits of its power of expansion. </seg>
            <seg id="p170">170 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT 8. Business men of the United States need not hesitate to plan for an immediate period of business prosperity. No period of depression and no collapse of values need to be feared. The man who goes full speed ahead will gain an advantage over his procrastinating competitor which will far outweigh any possible slight decline in costs of production. For a fuller discussion of the effect of inflation on prices see "The New Price Resolution," by Prof. Irving Fisher, Yale University. Prof. Fisher's paper is briefly summarized in the following paragraphs: k9. Prices are not going to fall much, if at all. We are on a per - ently higher price level, and business men should go ahead on that 10. The general level of prices is dependent upon the volume and rapidity of turnover of the circulating medium in reuation to the busi - ness to be transacted thereby. If the number of dollars circulated by cash or by check doubles, while the number of goods and services ex - changed thereby remains constant, prices will about double. 11. The great price changes in history have come about in just this way. The price revolution of the sixteenth century was a result of the great influx of gold and silver from American mines. A similar in - crease in prices all over the world occurred between 1896 and 1914, following the discovery of rich new gold fields, and the introduction of cheaper methods of mining. 12. The present rise in prices has resulted from the great exten - sion of credits by the countries at war, and a more economical use of gold reserves as a basis of credit, and not from any great increase in the gold supply of the world. In the United States, however, the supply of gold has been greatly increased because of our large excess of exports of commodities, and our present gold reserves would permit of a much greater expansion of credits than exists now. 13. There is a little likelihood of a fal in prices in the United States. The gold reserve, which is now the basis of our currency, is not likely to leave the banks and return to general circulation, since chis is contrary to monetary experience. No great outflow of gold is to be expected through international trade, since our exports are likely to exceed our imports in the reconstruction period, and we no longer will have large interests and freight payments to make to Europe. Prices are higher in Europe than in the United States, and hence no influx of cheap goods is to be expected. Further issues of bonds or treasury certificates by our Government and loans placed by European countries in this country will tend to further increase our present credit struc - ture. Against any considerable reduction in bank credit the whole business community would rise in arms. Cost and Supply of Building Materials 14. Government restrictions and decreased demand reduced the pro - duction of most building materials in 1918. This reduction necessitated the operation of plants below their normal capacity and increased the DroDortion that fixed charsres bear to total costs. </seg>
            <seg id="p171">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 171 15. Curtailed production during the war resulted in low stocks of many building materials at the signing of the armistice. 16. As a result of the increase in the cost of living and of com - petition with essential war industries for labor, the wages of workmen in the building materials industries were raised. In some industries, largely because of abnormal labor turnover, the efficiency of labor was reduced and labor costs mounted out of proportion to other costs. 17. Costs of raw materials, transportation, fuel, taxes, sales, and other items that make up total costs have all increased. 18. The increased costs of building materials as a whole must gen - erally be considered in the light of curtailed production, low stocks, increased costs of labor, transportation, fuel, and plant maintenance. 19. Past experience has shown that prices of building materials fluctuate less rapidly than the prices of raw materials used in manu - facturing industries, such as metal ores, hides, etc., and than the prices of commodities that are consumed from day to day, such as food and textiles. Building materials are not likely to respond rapidly to any but a marked reductioh in the general price level. 20. A marked reduction in the price of building materials is de - pendent upon the reduction of the items mentioned under 18. It is not to be expected that wages, the largest single item in costs, will be re - duced in advance of a reduction of the cost of living. In view of the mounting operating expenses of the railroads it is not likely that trans - portation charges, a very large element in the cost of building materials, will be lowered. With the maintenance of the general price level the price of building materials as a whole can not well fall. 21. The index number for lumber and building materials (not in - cluding metal products) was in April, 1919, 184; for building materials, including iron and steel production, 189; for commodities other than building materials, 211; for all commodities, 203; for farm products, 228 (100=July 1, 1913-June 30, 1914). 22. Building materials are relatively low in price. The Wage Rate of Building Tradesmen and the Cost of Living 23. The union wage rate of building tradesmen in 41 large cities in the United States increased 28.5 from 1914 to 1918. Unskilled labor - building laborers, hod carriers and helpers enjoyed, as a rule, far greater increases than skilled labor. 24. Union wage rates are minimum wage rates. In 1918, as a result of a general shortage of labor, many building tradesmen were paid hourly wages in excess of the union wage rates. Overtime and bonuses further increased their earnings. 26. The cost of living for workers in the shipbuilding districts rose 58-86 per cent from December, 1914, to December, 1918, according to reports of the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The cost of living for the whole country increased 65-70 per cent from July, 1914,. to November, 1918, according to estimates by the National Industrial Conference Board </seg>
            <seg id="p172">172 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT In March, 1918, the National Industrial Conference Board published figures showing a slight reduction in the cost of living — an increase of 60-65 per cent for March, 1919, over July, 1914. However, since March the cost of food and shelter, the two largest items in the cost of living budget, has advanced, with the result that the cast of living for June, 1919, is little, if any, lower than it was in November and December, '918. 26. Because of the decreased purchasing power of the union wage rate of 1918, many building tradesmen have asked and obtained a new scale for 1919 that better adjusts their earnings to meet the increase in the cost of living. In advance of a noticeable decline in the cost of living the unn.n wage rate of building tradesmen can not well fall. Efficiency of Building Tradesmen munities was lowered by large labor turnover (particularly by the di - 27. In 1918 the efficiency of the building trades in many com- verting of skilled labor into other fields and its replacement by less efficient labor), by overtime, and abnormal conditions of employment. 28. In 1919 the efficiency of labor in the building trades may be expected to be that of its prewar years. Sources and Supply of Capital for Construction Industry 29. The main sources of real estate loans are savings banks, title guarantee and trust companies, insurance companies, building and loan associations, and individual lenders. 30. Real estate loans by lending institutions did not increase in proportion to the growth of the country from 1913 to 1918. L31. Real estate loans of banks did not grow as rapidly as bank re - ces in the United States from 1913 to 1918. Savings banks, insurance companies, and building and loan ciations, the chief financial institutions making real estate loans, did not grow as rapidly in resources as banks, other than savings banks in the United States. k33. Real estate loans of banks in New York, which hold one-sixth cent of the total banking resources of the country, did not grow as idly as the total resources of New York banks from 1914 to 1918. L34. Savings banks in New York did not grow as rapidly as other r classes of banks in New York from 1914 to 1917. 35. During 1917 and 1918 statistics indicate that there has been an absolute decrease in real estate loans held by financial institutions. 36. Statistics showing the amount of real estate loans made by in - dividuals are not available. 37. The main causes of the failure of real estate loans to increase in proportion to the general growth of the country during the last five yean have been the lack of marketability of real estate loans, lack of standardization in making loans (which makes the cost higher than need </seg>
            <seg id="p173">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 173 be), changes in the banking system, Government restrictions during the war, and the issue of Liberty bonds. 38. A general amortization system for real estate loans by en - couraging payment of old loans would make available hundreds of of millions of dollars annually for new loans. 39. Improved machinery is needed for making and marketing real estate loans. This would involve, first, a standardized and simplified method of examination of the security offered on real estate loans, thus cutting down costs, and, second, a system of real estate mortgage bonds. Rents 40. As a result of the largest cost of commodities taxes and labor and of the shortage of housing, rents have risen. In most communities their rise has been sufficient to justify building as a safe investment. How Building Has Been Stimulated 41. The most complete construction statistics available cover con- tracts let for engineering and building construction north of the Ohio and east of the Missouri together with some adjacent area, containing four-sevenths of the population of the country. The contracts let in the first five months of 1919, compared with the same months in 1915 and 1916, run as follows: 1919 1915 1 1916' January $51,000,000 $69,800,000 $87,500,000 February - 95,000,000 79,600,000 91,600,000 March _ 151,000,000 122,600,000 131,200,000 April 191,800,000 124,100,000 140,300,000 May 215,000,000 125,200,000 182,500,000 'Costs brought up to 1919 price level The total for March, 1919, exceeds the total for March of any year but one, even with the costs of former years brought up to the 1919 price level. The totals for April and May exceed the totals for April and May of all previous years even with costs adjusted to the 1919 price level. The revival of construction activity is more notable in the Middle West than in the East, and in the smaller than in the larger cities. </seg>
            <seg id="p174">FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT 174 FARMERS' CO-OPERATION ASKED IN PASSAGE OF NATIONAL HIGHWAY BILL Asserting that construction and maintenance of the main high - ways of the country will not only insure the farmer travelable trunk roads the year around, but will also release state and county funds for the construction of farm to market roads, Senator Charles E. Town - send of Michigan has called upon the farmers of the country to co - operate with him in securing the passage of the Townsend bill. In a letter addressed to members of the National Grange, Senator Townsend says: "Few questions are of more far reaching importance to the people of the United States, none in my opinion, to the people of the farms of the United States, than the question of how best to efficiently and econ - omically build roads which will serve all interests. The remarkable growth of motor transportation in the past few years, and its still more tremendous potentiality for the future, the great necessity for in - terstate roads no less than market roads, has brought us to a point where past procedure is no longer sufficient. Large sums will inevitably be expended on our highways to make them useful for longer periods, and to decrease transportation costs. Every dollar so expended must bring back a full dollars' worth of value. "At the last session of Congress, I introduced a measure which would provide for a national highway system of main trunk lines to be constructed and forever maintained by the United States Government under the direction of a Federal highway commission and requiring as a basis for administration, a scientific study into the principles governing highway transportation and construction. "My purpose at that time was simply to bring about a country - wide discussion. So general was the public interest that a great many national, state and local organizations endorsed the principles so enun - ciated while many valuable and constructive suggestions were received. "These suggestions I have since incorporated into a bill which is now once more before Congress, this time with the hope that an aroused and enlightened public sentiment may result in its translation into law. "A principle involved in this bill may need statement in more detail at this point, to meet certain suggestions which have come especially from the people of the farms of the country. It is that by taking over a certain definite mileage of highways in every state to be built and maintained by the Federal government, the states and the localities, will be given not only the incentive and the example of well built roads, but will also have saved from their own expenses for such con - struction the money needed to build those equally needed market roads, and at the same time will be providing the across-state and inter-state roads which makes every radiating market road not only a market road to its nearest market point but to the other greot«t market centers. </seg>

WHAT CAUSES 'BROWN PATCHES". ON THE LAWN Objectionable "brown patches" appear on fine laws, greenswards, and the putting greens of golf courses usually during the hot, moist weather of summer, the disease being most noticeable when the weather is hot and muggy, and on ground which is kept too moist by insufficient drainage or heavy sprinkling. The brown spots — caused by a fungus — are at first more or less circular and grow in centrifugal fashion, be - coming a foot or more in diameter. During the early morning many of the spots are covered with a fine mildew. Later in the day the border of actively growing spots is smoky green in color where the grass leaves are dying. When the disease is abundant and a merging of the spots occurs, an entire putting green often will be completely brown and appear as if dead. Peculiarly enough, with the coming of cool weather in fall most of the infested spots recover, indicating that the grass has suffered no per - manent injury. However, occasional diseased spots are completely killed. Apparently the brown spots radiate in the form of a small circle from one unit and continue this process, season after season, until large circles are formed. Occassionally a green spot is found in the center, but usually the whole patch is brown. Prevention is the practical way of decreasing the damage wrought by this turf disease, according to the United States Department of Agri - culture. Preventive measures consist in providing thorough drainage, both of the surface and subsoil. Watering should be done in the morn - ing, in the case of golf courses, the purpose being to have the courses as dry as practicable during the night. Often in spite of these pre - cautions the disease will appear in warm, wet weather when the excess surface moisture can not be controlled. The growing of turf plants immune or highly resistant to the disease — Bermuda grass in the South and blue gras and white clover in the North — is the ideal method of prevention, but the last two are not the most desirable for putting greens or for lawns of superior quality. The fescues and the bents, the peers of all turf grasses, are markedly susceptible to the "brown patch" disease, although resistant strains are available in both these groups of grasses. It is anticipated by specialists in the United States Department of Agriculture that in the near future resistant strains of desirable grasses for putting green use will be available in amounts sufficient to satisfy all demands. When a person is sufficiently familiar with the time of appearance and development of the "brown patches" among grass plants to fore- </seg>
            <seg id="p176">176 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT cast the occurrence of the disease, he can partially control and check its damage by persistent spraying with Bordeaux mixture, in amount just sufficient to moisten the leaves and crowns of the grass, without thoroughly wetting the ground. Frequent applications are necessary. The difficulty attending the use of Bordeaux or any similar fungicide is that as soon as it has been removed from the plants by rain or by continued mowing the fungus breaks out in new places, undeterred by the fungicide which is on the surface of the soil or on the older stems and leaves. Although the expense of using Bordeaux mixture is rather heavy, it will pay the owner to test out this measure of eradication rather than to allow the disease to spread unchecked. As a rule, mixed grasses on putting greens or lawns are less in - jured than individual settings of purebred varieties. However, mixtures will never result in the fine turf which comes from setting such grasses as velvet bent, carpet bent, or red fescue. Incidentally the high sus - ceptibility of mouse-ear chickweed, or "creeping Charlie" is a special rson for eradicating all patches of these plants from putting greens high-quality lawns. kThe common lawn plants seem susceptible to the brown patch ise in about this order: Mouse-ear chickweed, red fescue, red top, ?t bent, carpet bent, rough-stalked meadow grass, speedwell and yarrow. Frequently, especially in the case of mouse-ear chickweed and speedwell, the disease does not spread beyond the boundaries of the plant attacked, but in other cases several species of plants may be involved in the same spot. kAt one of the leading golf courses in the District of Columbia, re the "brown patch" disease was rampant in 1916, experiments s conducted in 1917 to determine if the trouble could be prevented by the use of Bordeaux mixture. A fine putting green of German - mixed bent, measuring about 40 by 80 feet in size, was used. The dis - ease appeared on June 13; two days later the green was watered with 300 gallons of half-strength Bordeaux mixture, a small portion of turf being left untreated as a check. No injury whatever resulted to the grass from the use of the Bordeaux. The treated area seemed to improve very quickly and within a week few spots were visible. In contrast, the un - treated portion continued to deteriorate and on July 9 was in bad con - dition, while the treated area showed no signs of the disease. About July 15 the disease again became rampant on the treated area, when it was watered a second time with Bordeaux as before. The results follow - ing the second application were by no means as marked as after the first treatment, but were decidedly beneficial. From this experiment, as well as from several similar ones, it seems probable that the disease can be held in check by frequent light applications of Bordeaux mixture. </seg>
            <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 177 FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION, WASHINGTON July 11, 1919 Warning of an approaching domination of the nation's food supply by the Big Five Chicago packers, the Federal Trade Commission today made public Part I of its report to the President on its investigation of the meat industry, bearing on "Extent and Growth of Power of the Five Packers in Meat and Other Industries." "An approaching packer domination of all important foods in this country and an international control of meat products with foreign companies seems a certainty unless fundamental action is taken to prevent it," the report says: "A fair consideration of the course the five packers have followed and the position they have already reached must lead to the conclusion that they threaten the freedom of the market of the country's food in - dustries ond af the by-product industries linked therewith. "The meat packer control of other foods will not require long in developing." Declaring "the history of the packers' growth is interwoven with illegal combinations, rebates and with undisclosed control of corpor - ations," the report also urged the importance of full publicity of corporate ownership of all industries. "As to devices for secret con - trol, there does not exist adequate law. In its absence unfair com - petition may run its course to the goal of monopoly and accomplish the ruin of competitors without the secret ownership being suspected and consequently without complaint to the Commission or investigation of facts. The competitor is in jeopardy so long as he has not knowledge of true ownership and the public is entitled to such knowledge." Extensiveness of Packer Activities Pointing out that the Big Five packers jointly or separately wield controlling interest in 574 companies, minority interest in 95 others and undetermined interest in 93 — a total of 762 companies — and that they produce or deal in some 775 commodities, largely food products, the report gives this picture of growing packer invasion into related and un - related industries: "In addition to meat foods, they produce or deal in such divers commodities as fresh tomatoes and banjo strings, leather and cotton - seed oil, breakfast foods, vin fiz, curled hair, pepsin, and washing powd - ers. Their branch houses are not only stations for the distribution of meat and poultry, but take on the character of wholesale grocery stores, dealers in various kinds of produce and jobbers to special lines of trade. "They have interests large enough to be a dominating influence in most of the services connected with the production and distribution of animal foods and their by-products, and are reaching out for con - trol, not only of substitutes of animal food, but of substitutes for other lines into which the integration of their business has led hem. They </seg>

"They are interested in banks from which their competitor pack - ing-houses borrow money; in companies supplying machinery, ice, salt, materials, boxes, etc., to themselves and their competitors; they are principal dealers on the provision exchanges where future prices in standard cured animal products are determined; they or their subsidiary companies deal in hides, oleo, fertilizer material, and other crude animal by-products; purchase from other packers these crude by-pro - ducts, and themselves carry the manufacture thereof to a further stage than most of their competitors. "They are important factors in the leather industry, in oleomargerine and lard substitutes, in cotton-seed oil, in fertilizer, in soap, in glue, etc., L "Their vast distributing system, with the advantages arising from control of private cars, cold storage, and a net-work of branch houses, has enabled them to extend their activities on a large scale into poultry, eggs, cheese, butter, rice, breakfast foods, canned vege - tables, soda-fountain supplies, and other lines. "From rendering edible fats from what would otherwise be wasted in their own factories, they have reached out to secure for rendering the waste fat and bones of local butchers in large sections of the country, and in some instances are interested in companies contracting for the disposal of garbage of large cities. "Individuals of the Armour family are owners of grain and elevator companies, and J. Ogden Armour and the president of one of the Armour subsidiaries are important stockholders in a company producing from mineral deposits in Utah a substitute for potash as an element of com - mercial fertilizers. "J. Ogden Armour is also a prominent factor in the American In - ternational Corporation, with its shipping and ship-building interests, its import and export companies in various lines, its interest in a company organized to develop cattle raising., meat packing, quebrache extract and allied businesses in Paraguay, its control of a large tea-importing company and a sugar-machinery corporation, and its minority stock in the United Fruit Company. Some of Swift &amp; Co.'s subsidiaries are growing tropical fruits in Hawaii; a subsidiary of Wilson &amp; Co., Inc., has reached into the Salmon fisheries of Alaska, and a Morris concern cans shrimp taken in the waters of the Gulf of Mexico. Cattle brought from Central America are slaughtered by or for some of the big packers at Mobile and Jacksonville. In England, France, Italy, Holland and other European countries large meat-distributing companies have been organized by the packers to sell the meats from their plants in the United States, Argentine. Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil, and Australia." </seg>
            <seg id="p179">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 179 The Big Five, the report shows have control of or interest in public utility corporations in Sioux City, Kansas City, South St. Paul, Port - land, Ore., South San Francisco, South St. Joseph, Mo., Hill City, Minn., Forth Worth, Tex., and Chicago. As to financial power, the report in part says: "The packer has drawn to a marked degree upon the banks of the country for liquid funds. . . .he could not operate on the scale he does without the very large loans furnished by the banks. To assure himself loans ample to his purpose, the big packer has secured affiliation through stock owner - ship, representation on directorates, and in other ways, with numerous banks and trust companies. Mr. Armour, Mr. Swift, Mr. Morris and Mr. Wilson are directors in banks affiliated closely with those who are strong at the sources of credit in the United States. Being thus allied with the powerful interests at the sources of credit, the packers' power is great, not only for financing their own national and international operations, but for affecting, for good or for ill, the credit of cattle producers and of competitors or customers in any line." The Big Five in the Leather Industry The packer invasion of the leather industry is shown in the report to have reached the following point at the close of 1917: Armour, Swift, Morris and Wilson — Cudahy not being engaged in tanning until the close of 1917 — produced 44 percent of the country's total output of sheep and lamb shoe stock; 17 percent of sheep and lamb glove and other stock; 11 percent of shoe stock tanned from calf, kip and all skins other than sheep and lamb and goat and kid, and 23 percent of other leather tanned from such skins (except glove stock); 12% perecent of shoe stock from cattle sides; 9 percent of harness leather; 45 percent of strap leather; 21 percent of belting; 22 percent of sole leather; and 13 percent finished splits. The proportion of stocks of hides held in the United States by the Big Five packers as against all other interstate slaughterers, the report shows, ranged from 90.7 percent of a total of 96,989,851 pounds on January 31, 1916, to 88.6 percent of 143,921,858 pounds on July 31, 1917, at no time dropping below 87.1 percent. Big Five in the Fertilizer Industry Armour &amp; Company, Swift &amp; Company and Morris &amp; Company, the report shows, produced in the fiscal year of 1917, approximately one fifth of the entire production in the United States of mixed fertilizers, and one tenth of acid phosphate. Armour &amp; Co. had 30 fertilizer plants in various parts of the country; Swift &amp; Co. had 11 plants for the manufacture of mixed fertilizers and various Swift slaughtering houses are equipped with fertilizer plants. Packers in the Cottonseed Oil Industry LThe Big Five packers in the season of 1916-1917 produced nearly third of the nstion's entire refined cotton oil output of 201 389 000 </seg>
            <seg id="p180">180 other concerns in their manufacture of oleomargerine, lard compound, gallons, or 31.8 percent. Three other interests, the Proctor &amp; Gamble companies, the Southern Cotton Oil Company and the American Cotton Oil Company, produced 42.6 percent, and all other companies, 25.6 per - cent. Of crude cottonseed oil, the three of the packers operating cotton oil mills, Swift, Armour and Morris, produced only some 8 percent of the total production, using however, large quantities purchased from cooking oils, soaps, fertilizers and other products. Production of lard compound and lard substitutes by interstate slaughterers during the first half of 1917 was 87 percent in the hands of the Big Five packers, the report shows. Including all cottonseed oil manufacturers as well as interstate slaughterers, the Big Five producion during this period was 49.4 percent of the total production of lard compound and lard substitutes by these groups. The average monthly holdings of lard compound and lard substitutes by the Big Five during 1916 was 91.0 percent of holdings of all interstate slaughter - ers. Of cottonseed oil soap stock for the season 1916-1917, the Big Five produced 30.2 percent of the total for the country. Oleomargerine production for the entire United States from July 1915 to June 1916 was 41.7 percent controlled by Armour, Swift, Morris and Wilson interests; and 74.1 percent by the "Oleo Legislative Pool", embracing beside these packers, John F. Jelke Co., and W. J. Moxley, Inc. In grains, the Armour Grain Company, Chicago, of which J. Ogden Armour owns 64 percent of the stock and other members of the Armour family 22.9 percent, directly or through its subsidaries operates over 90 country grain elevators. Its eight terminal elevators at Chicago and its two at Kansas City constitute 25 percent of the total elevator capacity of those cities. In 1917, its sales were 74,847,000 bushels or 22.6 percent of all grain receipts at Chicago, the world's greatest market; and its business is growing rapidly. In connection with its chain of country elevators, the Armour Grain Company merchandizes fertilizer, feed, coal, fence posts, wire fencing, builders' hardware, binding twine, lumber, mill work, cement, lime, plaster, brick, sand and gravel and roofing. In the manufacture of breakfast foods, and stock and chicken feeds, the Armour Grain Company, says the report, "is expanding especially in the line of producing retail brands. Within four years, it has under - taken the manufacture of Armour's Oats, has taken over the Buffalo Cereal Co. with its many brands of cereal foods and animal feeds, and in 1917 took over the Mapl-Flake Mills, of Battle Creek, Mich." Packer Invasion of Other Food Industries and Substitutes for Meats "The reason why the packers are seeking control of the substitutes for meat — the foods that compete with meats — are obvious," says the report. "If the prices of substitutes for meats are once brought under packer control, the consumer will have little to gain in turning to them </seg>
            <seg id="p181">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 181 for relief from excessive meat prices." An Armour advertisement in the New York Daily Mail, December 31, 1917, said in part: "The intelligent housewife has come to realize that the Armour name is synonymous with virtually- every food she needs for her table practically everything for every meal in the week, including the Meatless Day! Soups, fish, vegetables, fruits, condiments, beverages — she can obtain them all under the guarantee of the Armour name." Packers in Poultry and Dairy Products "Judged conservatively by trade estimates, the Big Five handle at least half of the poultry, eggs and cheese in the main channels of inter - state commerce," the report states. "Most estimates place the total production in dressed poultry and eggs controlled by the packers at a higher percentage. "Practically all estimates received stated the packers handle 75 to 80 percent of all cheese produced in Wisconsin alone where 55.6 per - cent of the entire country's cheese was made at the time of the last manufacturing census in 1914. All of the Big Five are distributors of cheese and all except Wilson &amp; Co. own and control large cheese com - panies. "The packers are also important factors in condensed milk, and are rapidly increasing their proportion. Wisconsin is covered by their cream - eries, condenseries and buying stations, and a similar process of con - centration and control is already evident in the other principal dariy states. "Swift &amp; Co. is the largest single butter distributor in the United States, handling in 1916 approximately 50,000,000 pounds or nearly as much as the combined sales of the two largest non-packer organiz - ations; and the butter department was pushing for a 25 percent increase in 1918 over 1917. Swift &amp; Co. alone, for its own creameries, collects cream in Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Mexico, Ohio, Oklahoma, Texas, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. Companies owned or controlled by it, such as W. F. Priebe &amp; Co., Western Meat Company, Union Meat Co., and Libby, McNeill &amp; Libby, obtain milk and cream in still other states. "Armour &amp; Co. in 1916 handled in its branch houses f.lone over 28,000,000 pounds of butter. Most of its creamery butter was manu - factnred by the Eau Claire Creamery Co., Eau Claire. Wis., which is controlled by Armour; the Kentucky Creameries, Louisville, owned entirely by Armour; Oakdale Creamery, Oakriele. Calif.. A. S. Kinin - month Produce Co., Winfield, Kan., and the Michigan Ice &amp; Cold Storage Co., operated by Armour; and the Armour plant in Rochester, Ind. "Moiris &amp; Co. operates no creameries but controls Sherman White &amp; Co., Fort Wayne, Ind., and buys large quantities of butter rnanu- </seg>
            <seg id="p182">182 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT factured by other concerns; Cudahy owns tho D. E. Wood Butter Co., Evansvill&lt;?, Wis., and the Sunlight Produce Co., Sioux City, Wilson &amp; Co. owns no creameries but purchases outside." The Big Five, the report shows, sold in 1916 through their branch houses aione, nearly 100,000,000 pounds of poultry, 90,000,000 pounds of butter, 75,600,000 pounds of cheese and over 135,000,000 dozen eggs. Packers in Canned Fruit, Vegetables, Etc. "Fruit and vegetable caning are remote from slaugtering and meat packing, but the big packers, through their branch house system of distribution possess special advantages in this field of industry," the report says. "The Big Five's advantage rests not so much on their ownership of canning factories, although in some branches their out - put amounts to more than a quarter of the total for the United States, as upon their rapidly growing control of the wholesale distri - bution of canned goods, Armour &amp; Co.increased its canned goods sales from about $6,500,000 in 1916 to $16,000,000 in 1917, whereas the com - bined sales of these products of Austin Nichols Co. and Sprague, Warner &amp; Co., two of the largest independent wholesalers, amounted to only some $6,000,000 in 1917. Although distribution is the point at which the packers have acquired the greatest control, they are nevertheless entering the field of manufacture." Swift &amp; Co. the report pointed out, through Libby, McNeill &amp; Libby, has become a factor of considerable importance, canning tomatoes, beans, baked beans, cabbage, spinach, asparagus, beets, pumpkins, squash, sauer kraut, pears, apples, cherries, grapes, berries, plums and pine - apples. "Libby, McNeill &amp; Libby (Maine) owns 96 percent of Libby, McNeill &amp; Libby (Ltd.), of Honolulu, engaged in raising and canning pineapples; 100 percent of the Ahuimanu Pineapple &amp; Ranch Co.. 100 percent of the Thomas Pineapple Co.; and 50 percent of the Stetson &amp; Ellison Co., engaged in canning. "Armour Wilson and Morris have likewise entered the manufactur - ing phase of the canning field through acquirement of ownership or con - trol of canning companies. "Both canned salmon and other canned fish, as well as dried and salt fish — foremost meat substitutes — are handled by Swift and Armour through their branch house system." Staple Groceries and Vegetables "Recently the big packers began dealing in various staple groceries and vegetables, such as rice, potatoes, beans and coffee, and increased their sales at such a rate that in certain lines they have become factors of great moment. Here again the selling organization of the packers, built up in connection with their meat business, assures them almost certain supremacy in any line of food handling which they may wish to enter. </seg>
            <seg id="p183">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 183 "Armour's drive into the rice market in a single year is perhaps the most striking instance of their potentialties in this direction. Early in 1917, Armour &amp; Co. first undertook the handling of rice, and in that one year sold more than 16,000,000 pounds of rice, thus becoming at a single move, on the statement of the vice-president of the company, 'the greatest rice merchant in the world.' During this period the whole - sale price of rice increased 65 percent. "Even the oldest and most strongly established wholesaling houses find that line after line of their merchandise is being absorbed by the packers' branch house system. First the packers encroached on the handling of butter, eggs and cheese, then on canned goods, and on various kinds of 'package goods'; and now are handling increasing quan - tities of rice, coffee and other staples. "In 1917, the ig Five's combined sales of meats and all other com - modities totaled $2,127,245,000; in 1918 they were over ?3,000,000,000. Big Five Dominance in the Meat Industry The Big Five in 1916, according to Commission figures, slaughtered 82.2 percent of all cattle slaughtered by interstate slaughterers; 86.4 per - cent of all sheep; 76.6 percent of all calves; and 61.2 percent of swine. "As to both cattle and sheep," the report states: "The percentage of control by these five concerns constitutes a monopolistic position, con - sidering the harmony with which the five work together in their pur - chase of animals and the extensiveness of their distributing systems. These combined percentages of control indicate a potential degree of in - fluence over the price paid to the producer and over the price paid by the consumer, sufficient, if exercised, to account for a large share of the suspicions and complaints that have arisen over the meat industry." The explanation of the 81.2 percent slaughter of hogs lies, the report points out, in the nature of the products. The advantage of the big packer to utilize by-products most efficiently has less scope in hog slaughter because only some 10 percent of the live hog goes to by - products as against 20 percent of cattle. Also, the big packers lose the special advantage of their highly developed refrigeration and private car-line systems, since cured hog products do not require refrigeration in shipping. For these reasons, the report stated, nearly all the inde - pendent interstate slaughterers confine their interstate trade to curort hog products; and in fresh meats do principally a local business. Including besides all interstate slaughterers, all wholesale local or interstate slaughterers, all wholesale local or interstate slaughterers, the Big Five percentage of slaughter in numbers of head are: catle, 74.5; sheep, 78.5; calves, 62.5; swine, 56.9. "The ability of the large packers to undersell the small slaughterer Sly," says the report, "is a potent weapon, even if unused, to keep from undertaking any aggressive campaign to increase his business, branch houses and 'peddler car' routes of the Chicago packers cover :ountry with such a network that the local slaughterer realizes that </seg>
            <seg id="p184">184 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT he cannot maintain himself against their distributing system if he should attract their unfavorable attention by aggressively trying to increase his volume of business. . The local packer, though able to compete in the local market, fears to exert his full powers. His strong tendency is to come in 'under the umbrella' of big packer prices and to content himself with a modest share of the near-by business. Evidence on this point and on competitive conditions generally is given in other parts of the report." Average monthly holdings of non-perishable meats during 1916, the report ShOWS, Were for the Big Five as against all other inter - state slaughterers; of frozen beef, 95.6 percent; smoked ham and bacon, 64.1 percent; dry salt pork, 69.8; pickled pork, 70.5; total meats from gwine, 70.0. Big Five Control in 12 Great Packing Centers The Big Five control of interstate slaughter at the 12greatpacking centers— Chicago, Kansas City, Omaha, St. Louis, New York City, St. Joseph, Fort Worth, st. Paul, Sioux City, Oklahoma City, Denver and Wichita — was during 1916, 944 percent of cattle; 89.1 calves; 94.3 sheep and lambs; and 81 swine. "In the Chicago market— the largest in the country— the Big Five slaughter 87.1 percent of all cattle slaughtered there for interstate com - merce; 93.6 percent of calves; 96.5 sheep and lambs; and 67.3 swine," the report states. "In the remaining 11 cities they have 97.6 percent of the total cattle slaughter." Big Five Control of Stockyards Receipts of live animals at stockyards controlled by the Big Five packers, including Chicago as dominated, as against receipts at in - dependently controlled yards during 1916, were in the following per - centages: of cattle, 83.1; sheep, 78.1; calves, 78.8; swine, 74.4; horses and mules, 84.6; total all animals, 77.2. Kg Five Control Over Refrigerator Transportation The Big Five on December 31, 1917 owned 93 percent of the 16,600 refrigerator cars owned by interstate slaughterers; 20 percent of the 7,992 ventilator cars — used principally in fruit and vegetable traffic — ; and 92 percent of the 24,592 total refrigerator cars of interstate slaughterers. Of all refrigerator cars in the United States, the Big Five Owned 91 percent of beef cars, other interstate slaughterers 7 percent, private car companies, 2 percent; Big Five owned 7 percent of ventilator cars, other interstate slaughterers 1 percent, private car companies, 6 per - cent, and railroad intersts, 86 percent. Big Five Branch Houses and Peddler Car Routes The Big Five packers in 1916 had 1,120 branch houses throughout the United States, 89 percent of the total of all interstate slaughterers. </seg>
            <seg id="p185">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL society 185 They maintained 1,297 peddler car routes, listing 58,000 towns, — including duplications on lists of the different peddlers — or 90.2 percent of car routes of all interstate slaughterers. "The branch houses," explains the report, "which are located in the cities and large towns, are supplemented by a wide-reaching 'peddler car' service, Which consists of refrigerator cars loaded with meats and provisions operating over what are known as car routes. These peddler cars are in effect miniature branch houses on wheels, reaching thousands Of Small communities where trade is not sufficient to justify the in - vestment in a branch house." Branch house and car route gales of the Big Five for 1916 were 58.2 percent of their total sales for that year, or over $925,000,000. During that year, the Big Five sold through these means some 6,500,000,000 pounds of commodities, or something like 65 pounds per capita for the entire population of the continental United States; or 156 pounds per capita of population living in cities or towns of over 8,000 inhabitants. Branch house sales of fresh and cured meat by all interstate slaughterers in 1916 showed the Big Five sold 94.9 percent of fresh meat, 86.5 percent of cured meat, and 92.8 of fresh and cured combin-d. The 1,120 Big Five branch houses represented in 1916 a book value investment of $30,275,550, with sales of $783,343,549. As to branch houses where both land and buildings were owned, the investment was ?20,184,427 and sales $338,866,188— an investment per dollar of 3ale» of six cents. The Big Five in South America From establishment of a single plant in Argentina in 1907 by Swift &amp; Company, the American Packers, Swift, Armour, Morris and 'Wilson, had developed by 1917 until for that year they exported 57.4 percent of all exports of frozen and chilled beef quarters from Argentina and Uruguay. "It is significant of their power and the rapidity of their action," says the report, "that in 1910, three years after their entrance into the River Plate (Argentina) field, they had secured control of Over 40 percent of the trade; that in 1915 they had substantially 65 percent; and that their weighted average control during the eight years from 1910 to 1917 was 55 percent. In this period they exported nearly 22,000,000 quarters of beef from these two South American countries, which represents well over 5,000,000 head of cattle." The American packers control or are associated with 17 meat com - panies or holding companies in South America, according to their re - ports to the Commission. Chronological Growth of the Big Five Commenting on an elaborate table of "The Packers' Progress 1857 - 1917", the report says: "To reconstruct the economic and financial history that lies be- </seg>
            <seg id="p186">FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT 186 hind this bare record of outward change would be an undertaking re - plete with human interest. There can be little doubt that such a his - tory, if it could be written, would reveal imagination, energy, shrewd - ness, and indomitable determination on the part of the founders of these great slaughtering companies, but would also reveal, even if obscurely, a back-ground of wreckage brought about by unfair and oppressive methods followed by these packers in their progress toward their goal." From four slaughtering plants in the decade, 1858-1867, the Big Ffve had built or acquired by 1917, 91 slaughter plants— 22% times the number in 1867. In the ten years from 1908 to 1917, their number of slaughtering plants increased 60 percent. Swift, Morris and Armour increased their cattle slaughter from 2,580,695 head in 1898 to 5,157,830 in 1916, doubling their kill in those 18 years. From slaughtering 74.9 percent of cattle slaughtered in in - terstate commerce in 1907-1908, the Big Five jumped to 80.8 percent by 1916-1917; from 63 percent in calves to 73.6; from 71.6 in sheep to 86.6; from 53.2 in swine to 60.2. In the face of this nine-year growth of the Big Five, the independent interstate slaughterers lost ground in actual number of head slaughtered as well as in their proportionate shares. In 1907-1908, all interstate independents slaughtered 1,788,120 cattle and by 1916-1917 had dropped to 1,783,518 — their interstate slaugh - ter cut down proportionately one-fifth in nine years. During this period, the Big Five slaughter grew from 5,330,155 head to 7,515,971. In sheep, the independents fell off from 2,753,458 to only 1,524,617; while the Big Five increased from 6,949,087 to 9,818,801. The independents lost over one-half in sheep and lambs; three-tenths in calves and over one - seventh in swine. Starting with two branch houses in 1884, the Big Five had 211 by 4; 743 by 1904; and operated 1,120 in 1917. COMMUNITY COUNCIL WORK DURING THE PERIOD OF DEMOB- ILIZATION AND READJUSTMENT AND THE PERMANENT ORGANIZATION OF COMMUNITIES (Community Council Circular No. 4) January 15, 1919 To the County and Community Councils of Defense and Units of the Woman's Committee: Community councils are the units of the council of defense system upon which, more than any other, depends the successful conduct Of t ri£ work of demobilization and read iustmGnt D urine* the war they </seg>
            <seg id="p187">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 187 amply demonstrated their ability to meet emergency problems. In the period of demobilization when the emergencies are local, community councils, more even than during the war, are essential to carry out the work directly entrusted to the councils of defense to strengthen the hands of every Federal agency, and to weld together in understanding and sym - pathy and unity of purpose and effort the work of all the forces operating in each community. At this time it is their especial opportunity to relieve from all un - necessary hardship those members of the community who have been willing to give up everything in order to serve in the armed forces of the United States in the great struggle for ligerty and democracy, and as far as possible to free the home coming of these men from all anxiety as to their present and future welfare, so that it may be for them, as well as for the community, a time of unclouded rejoicing. In addition to all emergency work, a continuing service lies before the comunity councils. They have brought out of the war a new unity and sense of cooperative community fellowship. One of the lessons which we have learned in the strain of war is the interdependence of social effort. It is now, therefore, the duty and opportunity of the com - munity councils to make the new unity a permanent asset in the na - tional life, to the end of leavening the entire Nation with the spirit of cooperative and communal endeavor. Throught the community councils we may very well express in ser - vice the measure of our gratitude to our soldiers and sailors and con - tribute to the several Commonwealths and to the Nation a new and enduring benefit. Very truly, yours, Grosvenor B. Clarkson Director of the Council and of the Field Division The Need The cessation of hostilities has not concluded the war emergency. Great emergency tasks still lie before the people of America. The pro - grams of demobilization and readjustment call for response in service from every citizen. To secure this response, it is necessary that all citizens in each community be brought together in a general community organization where each individual will come into intelligent touch with the emerg - ency programs and the support of every individual and every agency focused thereon. To make this response effective further requires that the work of all agencies and persons should be coordinated and welded into united action and that there should be some central general agency which can undertake directly those programs for which there is no special agency in the community. In a word, there must be a people's workshop where patriotism is turned into action is secured through freely willed teamplay. This workshop in each community is the com- </seg>
            <seg id="p188">188 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT munity council. Upon the community councils the Council of National Defense now relies to do the work of the present emergency. when the emergency programs of demobilization are a thing of the past, the need for the organization of each community will, nevertheless, endure. Each community will need organization in order that its people may come in effective working contact with the problems of the State and the Nation and that the voice of the community may become articulate in regard thereto. Each community will need organization order to develop a true community interest and responsibility that 1 lead to community initiative and action to meet local needs, in order that the programs of separate institutions and agencies may best be adjusted to meet the particular needs and opportunities of the individual community and in order that the welfare of the community may be safeguarded through intelligent thoroughgoing planning and not left to chance and the competition of individual agencies. Finnally, this organization is needed in order to provide for every individual in the community a true place in the community life and to bring to the com - munity as a whole a sense of fellowship and cooperation that will enrich the life of the community and make each citizen proud of his community citizenship. kThe need of community organization, both now and in the future, best be seen, however, in concrete programs of work and organiz - n. A Reconstruction Program for Community Councils Each community council, as an emergency task, should carry through to completion so much of the following program as is adapted to the needs of its community. Each county council should see that this pro - gram is brought to the attention of all community councils in its juris - diction and should assist the community councils in the execution there - of. For the sake of clarity the program is worded peremptorily and directed to the individual community council. It should be borne dis - tinctly in mind, however, that this program is suggestive only and should be modified in each county and community as experience indicates is most desirable. The Returning Soldier and Sailor tNo present task is more important than providing for the welfare these men. Develop a sentiment of local pride in making con - ons satisfactory for the returned soldier. 1. Employment.— See that a "Bureau for Returning Soldiers. Sailors, and War Workers" to provide employment, information, and other assistance to these men on their return is created wherever con - ditions warrant it, following the plans of the United States Employ - ment Service. If no such bureau exists in your community and it is </seg>
            <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 189 the opinion of your community council that it is needed, communicate at once with the State director of the United States Employment Service or with the Council of National Defense at Washington, D. C, and full plans will be sent to you. 2. Legal Assistance. — See that every soldier coming into your com - munity who has any litigation pending against him under the soldiers' and sailors' civil rights act is warned of the importance of immediate action to safeguard his rights and is given free legal service for the conduct of the litigation. See also that all men whose land titles, leases, or insurance policies are encumbered, whose business affairs have been confused, or who otherwise are in need of legal aid to solve problems which have arisen in their absences, are given such aid free and are made aware that it is thus available. Put this need up to the lawyers in your community and they will respond, then post notices saying who the lawyers are and where the men can find them. 3. Moral Welfare.— Safeguard the moral welfare of the returning men by seeing that all regulations as to sale of liquor and for the pre - vention of venereal diseases are rigorously enforced, and that if such ordinances do not exist they are immediately enacted. 4. Disabled Soldiers. — See that no disabled man returning to the community fails to take the special vocational training given by the Federal Board for Vocational Education which will fit him to earn his living, and that he is not misled by unwise entertainment to believe that he can live on his reputation. 5. Receptions.— See that some group in the community gives an ap - propriate reception to each soldier and sailor immediately upon his re - turn. If it is so desired, when all or nearly all have returned, the com - munity council could well provide a general community reception in honor of the soldiers and sailors of the community. Aid in Demobolization 1. Deserters. — Upon orderly demobilization depends the welfare of the returning soldiers as whole. Assist The Adjutant General in pro - viding for orderly demobilization by reporting to the nearest agent of the Department of Justice all deserters from the Army who come into the community, or preferably by inducing them to return to their camps. Make clear to all persons in the community that connivance in desertion is not a kindness to the soldier, but induces him to aggravate a serious crime for which he will probably be punished by penal servitude and may be punished by death. 2. War-Risk Insurance. — Report to the Bureau of War-Risk Insur - ance, Washington, D. C, all cases of allotments and allowances being paid after soldiers are discharged or to persons falsely claiming to be wives, children, or dependents. The Bureau of War-Risk Insurance will promptly investigate these cases. </seg>

Food Production. — Unite with the county farm agent in carrying out the national agricultural program necessary to meet the present emergency demand for food. Aid him in creating a farm bureau, if one does not already exist in your community. 2. Food Conservation. — Get in touch with the nearest local food administrator and carry out on his behalf the food conservation program through which alone our present supply can be made to meet the world rd. Unite also with the county home demonstration agent in the work education in food saving and diet improvement. 3. Boys' Working Reserve.— Assist in food production through de - veloping an adequate Boys' Working Reserve wherever farm labor is scarce. If there is no reserve in your community write for details to the Boys' Working Reserve, United States Department of Labor, Wash - ington, D. c. 4. Fire Protection. — Protect and conserve food through providing adequate fire protection to all standing crops and goods in storage, through providing adequate fire-fighting apparatus, inspection of de - positories, and fire warnings, especially in regard to grain fields. Americanization f Unity Essential to Successful Democracy. — The need for assimilation the foreign-born at this time of intense national feeling is one of the great emergencies of the present period. In all communities with a considerable foreign-born element the community council should en - deavor to assimilate all foreign-born citizens into true American citizen - ship and into the community by — LI. Providing education in English, and in American institutions and Is. b2. Seeing that all foreign-born citizens are taken into the com - ity activity and life in such a way as not to violate the customs and Is which they have long cherished, and to make them realize that they have a definite contribution to make to America. Bear in mind that music is an effective avenue of approach. For further information as to Americanization, write to the Division of Americanization, Department of the Interior, and Bureau of Natural - ization, Department of Labor, Washington, D. C. Children's Year War Children To-day Our Men and Women of the Future. — See that the Children's Year program is carried through to completion. Every child up to 6 years of age should have been weighed and measured. Secure the treatment of every defect discovered by providing public healthe nurses county child health centers, clinics, etc. </seg>
            <seg id="p191">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 191 See that every child of school age attends school regularly. We must not let our parents or children submit to the temptation of high wages now when leaving school will mean a low future wage and lower value as a citizen. See to it, as well, that no child of school age is forced to leave school for work by financial necessity. See that no child-labor standard is lowered, and no child-labor law is unenforced in your community. Relief Assist the social agencies of the community in presenting a strong and united front to the relief problem of the coming winter of high prices and uncertain employment. The relief of the families of soldiers and sailors is in the hands Subscriptions See that your community subscribes its due part in the coming Liberty Loans, the 1919 War Savings Stamps issue, and such local and foreign relief campaigns as are indorsed by the State council or by an appropriate branch of the Federal Government. Health Take whatever action is deemed advisable by the best medical authorities in your community to stamp out the last traces of the in - fluenza epidemic. Community Meetings and Community Singing Conduct community meetings and develop community singing. This work, which is described more fully in the sections on organization which follow, is true emergency work. Successful community meetings are essential to place your programs before the people. Community singing is a wonderful factor in maintaining among the people that patriotic and civic interest and desire to serve which is essential to the execution of all programs of popular cooperation. Coordination The community council should be a coordinating agency and clear - ing house for all emergency work in the community and should assist Federal, State, and worthy voluntary agencies in the conduct of their work. It should make each agency feel that its individual integrity is being thoroughly respected and yet should bring all together for consultation and joint action. There should be no duplication or re - placement of the work of existing organizations. Whenever the work can be done by an existing agency the community council should work through it and strengthen it. </seg>
            <seg id="p192">192 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT Local Initiative Too much stress can not be laid upon the importance of each com - munity council's undertaking independent work to meet the emergencies of its own locality. Local needs and opportunities call for local initiative and action. A Program for an Organized Community (A permanent program, of course, must be stated as brief sugges - tions only, leaving it to the individual community to map out work specially adapted to its needs.) The first and greatest task of an organized community is to study its community problems as a whole and then to see that each problem is being adequately taken care of by the action of some agency, or, where no appropriate agency exists, by the creation of a new agency or direct action by the community. The community or - ganization should feel that it is its responsibility to lead the action of all agencies operating in the community so that they will be closely adjusted to the needs of the community and so that the forces in the community will meet the problems of the community with a united front and a systematic and thoroughgoing program. To accomplish this is the underlying reason for community organization. A permanent community program may well cover the following sub - jects. Each subject should be carefully considered each year in pre - paring the annual program, and the progress under each general heading in the annnual program should be reported on at the quarterly or other regular meeting. Community Welfare Upon the welfare of each member of the community depends the welfare of all. 1. Health and Sanitation. — Bring together in a permanent work - ing group, as a basis for all health work, all of the agencies, private and public, concerned with public health, to pool their forces in this work. (a) Improvement of sanitary conditions of all public places, stores, restaurants, and places such as farms, bakeries, etc., where food is made, of sewers, garbage removal, water supply, etc. t(b) Combating malnutrition and providing examination and treat - t of all children, especially as to curable defects, making .permanent child health work manifested in the Children's Year.

How to Organize a Community C Where no community exists we suggest the following scheme of or - ization. Where a community council has been organized, many of the following suggestions will be valuable in providing a permanent form of organization: What is a Community. — Choose for your organization a unit which, if possible, is already a social community. Such a unit should not be so large that all the members of the community can not be reached dir - ectly by personal contact. It is desirable, other things being equal, that the unit should be of such size that all residents can be brought together at a single meeting and all generally know one another. The unit, however, should not be so small that it has no sense of community problems and has few local needs that can not be met by individual </seg>
            <seg id="p195">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 195 All the people. — A community organization is not a selected body. It is the organization of the community itself. The basis of mem - bership in an organized community should be residence. Strive, there - fore, to have every member of the community an active member of the organization and to draw each one into some form of active work. All Agencies. — Include in the organization of your community all agencies operating in the community. This means all churches, official agencies, voluntary societies, citizens' organizations, etc. It ia not a new organization, but a unification of existing forces. Its strength is the strength of the agencies federated in it. Do not at any time hesitate to recognize, or to assist in organizing, a new special agency that serves a worthy agency feel that its integrity will not be inter - fered with through becoming a member of the community organization, but that the agency will be drawn into closer contact with the other forces of the community, and in the development of its special programs will have the assistance of all residents and of all other agencies in the community. How to Begin. — Wherever possible begin the organization of your community through drawing together existing agencies. Where farm bureaus or community centers exist, they provide a nucleus about which other agencies can be drawn together and an organized community can be built up. In all cases, it is better, as well as easier, to start with a few organizations, convincing them of the community idea and then through their aid extending the organization to cover all agencies and indi - viduals in the community. Organization Committee. — Create an organization committee which will represent the various interests and agencies of the community. With this organization committee plan an organization meeting. Organization Meeting. — Have the organization committee call a mass meeting, possibly at the school house, of all citizens of the community. Have present, if possible, representatives of the county council of de - fense, the county unit of the Woman's Committee of the Council of Na - tional Defense, the county farm agent, the county home demonstration agent, the county superintendent of schools, the principal of the high school of the community, the head of the local chapter of the American Red Cross, the director of the Y. M. C. A., and representatives of similar agencies. Plan for good music, to include singing by the aud - ience. Arrange the entire program in advance. First, have a good and vigorous speaker present the need for community organization both to meet the emergency of demobilization and as a permanent asset to the community. Then, have the temporary president of the organ - ization committee outline specifically the plans for organizing the com - munity. Follow these by brief statements from the principal agencies </seg>
            <seg id="p196">196 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT of their desire to federate with the organizing communities and of their belief that through such federation their integrity will not be impaired and their strength will be increased. Then turn the meeting over to those present for permanent organization. This can be accomplished through the election of a chairman and of a permanent community board. t Community Board. — The community board should be composed of m three to ten persons, both men and women, elected by the com - munity at large. It should include in addition, either in its membership or in an advisory capacity, representatives of the principal agencies of the community. A chairman should be chosen either by election by the whole community or by the vote of the board. Executive Secretary. — In most communities an executive secretary should be appointed to be responsible for the conduct of all activities. The executive secretary should be chosen on the basis of fitness and ability to give the necessary time to act as community organizer and to perform executive work, should be considered entirely as an executive appointee and not appointed on the basis of his prominence in the community, and wherever possible should be paid. This can often be accomplished by centralizing agencies so that they may use a com - mon office and employ in common the executive secretary, contributing pro rata to the expense. An able school teacher can often be secured as a voluntary executive secretary, or there may be obtained a paid secretary at a small sum additional to his or her salary. k Committees. — The board should appoint or designate special com - ttees. Do not appoint unnecessary committees. Only appoint com - ttees in fields where there is active work to be done and then insist that each committee do active work. Whenever an existing agency fully covers an entire field of endeavor it should be made the special committee thereon and no additional committee should be appointed. New committees should only be appointed if there is more than one agency in the field, when the committee should be in the nature of a co - ordinating committee, or if there is no agency in the field. All com - mittees and officers should be chosen with the object of securing men and women of sufficient vigor and ability to devise and carry out pro - grams that will meet the individual needs of the community and of sufficient tact and force to bring together in joint action the various agencies through whom these programs are to be executed. The Initial Community Task. — As soon as the community organ - ization is affected, undertake a community task that will include as many people and agencies as possible. A health campaign is especially suitable for this. It is of indisputable value. It can be participated in by young and old, thus drawing them in to the organization. It in - volves nearly all agencies and necessitates joint action and pooling of </seg>
            <seg id="p197">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 197 Regular Meetings. — The community councils should have regular meetings, possibly quarterly. Through such meetings only can a true community spirit be developed and all the various elements welded to - gether. At these general metings reports should be heard from the various committees and agencies at work in the community, and a re - port should be made by the governing committee as to the desirability of new activities and as to any field work upon which the community determines to concentrate during the coming quarter. Each meeting should be made attractive through some form of social entertainment, and especially through community singing. In pro - viding these entertainments, seek out and utilize the local talent of the community and endeavor to give to the meeting an air of social festivity which will make all people look ahead to the quarterly community con - ferences. Hold these meetings in the schoolhouse or some other place which is common to the whole community. Get school children with talent to make attractive posters for bulletin boards in the post offices or in the town hall. In large municipal communities have mimeo - graphed or printed handbills made to be distributed by the school chil - dren announcing the meetings. Above all, get the cooperation of the local newspapers, foreign language as well as English, in announcing and writing up the meetings. At these meetings always encourage questions and discussions, so that every member of the community will feel that he has not only heard the plans of the community for the work of the coming quarter but has had an opportunity to express his views in the determination of these plans. Designate one of these meetings as the annual meeting at which officers are elected for the coming year, and the program for the year announced. Special Meetings. — In addition to the annual and quarterly meetings, hold special meetings as often as good programs can be provided; but not so often as to compete with the attendance of the community at the regular meetings. Build each special meeting around one particular subject, preferably one of immediate community or national interest. In every case, endeavor to bring out the connection of the subject under discussion to the life of the community. Bear in mind that in these meetings, as well as in the regular meetings, it is valuable to have a lighter side to the program to relieve the serious discussion. Or - ganize debates, short plays, musicales, etc. Provide motion pictures and stereopticon views. In the summer, it is well to hold out-door meet - ings, and at these meetings to include athletic carnivals and games. In communities with varying nationalities appeal to national pride by assigning various parts of the program to the various foreign societies or groups. Organize stirring patriotic meetings on the national holidays of America. In every meeting make sure that a large part of the community has something to do besides listening and make sure that the young people </seg>
            <seg id="p198">198 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT especially the boys, feel that the meeting has "pep." At the same time, let the older people feel that the meeting serves some real purpos. Possibly, in larger communities, special meetings for older people and for younger people can be held. Publicity. — Keep the community organization constantly before the people of the community. Urge the local papers to give prominence to news of what the various elements of the community organization are doing. Establish, if possible, a column headed "What the Community is Doing." Also, maintain a community bulletin board with constantly up-to-date news of "community doings." Be always accurate in state - ments of facts in news matters; news rises no higher, in the end, than the character of its source. Coordination. — Have frequent meetings of all committees. Es - ally important are frequent regular meetings of the governing board, where informal reports on the activity of each agency are made and discussed and suggestions for joint activity are brought forward. Remember that coordination means team play and joint action; that it is not enough merely to work peacefully together. Community organi - zation is a pooling of endeavors and of resources. This can only be accomplished if each agency is willing to assist in the work of others, and is willing to have others assist it in its work. This can only be accomplished, also, if the governing board makes it perfectly clear that it, itself, is not endeavoring to build up a new organization, but to strengthen the work of all organizations and to bring them in closer touch with each other, and, therefore, in closer harmony with the local community life. In no case should the organized community itself undertake a specific activity when there is some existing agency through which the work could be done. Expenses. — As the community organization is not a separate body and conducts its work through special agencies, it will itself need almost no funds. Such slight expenses as may be involved can be largely mef through observation of the principle of "a penny saved is a penny earned." Use the parks, schoolhouses, and other public build - ings or places for meetings and offices. Utilize the services of public officials in a legitimate way whenever possible. Work through existing agencies. When work is done on a joint basis ask the agencies involved to contribute pro rata. If this is done, almost all expenses will be met without special funds. A small special fund will probably be needed to pay overhead expenses, and this can best be obtained either through charging a small admission fee to the principal entertainments, or through a membership fee, so small, however, as to be easily met by every member of the community. If additional funds are necessary, they can be provided through the establishment of contributing mem - berships, for which a considerably increased fee is charged, and through </seg>

Probably the questions are the most natural ones in the world. Probably they are based on a created public sentiment. "The questions are: What was the attitude of the welfare workers in France toward each other? and, was there any religious discrimin - ation?" "To the first question I say: Best in the world. To the second I saw: None whatever," said Miss Martha Porter of Des Moines, Iowa, a returned overseas worker for the Salvation Army, who is assisting in the Salvation Army Reconstruction Home Service Campaign in Ne - braska. "Why should two or more welfare organizations working for the same thing — the welfare of the soldier boy — be antagonistic to each other? The answer is obvious. "I have had numerous people ask me these questions. My friends act as if they expected an uncensored statement. Many folks seem to be honest in an effort to get the real truth. I have made and served doughnuts in Y. M. C. A. huts for the reason the 'Y' had the facilities for entertaining and I had the grease and ingredients for doughnuts which the 'Y' did not have. I have never tasted anything so good as the big gum drops the Knights of Columbus men would send us in a neighborly return for a plate of fresh doughnuts. Had we been men they would have sent us cigarets. In places where the Knights of Columbus did not have huta the workers were our boarders. I never knew a Salvation Army worker to be too busy to prepare hot food for transient guests whether they were welfare workers or soldier boys. Red Cross workers and telephone operators passing through camps knew they were welcome to a share in our pork and beans, and to our doughnuts. No one can ever know what the Red Cross canteen has meant in France to the soldier boys and to the welfare workers. The Salvation Army popularized the doughnut in France Knowing the boy had a big appetite for the doughnuts the Red Cross workers learned to make them. Womanlike, everytime they saw a Salvation Army worker, the doughnut making expert, they would want her appraisement on their doughnuts. We exchanged receipes and advice in making and frying like two home cooks. We owed many a comfort to the Jewish Welfare workers. They seemed to always know just what we would appreciate and brought it for us. Among my prized tropies of war are the knitted sweaters, towels, and comfort kits given me last winter by the Red Cross at a time I most needed them. To be included in the distribution was like being considered a soldier of war and so appreciated. </seg>

"Looking back now I cannot remember whether or not we knew just what we were. It used to be a joke with us at Gondrecourt as to what particular brand of religion was being specialized upon in the hut at any particular time of the day. 'What are we now?' Someone would ask. 'Look out in the hut and see,' was the answer. Every Tuesday and Friday it was my duty to clear out a closet in which we kept our rubber garments for use as a confessional by the Catholic priest. Here is the regular Sunday program at Gondrecourt, the largest hut in France: 8:00 — Catholic Mass. 9:00 — Catholic Mass. 10:00 — Services by Army Chaplain. 6:00 — Young People's Meeting. 7:00 — General Service, Salvation Army. In France with the mud knee deep, it did not seem incongruous that the priest should be wearing muddy boots with his lace robe while conducting the service. We all attended the services and the same boys were sitting on the same hard benches for all services. The only difference was the Catholic boys knew when to kneel during the service and the others did not. It only took a few minutes to convert our plat - form into an altar. Late one Saturday night the priest brought me a large linen sheet which he had found in a shelled house. I washed, ironed and had it ready for him for an altar cloth early the next morn - ing. The three day Jewish Passover Servicees this year were held in the Salvation Army hut. We helped to prepare the big dinner served at the close of the fast by the Jewish Welfare Board workers. No effort was made whatever by any religious order to make con - verts to that religion. The appeal made by all of us to the boys, was for clean living and to live true to the faith of their mothers. In appreciation of what the Salvation Army did oversea, James A. Flaherty of New Haven, Connecticut, Supreme Knight of the Knights of Columbus, has written Colonel Richard E. Holz of the Salvation Army, an endorsement of the Salvation Army reconstruction Home Service Campaign in Nebraska during the week of September 21 to 27. His letter reads: "Dear Colonel: — My attention has been called to the Campaign you are to launch to raise a fund in the United States for the permanent work of your Organization in this country. </seg>

STORE VEGETABLES FOR WINTER USE Washington, D. C. Jack Frost soon will kill most of the tender garden crops, even in the South, and home gardeners are advized not to delay in caring for vegetables now in the garden. A storage cellar or outdoor pit is, of course, the most desirable place to store vegetables, but not every home gardener has a storage cellar or pit at his disposal and some simple and inexpensive method must be provided. A very effective storage, recommended by the United States Department of Agriculture, may be made by partially burying a wooden box or a large barrel on its side in a well-drained spot in the garden. Irish potatoes, carrots, parsnips, salsify, turnips, beets, and winter radishes can be stored in this manner. Cabbage, as a rule, can be stored to best advantage by burying it in the ground, while celery can be placed in a trench and covered with boards and straw or leaves, with an outer layer of soil to keep out frost. Sweet potatoes should always be stored in a warm, dry place, such as a room over the kitchen where there will be plenty of both heat and ventilation. If no cellar or storage pit is available, a temporary storage should be provided at once, and the various vegetables that are adapted to storage should be cared for before it gets cold enough to injure them. Full information regarding the storage of garden vegetables is con - tained in the Department of Ariculture Farmers' Bulletin No. 879, "Home Storage of Vegetables," which will be sent free on application. The horticultural departments of the State agricultural colleges also have valuable bulletins and circulars on the home storage of vegetables. DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE Bureau of the Census, Washington Washington, October 11: — "That the facts and figures gathered by the enumerators, supervisors and special agents of the Fourteenth De - cennial Census will have absolutely nothing to do with valuation of </seg>
            <seg id="p202">202 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT property for taxation purposes is a point I desire to emphasize with all possible vigor," said Director of the Census Sam. L. Rogers today in speaking of the forthcoming 1920 enumeration. "Some difficulty has been experienced in the past," continued Mr. Rogers, "in getting absolutely accurate values of land and other pro - perty because of a certain amount of confusion over this point. Many people were erroneously inclined to connect the Census with taxation. We hope to avoid any such confusion this time." - The act of Congress which, under the Constitution, provides for the taking of the Fourteenth Decennial Census makes it unlawful for any enumerator, special agent, supervisor or other employee of the Census Bureau to divulge any information whatsoever concerning the census returns. A heavy fine and possible imprisonment or both, is the penalty prescribed for violation of this provision of the law. LThe proper tabulated figures of the Census are given out nowhere t here in Washington and then only upon the express authority of the Director of the Census Bureau. Actual work by the enumerators in the various census districts will begin on January 2, 1920. It is expected that the population sta - tistics of all cities and towns will be gathered in approximately two weeks. Final figures for rural districts, however, can hardly be gathered in less than a month. Washington, September 27: — Fifteen million copies of the farm schedule have been ordered printed by the Bureau of the Census for use in gathering the agricultural statistics of the Nation for the Fourteenth Decennial Census. To facilitate the work of taking the census and promote accuracy, large numbers of schedules will be distributed in advance of the enumerator's visit in order that the farmer may become familiar with the questions and be prepared to furnish promptly the required data regarding acreage tenure, values, live stock, and crops. tThe Bureau anticipates that the coming census will show an increase approximately one million farms since 1910 when the number of farms unerated was 6,361,502, valued at more than 40 billions of dollars. The enumeration will begin January 2, 1920, and it is planned to com - plete the gathering of both population and agricultural figures by Feb - ruary 1. FARMER AND MANUFACTURERS CONFER TO COMBAT BOLSHEVISM Ways and means of defeating Bolshevism constituted the prin - cipal theme of the second meeting of the American Cooperative Institute.

One farmer delegate reported that in five years his local company had increased its sideline business from $9,000 to over $165,000. He then spoke of 2,000 other companies in his national federation that were making similar progress. The meeting selected Milo D. Campbell of Coldwater, Mich., chair - man of the National Board of Farm Organizations, for its chairman and instructed him to form a fighting committee of farm leaders and manufacturers to take active steps toward educating the people to the idea of "America First," and to bring them back to the common sense idea of things. The following working principles were unanimously adopted: 1. That the people of the United States should forthwith return to the letter and spirit of the Constitution. 2. That the right to acquire, own and enjoy private property should be zealously guarded and that adequate governmental protection should be afforded to both person and property. 3. That there should be strict enforcement of law against violence. 4. That there should be waiver of the right to strike by employee of federal, state and municipal government. 5. That there should be public and private encouragement of in - creased production, broader and better markets and improved distribu - tion. 6. That workers in every field should be paid in proportion to the amount and value of work performed. Those in attendance were: Fred L.

The exhibits represented the amateur florists of the city, with one or two extensive exhibits by professional florists and amateur grow - ers had dahlias on exhibit. </seg>
            <seg id="p205">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 205 Among the amateur growers H. G. Ney, E. 614 First avenue, pre - sented probably the best dahlias and the largest assortment that has ever been presented in the city, exhibiting 76 different varieties. The city parks presented a very beautiful exhibit, the flowers being laid in an oval bed with a fountain in the center. Among the chief varieties shown by the city parks are the "City of Portland," "George Walters," and the "Hortulanus Witte," the flowers being in shades of yellow, bronze, pink and red. Two out-of-town growers, Mrs. C. E. Bartholomew, of Springdale, and Mrs. J. N. Nankernis of Moscow, showed a large assortment, while the J. P. Graves, exhibit contained a number of well grown specimens. Mrs. J. N. Othmer, W. 1906 Shannon avenue, presented a new seed - ing variety which she called "North Central", the flower being of a mul - berry red color. Charles Wurrs, W. 2316 Sinto, featured "Jean Sharmat" dahlias of yellow and orchid lavender colors. Others who had flowers on exhibit were: Mrs. L. B. Ruth, E. 2927 Fairmount avenue; Mrs. T. J.

The entire first floor of the store was taken over by the amateur growers while the professional growers displayed their dahlias on the balcony. Prizes were awarded for amateur exhibitors. Spokane, Wash. — The Washington State Horticulturists' Associa - tion will hold its annual convention in Spokane December 2 and 3. At the same time the Inland Fruit Growers' Association will hold a con - ference here. During the horticultural conference a number of noted men in this line will speak, and G. Harold Powell, general manager of the California Fruit Growers' Exchange has been definitely secured. He will give paper on "Standardization." REPORT OF JANE ADDAMS AND DR. HAMILTON TO THE AMERI- CAN SOCIETY OF FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE PHILA - DELPHIA, ON THE SITUATION IN GERMANY In explanation of our journey into Germany it may be well to quote from a 'minute" passed at a meeting held in Devonshire House, London, the central office of the Society of Friends, July Fourth, 1919. "We are thankful to learn that the following members of the Religious Society of Friends are now proceeding to Germany under a deep sense of the need which exists for mutual friendly intercourse and fellowship between those </seg>
            <seg id="p206">206 who all belong to the same great human family and who have been sep - arated during these sad years of war, namely: "Marion C. Fox, Joan M. Fry, J. Thompson Elliott and Max Bellows from England, together with Carolena M. Wood from America, who is accompanied by Jane Addams and Dr. Alice Hamilton. "Our friends are traveling on behalf of the Committee which has under its care the arrangements for sending 'Gifts of Love' to Germany in the form of food, clothes and other necessities — a work that is shared in, not only by 'the Emergency Committee for the Assistance of Germany, Aus - trians and Hungarians in Distress' and 'the Friends' War Victims Relief Committee,' but by many other persons not associated with Friends in membership." The four English members of the Committee who traveled through the occupied region and entered Germany via Cologne reached Berlin July 6th, the three American members who traveled through Holland and crossed the border on the first civilian passports issued there since the signing of peace, arrived in Berlin July 7th. Dr. Aletta Jacobs, a Dutch physician, who had been asked as a neutral to make observations on health conditions in Germany, was the fourth member of the second party. Dr. Elizabeth Rotten of Berlin, who has been acting as the representative in Germany of the work of the English Friends and is also head of the Educational Committee of the German Association for the Promotion of the League of Nations, was naturally our guide and advisor in making arrangements for the distribution of such assistance as we might be able to send from America. Both the English and the American members of the Committee at - tended the Conference arranged by Dr. Rotten in the office of Dr Albert Levy, head of the Centrale fur Privatfursorge, an organization similar to our Associated Charities, in which various organizations responsible for the care and protection of children were represented. The decision was made to appoint a central committee of which Dr. Levy, Dr. Rotten, Sigmund-Schultze — the head of the Municipal Jugendfursorge Amt, and Dr. Alice Salomon, head of the Berlin School of Philanthropy, were to be members. Provision was made that in each place in which we should find unusual need, someone was to be selected who would serve as a mem - ber of the Committee and aid in the distirbution of supplies. Credits had already been established by the Society of Friends in America for $30,000, for which sum we were to secure through the office of the Ameri - can Food Administration in Hamburg: 10 tons of cocoa. 17 tons of sugar. 35 tons of condensed milk, 40 tons of white flour. In addition to this, 25 tons of new clothing made by Friends in America was also to be disposed of. We realized that this was only an infinitestimal amount in the face of a great need and very little compared to what the English Friends had been sending to Germany ever since the </seg>

            <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 209 signing of the armistice, but we hoped it was only an earnest uf what America would send later! From the very first we made every effort to see as many children as possible that we might know the effect of long-continued underfeeding as registered in their growing bodies. In each city, therefore, sometimes under the guidance of the workers or patrons of private charities, some - times under city physicians and other medical officials, and sometimes with well known professors or child specialists, we visited the churches, the child welfare clinics, the playgrounds and outdoor sanitaria, the homes for convalescent children, the hospital orphanages, and always several public kitchens and the working people in their own homes. After Berlin the Committee of eight divided into separate groups. The English Friends remained in Berlin and we went to the industrial regions of the Ruhr valley, to he Erzgebirge; Dr. Jacobs, Dr. Hamilton and Jane Addams went into the industrial cities of Saxony, Leipzig, Halle and Chemnitz, where Mr. Hoover had told them that the need was un - usually great. Later Dr. Jacobs and Carolena Wood went to Breslau and the Silesian villages in the neighborhood, Dr. Hamilton and Jane Addams, after seeing something of the villages in South Saxony, went to Frankfurt am Main. We received help and every possible courtesy in the carrying out of our plans. One Sunday morning in Leipzig three of us were accompanied by the Oberburgermeister, the City Physician, and by the head of the Jugendfiirsorgeamt, a woman. We visited with them the city orphanage and a detention home for dependent children and a city home for delicate children, where a distinguished orthopedist, Professor Kolliker, met us and demonstrated to us by means of his little patients the effects of pro - longed hunger on rickets and tuberculosis. Of course, at other times we made our own connections quite informally through old acquaintances in the philanthropic or medical field who showed us every hospitality and kindness. An unusual opportunity was occasionally given us to see a large number of children together, in connection with the sending of groups of children to Switzerland and to Holland, where they were to be the guests of kindly people who took them into their homes. The children selected were not always tuberculous, but chosen because they were plainly suffering for lack of proper food, which cannot be procured at present in Germany. It seemed apparently quite natural to our guides that we should be interested in the privations of these children irrespective of their national - ity, as indeed the Germans were themselves. We entered Germany just one week after peace had been signed at Weimar and food conditions were already changing for the better, altho most of the food shops and bakeries still had windows containing noth - ing but empty cans of biscuit boxes. An occasional display of American bacon would at once attract a crowd of adults as well as children, feasting their eyes on the unaccustomed sight of fats. The pale people we saw on the streets, especially in the industrial quarters, were very serious and </seg>
            <seg id="p210">210 quiet, and in the railroad stations there was a conspicuous lack of all that talk and family bustle which one associates with German travel Even the children were quieter. For them the war had evidently been translated into lack of milk and butter and chocolate. The editor of a large city newspaper told us that he had been able the night before to take home a bottle of milk and that his little girl, who met him at the door, had shouted joyously to her mother that peace had come. He went on to say that the child could only feast her eyes, as the milk was intended for the little baby. We were told by a mother that her little girl had asked her if it was true that there were countries in the world where there was no war and where people could eat all they wanted to. Per - haps it was these mothers who suffered most, these intelligent women who knew perfectly well how important proper feeding was and who yet were unable to obtain the barest necessities for their children. One such mother said it was hardest at night after the children were in bed and one heard them crying and whimpering from hunger until they fell asleep and even after. She added, "I do not see how the women endured it who were obliged to be always in the same room with their children and could offer them no diversions." We found conscientious people everywhere who had scrupulously lived only upon the rationed food, although it must be remembered that the ration represented only about one-third of the caloric value con - sidered normal. This restraint was especially observed by those whose work brought them continually in contact with the life of the poor, though it was not by any means confined to them. We were entertained in a beautiful country house where the supper served upon old silver by a butler consisted of fresh vegetables and fruits from the garden and after dinner tea had been made by our host from dried strawberry and raspberry leaves and linden blossoms. On the other hand, we were told that there had been a very general evasion of the food regulations and many people we met ruefully confessed that they han compounded with their consciences in the second year of the strict blockade. It is obvious that a mother who anxiously wonders whether she could really set higher value upon impartial obedience to the ration - ing regulations than upon her elementary duty to preserve the health of her children has taken the first step toward making illicit purchases. "My husband knew that I bought smuggled food for the children, but he would touch none of it himself." He died after a slight operation and I torment myself thinking that it was because he had no resistance left. I bought what I could for my old father after he had lost forty pounds and looked so wretchedly that all my friends accused me of ne - glecting him. At first he would not take any of the illicit food, but at last he was driven to it and he always refers to it as the time my con - science died." Everyone we saw — men, women and children — had lost weight many of them to the point of emaciation. This loss of weight is very serious because it is a sign of lowered nutrition and consequently diminished resistance to infectious diseases, especially in the young. Wherever we </seg>

Christy, Nemaha County "Our cherries will be ripe and ready to pick Monday, June 19. Will be sold on the trees at ?2 per bushel. — G. S. Christy, Johnson, Neb." I inserted this advertisement, with variations, in three small-town papers, in Tecumseh, Brock and Talmage. The total cost of the advertising was $1.35. On the day of the sale there were over seventy-five automobiles standing near my orchard, coming from as far as thirty miles away. I had about thirty ladders myself and many of the auto - mobile parties brought ladders themselves. That day the people cleaned up 175 bushels and handed me $350 in cash, all from $1.35 worth of advertising. The farmer that sees cherries selling for $4 a bushel at retail in the cities might think he was selling too cheap at $2 a bushel. But I know that I made more money by my plan than I could have possibly made any other way. By the time I had paid the pickers, bought the crates, paid the freight, a MR. CHRISTY | and permitted the commsision men and retailers each to make some - | thing, I know very well that I could not have made as much as I did my 1 way. Another difficulty I have always found is getting enough pickers, | and part of the crop often spoils awaiting picking. This way I am S making hundreds of friends among consumers who will be willing to 1 come back again. Only two limbs in the orchard were broken that day. My cherry orchard is twenty-seven years old. I also have 300 pear | | trees and a good-sized apple orchard. I expect a yield of about 300 | 1 bushels of pears and about 3,000 bushels of apples. I shall follow the j | same plan of selling them. Of course I hardly expect to be able to dis- i I pose of my entire apple crop direct to the consumer, but I shall sell a I | good part of it. I might say that I am also a general farmer, handling | a 160 acres of land. I have visited the fruit country of the northwest and I can say that I there is no section better fitted for fruit raising than southeastern Ne - | braska. The land men tell you only of the successes in raising fruit in 1 other parts of the country and one never hears of the failures.

            <seg id="p213">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 213 saw children gathered together we were struck by the greyish pallor which has taken the place of the ruddy color formerly so characteristic of these blonde German children, and also by the thin necks and wrists and legs, even when the face itself was fairly round in its outlines. It is of course impossible to judge of emanciation in a child, unless very extreme, without stripping it, but in several places we were shown the children with their clothes off. The "Luftbad" in Frankort does not take children who are really ill, but many of the naked boys we saw there were quite shockingly wasted. We tried always to bear in mind the norm for German children, which is high, and to judge of the actual conditions we saw according to this standard. Recently the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company made a study of the weight and height of New York public school children and found that the children of German parentage stood at the top, outstripping those of English, Scotch and Scandinavian parentage, their nearest rivals. In normal times the German children are probably even taller and sturdier than those of German parentage born in a new country. The coutrast between the children as one sees them in Germany today and the children we were accustomed to see before the war is very striking and when one can see them stripped there is no mistaking the effects of the long starva - tion. The shoulderblades of the boys stand out like wings, it is really almost a deformity, their ribs and their vertebrae can be counted, and their bony little arms and legs look still thinner because of the swollen joints which rachitis causes so commonly. The narrow, sunken chests bode ill for the future in a society where tuberculosis infection will cer - tainly be widespread. It is after the sixth year of life that the effects of underfeeding be - comes increasingly evident, for there is not enough food to supply the needs of a growing child unless a good deal can be added by the purchase of smuggled goods. Already the school children of Leipzig average 2 to 4 cm. shorter than the pre-war average. In Frankfurt we were told that the average loss of weight for the younger children is 9 to 10 per cent, for the older, 10 to 15 per cent, and in this last year a loss in average height is becoming evident. In general, the results of the block - ade began to appear in 1917, but people familiar with conditions among the poor saw as early as 1916 a change in the little children and in the mothers, which however became much more striking the following year. It is certainly fair to conclude that the shortage of food has been regis - tered on the bodies of German women and children for a period of nearly three years, and of course it continues to register still. From notes selected at random we find descriptions such as the following: "A girl 8 years, weighing 30 pounds, one of the age weighing 28 pounds, a third of 12 years weighing 46 pounds." These are not supposed to be ill, only in need of food and fresh air. That was in Frankfurt. In the notes taken in Halle we find mention of a child of 3%, weighing 14 pounds, a 12-year-old boy weighing 64 pounds, a girl of 11 weighing 60 pounds, and the following record of a 4-year-old who had </seg>
            <seg id="p214">214 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT been under hospital care for malnutrition since February last. The miserably inadequate food is revealing in this child story: Weight in February, 27 pounds; in March, 25 pounds 8 ounces; in April, 26 pounds 7 ounces; in May, 25 pounds, and in June 26 pounds 4 ounces.. In Leipzig, in Frankfurt and in the little hill town of Barenstein in the Erzgebirge (on the Saxon side) we saw large crowds of children at school or in playgrounds, and always it was the rosy-cheeked, sturdy child who stood out in sharp contrast to the crowd. In the village schools in Barenstein, the teachers had the different classes pass slowly before us, so that we could look closely at the children. They did not show the effects of the underfeeding as strikingly as did the children of the cities, especially the Saxon cities, for in the country it is easier to eke out the rationed food with extra vegetables or even a little milk than it is in the city, though the villages in the Erzgebirge are bleak and the soil is poor. Judging only from the looks of these school children as they filed past us, we estimated that about 85 were in fairly normal condition and 126 were decidedly thinner and paler than normal. Of course, this is a very superficial judgment, but it has some significance. As a preliminary to understanding the food conditions of the chil - dren early in our stay of five days in Berlin, we went to the office of the central food control, where we were met by Professor Schelsinger and Dr. Pfeiffer, who gave us every facility for studying their methods of food allotment and especially the distribution of milk to children. The supply of milk for Berlin in 1914 was 1,000,000 litres. There was a quick falling off in quantity in 1915, which continued till in the winter of 1918-19 it reached 150,000. Milk is given to children up to the age of four years, at the rate of a pint a day, and in exceptional cases to delicate children up to the age of six, but at times there has been no milk even for the four - year-olds. Among adults only the cases of open tuberculosis may have as much as a pint of milk and acute nephritis entitles the patient to half a pint, chronic nephritis to none. This latter is especially hard, as patients with nephritis on a milk diet may recover. We met one well-to do women who spoke with greatest bitterness of the death from nephritis of her brother, for whom she had been unable to get milk. This fall in the milk supply is due chiefly to lack of rich fodder, which Germany has always been obliged to import, and without which her cows yield less than one-third of the usual amount. The city of Berlin has a herd of 7,000 cows which are fed upon potato parings and vege - table trimmings carefully collected from householders every morning. If they could import oil cake for fodder they could ration it to the peasants and thus control the milk for the peasants, which now passes in part at least into the smuggling trade, what the Germans call the "Schleichhandel." We found later in Chemnitz that the milk supply had fallen from 60,000 litres daily to 7,000. This milk goes to infants and nursing moth - ers, and, according to the supply, to children up to the age of four. This is distributed by colored cards, one color for infants, another for little </seg>
            <seg id="p215">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 215 children, etc. When the supply is low, one color is withdrawn, beginning with the older children, those over the advanced age of four years. Frankfurt's former supply of milk was 220,000 litres of milk daily, which has now fallen to 15,000. This does not promise to improve, since the hinterland from which Frankfurt has always drawn her supply of milk is now in the occupied territory and its produce used by the French army. The same office also rations the fat. The population in general is allowed to buy weekly 30 grammes (1 ounce) of butter, 60 g. (2 ounces) of vegetable magarine, 12 5g. (4.2 ounces) of animal fats. This of course is only permission to buy and many people cannot afford butter at 23 to 36 marks a pound, or American bacon at 12 to 16 marks a pound. We urge told that probably as much as 60 per cent of the food in Germany passes into the Schleichhandel to well-to-do people at enormous prices, and that there is constant speculation in food cards. (There is very little fat in the meat that reaches the market from German sources, for the lack of fodder has greatly reduced all cattle.) Berlin has a separate public office for providing food for the sick, where we saw many sick people waiting to be given cards entitling them to buy milk and white flour. This office is now caring for 210,000 people, although the permits are confined almost entirely for those suffering from tuberculosis, rachitis or acute nephritis. Before the war it was estimated that about 2 per cent of the population of Berlin would be sick at any one moment, now it is at least 10 per cent. The records in one room were especially pathetic. It contained the cards of those whose allowance had been revoked not because the given case no longer required special food, but because so many new cases had come in that the list had to be revised in the interest of the most pressing need. Old people had to be sacrificed to the young, the incurable to the more hopeful. We were permitted to examine any cards which we chose to pull out of their cases. We saw with our own eyes a striking demonstration of the insuffi - ciency of food for the sick when we visited the kitchen of the great Uni - versity hospital in Berlin, the Charite. There are 2,200 people in the insti - tution to be fed and since the Revolution the "Einheitessen" rule has been in force, that is, exactly the same food in kind and quantity is served to everyone connected with the hospital, from t"he scrub women to the head professor. We were shown the supply of meat for one day. It consisted of lumps of very lean beef with much bone, already thoroughly boiled in order to make soup. It filled a tray about two and a half feet long by one and a half feet wide and about five inches deep. This was the meat allowance for 2,200 people, but they do not get it every day. The weekly per capita allowance for the sick is 250 g., but after the bone has been re - moved it is only 150 g., which we were told would make a daily allowance tit the legal weight of a letter. The bread allowance for the hospital 335 g. daily, but many of the sick cannot eat this bread, for it is made of war meal containing all but 5 per cent bran with the addition of ground dried vegetables, which render it damp and liable to mould or fer - ment in a few days. There is only one loaf of white bread for ten patients weekly. They were using ten times as much green vegetables as formerly </seg>
            <seg id="p216">FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT 216 because they had dried beans, peas or rice. For that week the supply of potatoes was only one pound per capita. There has been no fish since the armistice, when the blockade provisions prohibited fishing in the North Sea. With this diet of unsatisfactory bread was served thein - evitable marmalade made of vegetable fibre, a minimum of fruit, the whole colored with aniline and sweetened with saccharine. It is obvious that such a diet is insufficient and that under it there is little chance of real recovery from sickness. The Director of the hospital was suffering from a fracture of the hip, which would not heal because his powers of re - cuperation were at so low an ebb from underfeeding. As we went through other institutions we often had an opportunity to see the food served to inmates. In the City Orphanage in Berlin chil - dren with rickets received for their noon day dinner a soup of war meal and dried vegetables, with a few drops of vegetable margarine floating on the top. In a creche in Frankfurt for well children they were serving at noon a meal soup made with one pound of margarine for 100 children. In the afternoon they were given a mug of German tea, made from dried leaves of strawberry and other plants, without milk and with only three - quarters of a pound of sugar to 40 quarts of tea. Many of the children in the creche showed signs of rickets and almost all of the malnutrition save one small boy, conspicuous for his rosy cheeks, who had just returned from a visit in the country to his grandmother. In Leipzig we visited a "Landkolonie," a large playground in which 625 children from 1 to 12 years of age spend the day and are given a mid - day dinner. It consisted of one pint of meal soup, to which had been added a little dried vegetable. Out of 190 children seated at one time in the dining room all save one were pale and anaemic. The director made several announcements to the children — a hike for the following day, which he carefully explained was not compulsory — the time when the prize would be awarded for the best garden, and so forth. All of these were received with a curious sort of apathy by the listless children, but when he said that he hoped they would have milk 'in their soup tomorrow or the next day, the announcement was greeted by a shrill and spontan - eous cheer. Here as everywhere the effect of food privation was more striking on the boys than on the girls. This was usually explained by the greater activity of the boys, although one professor regarded it as another evidence of the greater resistance of the female sx which has always been shown in the lower death rate of girl babies. The "Luftbad" in Frankfurt is a very original mode of treatment for delicate children. The children in bathing suits — on the boys' side they wear a very abridged form — are kept in the sun and the open air for three hours a day, some of them playing, but others lying down according to the doctor's orders. The children were used to be given a large glass of milk and all the bread and butter they wanted. Now the city allowance for them is half a pound of soup meal a month per capita, to which the patrons add some fresh vegetables, but they have no fat. Many of the boys exhibited such extreme emaciation as to remind us of pictures of </seg>

            <seg id="p219">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 219 Indian famines, yet we were told that these children had greatly improved during their month of treatment in the Luftbad. Of course many of them brought bread carefully measured out by their mothers from the home allowance, for it would be illegal for the management of the Luftbad to secure an extra supply of bread. At another charming outdoor charity for little children, who are taken to spend each day in the woods, we again encountered the afternoon tea without milk and so little sweetened that fe were surprised the children were drinking it. In each city except in Halle we visited public kitchens, to which men and women of the working class and middle class come to buy cooked food either taking it home or eating it on the premises. We visited six of these in Berlin, two in Leipzig, one in Chemnitz and one in Frankfurt. In Berlin a meal could be bought for a mark and a quarter or a mark and a half. For this they received a soup of meal and dried vegetables, then a dish of boiled greens, part fresh and part dried, and another dish of dried cabbage or potatoes, and for desert — to quote from notes taken on the spot — "dreadful pasty, slimy town cake or loathesome slabs of aniline red jelly-like stuff." In Leipzig the kitchen we visited was serving 10,000 boiled dumplings made of war meal and eaten with dried pears that had been stewed with sugar; for two dumplings they paid forty-five pfennigs. In Chemnitz forty pfennigs bought a pint and a half of soup made of sauer kraut and potatoes with a fairly generous allowance of margarine. This last is a municipal enterprise as is a kitchen we visited in Frankfurt, where school children are served their midday meal, the most nearly adequate one we saw they were given one or two quarts as they chose of a thick soup of potatoes, carrots and noodles; this was made in a central kitchen and distributed through many centers. The food in these Beriln kitchens seemed sufficient in quantity, but poor in nutrition, and very tasteless,, and while in Chemnitz and Leipzig the qualtiy was better and more attractive, the quantity was very insufficient. The children in Frankfurt had to eat a harmfully large quantity of soup in order to satisfy their hunger. Of course no-one knows better than the Germans themselves the harmfulness of this bulky diet, so poor in nutritive qual - ities. German scientists have made every possible effort to get at new sources of fat, every bone is saved that it may be crushed and the fat extracted from the marrow; they have taken the germs from the rye kernel for the sake of fat; they even collect the fats from the dish-water of the great hotels. We were constantly reminded that the paucity of foods does not affect only the poorer people. We were told that many working people with relatives in the country, from whom they might obtain food, fared better than professional people and others, who had no such connections. Often when asked a direct question, the professors in clinics revealed the difficulty they had had in providing for their own families. One famous physician said that he had never daring the blockade and up to the pre - sent had meat more than once a week. The wife of a great biologist said that many a morning when she had faced an empty larder she would </seg>
            <seg id="p220">220 go out in one direction, her husband in another and the nurse in a third, in order to find food for her three little children. Another professor who was taking us through a children's ward admitted rather reluctantly that his breakfast consists of black war coffee with bread and marmalade, that he eats no midday meal and his supper is only soup and bread. He had come from the front to find that his wife had made a poor re - covery from a serious operation and that his two children were very much reduced, all for lack of proper food. He sent them to a seaside place on the Baltic, but there proved to be so little food there that he is obliged to save all he can to send them food from Berlin. Another of our guides, who kindly invited us to his house, showed us two blooming children of seven and eleven, but the little war baby of two years had stopped growing when she was weaned and developed rickets. With the utmost care she is now able to walk, but is still tiny, white and thin, a great contrast to the other two children. II was in Saxony especially that they spoke with horror of the "time turnips," when for three or four months the entire population had almost nothing to eat except white turnips. Many grown people have ac - quired a permanent dyspepsia from that experience and it was of course impossible for many of the children to digest such food. The village schoolmaster in "Barenstein" told us that in the course of each morning nine or ten children would leave the room, vomit their breakfast and stagger back, too miserable and sick to hold up their heads, and much less to study their lessons. We were constantly told that the amount of school work required of the children had to be lessened in order to meet their lowered vitality and that owing to their absolute inability to do the school work many children of the poor in Germany have practically lost four years of school out of their possible eight. The numbers of school children was greatly reduced also by actual illness. We were told in Halle by one of the school doctors that the school population had actually fallen off one-half since the war began. Ruth von der Leyden and other probation officers of the Juvenile Court of Berlin told us much of the increased criminality among the former pupils of the higher grade schools. These growing boys and girls, who owing to the shortage of labor during the long course of the war, undertook hard factory work and were simply unable to get enough to eat from the rationed supplies. From this root cause sprang many thefts of food, falsification of bread cards, housebreaking into bakeries and mills, stealing potatoes and turnips in the fields, taking part in the fraudulent handling of food in the hopes that some would be given to them, and so forth. In addition to hunger, many of these children, unable to bear any longer the anxiety of their mothers, stole food to take, reckless of the consequences to themselves. Of course they often stole money from their parents, sold the clothing of their brothers and sisters or such household articles as they could pilfer. To quote Miss von der Leydon, "Children and youths from the most respectable famil - ies come before the court through their sheer inability to withstand the </seg>

            <seg id="p223">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 223 temptations to which the blockade so cruelly subjects them." It has been said of these half-starved children that they illustrate a saying of Rousseau's, "The body must have strength to obey the soul, the weaker the body the more it commands." It has seemed best to treat the specific results of the food blockade, the loss of weight, increase of tuberculosis and other diseases, under sep - arate heads, as follows: Tuberculosis — On our first evening in Berlin,Professor Kayserling, one of the foremost German authorities on tuberculosis, came to our hotel and gave us a brief outline of the terrible results of the prolonged food blockade as shown in the increase of tuberculosis in German cities. Country districts have apparently suffered less. He began by saying that the increased rate is due to lack of food and not to the other in - cidents of war as shown by the slight rise before the tightened blockade and the rapid rise after it. In 1914 the death from tuberculosis in German cities of over 15,000 inhabitants was 40,374. By 1916 it had risen only to 48,778, but by 1917 it was 67,860, and for the first half of 1918 it was 67,860. Since tuberculosis is not a disease that kills quickly, Professor Kayserling expects that the rate for the first half of 1918 and that for 1919 will prove to be still higher. It must also be remembered that the number of people in the susceptible ages was decidely diminished by the loss of young men who had fallen in the war. The almost complete lack of fats, including cod-liver oil, the first installment of which reached Germany through Dr. Rotten in May of this year, make it impossible to strengthen the body against infection or help it to combat infection after it has taken place. Matters were still worse after the armistice when the demobolized soldiers suddenly returned to the cities to share in the scanty food supply at the same time transportation became more demoralized than ever because of the surrender of rolling stock. So striking has been the effect of partial starvation on tuberculosis among al classes that Kayserling says German physicians are beginning to say that tuberculosis should be regarded primarily not as an infectious disease, but as a disease of nutrition to be controlled much more by feed - ing than by preventing infection. A few days later we had the opportunity to visit Kayserling's dis - pensary (Poliklinik) for tuberculosis children of the middle class. He allowed us to interview the mothers who brought their children for exam - ination and to find out what the little things had to eat. The answer was almost always the same. For breakfast ersatz coffee without milk or sugar, bread, and usually but not always, marmalade made with saccha - rine for sugar. One lucky child had had a bit of lard on his bread that morning. For dinner at noon, soup made of war meal and dried vege - tables, sometimes potatoes and rarely beans. Supper was a repetition of breakfast. If the child was under four years he was receiving a pint of milk a day and this was true for part of the time of the six-year-olds, but above six years the allowance stopped. One girl of eleven, who looked about eight, was discovered to be tuberculous. She was getting </seg>
            <seg id="p224">FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT 224 a little meat once a week, no butter, no eggs or milk. Kayserling gave the mother an order for a pint of milk daily, but it will cost her a mark and a half each time, and will constitute the only possible change in the child's diet, which, even with this addition will be too meager for a healthy child, to say nothing of one whose hope of life lies in a generous allowance of animal fats. Many of the mothers of this clinic looked so emaciated that one could not help believing that, scanty as their rations were, they took only part for themselves and gave the rest to the children. One specially wretched - looking woman said she was the mother of six children, one of whom had recently died of tuberculosis and she had brought a little daughter to be examined for the same disease. As all the children were over six years they had no milk except the half pint which was allotted to her because she is suffering from a serious form of nephritis. "And how much of that goes into your stomach," Professor Kayserling asked. The woman only shrugged her shoulders. At the end we asked him what he could do for these cases, and he answered: "Almost nothing. I see the conditions and I know how they should be dealt with, but I cannot put my knowledge to use, I cannot work without the tools of my trade." While in former years Kayserling used to see about 50 cases of bone tuberculosis in children in the course of a year, now he sees as many in a month. We heard still more about tuberculosis in the great hospital of the /harite, connected with the University, when we visited Professor Jzerny's wards there. Fully half of all the children here are tuberculous, condition which they attribute first to increased infection bocause so many mothers have contracted tuberculosis through overwork and under - feeding and so many fathers have come back from the front tubercular, nd second, to the loss of resistance in the children's bodies because of tarvation for fats. The men in charge in this hospital and in the Kaiser and Kaiserin Friedrich Spital for children's bodies told us that they feel ure the effects of the hunger blockade will be apparent throughout the ifetime of this generation and perhaps longer. These effects cannot be rightly estimated by simply looking at death records. Most children infected with tuberculosis will not die now, the majority do not as yet even show signs of the disease. But each coming year for twenty years will show a far higher rate of sickness and death from tuberculosis than Germany has known for decades, because the seeds of the disease which have fastened themselves on these weakened children will do their work rer on, perhaps in puberty, when resistance is always lowered, perhaps the twenties under the strain of child-bearing or of industrial life. Nor it only tuberculosis which will have increased, all infectious diseases will meet with a lessened resistance, all overstrain and hard work will do a greater injury and even the children of these war children may be below the normal stand. In the wards for tuberculosis children we saw varieties of the disease which used to be regarded as medical curiosities, so extreme as to be seen onlv in primitive DeoDle with no racial immunity to the disease Germanv's </seg>
            <seg id="p225">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 225 racial immunity, if there really be such a thing, was destroyed by the blockade and now in her hospitals one can expect to see the most terrible forms of this infection and not as exceptional cases, but fairly commonly. Not only in the Charite, where one expects to see picked cases, but in the hospitals of Halle, Leipzig and Frankfurt, we saw children with en - ormously developed tuberculosis of the glands, with tuberculosis of several bones at once with involvement of both lungs and cavity formations, such as ordinarily occurs only in grown people. There were tiny children with tubercolosis of the breast bone, for the bones of the skull, even of the bones of the upper jaw with involvement of the eye socket, and many cases of the formerly rare tuberculosis of the skin, lupus. There was added tragedy in the importance of the physicians, who while equipped with all that science has discovered in this field and so entirely capable of dealing with each case in the best possible way, could only struggle with makeshifts and look on at their own failures because without nour - ishing food the fight against this disease must be a losing one. Yet if only food could be procured these child cases of bone and gland tuberculosis could be made to improve amazingly. While at the Charite we went to Kraus' wards for tuberculosis adults and were received by his assistant, Professor Leschke, who showed us cases of the new form of this disease in adults. Before the war the so - called galloping consumption was a great rarity in Germany, now they are having an enormous mortality in young adults after an illness of only one to four months. It appears in those who have lost many pounds in weight. As it is impossible to give them the abundant fats they need, they go rapidly down, hill, having apparently lost all resistance to the disease. This rapid consumption is greatly on the increase and probably will continue at a high figure for several years. Nor is it confined to hospital patients; it is common among the well-to-do. Dr. Leschke had at that time no less than thirty cases hi his own private practice. The city orphanage in Berlin, which is really a home for dependent children, whether actually orphans or not, is not supposed to take any but healthy children, but it is impossible now to reject the tuberculous and rachitic, for they are too numerous. It has long been the rule here to give the Pirquet skin test to the children, to determine the presence of tuber - culous infection. Before the war this test was postive for 10 per cent of the two-year-olds, now it is positive in 30 per cent, but while infection has increased threefold, actual illness has increased fivefold, as shown by the number of cases of skin, gland, bone and pulmonary tuberculosis In Halle there is ten times as much skin tuberculosis as before the war, and in Frankfurt they showed us cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in babies, something hardly ever seen in other countries. The cure of tuberculosis, or rather of mortality from this disease, in the city of Chemnitz shows clearly the influence of the intensified blockade, for while there is little increase in the first two and a half years of war, there is a sudden rise in 1917 and a still greater rise in 1918. Increase of Other Diseases — Probably the increase of tuberculosis is </seg>
            <seg id="p226">226 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT the most serious single result of the food blockade, but there are other iseases also which have shown a stratling rise in prevalence and in everity. Among children, rickets, which was formerly almost confined o the very poor or to the inmates of private orphanages, has become idespread in every class of society. With the softening and bending of le bones goes an abnormal fragility, so that fracture occurs almost pontaneously, after the slightest violence. If a child stumbles and falls o the floor he may break a leg or a collar bone, even a hip; if the mother ifts the child by its arms, she may break one of the arm bones. We saw three-year-old boy in bed with his second broken leg. Lin the orthopedic wards of the Charite, 90 per cent of all the children rachitic and even in detention homes and creches and orphanages rickets is now common. Forty-one per cent of all the children in the Leipzig home for delicate children are rachitic. We saw innumerable instances of this disease of malnutrition coming on after the first year, in children who were fairly normal till they were weaned or till they b3gan to require more fatty and proteid food than could be given them. There were children of two, three, four and even six and seven years who had learned to walk and then gradually lost the ability to so much as stand alone. The orthopedists operate on bowed legs or knock knees and obtain their usual good results, but the food that would make the straightened bones strong is lacking and so little by little the bending returns and the surgeon's work is all undone. Infantile scurvy is frequent, from lack of milk and eggs, and we saw nstances of profound, anaemia in tiny children, a very rare thing in most ountries. These were children who had been kept on food very poor in ron — war meal, potatoes, marmalade. One child had only 30 per cent of ed coloring matter in the blood. The war dropsy of which we read so much appeared in children who had been kept on a diet cf carbohydrates nly and in Berlin it was confined to certain raligious orphanages where t was very prevalent. In one of them all the children, 150 in number, were dropsical. That state of things has been corrected. LWe saw many cases of emaciation in children and babies, so extreme t it was hard to believe the condition was caused by hunger alone and not generalized tuberculosis, yet such was the case. In a creche in the industrial town of Neu Kollon, near Berlin, there were fourteen baHes in one room. Five were normal, nine markedly undernourished, and of these five were emaciated. None of them were tuberculous. In a Leipzig creche, out of thirty-nine babies, only eleven were normal in development, the remaining twenty-eight showed in varying degree the effects of lack of food, emaciation, rachitis or both together. The food blockade was also a soap blockade and this has had very great influence over certain diseases, notably skin diseases, and the fever of childbed. The lack of soap to cleanse the person of the patient, to wash her linen and to cleanse the hands of the midwife is apparently the cause of a sudden rise in the mortality from puerperal fever which has occurred in Germany in the last two years. Children have been the greatest suf- </seg>

            <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 229 ferers from the skin diseases resulting from lack of soap, babies of course most of all. We were shown their scalded little bodies, their heads covered with scales, the bleeding surfaces in the folds of groins and arms. The treatment for such conditions is very unsatisfactory, for Germany has absolutely no medicinal oils, no vaseline or other bland ointment to soften the scales and assist in the healing process. For soap' there is still only the heavy slab of chalky material which is very irritating to delicate skin, and to wash inflamed eyes there is no absorbent cotton, only tissue paper. The result is that these forms of skin disease in children sometimes progress to a dangerous point. There was a little child in one of the wards in Halle whose body was covered so thickly with scars that it was impossible to find a square inch of skin that had escaped. This was a case of furunculosis. CENSUS INTERPRETATION OF THE WORD "FARM" Washington, November 3: — What is a farm? Seems a foolish question to ask, doesn't it? Almost anyone can tell off-hand just what a farm is and knows one when he sees it. But do you happen to know the interpretation Uncle Sam places on the word "farm" for census purposes ? No? Then read how this Bureau of the Census defines the word: "A farm for census purposes is all the land which is directly farmed by one person conducting agricultural operations, either by his own labor or with the assistance of members of his household or hired employees." In further explanation of this definition the Census Bureau points out that the term "agricultural operations" is used as a general term referring to the work of growing crops, producing other agricultural products and raising domestic animals, poultry or bees. From this definition it will be seen that a •farm may consist of a single tract of land or of a number of separate and distinct tracts. And these several tracts may be held under different tenures as, for instance, when one tract is owned by the farmer and another is rented by him. Thus if a man who owns 100 acres rents an additional ten acres from some one else and operates both the 100 acres and the ten acres, then his "farm" includes both tracts of land comprising 110 acres. By the same token from a landowner has one or more tenants, renters, croppers or managers, each different tract of land operated by any such tenant, renter, cropper or manager is considered a separate and distinct farm by the Census Bureau. Or, to give an example, if • man owning 120 acres of land rents 40 acres to a tenant and farms the remaining 80 acres himself, his farm is the 80 acres which he operates, not the 120 acres which he owns, while the 40 acre tract which he rents to a tenant comprises a separate farm to be reported in the name of the tenant. Another question to be determined is how important does an agri - cultural enterprise have to be in order to secure recognition in the census as a farm? A smal vegetable garden or a chicken yard accommodating a few busy hens will not be allowed to qualify as a farm" in the census </seg>
            <seg id="p230">230 no matter with what pardonable pride and satisfaction the proprietor may view his agricultural enterprise. But if the garden or chicken yard expands until it covers not less than three acres of ground, or until it requires for its care the continuous services of at least one person, or yields products annually to the value of $250 or more, it comes within the census definition of a farm and will be recognized as such and counted. The agriculture schedule contains many questions regarding farm values, expenses and live stock as well as the acreage and quantity of crops raised in the year 1919. Census Bureau officials are urging farmers everywhere to prepare for the census enumerator by looking rT their books and records so that accurate answers may be furnished questions. In this connection the Bureau of the Census emphasizes the fact that that information furnished to census takers is absolutely confidential, made so by Act of Congress, and that under no circumstances can any such information be used as a basis for taxation. "Co-operation between farmers and the census officials next Janu - ary is more necessary and vital than ever before," declares Director of the Census Sam. L. Rogers. "The world war and the part that the farmer played in it and will continue to play in the rehabilitation of Europe serve to make the agriculture section of the Fourteenth Decennial Census Emost important in the Nation's history. Absolute accuracy and com - ;eness in the census returns is the goal toward which every citizen uld strive.' OUR COUNTRY FIRST CONFERENCE A National Meeting to be Held Under the Auspices of the Illinois Manu - facturers' Association, Congress Hotel, Chicago, September 8-9, 1919 Are These Our Problems 1. Chief Justice Marshall, in the famous case of Marbury versus Madison, said: "The government of the United States has been em - phatically termed a government of laws and not of men." Are we drift - ing from this form of government insisted on by the farmers of the constitution and upheld by the United States Supreme Court when we pass legislation such as the Adamson Bill? 2. The constitution precisely enumerates and delegates limited powers to Federal government. It distinctly states that the power of the federal government, as far as interstate commerce is concerned, is limited to regulation. How can congress pass a law such as proposed in the so-called Plumb plan, which compels the government to purchase the railroads and lease same to a smal minority of people? To regulate transportation does not mean to engage in transportation. 3. Would not such a nationalization of railroads, industries and farms result in adding a new pork barrel? Pork barrels are political expediencies and add unnecessary taxes upon the American people. </seg>

One enforces com - petition whilst the other forbids it. 5. What economies can our federal and state administration practice so as to reduce taxes? Profligacy of administrative expenditures must be met by taxes and taxes influence the cost of production and sale price. 6. What could be done to attract the best class of experienced men to accept governmental work? 7. Can we continue to be a great commercial and agricultural nation under the present many vexations statutes and prying investigators, with their petty tyranny because they assume governmental authority? 8. Is the Jeffersonian principle stil workable that "That government is best which governs least"? (Our federal and state law-making bodies have, for the past seven years, annually added 12,500 new laws to our statutes.) 9. Our war debt is estimated at $280 per capita. Our civil war debt was about $82 per capita. Shall this indebtedness be paid at once and maintain high costs, or would it be better to amortize the indebtedness and spread it over a long period of years ? The immediate payment must influence high prices and unrest. 10. Have we too much currency? If so, what percentage could, with safety, be retired? What could our Federal Reserve Bank do to increase the purchasing power of a Dollar, bearing in mind the unchallenged state - ment of Mill: "As gold production or gold reserve increases the purchas - ing power of a Dollar decreases"? 11. What advantage are we taking of possessing 52% of the gold reserve of the world? How could this be used to the benefit of our peo - ple? Could it be used to assist foreign nations to amortize their war indebtedness? Should we, out of enlightened selfishness, guarantee with the other allied nations a certain amount of credit to some nations on condition that the guarantee shall be used for the establishment of a sound financial banking system and currency in their countries, and that this money shall not be used or pledged save with the consent of the representative of our Federal Reserve Board? Europe needs money. Money is dependent upon commerce. Com - merce is dependent upon the production of her farms and factories. They are dependent upon raw materials and machinery. Idleness of her work - ing population means unrest. What is our obligation? How shall these foreign sales be made when stability of credits or specie does not exist, and many of our producers cannot afford to carry accounts until these nations can convert the raw materials into a finished product, sell them, and be in a position to make other purchases? Shall the United States Government help to finance foreign sales ? Shall the government organize a foreign sales department insuring American sales to the extent of 75% of the sales, at a premium of 5%, </seg>
            <seg id="p232">232 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT debenture these policies as notes or bonds sell the same, exempt of all taxes, and thus increase production and at the same time stabilize foreign trade? Or should this be left to private corporations with governmental sanction? What do you think of the Edge Bill as helping in foreign commerce ? 12. Can we be relieved of the moral obligation to assist foreign nations in obtaining the necessities of life? What effect on domestic prices would the exportation of these essentials have? 13. Do you think that we should now practice those economies we willingly followed during the war? Do not the returning soldiers who helped save us at $33.00 per month resent the display of wealth on the part of those who were benefitted by war earnings and wages? Shall he be considered? 14. Are you in favor of the suggestion that some industries be limited in the return on their investment and prohibited from capitalizing their surplus and profits whilst others are permitted to do so? 15. Are you in favor of the nationalizing of the railroads? If so, do you favor the nationalizing of banking and insurance? Shall we extend governmental regulation, now under the food and drug act, to include the licensing as proposed by the Kenyon and Kellogg Bills? If so, are you willing to have your industry or your farm or organization nation - alized? 16. Is American Industry a financial privilege or a technical achievement? Did not all of the American industries begin with little capital but with technical brains and resolute characters? Did not the present so-called captains of industries graduate from the ranks of labor because they were willing to work, to sacrifice and to face the chances of failure in order that they might give labor more work and serve labor more efficiently than under the German nationalized industrial system? Did we not defeat that arrogant and despotic system? This American system made this country the economical as well as the political hope of the world. Would the nationalization of the railroads, the basic in - dustries such as coal, iron, lumber and agriculture, and the licensing sug - gested by the pending Kenyon and Kellogg bills result in a levelling process? How would it affect our commercial future? 17. What suggestions have you to offer for reducing present prices? 18. What is a profiteer? It is sometimes well to agree on a defin - ition. Who is accountable for profiteering? Is it the merchant, the manu - facturer, the farmer, the laborer, or all combined? What is the remedy? Is it possible for the American people to solve these problems without an appeal to congress? Have we, as a people, lost our initiative, creat - iveness and spirit of co-operation? 19. Is the present system of distribution economical? Have you any suggestion to offer to simplify distribution, minimize losses, obviate unnecessary deliveries and establish a closer point of contact between buyer and seller? Are any of the practices to simplify production and distribution willinsrlv practiced during the war now beintr used ? It </seg>

In the great war only one General is conspicuous; the liberty loans massed and aroused the people; we put men into uni - forms; massed industries to assist the government to produce the essen - tials; farms were brought to the highest point of production; new governmental bureaus were created — unity of action for mass play so that we would win the war. Some would continue these conditions as the permanent social order of the United States. Are the problems of peace the same as the problems of war? What should be done to help change the mental attitude of our people? Is the mass precedent, established by the war, a contributing factor to the present unrest? 27. Our Country First.

MEDICAL AND SURGICAL RELIEF FOR WAR HEROES How the Bureau of War Risk Insurance is meeting the herculean problem of examining, rating and returning to physical usefulness minds and bodies wrecked in the Great War. The war has brought the Government face to face with a brand new series of problems. Long before the armistice was signed, Congress foresaw some of the necessities of the situation and, starting from the broad-angled viewpoint that a man who has been injured in the service of his country is not an object of charity but a person who is entitled to compensation and medical relief exactly as is the man who suffers a hurt at the hands of industry, a wise legislative program was inaugurated. This contemplates that the Director of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance shall take all the necessary measures to insure that every person who contracted a disease or suffered an injury in military service in the line of duty during the war with Germany shall be recompensed therefor, and that he shall receive such medical and surgical attention •which will return him to health, or at least shall bring to him the maximum relief possible in his particular case. Furthermore, should this ex-soldier, sailor or marine have lost a limb or eye, or suffered any hurt for which a mechanical device may be necessary, that such apparatus shall be furnished him without cost. In furtherance of this plan Congress has enacted enabling legislation and at present is considering a bill which will further elucidate its purposes in this regard. There is a man in Washington who sits all day long facing a gigantic map of the United States. On it is shown every railroad, town and hamlet in the nation. Colored pins locate the hospitals, dispensaries, medical and surgical consultants and examiners, all of this being the vast field machinery which the Government has put in motion to relieve </seg>
            <seg id="p259">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 259 suffering, prolong life, and return to efficiency the men and women whose minds or bodies may have been broken in humanity's war. Some one asked this officer why he always sat facing this gigantic map, why he lifted his eyes to it so many times during the day? The answer was, "So that I may always keep before me the fact that the problem is national in its scope and can be solved only by the maximum breadth of vision." When Congress in its wisdom passed the War Risk Insurance Act, little did anyone dream of its far-reaching effects. Manifestly it was the desire of Congress, expressing the will of the American people, that those men and women who had rendered military service in the war with Germany should be adequately recompensed for any injuries or disabilities which they might receive or which might be aggravated by their response to the call of duty. Not only was it intended that the in - jured person should receive a just remuneration in proportion to the seriousness of his disability, bat also that the Government should employ every means at the command of science to return such persons to health and as high a degree of physical efficiency as possible. No human brain could have foreseen the puzzling maze of intricacies which would follow in the train of such a legal enactment. The tentacles of no mind could have reached out into the future and brought back impressions of the multitudinous variety of ways in which this beneficient measure would touch the lives and happiness of thousands of Americans. At first glance the problem appears easy. If a discharged soldier, sailor or marine, army or navy nurse, yeoman (f) or marinette, can show that he or she received an injury in service or suffered an aggra - vation of a pre-existing injury or disease, then compensation and medical and surgical treatment if necessary, must inevitably follow. If it were so simple as this, every one of these persons would be able to arrange his compensation immediately upon his discharge from the military forces, and it would be unnecessary for the Government to employ special examiners and a corps of medical specialists in order to administer the Act with justice to the beneficiaries and to the Government. But such is not the case. In the first place, it must be shown that a claimant was actually in the military or naval forces of the United States. Secondly, that he suffered an injury or an aggravation of a pre-existing injury. The Office of the Adjutant General of the Army and the Bureau of Navigation of the Navy are able to furnish the data required under the first head. It is not always so easy to arrive at a decision with re - gard to the second head. A large number of cases are on record in which the man was dis - charged as in good condition, and within a few days was found to be suffering from serious trouble which was of such a nature as to make it absolutely certain that it existed prior to his separation from the ser - vice. For this reason it is not practical for the Medical Division to ac - cept at their face value the reports of discharge boards. This is es- </seg>
            <seg id="p260">260 pecially true when there is an absence of data. When boards have care - fully reviewed a man's condition, their reports are regarded as corrobor - ative evidence of the highest value. Then, too, there is the question of these disabilities which appear some time after the man's separation from the service. Here it is ncessary to call upon the Adjutant General and the Surgeon General for the man's medical record while in the service. This sometimes throws considerable light upon the question of determining whether military service had aggravated what would otherwise have been a very obscure condition. In every case the burden of proof is on the Govern - ment, and the man is always given the benefit of the doubt. This is in the interest of broad-minded, sympathetic treatment. Nearly the entire eighth floor of the Arlington Building in Wash - ington is occupied by the Medical Division of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance. The function of this Division is to pass upon the medical aspects of claims made against the Government under the War Risk Insurance Act; to supervise the medical and surgical treatment of those discharged sick and disabled soldiers, sailors and marines who are in need of such services; to arrange their hospitalization, to secure for them the artificial limbs and other prosthetic appliances which they may require.... to secure physical examinations of these claimants, and to prepare the certificates of disability which will be their protection in years to come, even though they may not be in need of compensation or medical and surgical attention at the present time. In other words it is the medical department of the largest insurance and employers' liability company in the world. Surgeon General Rupert Blue of the United States Public Health Service has detailed the medical officers necessary to conduct this work, and Dirctor R&gt;. G. Cholmeley-Jones of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance has assigned a large force of clerks, stenographers, and messengers to this Division. If one 'could visualize this busy place, presided over by the Chief Medical Advisor, Assistant Surgeon General W. C. Rucker, and could sense the broad sympathy with wh'ich" the Government is endeavoring to meet this post-war problem, the effect would be that of placing one's hand upon the pulse of the great American people. Here comes a hand-truck pushed by two lusty messengers. It is filled with reddish-brown fibre folders, each having a brilliant red edge. Everyone of these folders represents the claim of some man who has suffered a hurt at the hand of the god of war. These folders go into a large room where they are sorted and classified and from which they are dispatched in other trucks to the various sections of the Medical Div - ision. Each of these folders represents some man in need of treat - rnt or prosthetic apparatus, or some man, who by reason of his injury disease, is entitled to compensation from the Government. The sorted cases travel out by trucks to the various sections of the Medical Division. More than 5,000 cases pass through the Medical Division every working day, action being had on one case every four seconds. When the case reaches the section to which it is routed, it is </seg>
            <seg id="p261">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 261 carefully reviewed by medical officers of the United States Public Health Service specially trained in such work. In one instance it is necessary to rate the degree of disability; in another, to order an artificial arm; in another, to pay a bill for the re - pair of teeth; this patient is to be admitted to a sanatorium; that un - fortunate boy whose reason has been rocked by the thundering engines of war must be committed to an institution. Here the mother of an epileptic requires a consoling letter; there some officer in the field most be informed regarding the special needs of some particular case. The organization of the Division is simplicity itself. At the head is the Chief Medical Advisor, who is assisted by the Executive Officer. It is necessary that the Division be in accurate and close touch with various govenrmental and quasi-governmental agencies interested in the problem and for this purpose there is a Division . Officer to take up questions with the U. S. Public Health Service, the Federal Board for Vocational Training, the Army, the Navy, the Marine Corps, and Red Cross, and the various volunteer organizations which are doing such magnificent work in assisting to rehabilitate the war wreckage. The Division itself is divided into eight sections: — Internal Medicine, Surgery, Tuberculosis, Neuro-psychiatry, Eye, Ear, Nose, Throat, and Dental, Prosthetics, Statistical, and Miscellaneous. The functions of these sections are pretty well indicated by their titles. In the case of the sections of neuro-psychiatry and tuberculosis, the officers having charge of them have also charge of the same sections in the Hospital Division of the Public Health Service, thus making it possible to coordinate accurately the care of the tuberculosis and the mentally injured with the anti-tuberculosis and mental hygiene program of the Public Health Service. In this way it will be possible to assist in the nation-wide movement looking to the control of the great white plague and the recognition and early cure of many cases of mental ill - ness which are at present escaping observation. The cases pass to the various sections for action and from them back to the mail room and to the other divisions in the Bureau for such further action as may be necessary. It will be readily understood that one handling does not suffice for a given case. Each must be gone over many, many times, and will be gone over many, many times in the suc - ceeding years. This explains why although more than 5,000 cases are being ad - ministered each day, only some 107,000 different individuals have been the receipients of the ministrations of the Medical Division. Of these, more than 18 per cent were suffering from wounds incident to their military service; almost 15 per cent were the victims of tuberculosis, and not quite 11 per cent were afflicted with temporary or permanent mental disorders; about 4 per cent gassed; 6 per cent had respiratory affec - tions other than tuberculosis, and 2 per cent were paralyzed. About 17,000 of these cases have been treated in hospitals and about 7,000 men are undergoing hospital treatment at the present time. </seg>
            <seg id="p262">262 It should be borne in mind that these cases represent less than one per cent of the total number of men in service during the war with Ger - many. The total strength of the Army, Navy and Marine Corps to Novem - ber 11th, 1918, was 4,791,172. All of these are potentially patients of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance. To this number should be added the number of 200,300 men who were accepted by the local draft boards but were rejected by camp surgeons, and 50,000 men who were drafted and furnished transportation to camp but who were not mustered into service for reasons other than physical. The sum of these three groups was 5,041,470. Lit is estimated at the present time that at least 641,900 men of group were discharged from military service with some disability. Estimates which have been prepared by the Chief Medical Advisor on 513,500 of these men show that about twenty-five per cent of these cases of disability are due to diseases of the nervous system or mental alienation — about 76,000 cases. Thirteen per cent suffer from diseases of the circulatory system and almost thirteen per cent from diseases of the bones and organs of locomotion, and at least nine per cent, or about 46,000, have tuberculosis. To follow up a series of these causes through the Division and see the way in which they are handled is to come into intimate contact with humanity in the raw. Within the brick-red fibre folder with its scarlet edge are encompassed the records of the most important hap - penings of many a life. Here are certificates of birth, marriage and death, records of military service, reports of physical examinations, treatments received, operations performed, and letters from parents, wives, relatives and friends. In fact it would be possible to write the complete biography of many a man from the data collected in this one small space. Side by side, and handled in exactly the same way, are the cases of Colonels, Captains and Corporals; white men, colored men and Indians; men who have no English — men who are illiterate, and men who have received their education at the finest institutions of learning in the world. The case of a "marinette" is beside that of a Major General while that of a nurse is next in order to that of the private whom she nursed back to life. They have, however, one thing in common; they have suffered a hurt in the service of their country. Very seldom in - deed do they try to get more than their just dues, and many times they state that they do not wish compensation, all that they require being an opportunity to be cured of their diseases or healed of their wounds so that they may pursue again their peacetime avocation. It is interesting to examine some of the typical cases. The follow - ing have been selected at random and are authentic except as to names and addresses, which must be omitted since a man's medical record cannot be made public property.

I have worn this temporary arm for over three months and think I am ready for the permanent arm. So please inform me how to get it." Then follows this letter: — "In reply to your letter, you are advised to report to the District Supervisor at 512 Garland Building, Chicago, 111., for a complete physical examination and to be fitted with a permanent artificial arm. Present this letter together with your dU - charge paper as a means of identifying yourself, and you will be furn - ished with a permanent arm. Transportation is enclosed and return transportation will be given you by the officer who examines you." This man, whose left arm was blown off in the Argonne by a high - explosive shell, is examined and all the measurements taken for an artificial arm. Right here it may be stated that the War Risk Insurance Bureau specifies in all of its contracts that the manufacturer shall furnish the best artificial limb which he is capable of making; the Government sup - plies all of the extras, and in the case of men who have to do heavy work and therefore run a risk of breaking their artificial limb, they are given two. As one of the amputated men said, "One for week-days, the other for Sundays.' The arm for this patient was manufactured and, at Government expense, he was sent to the factory to try it on. Here in the file is his certificate stating that he has received the limb and that it is satisfactory in every respect, and next to it is a bill for $200.00 for this arm. Approximately 3,800 major amputations have occurred as a result of the war with Germany. Of these about two-fifths were arms and three- fifths were legs. Up to September 19, 1919, there were exactly 1,200 claims for arti - ficial limbs. Of these, 621 were artificial legs and 579 were artificial arms. While the artificial limb was well-known to the ancient Egyptians and was issued by Julius Caesar to the forces who captured Gaul and invaded England, in its modern application it is essentially the pro - duct of American inventive genius. The type of leg which Rameses used to order for his men and which was in general use by the mutiles of Pericles, consisted of a peg surmounted by a hollow wooden cone lined with leather, which was affixed to the body by means of a pair of homely suspenders. It was stiff and it was impossible therefore to "bend the pregnant hinges of the knee." This was remedied by a French gallant who in 1853 discovered that the emulation of "Hick, Hick, with his hickory limb" was unpopular in French society. He there - fore inserted a hinge at the knee. While in the process of active per - ambulation a strong metal pin prevented flection of the limb, but when seated the gallant beau wonld pull the pin and bend the hickory limb with his hand, thus removing the danger of tripping some fair Duchess. On rising, the leg was straightened out, the pin reinserted, and the pro - cess of "dot and carry one" recommenced. </seg>
            <seg id="p264">264 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT We have progressed far from that crude apparatus. The close of the Civil War necessitated the manufacture of large numbers of artificial limbs, and American ingenuity has succeeded in producing an artificial leg which is little short of 'marvelous. The limbs are made of wood covered with raw-hide which is shrunk on. They are very light, comfortable, and useful. Many persons call them cork legs in the be - lief that they are made of cork. They forget, however, that the cork leg received its name from a famous city in Ireland celebrated for its artificial limbs. t Artificial hands are, however, not quite so satisfactory. The arms iselves really function very well. Several enterprising manufactu - have, however, succeeded in producing fairly efficient artificial Is which function reasonably well when used with discretion and patience. The intelligent men who are willing to train themselves care - fully are able to use these with a considerable degree of satisfaction. The present war has stimulated very greatly inventive genius along the lines of artificial limbs and it is believed that before very long an abso - lutely satisfactory hand and arm will be placed upon the market. All sorts and conditions of men and women find ther way into the Medical Division, each with his or her heart full of his or her own particular problem. Here is the widow of a Lieutenant-Colonel, glori- Ey dead upon the field of honor in France. The next visitor is a hope - optimistic boy with tuberculosis of the spine, come to offer thanks the brace which is relieving his bent back. A huge, hulking, pro - gnathous shell-shock case is next. He is truly shell-shocked, having been blown up with high explosive in Belleau Wood. He has a fancied griev - ance and his attitude is such as to inspire terror. A quiet, peaceful talk follows in which it transpires that the apartment in which he is living is being remodeled, and the noise of the plumbers pounding on the pipes — "Honest, Doc, it fair makes me nutty." He was sent with an attendant to the newly opened psychopathic hospital at Cape May where he re - ceived careful attention and accurate scientific treatment designed to ultimately knit up the raveled sleeve of care. Lit is rther interesting to follow this man up. A few weeks after preliminary interview he was seen again. His whole attitude had changed. He was happy, contented, and announced he was doing splendidly in a business college where he was taking a course at the hands of the Federal Board for Vocational Education. The next is a shy. timid mother, the lines upon whose countenance bespeak a long, hard, character-making battle with life. Her brown eyes fill with tears as she tells about her son — "A good boy, he really isn't crazy. Doctor. The only trouble is he just hears voices." Ad - miss : cn is secured for this boy to the U. S. Public Health Service Hos - pital at Dansville, N. Y., and with a few worda of consolation this timid little woman, whose aching heavi has bcjn somewrat lightered, B*m o&gt;i ..rr vay. </seg>
            <seg id="p265">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 265 A small-town couple from New England were sent to the Bureau by the State Department. Their only son, evidently a line, lovable boy who had been running a small store for his father at the beginning of the war, entered a training camp and disappeared a few days before the final examinations. The mother's attitude makes one feel that she is sheltering her son in his failure. Next he enlists in the Canadian Royal Flying Corps, and after eighteen months of successful flight over the crater-strewn fields of Ploegsteert, he returns to America, secures an aviation position, and then disappears, his route being marked by a flood of bad checks and erratic actions. At one place he purcheses a dozen reversible coats and presents them to a friend; at another, he buys fifty parrots, and turns them loose in a church service. "Can he be admitted to a hospital at the expense of the Canadian Government?" "Certainly. Where is he?" They do not know. The Home Service Section of the Red Cross is requisitioned for aid ; the country is flooded with telegrams, and twenty - four hours later this poor, shell-shocked boy is removed from a filthy jail and placed in a clean, cool, quiet psychopatic ward. And so this procession goes on hour by hour and day by day, and one by one these problems of human life are met and solved with kindly sympathy. The mail is not less interesting. A mother in Virginia writes a four-page letter urging pitifully that something be done for her son, but neglects to sign her name or give the boy's name, address or organization. A boy in a large eastern hospital writes as follows: "Chief Medical Advisor — I am going to be operated on tomorrow, and I expect to die anyhow, but before I check out I want to tell you that I think you're a dirty bum, and everything connected with your Bureau is rotten." Immediately follows a reply telling him if he will make his com - plaint a little more specific it will be carefully investigated, and ex - pressing the hope that his operation may not be as unsuccessful as he expects. A few days later comes his reply. He seems to be getting along pretty well. Part of his complaint seems fairly well founded — an over-zealous clerk has refused to pay certain very legitimate bills. In his letter he says: "You say the Bureau is interested in the welfare of every ex - service man. Here is a living opportunity to prove it I am in the hospital flat on my back without any money to pay for treatment. It is bad enough to be sick, but when one has to worry about bills, well it is Hell." — and closing, "Let me thank you for the prompt manner in which you replied to my letter. Frankly speaking, when I wrote I thought I would be beyond earthly cares in a few days, and that is why I wrote it" A reply is immediately sent forward. He is told that his hospital Mils will be paid, and this is the close of the letter: </seg>
            <seg id="p266">FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT 266 "So far as his Bureau is concerned, it is earnestly desirous of giv - ing every one of its beneficiaries a square deal. More than this it wants to do its work in a human, sympathetic, broad-minded way." The time once was when letters were not answered as promptly aa they are now. In the early days of the Bureau there was such an enorm - ous pressure of work, — work which was wholly without precedent in the history of governmental enterprises — that it was not always possible to reply immediately. Now the work of the Medical Division is and has been for some time absolutely current. Cases which formerly required several days of waiting are now handled by telegram and in the handling of these cases it is an invariable rule to endeavor to give them the personal interest touch. Here is a rather typical case in the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Section. A native of Spain after having completed three years and seven months of service is furloughed to the Reserves. He claims that he was injured in an automobile truck accident and that as a result he is suffering from impairment of vision. Careful examination reveals the fact he is nearly blind in his right eye; that he is partially deaf in his right ear; is suffering from nasal obstruction, and that he has a de - pressed fracture directly over the right eye. As if this were not enough, he has healed laceration of the left shoulder, the left kneecap, and a sprain of the wrist. As a result of this claim, he was recommended for a temporary total disability rating, was placed in hospital for immediate relief of his nasal condition, and if this is found to result in part from the condition of his tonsils, these will also be treated. During the time he is in hospital his eyes will be refracted to determine whether or ndt his vision may be improved by glasses. He will also be carefully examined by expert consultants to ascertain whether or not anything can be done for the depressed fracture over his right eye. He will be kept under treatment until there is evidence that his condition has received the maximum improvement. During this time, advantage will be taken of the opportunity to give him some occupational therapeutics, and as a result this faithful soldier will receive the best which it is possible to give Here is another case. A soldier, while engaged in bayonet exercise received a wound of the head from the bayonet of the man behind him. As a rsult he became paralyzed. He could not sit up, walk, or rise without assistance. He suffered from epileptic attacks. He is given a temporary total disability rating, and later if it is shown that his paralysis is not improving, that he is still very nervous, this rating wfll be made permanent. In spite of all that medical science can do there seems to be no pobability of this man's cure. Therefore, he will con - tinue to receive this compensation as long as he lives. The interesting feature of another case from a surgical standpoint is the fact that the patient had a piece of shrapnel lodged in the base </seg>
            <seg id="p267">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 267 of his skull— received during the violent fighting in the Argonne Forest last October. As a result of this wound, the patient is going blind, and unless surgical measures are taken, this injury may result in the claimant's death. The removal of a foreign body from this location is an extremely delicate operation. There are few men in the world who are capable of extracting this fragment of steel from the base of the brain. A telegram is dispatched to a surgeon whose reputation in this class of cases is international, asking if he will undertake this very delicate operation, and upon his favorable reply the patient was sent the breadth of the United States with a special attendant, placed in the only hospital in which this surgeon would operate, in a private room with a day and a night nurse. At the time of writing this article the shrapnel has been removed from the base of this man's brain and he is progressing rapidly to recovery. This would not have occurred had not the Govern - ment taken every means at its disposal in the endeavor to prolong the life and save the sight of this brave man. Here is a Polish-Jew, a tailor in civil life — a good boy who was always lively and liked to sing and read; was ambitious and was educating himself in night school. After a short period of service he found that he could not do his work; that he felt sleepy, but could not sleep; was worried. One night he was awakened by a severe pain in his head, but by morning this pain was better and he went on with his work. That night he could not sleep because he was worried. Finally it be - rie evident that some mental change was taking place in this man, and was placed under observation. His mind was at first depressed, and he accused himself of things 'which he never did. Later he became apprehensive, depressed, worried, and longed for death. It became evident that he was hopelessly insane, and would so remain until relieved by the kindly hand of death. Under a cooperative arrangement with the U. S. Army he was taken to a state institution and there discharged from the Army and committed to the care of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance. Here is a tuberculosis case — a chauffeur in civil life. He has been referred to the supervisor of the district in which he lives and he is placed in a sanitarium not far removed from his home. At the last report lie was gaining weight and was improving rapidly. The War Risk Insurance Act requires that the Director, shall prepare and adopt a schedule of disability ratings and that this schedule shall be ltered from time to time in acordance with experience. At first blush t might appear that this was an easy thing to do. But when the vast umber of diseases and injuries and the myriad of ways in which these may be combined, are considered, it is seen that this is extremely ifficult of accomplishment in such a manner as to work justice to the ischarged soldier, sailor or marine. As a result, the Medical Division has been obliged to adopt tentative schedules and to utilize these. Almost daily these schedules have to </seg>
            <seg id="p268">268 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT be altered in order to keep pace with experience. When a man has more than one injury, he receives a rating for each and then an additional percentage for the combination. In the matter of amputations there is a difference between the two hands, and allowance is made for the length of the stump. In other words, an endeavor is made to administer the rating with justice to the wounded man. The loss of the little finger of the right hand, for ex - ample, counts as 4 per cent but the little finger of the left hand in the tentative schedule now being used counts only 1.9 per cent. This rating would be reversed in the case of a left-handed man. If a man has a stiff joint, account must be taken not only of the particular joint involved but also whether the angle of fixation is favorable or unfavorable. Visual defects are exceedingly difficult to rate. Tables have been made which give a rating for all visual defects and combinations there - of. Ratings cannot be given for hazard. To do so would be to involve the Government in endless disputes and would probably work very little benefit to the injured person. Hearing defects are rated in much the same manner as are visual defects. Considerable difficulty was met in the formulation of a definition of complete deafness. Since many persons are now made to hear by various telephonic apliances on the market, in rating total deafness the conduction of sound waves by the bones of the skull must therefore be taken into consideration. The great bulk of the ratings which are given are temporary. This is done in the interest of claimant and Government alike. Later, as soon as a rating can be placed upon a permanent basis, this is done, but not until the case has been thoroughly gone over and the rights of the individual claimant carefully considered. Permanent total ratings are passed on by a board of three officers before they are finally made and every means is taken to see to it that the rating is given with full just - ice to the ex-srvice man. The law provides that any man who has received an injury in the war may apply for a certificate of disability. This is for the purpose of protecting his rights in the event that the may have trouble from his injury in the future. Undoubtedly a considerable nubmer of men are unaware of their rights in this regard and are allowing their year of grace to pass without action on their part. In all probability Congress will see the justice of changing this phase in the law so that men who have allowed their rights to lapse in ignorance may receive this measure of protection. The problem of hospitalizing the patients of the War Risk Insurance Bureau is an enormous one. Congress has already passed one act author - izing the Secretary of the Treasury to provide additional hospital and sanitorium facilities to meet the necessities of the situation. This phase of the work is administered by the Bureau of War Risk Insurance using as its agency the United States Public Health Service, which also has at its command the United States Marine Hospitals and </seg>
            <seg id="p269">NESRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 269 the special hospitals which Congress has authorized it to secure by pur - chase or lease. These include a certain number of temporary hospitals which were turned over by the Army. It will be necessary for the Public Health Service to provide ad - ditional hospitals to take the place of these temporary institutions as well as special institutions for the care and treatment of mental and nervous cases, the tuberculosis and the epileptics. It is evident to even hte casual observer hat the number of persons who will apply for relief under the various acts will increase for a considerable number of years. Con - servative estimates indicate that this increase will be rapid and con - tinuous until at least 1920. The Public Health Service has already created a home for epileptics in Massachusetts, a psychopathic hospital in New York, and an institution for the care of neurosis cases at Waukesha, Wisconsin. It is not only necessary that many claimants under the War Risk Insurance Act shal be given hospital relief, but in many instances also to give them treatment in clinics. At the present time there are scattered throughout the country a considerable number of these insti - tutions. Undoubtedly it wil be necessary to increase them very ma - terially. It is believed that these clinics will serve a useful purpose as way - stations to and from the hospital. They wil prove of enormous benefit in the matter of caring for the convalescent claimant who, while not requiring hospital relief, should be kept under observation for a con - siderable number of years. A few of the necessities in the matter of utilities have been pointed out bfore. It is equally necessary that the Public Health Service have an adequate personnel with which to meet the very heavy burden which has been placed upon it. That service is fully aware of the necessities of the situation and is meeting them by increasing its regular and re - serve corps. The Director of the Bureau of War Bisk Insurance has, in addition, appointed a corps of special examiners to operate on a fee basis in various parts of the country. This has been done so that the claimants may receive examinatins and every medical attention without prolonged travel. Before we leave this subject let's go back and have one last look atthe Medical Division of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance, — that busy place where day in and day out the red fibre jackets travel from room to room carrying their messages of braveries performed, of wounds received, and of diseases incurred for love of country The work which the Medical Division of the Bureau of War Risk Insurance is doing is as broad as Humanity itself It touches every angle, every phase of American life and into the performance of these very serious respons - ibilities there is infused a spirit of broad generous humanity and </seg>

Probably the most im - portant of these is the new Department of Agriculture which includes the former Food, Drug, Dairy and Oil Commission, the work former - ly done by the Live Stock Sanitary Board, Stallion Registration, the Fish and Game -Commission and a new Bureau, to be known as the Bureau -of Markets and Marketing. This Bureau will also include Agricultural Statistics, State Development and Publicity. The Publicity work in this Bureau of Markets and Marketing will include the work formerly carried on by the Secretary of the Nebraska Board of Agriculture. The Bulletin on crop statistics here - to fore issued in a co-operative way by the Nebraska Board of Agri - culture and the Bureau of Crop Estimates of the United States Depart - ment of Agriculture, will hereafter be issued jointly by the new State Department of Agriculture and the Federal Department. The activities of the new department and subjects of interest to the producer as well as subjects relating to the agricultural industry in general will be discussed from time to time in this Bulletin. LEO STUHR, Secretary, Department of Agriculture September 1, 1919, Crop Report Corn deteriorated to the extent of 10% during August, making the September 1 condition 71%, according to the latest estimates of the Co-operative Crop Reporting Service This condition indicates a yield of 25.5 bushels and a production of 172,402,000 bushels compared to 123, - 086,000 bushels last year. Corn is very uneven, ranging from a failure to an excellent condition. Parts of south central, central and most of northeastern Nebraska have good corn. The southeastern quarter of the state with few exceptions has a very poor crop. The condition of spring wheat at the time of harvest was 47% which promises a yield of 8.5 and a production of 6,870,000 bushels, com - pared to 9,663,000 bushels last year. The yield ranges from a failure to a fair crop. Some western and central counties have fairly good yields and with a comparatively larger acreage makes a higher state average than one might expect. Spring wheat ripened too fast in the eastern half of the state and black rust was also a factor in reducing yields. The total production of both spring and winter wheat is 55,870, - 000 bushels, compared to 43,141,000 bushels last year. The condition of oats at the time of harvest was 85%, which should make a yield of 32.3 bushels compared to 22.2 bushels last year. The production will approximate 74,387,000 bushels, compared to 56, - 188,000 bushels last year. The southeastern quarter of the state has a better oat crop than northeastern Nebraska, which is rather unusual. </seg>

            <seg id="p272"/>
            <seg id="p273">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 273 The condition of barley at the time of harvest was 83%, from which a yield of 25.7 bushels may be expected, and a production of 7,951,000 bushels, compared to 5,550,000 bushels last year. Barley and oats are nearer normal than other grain crops this year. Barley is gaining favor as a grain crop and the acreage has increased considerably. The potato crop will be very short this year. The condition which was generally very promising previous to July, has now been reduced to 52% of a crop. The commercial potato crop of western Ne - braska while slightly better than a half crop may turn out less than half of last year's production as the acreage is smaller. September 1 condition indicates a total crop of 6,458,000 bushels, compared to 10,406,000 bushels last year. The western Nebraska crop was very good last year while the general farm crop of potatoes was very small. The average yield of the first three cuttings of alfalfa is 2.9 tons per acre, compared to 2.1 tons last year. The first two crops were generally very good while part of the third crop was light. Some counties will have a fourth cutting. The total production will approximate 3,480, - 000 tons, compared to 2,527,000 tons last year. The average yield of wild hay is 1.1 tons per acre, compared to .88 tons last year. The weather was generally very favorable for harvest and the quality of hay is good. The production should be nearly 2,989,000 tons, compared to 2,285,000 tons last year. There are 15% less swine than a year ago. Last year's swine crop was very large. However, Nebraska probably has as many swine as the short crop of corn will feed this year. Estimates of important crops for the Uinted States are as fol - lows: Corn, 2,883,356,000 bushels, compared to 2,582,814,000 bushels last year. Oats, 1,232,559,000 bushels, compared to 1,538,359,000 bushels a year ago. Spring wheat, 204,907,000 bushels, compared to 358,651, - 000 bushels last year. All wheat, 920,208,000 bushels, compared to 917, - 100,000 bushels a year ago. , * A yield of 25.0 bushels of corn per acre for Nebraska is the pre - limianry estimate just announced by A. E. Anderson and Geo. A. Williams of the Crop Reporting Service. The yield was 17.7 bushels per acre last year and the ten year average is 23.6 bushels. The acreage was reduced this year and the production will approximate 168,625,000 bushels compared to 123,086,000 bushels last year and 177,630,000 bushels the acreage for 1909-18. Dakota county has the highest yield of corn with an average of 41 bushels and Burt county is second with 40 bushels per acre. Central Nebraska has a very good crop. The south central part of the state is far ahead of its average with yields ranging from 34 bushels in Kearney county and 33 bushels in Phelps county to 17 bushels in Web - ster county. Southeastern Nebraska has the lowest yields, ranging from November 1, 1919 </seg>
            <seg id="p274">274 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT 23 bushels in Richardson county to 12 bushels in Jefferson county, 13 bushels in Fillmore county, 14 bushels in Nuckolls county, and 15 bushels in Clay, Gage, Johnson, Pawnee and Thayer counties. Colfax county leads in the east central section with 34 bushels and Lancaster county is the lowest with an average of 17 bushels. The yields in this section are exceeding earlier expectations. The quality of corn is generally very good. Approximately 3.5% of last year's crop remains on farms. The average yield of silage was 5.0 tons per acre. The average weight per measure bushel of winter wheat is 56.0 lbs., spring wheat 51.0 lbs., oats 31.0 lbs., and barley 44.0 lbs. Wheat is far below its average while oats and barley are nearly the average. The preliminary estimate of yield of potatoes is 45 bushels per acre. Since 1866 there were six crops having lower yields Potatoes produced 86 bushels per acre last year. The ten year average is 74 bushels. The production will approximate 5,175,000 bushels as com - pared to 10,406,000 bushels last year and the ten year average of 8,771,000 bushels. The dry land potatoes in the commercial section will produce a half crop while the irrigated potatoes will make two-thirds of a crop or slightly better. About 10% of the commercial crop was des - troyed by a freeze on October 10. Shipments of the commercial crop have totaled 1,115 cars up to and including November 5 as compared to 1,731 cars for the same period last year. The average yield of flax is 5 bushels, clover 1.8 bushels. The condition of sugar beets at the time of harvest was 92%. The total production of apples is over 50%, grapes 78%, and pears 61%. The condition of winter wheat and rye remains highly satisfactory. Preliminary estimates of acreage and condition will be made next month. b Preliminary estimates for the United States are as follows: Corn 10,000,000 bushels compared to 2,582,814,000 bushels last year. Po - oes 352,000,000 bushels compared to 400,106,000 bushels last year. Commercial Apple Report Nebraska commercial apple crop is estimated by the fruit crop ialists of the Bureau of Crop Estimates to be 224,000 barrels as com - pared to 61,000 barrels last year. The commercial apple crop for the United States is reported to be 24,400,000 barrels compared to 24,724, - 000 barrels last year. Commercial Potato Report The Nebraska commercial potato crop was damaged to the extent of 10% by the freeze of October 10. Most of the damage was confined to the unharvested potatoes in Box Butte, Sheridan and Dawes counties. There was some loss in pits that were not properly covered. The irrigated section escaped with a slight damage. Kimball and Brown comities report very little if any loss. </seg>
            <seg id="p275">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 275 Commercial shipments are expected to be approximately 50% of last year, or a total of 2,500 cars. This is only slightly less than esti - mated a month ago, as the yields are better in the irrigated sections than the earlier condition figures indicated which offsets partially the loss from the freeze A total of 1,131 cars were shipped previous to and including November 6 as compared to 1,766 cars for the same period last year. Total shipments last year were 5,000 cars. Most of the dry land potatoes are grading No. 2. A large per cent of the irrigated crop is grading No. 1. The total crop is estimated to average 35% of No. 1, 55% of No. 2, and 10% culls. The October estimate ofthe commercial potato crop for the United States by the Bureau of Crop Estimates was 129,466 cars as compared to 152,248 cars last year, or about 85% of last year's crop. Car Shortage Serious in Some Sections A great many complaints are reaching the Department of Agri - culture relative to the car shortage in certain sections of the state. The situation is acute in certain localities owing to the great demand for cars at this time. This demand is not only for cars for trans - portation of wheat and potatoes but at the present time is also affecting the movement of coal shipments. The Bureau of Markets as well as the Railway Commission are doing all in their power to make a prompt and fair distribution of these empty cars. Farmers are cautioned to safeguard the storage of any products which may be held up owing to this existing car shortage Announcement The bulletins covering the laws enforced by the Department of Agri - culture have just been received from the printer.

SCOPE OF THE FOURTEENTH CENSUS EXTENDED Washington, Nov. 2 — That the Fourteenth Decennial Census, on which the actual enumeration work will begin January 2, 1920, is to be the most important ever taken is shown by the fact that the Act of Congress providing for this census expressly increased the scope of the inquiries so as to include forestry and forest products, two subjects never covered specifically by any preceding census. The inquiries to be made relating to population, manufactures, mines, quarries and agriculture were also extended in their scope by Congress, the keenest interest over the forthcoming census having been shown by the members of the census committees of both the House and Senate while the law was under consideration. The statistics gathered on mining will include all oil and gas wells. Many startling developments in this important branch of the Nation's resources are looked for by census officials. The figures gathered in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas will no doubt prove to be those eagerly sought for, as shown by inquiries already received by the Census Bureau. The compilation and gathering of forestry and forest products statistics will be in charge of a special force of experts. The accurate and comprehensive figures gathered concerning this vital natural re - sources will be much in demand, and the comparisons made with con - ditions existing before the war will be of great interest. Agricultural statistics will likewise be the subject of special effort on the part of the Census Bureau as the importance of farming is be - ing realized by the average citizen far more than ever before. t Washington, October 25 — Sixty-five former soldiers and sailors have i appointed supervisors for the Fourteenth Decennial Census, accord - to an announcement issued today by the Bureau of the Census. "The Census Bureau was particularly glad whenever it found a former service man for the job of supervisor," announced Director of the Census Sam. L. Rogers. "Most of the applicants who qualified, however, were men of more mature age and of broader experience than the ma - ioritv of soldiers and sailors." </seg>
            <seg id="p277">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 277 Three women appear on the list of supervisors, one having been appointed to serve in the State of New York, one in Texas and one in Nevada. This is the first time in the history of the Census Bureau that women have been selected to fill these positions. Of the 372 supervisors chosen approximately 100 are lawyers. Ex-service men come next in numbers and editors rank third with more than 40 appointments. Farmers are represented with about 25, while educators, numbering about 20, run the farmers a close race. Several physicians have undertaken the task of collecting Uncle Sam's statistics, and likewise a great many business men. Each supervisor appointed had to undergo rigid tests as to his fitness for the position, especial stress having been laid on character and experience. "No man was appointed a supervisor for the Fourteenth Census," said Mr. Rogers, "Until every possible guarantee was given as to his ability and honesty. Character was at all times the leading and pre - dominating consideration with the Census Bureau in every appointment made." SOME ECONOMIC ASPECTS OF FRUIT AND VEGETABLE STORAGE By J. W. LLOYD, Chief in Olericulture University of Illinois Agricultural Experiment Station In order to understand the economics of storage, it is necessary to keep in mind certain fundamental laws regarding factors which de - termine the price of commodities. Except in war times, it is usually considered that the price of a given commodity at a given time and place is an expression of the ratio between supply and demand. How - ever, the same relative change in supply affects the price of various commodities very differently. This is due to differences fn the elasticity of demand for the different commodities. The demand for some commodities is elastic, and for others it is inelastic. In the case of commodities for which the demand is inelastic, about the same quantities will be used regardless of the price, and large change in prices are associated with relatively small changes in quan - tities offered or taken. When the available supply is below normal, prices rise out of all proportion to the decrease in supply; and on the other hand, when the supply is above normal, prices must be enormously reduced t oeffect the movement of larger than the usual quantities of the given commodity. In case of a short crop, prices may reach enormous heights; and in case of an excessive crop, the selling price may be below the cost of production. In fact, in the case of a commodity for which </seg>
            <seg id="p278">278 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT the demand is inelastic, when the crop is in excess of the normal needs of the people the total crop will bring less money than will a crop which is below normal in volume. In general, the demand for commodities considered as necessities is inelastic. Relatively small changes in quantity are associated with much larger changes in price. On the other hand, the demand for goods classed as luxuries is elastic. Relatively small changes is price are associated with relatively large changes in amounts taken. A slight reduction in price will greatly increase the amounts purchased, and a slight advance in price will greatly curtail consumption. A large crop will be of greater total value than a crop below normal in size, for the reduction in price per unit is not so great as the increase in quantity. The price of luxuries fluctuates much less widely than the price of necessities. Importance of Storage Storage facilities are of great importance in the handling of perish - able food supplies whether the demand be inelastic or elastic. In the case of necessities, for which the demand is inelastic, storage may be made a means of distributing the supply thru the season of non-production or low production, thus making the fluctuations in price less violent. Good storage facilities make possible the anomaly of higher prices to the producer at harvest time, and lower prices to the consumer during the season of non-production. The demand for apples is elastic. A small reduction in price is likely to result in quite a large increase in quantities purchased. The converse also is true: a relatively small increase in price is likely to result in a large reduction in the quantities purchased. In order that large quantities of apples may be moved into consumption, it is there - fore essential that the price be reasonable. However, it is not necessary that it be excessively low. In order that a maximum quantity be used, it is also important that supplies be available thru a long marketing season. The existence of a continuous supply on the market not only results in the moving of larger quantities because of the longer time made possible for consumption, but also has a tendency to establish the apple-eating habit on the part of more people. One reason that so many bananas are sold is that a continuous supply is available thruout the entire year. The same is true of California oranges to considerable extent. The continuous supply stimulates consumption. The continuous supply of bananas is made possible by reason of the fact that this fruit is produced in the tropics where growth of the plants is continuous thru the year, and where by proper management of the banana plantation, it is possible to cut fruit from the trees at any time desired. In different parts of California, the climatic conditions are sufficiently different to make quite a difference in the time of ripening of the same variety of orange. It is also true that an orange will remain in good condition on the tree, in some parts of the state, </seg>
            <seg id="p279">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 279 for several months after it has become sufficiently ripe for picking. By leaving the Valencia oranges on the trees thru the summer in the reg - ions where they ripen latest, it is possible to have this variety of fruit available until the Navels of the succeeding crop in the earliest-producing regions are sufficiently mature for use. Thus, both bananas and oranges can be shipped directly from the trees to the consuming markets at any time during the year. However, if a continuous supply of apples is to be furnished at points of consumption it is necessary that storage be resorted to for supplying the markets at least half of the year. Location of Storage Houses If apples must be stored for supplying the market, the question naturally arises as to whether storage should take place at the point of production or at the point of consumption. There are several ad - vantages in having the fruit stored in the consuming regions. If the fruit is shipped to the point of consumption during the harvesting season, there is practically no danger of its freezing in transit; it is available for use at any time during the winter regardless of weather conditions, and there are no periods of local scarcity due to delayed tight movement. Furthermore, supplies for any given year may be ured directly from the most available source that year If, on the er hand, storage in producing regions were depended upon, the storage ises in certain localities would be unused or only partially filled in seasons of light crops in a given region, unless perchance the total crop of the entire country were so large that these houses needed to be used to take up the surplus from other regions. In such a case, shipment both into and out of storage would be required, and needless movement of freight take place. Size of Towns that Should Store Apples The question might arise as to what sized towns could advan - tageously secure their winter supplies of apples in the fall and store them, rather than depend upon shipments from outside during the winter months. There are certain advantages in securing apples in carload lots The freight rate is considerably lower than on less than carload lots, and the fruit is likely to arrive in better condition. It is particularly disadvantageous to ship in small lots during cold weather, since these are much more likely to suffer frost injury than carload lots. It would therefore be advantageous for any town which could use on« or more carloads of apples to secure them in the fall and store them, provided proper facilities for storage could be secured. A town does not need to be very large to use a carload of apples A normal crop of apples for the United States amounts to only about two bushels for each inhabitant. This includes both summer and winter apples and all varieties and grades. The commercial crop (the </seg>
            <seg id="p280">280 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT portion of the crop which is shipped beyond the borders of the county in which it is produced) is usually estimated at about 40 percent of the total crop. It is probable that on the average there would be not more than about one-half bushel of apples per inhabitant available for the winter supply. If this supply were distributed over a period of six months it would mean only about one-half of one small apple for each person each day; and yet at that rate a town of 5,000 inhabitants would require atout five carloads of apples for the winter, and a town of 20,000 would require twenty carloads. In case the inhabitants of a given town really had the apple-eating habit, they could easily consume double these quantities. Towns which can use from five to ten carloads of apples during the winter, as well as larger towns, should by all means be provided with facilities for storing their winter supply. Even as far back as 1910 there were 72 towns and cities in Illinois, outside of Chicago, with popu - lations of over 5,000. While part of these cities have storage facilities for apples, many of them are not provied with such facilities, and in some of these places the apple supply becomes very short at times during the winter, when local shipments from distributing centers are depended upon. The scarcity of apples and the irregularity of the supply in winter is even more pronounced in smaller towns. According to the Census Report for 1910 there were 245 towns and cities in Illinois with popu - lations of between 1,000 and 5,000. The number has increased rather than diminished since -that time. Since 1,000 people can use a carload of apples during the winter if each person eats one apple every two days, large quantities of apples in the aggregate would be needed to supply the towns of Illinois having populations of 1,000 to 5,000 if they used their rightful share of the apple crop. However, during periods of severe weather, such towns sometimes are entirely without apples, except those shipped in by express at enormous expense. Under such cir - stances, the high retail price curtails consumption. This condition could be overcome by the maintenance of proper storage facilities in these towns. Storage for Local Consumption in Producing Regions kThus far we have been thinking primarily of towns located out - of commercial apple-producing regions; but even in localities i which apples are shipped in large quantities at harvest time, a supply for winter use is often lacking. This is especially true in the smaller towns. Apples may be very abundant in September and October, but practically none available after the first of December, except as an occasional barrel is shipped in from a storage house in some more or less distant city. This means that whatever apples are consumed in that town in the winter have usually had to be shipped to and from storaee, thus necessitating the inclusicn of two trans- </seg>
            <seg id="p281">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 281 </seg>
            <seg id="p282"/>
            <seg id="p283">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 283 portation charges in the retail price. If local storage facilities were available, no freight or express charges whatever would be necessary; and there is no doubt but that many more apples would be used in such towns if they were stored locally. It is exceedingly regrettable that inhabitants of towns in apple producing regions do not have an opportunity to enjoy the products of their own locality during the winter as well as at harvesting time. Types of Storage Structures for Apples To meet the storage requirements of towns of various sizes, dif - ferent sorts of storage structures need to be provided. It must be kept in mind that three factors have a distinct bearing upon the keep - ing quality of apples in storage, aside from the condition of the fruit itself when placed in storage. These factors are temperature, hu - midity, and aeration. Up to the present time more attention has been given to temperature than to the other two factors. However the experience of persons who have given attention to the matter of humidity indicates that this may be fully as important a factor as temperature, and the results of recent investigations by Brooks and Cooley indicate that aeration is the most important factor in relation to apple scald. Where apples are to be stored in a large city there is little ques - tion but that mechanical refrigeration is the most convenient and satisfactory method of maintaining the desired temperature In a city of considerable size where artificial ice is used in quantity, the apple storage house may very appropriately be operated in connection with the ice manufactory- Such a storage plant, however, demands expensive equipment and skilled operators, and in a medium-sized town where ice is not manufactured, it would hardly be feasible to erect a mechanical refrigeration plant for the storage of a few car - loads of apples. In a place of this sort, an ice-cooled storage house would better fulfill the requirements Such a house needs no expen - sive machinery or equipment, and with proper attention to ventila - tion can be operated so that a practically uniform temperature of 33* F. can be maintained. A storage house of this type, built at Neoga, Illinois, by the Horticultural Department of the University of Illi - nois, was successfully operated for a number of years. While the temperature was two degrees higher than that usually maintained for apples in a mechanically cooled storage plant, the fruit kept fully as well as in the latter type of storage The exceedingly slight amount of shrinkage due to loss of moisture from the fruit was especially noticeable. It is probable that the melting ice resulted in a more humid atmosphere which kept the fruit from shrinking. The only objection to such a store house is that it requires ice, and ice is rather expensive in these days. Such a house could be eco - nomically operated where ten to twenty carloads of fruit are to be </seg>
            <seg id="p284">284 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT stored. For small towns, needing perhaps only one, two, or three cars of apples for the winter supply, another type of storage would be cheaper to operate and would serve the purpose quite well, par - ticularly in regions where the weather is fairly cool at the time apples are placed in storage. Under such circumstances, an outdoor cellar provided with means for controlling both the humidity and the aera - tion would probably be the most satisfactory type of storage house, Such a structure is particularly desirable for maintaining a winter supply of apples for small towns in apple-producing regions, and furnishes the most practical means of solving the question of a winter supply of fruit for such places. If every apple-producing locality in Illinois were supplied with storage facilities of this sort, it would improve not only the health of the inhabitants of these localities, but also the general condition of the apple market in the larger places. tA big advantage in thus storing apples for local use would be t the expense for barrels could be eliminated, since with proper trol of humidity and aeration, the apples could be stored in open crates, or possibly even in bulk. Thus a local supply in producing regions could be made available thru a large part of the winter with little expense for packages, and no expense for freight. An outdoor cellar of the type suggested can be taken care of without much trouble. It is true that the temperature cannot readily be held at quite so low a point as in an ice-cooled house or a me - chanical refrigeration plant. However, after winter weather sets in, it is feasible to hold the temperature between 34 and 38° F., and the control over humidity and aeration will effect to some extent the dis - advantage of the higher temperature. bA storage for winter supplies for a small town might readily be ed and operated by a wholesale dealer in case there is one in the n. In towns where there are no wholesale dealers, there is often an association of retail merchants. Such an organization might read - ily form a stock company for the construction and operation of a store house where all members could store the apples needed for their retail trade thru the winter. For supplying small towns in apple - producing regions, some progressive grower might very well construct a storage cellar on his farm and supply the various retailers with apples as they needed them thru the winter, in case the dealers them - selves were without proper storage facilities. Construction of an Outdoor Cellar Since the outdoor cellar constitutes the type of storage best adapted to the needs cf small towns, or individual growers desiring to supply these towns., a brief consideration of the construction of such cellars may net be out of place. "An outdoor cellar is preferably built in a hillside and fully covered with earth except at one end where the entrance is located </seg>
            <seg id="p285">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 285 Ventilation is provided for by means of large ventilator shafts thru the roof, and cold air intakes under the floor. In addition to being lo - cated where the natural drainage is good, thoro drainage is provided by placing a line of tile around the outside wall and also having the air intake serve as a drain for surplus water that might in any manner gain access to the cellar. If the air entering the intake is made to pass over a reservoir of water under the floor of the cellar, the proper degree of humidity can be maintained. "Such an outdoor cellar may be constructed of brick, hollow tile, or concrete. Taking advantage of the topography of the land, an exca - vation is made at such a point that a grade entrance will be secured to the cellar, if possible. Forms are then erected, if the construction is to be of concrete, and the side walls made. The roof may be either in the form of an arch that is self-supporting, or it may be made flat if reinforced concrete construction is employed. Provision must be made for carrying shafts of concrete to a height that will put their outlets above the layer of earth that is to be placed over the roof. It is pre - ferable to have the walls provided with air spaces to furnish insulation. For this purpose concrete blocks in place of solid concrete walls may be employed. Another way of improving the insulation of the storage cellar is to fill in a layer of cinders between the concrete wall and the bank of earth forming the side of the excavation, and also to carry the layer of cinders over the roof. In all cases there should be a layer of water proof concrete over the roof. "Earth should be banked against the exposed sides and over the top of the building to a depth of at least three feet." Storage of Potatoes and Root Crops Thus far we have been speaking primarily of storage as applied to the apple. However, it should be stated that the type of outdoor cellar just described affords exceptionally good storage facilities for potatoes and root crops. These cellars show their superiority over other forms of potato storage mst strngly when the stock is kept until late spring or early summer. The remarks previously made in reference to the desirability of shipping apples at harvest time to the points of consumption, are equally applicable to potatoes. Towns which consume a few carloads of potatoes each winter should not be obliged to depend upon shipments from northern producing regions or large distributing centers during the dead of winter. It would be highly advantageous to store the entire winter's supply as early in the fall as the maturity of the crop and the available car supply will permit. A normal crop of potatoes in the United States amounts to only about four bushels for each inhabitant. If each person in a town con - sumed his full share on this basis, it would involve the storage of about two bushels per capita for a six-months' winter supply. This would mean that a town of 5,000 inhabitants would need about twenty car- </seg>
            <seg id="p286">286 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT loads of potatoes. Even if only half this quantity were used in a given town of the size mentioned, it would be highly advantageous to have storage facilities that would enable the town to ship in its full supply before severe weather sets in. While an outdoor cellar of the type described is especially stat - able for the storage of relatively small volumes of apples or potatoes, such a cellar may be constructed of almost any desired size by putting in sufficient pillars for supporting the roof. Such a cellar may there - fore be used for storing large supplies of potatoes and root crops. Summary rThe most important storage problems for Illinois involve questions economics rather than questions of refrigeration. Apples constitute a commodity for which the demands is elasti,. Large quantities can be sold at remunerative prices provided supplies are continuously available at all consuming markets and people are thus encouraged to establish the apple-eating habit. Storage at the points of consumption will make it possible to keep the supply con - tinuous. Not alone should the large cities be provided with storage facilities; small towns outside of producing regions should have ap - ples in winter without paying express rates for their transportation. Small towns in producing regions should have them without much expense for packages, and with no expense for freight. The maintenance of suitable storage facilities in the smaller markets will decrease the cost of distribution and increase the con - sumption of fruit and vegetables.

(Filed June 29, 1917. Amendments Approved June 28, 1919) POTATO CULTURE IN NORTH DAKOTA By H. 0. WERNER University of Nebraska, formerly Extension Horticulturist, North Dakota Agricultural College The production of potatoes in North Dakota is rapidly assuming im - portance. The State has become known for the quality of seed that it </seg>
            <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 295 produces. Its climatic conditions are particularly favorable to the de - velopment of potatoes which are desiraole for table use and for seed. The acreage in the State has increased from year to year and increasingly large quantities of potatoes are sold from the State an - nually. If the industry, however, is to become permanent in the State it is important that from its beginning the best quality be produced and that potato diseases, which effect quality and yield, be controlled. The acreage of potatoes produced in the State has increased from 43,000 acres in 1911 to 189,000 in 1918. The average yield per acre for these years was 104 bushels as compared to average yields in Min - nesota of 106 and in Wisconsin of 101 bushels. The North Dakota potato producer has certain advantages over many other states in the production of a superior quality of potatoes suitable for seed in the south or as table potatoes of high quality. Soil for Growing Potatoes The most ideal soil for potatoes is one that is deep, rich, mellow and well drained, but still well supplied with moisture. In sections with rather low rainfall the medium heavy soils should give the best results. A soil that bakes and becomes hard after a rain is not desirable for potatoes. Soils naturally not ideal for growing potatoes may be •im - proved by cultural methods. The character of the soil, however, is generally of less importance than the soil preparation and cultivation. Potatoes in the Crop Rotation As most potato diseases live over in the soil, potatoes should always be grown in rotation so that three of four years may elapse between potato crops on the same land. The cultivation necessary to produce a crop of potatoes eliminates many weeds and leaves the soil in a much improved condition. In a rotation at the North Dakota Experiment Station, consisting of one crop of potatoes followed by three crops of wheat, continuing for 12 years, the wheat yield averaged nearly four bushels more per acre than on the plots continually planted to wheat. The yield of grain following a crop of potatoes is generally as good as the yield following the best summer-fallow in even the most adverse seasn. This fact is shown in Table I containing data from the crop rotation plots of the North Dakota Experiment Station. Table 1— Yield of Wheat after Potatoes, Wheat and Summer-Fallow Average yield of wheat 'ollowing wheat _ 'ollowing potatoes ! 'ollowing summer-fallow — per acre (3 years 17.69 bu. 21.55 bu. _ 20.74 bu. </seg>
            <seg id="p296">296 FIFTIETH ANNUAL REPORT Local conditions will determine what rotation is best. A rotation that works out well is as follows: Small grain, 2 years; clover, 1 year; potatoes or corn, 1 year. A good stand of clover or alfalfa plowed under is usually found to be favorable for potato production, be - cause it increases the human content and improves the physical con - dition of the soil. The Use of Manure The yield of potatoes can be increased by the application of well rotted manure. However, the manure should be applied to the crop pre - ceding potatoes in the rotation, as its direct application may increase the amount of common scab. At the Langdon Sub-Station in 1914, 10 loads of manure per acre increased the yield from 108 to 141% bushels. In regular farm practice the application of well rotted manure increases the yield from 25 to 100 per cent. At the North Dakota Experiment Station in 1918 the yield was increased in all plots, ranging from 9% to 124 bushels per acre, depending upon the variety and cultural methods. Manure was applied at the rate of 20 loads per acre. Soil Preparation K is necessary that the soil be thoroughly prepared before the potatoes are planted. This means that it should be plowed to a depth of 6 to 10 inches. However, it is not advisable to go more than 2 inches below V e bottom of the old furrow in one year. Fall plowing is generally con - sidered better than spring plowing, except of course, on land that is liable to blow. The fall plowed land should be worked up well with a </seg>
