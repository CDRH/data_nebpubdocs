         <seg id="p005">REPORT OF STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION The purpose of this 37th Biennial Report is to provide information as to the school systems of Nebraska. The selection of subjects follows requirements of the law. A review of the previous reports shows that many problems persist. The effort to promote the solution of these prob - lems i can best be viewed as the problems arise. I am happy to pay tribute to members of the teaching profession for their devotion to youth and to ; the country. The ability to carry on in the adverse circumstances of recent years is abundant evidence of high professional spirit. The parents and taxpayers sacrifice for the education of youth these days. It must be said that no other generation has ever sensed so fully the requirements of preparation for the future. Loyalty to. the public schools is loyalty to the children of Nebraska. In the performance of obligations, to posterity and to the country our people will carry on in the present as in the past. The immediate requirement is to search out the truth of conditions as they are and to make pro - vision for the citizenship of our State and Nation. ¦¦¦;• Salaries and Wages, Biennium 1943-46 I request for the salaries and wages fund $30,880.00.

         <seg id="p010">DIVISION OF SECONDARY EDUCATION AND TEACHER TRAINING F. E. Bowers, Director of Secondary Education and Teacher Training L A. Wiemers, Assistant Director Mrs. Edna H. Jackson, Supervisor, Approved High Schools Introduction The responsibilities of the Division of Secondary Education are: (a) ,he inspection of high schools for the purpose of recommending accredit - ment hy the University of Nebraska and of approval by the State Depart - ment of Public Instruction, (b) the rendering of all possible assistance in the solution of the problems of these schools and (c) the direction of the high school normal training program in accordance with the laws, and the regulations pertaining thereto as set up by the State= Department. In this work we have the cooperation of the University of Nebraska, the county superintendents and all divisions of the State Department of Public Instruction. Observations of the work done in the high schools of the state lead 10 the conclusion that the teachers and administrators are on the whole, progressive and eager to serve their communities in accordance with best educational practice. Several circumstances hamper them in the attain - ment of these desires. First, military necessity has taken many of our splendid teachers out of the field of education. This, combined with the rather inadequate salaries still prevalent, has resulted in the assignment of too many and too large classes. This oftentimes means that teachers do not have time for adequate preparation or for the guidance of in - dividual pupils. One of the outstanding educational needs at the present time is a careful study and evaluation of the educational program m each community to determine its efficiency in serving the community., state and nation. The responsibility for curriculum revision for secondary schools in Nebraska was placed by the Legislature of 1939 upon the Department of Public Instruction. At that time, a fund of $7,500.00 was appropriated for the issuing of a new High School Manual, such fund to be subdivided as follows: Services and Expense of Curriculum Expert, not to exceed...53,500.00 Consultations with Committees of High School Teachers, Prm - cipals, Superintendents and Patrons, not to exceed 3,50 U.«« Printing, not to exceed The work accomplished during the first two years of the program is a matter of record, and is to be found in the Th,rty-S«th Biennial 10 </seg>
         <seg id="p011">Report of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction covering the period from January 1, 1939, to January 1, 1941. During that period, four bulletins were printed by the Nebraska High School Improvement Pro - gram. These bulletins were: j.

'.. -.;\' ¦¦... In addition to preparation and printing of bulletins, meetings were held by a large committee of delegates representing the agencies sharing in the direction of the program. These agencies were: University of Nebraska . State Teachers Colleges Church Related Colleges - High Schools County Superintendents Association. Omaha Municipal University Vocational Education Department : State School Boards Association Nebraska Congress of Parents and Teachers During April and May of 1941, about twenty-seven members of fac - ulties of institutions of higher learning and public schools conducted dis - cussions in sixteen centers in various parts of the state at which the work of the Improvement Program was explained to schoolmen of the various areas. Their reactions to the program and suggestions as to how it might be most helpful were secured. The various bulletins thus far prepared and their uses served as discussion material. Local curriculum problems received extensive consideration. ; During the summer of 1941, a committee, working in the Workshop of the University of Nebraska under the sponsorship of the High School Improvement Program, developed materials for a bulletin on aviation. The Nebraska Aeronautics Commission volunteered to bear the expense of printing the bulletin. As a result, Bulletin No. 5, "Aviation, in High Schools," was published and made available to the high schools in the fall of 1941, Largely as a result of this and previous work by the High School Improvement Program, Nebraska has been recognized by the federal government as a pioneer among the states in the teaching of aviation on the secondary level. - -I.| -: ' :;- ¦;¦'..-¦ - :;¦••;¦ &#132;. • ¦.- -- ¦ . ..'

         <seg id="p012">ployed as full-time director of the program. Committees were organized in various fields to prepare materials to be submitted to the schools. In response to the request of the U. S. Office of Education, committees prepared three bulletins designed to meet war needs. Lack of time . prevented these bulletins from being submitted to the General Committee before printing. The bulletins were: Bulletin Xo. s—Aviation5 —Aviation in High School (Revised) Bulletin Xo. 6—Physics and Mathematics Bulletin Xo. 7—lndustrial Arts in High School In addition, the following bulletins were submitted in mimeographed f.&gt;rm to the General Committee in December, 1942: Bulletin Xo. B—Health8 —Health and Physical Education Bulletin Xo. 9—Professional Discussional Materials Bulletin No. 10—Social Studies Bulletin No. 11—English, Speech and Journalism A committee is at work preparing material f6r a bulletin on com - mercial arts which will be presented at an early date. Bulletins on bio - logical science, general science, music, chemistry, home economics, and possibly languages, will probably be prepared during the coming bien - ninm. Xecessary revisions of materials already published will be made. High School Inspection and Accreditment A complete discussion of the various phases of high school inspec - tion would require far more space than can be allotted to this report and would, no doubt, prove burdensome to readers. At best, only a brief -urvey of some of the more interesting aspects, objectives and purposes, as carried on by the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, can be given. Authority for this work is vested by law in the office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction. It has a three-fold purpose - namely. (1) the determination of high school accreditment as finally recognized by the University authorities, (2) the determination of ap - proval to receive not only state apportionments but to receive state aid in connection with the program of high school normal training, and (3) through consultation with teachers and school administrators to present practical suggestions and recommendations for the general improve - ment of the educational facilities in a particular community. The determination of high school accreditment is primarily the re - sponsibility of the University authorities but, by agreement of that in - stitution and this office, it was concluded that the reports of this depart - ment would be accepted by the University. This was done to avoid the -erious duplication of effort that prevailed under the old plan. This ar - rangement has prevailed for several years and has proven very satis - factory. The University has set up certain standards of accreditment for the 12 </seg>
         <seg id="p013">high j school inspector to use in determining the evaluation of the schools visited as well as serving as a guide to school authorities in planning the organization of their curricula.

Unless a graduate of an accredited school, a candidate for ad - mission must be prepared to take examinations in those subjects in which entrance credits are desired, except that graduates of non-accredited four - year high schools may be excused from taking the academic examinations by passing an intelligence test with a standing that shows ability to do the work of a college freshman., .

Schools desiring to organize on other than the 8-4 or the 6-3-3 plan shall submit in advance such details of organization as will clearly indicate the local needs and the attendant reasons for the change. Such j schools will be considered special cases, and will be subject to ac - creditment on their merits. ¦ ¦:¦ Under this provision, some five- and six-year high schools with three teachers have been approved as fully accredited schools. 3. The minimum preparation of all teachers new to the school in four-year high schools and in grades 10 to 12 inclusive in schools or - ganized on any other plan authorized by Standard 2 to be a baccalaureate degree. This shall not apply to teachers, recognized on September 1, 1929, as having the equivalent of 120 college hours, to superintendents qualified on September 1, 1931, or to members of the instructional staff teaching in Nebraska accredited high schools in 1937-38.

In interpreting this standard 15 college hours in the field will be recognized as adequate preparation, pro - viding it includes college preparation in the specific subject taught, a year for subjects carried for two semesters in the high school and a semester for subjects carried for but one semester in the high school. Deduction from the 15 college hours may be allowed to the extent of two semester hours a unit, except in English, science, and social studies, for approved high school work not to exceed a total of 6 semester hours. Each basis of qualification shall include at least one college course of three hours or more. A minimum of 15 college hours, with the deductions as indicated for approved high school work in certain fields, will meet the standard as acceptable preparation in English, any foreign language, mathematics, science, and social studies. The following special fields require 12 hours, with deductions for approved high school work as above. la) Commercial arts should include at least two college courses in each subject taught, one of which may be a course in special methods of teaching commercial subjects. The minimum prepara - tion in typewriting is four semester hours; in shorthand, eight semester hours; in bookkeeping, four semester hours; in social business (business law, economic geography, general business) six semester hours. (b) Industrial arts should include bench woodwork and wood finish - ing, operation and care of woodworking machines, wood turning, architectural drafting or mechanical drawing, and home mechanics or any of the commonly taught industrial arts subjects. (c) Representative art should include representation, decorative art, art appreciation, and art history. (rl) Music should include music methods, voice, harmony, and orches - tra or band.

The law further provides that the county board of supervisors y or commissioners shall exclude from the county free high school tuition levy "all the actual valuation of all taxable property of any | district in which is maintained an approved four-year high school." Actual valuation of all taxable property of any district shall be excluded from the county free high school tuition levy in proportion to the number 15 </seg>
         <seg id="p016">of years tor which the high school maintained in the district is approved The approved non-accredited high schools were organized in rural and village schools where only one or two years of high school work was i,tiered Later some of these were extended to include the third and fourth years of high school work. A few schools which have been ac - credited have not been able to so continue because of having no twelfth grade students. Standards for approved non-accredited high schools have been de - termined in accordance with state law requirements. The work has been supervised for the purpose of assuring the proper training for high school students. Total Number of Approved Non-Accredited High Schools Compiled reports show a gradual decrease in the number of approved non-accredited high schools in Nebraska. This is due to various causes. The decrease in population, improved facilities for transportation, and a desire to send pupils to a school which can offer a more extensive cur - riculum are no doubt the most pertinent factors in the decrease in num - ber Due to the present teacher shortage in Nebraska, a few boards of education have found it necessary either to close their approved high schools or to contract for similar services with nearby schools.

The normal training course is vocational. It is very doubtful whether any other course offered in the high.schools of Nebraska pre - pares as many of its graduates to go directly into positions where the&gt; are able to earn their living. • v ; : " .. | The Pre-Professional Phase of Normal Training The normal training course has another value which our high schools are coming to recognize more fully—and this is what may be called the pre-professional phase. In short, the course becomes a college preparatory course for young men and women who plan to go on to institutions of higher learning and later enter the teaching profession. Evidence at hand seems to indicate that the normal training course is superior to any other 17 </seg>

DIVISION OF RURAL AND ELEMENTARY EDUCATION Chloe C. Baldridye, Director of Rural and Elementary Education This division is cognizant that its report of progress is due to the -plcndid cooperation of the teachers, parents, school officers, and county superintendents, all working together with this department for the best interests of the boys and girls of Nebraska. The problems, objectives, and achievements of the rural school are of vital interest to all citizens ni Nebraska. The elementary school, rural and urban, furnishes the basic education for practically all children. All the efforts and activities of the Division of Rural and Ele - mentary Education have been devoted to the improvement of instruction, supervision, and the school environment. Special help has been given in the iormulating and developing of county-wide and local progressive school programs for the best educational interests of each child. Teachers, pupils, parents, school officers and administrators have been called upon to mobilize their efforts so that schools make the maximum contribution in the war emergency and to the peace to follow. The continual im - provement of the school program of education is the first responsibility of school people. Schools have accepted added responsibilities and devoted time and effort to war activities in accordance with the national need. We have had cheerful and wholehearted participation in school and war activities by all school people of Nebraska. As in other states, the work of the Director of Rural and Elementary Education in Nebraska is concerned with the promotion of the state program of rural and elementary education, the supervision of instruction, and research. Professional leadership stimulates professional growth; it results in new ideas, inspiration, and higher professional ideals of service to teachers. Professional growth and increased efficiency is promoted - through classroom visitation, commendation, constructive individual criti - cism, classroom demonstrations, testing programs, standards of achieve - ment, individual instruction, contests and exhibits, teachers' meetings and institutes, school demonstration days and patrons' days, the issuance of circulars and bulletins, and emphasis on teaching units, projects, and ac - tivities. The field work consists of school visitation; personal confer - ences with teachers, superintendents, parents, and students; and educa - tional addresses. During the biennium, the Director of Rural and Ele - mentary Education has given 125 addresses at county, district, regional, and other meetings. 18 </seg>
         <seg id="p019">The office work of the Division has included the preparation of the Wartime Education Supplement, "Looking Forward," which supplements the 1940 edition of "Rural Education Moving Forward," a manual for the teachers; issuance of certificates of membership in the State Rural School Chorus; mimeographed bulletins; issuance of recognition certifi - cates for better rural school teaching; recognition of standard and super - ior rural schools; preparation of eighth grade examination questions; rural and elementary school correspondence; of conferences with parents, teachers, school officers, other taxpayers, and pupils. The work of this division cannot be measured merely in terms of sta:istical data concerning buildings and grounds, libraries, equipment, and personnel. It aims to realize with the cooperation of the home, the school, and the church the richest dividends for the Nebraska boys and girls, dividends in achieving permanent interests in good reading, in the development of good habits of st"dy, in the appreciation of good music, a knowledge of the duties and the opportunities of a citizen of the United States and an appreciation of loyalty to pur great nation. . In order to realize improved educational programs in all Nebraska cot nties, the following reports summarize, in part, the major achieve - ments, activities, and problems of this division. Annual State Conferences of County Superintendents Each year, a two-day conference program presents the state educa - tional program to the county superintendents. A meeting of the County Superintendents' Association is held during the same week. The theme for the 1941 conference was '"The Education of Youth is the First Line of Defense." The theme for the 1942 educational working conference was '"Nebraska Schools for Service of America." . • Advisory Committees of County Superintendents have been active in the work of the state program. During the biennium the following ad - visory committees have worked with this : division and have made signifi - cant contributions on the following problems; (1) Reports of Pupil Progress to Parents; (2) State Fair.Premium List; (3) Good Practices in the Supervision of Reading; (4) Good Practices in Visual Education; (5) Good Practices in Teachers' Meetings; (6) Good Practices in Co - operative Efforts for School Improvement; (7) Good Practices in Test - ing. .' :V '¦ ¦:¦[.:.'¦:,'. : ; ;:'''¦'¦ : '¦" ' ¦ ' ¦-.¦;:•''.'¦ • Recognition should be given to the examination committees of the County Superintendents' Association for the fine cooperative work in the preparation of tests for the first six grades in social science, science, and arithmetic based on the Nebraska Elementary Course of Study. It is recommended that these annual working conferences be or - ganized in cooperation with" teachers' colleges so- that follow-up work 19 </seg>
         <seg id="p020">can he arranged and assigned and college credit earned as was done in 1U33 and l'J26 at Peru State Teachers College and at Chadron State Teachers College. Schools Serving in War Activities An example of effective war work done by the schools was the Sugar Registration Program. Mr. Henderson, OPA Administrator, wired Mr. Mcl-adden of the State Rationing Office and expressed his gratitude to she schools mr a great work well done. The Sugar Registration -was -.. well done that Gas and Tire Registration was also assigned to the schools. The Junior Red Cross provides many opportunities for usefulness, i )m- of the best ways to avoid emotional strain in time of war is to have wiry pupil engaged in useful work. Junior Red Cross definitely fur - tlu-rs the educational aims and procedures suggested in the Nebraska Elementary Course of Study. Probably all schools have been enrolled in Junior Red Cross work and Junior Commandos during the present school year. What are Nebraska boys and girls doing and what have they done? They have collected scrap iron, rubber, and paper. They have prepared place cards, favors, scrap books, writing portfolios, games, atghans, and all kinds of articles that contribute to the comfort and pleasure of the veterans and soldiers in hospitals. Their program is liroad. comprehensive, and educational. The schools are also emphasizing First Aid. In some counties there are classes for the rural teachers. The First Aid Program is vital. It is especially important at this time, since so many of our doctors and nurses have been called to the armed forces. A recent safety conference concluded, "An accident in wartime is a national disaster since doctors' and nurses' services are so valuable." Even in wartime, every child should be guaranteed the right of se - curity and opportunity for growth and development. Taking part in the conservation of essential materials, defense savings, and Junior Red Cross or Junior Commando Activities have a real value in the total national ufort, r.i.-i" give students an opportunity to do their part in certain war - time undertakings. All town and rural schools are promoting a War Saving Stamp and Bond campaign. Teachers are teaching thrift, the saving of paper, pencils, books, toys, and clothing. Schools have re - sponded 100 per cent in the Salvage Drive. One little, rural district in Dodge County, for example, District 27, with eight pupils enrolled, sal - vaged 37 tons of scrap.

         <seg id="p021">ers cooperate and when the community is working in harmony with the school? Our schools are what our communities want them to be. Our ex - perience in Nebraska indicates that time spent in developing the proper type of community pays in the end in growth, satisfaction, and per - manence. We have reached the point, indeed, where we wonder if there is anything too great to be undertaken when parents and .teachers co - operate, and when the community at large is working in harmony with the schools. Teachers in rural communities have great opportunities to draw com - munity organizations in as helpers. The best way of doing this is to teach a good school, meanwhile surveying the needs of the community an! gradually interesting community leaders in plans for improvement. What We Have Done Our c forts for school improvement are currently carried on under many different auspices, among them the following well-organized groups: (lj Local parent-teacher associations; (2) County councils of parent - teacher associations and the advisory council of rural education in Nc - bnska; (3) County school officers' associations. .•;¦¦, On a more informal basis we have taken great steps forward by enlisting the aid of parents and of a wide range of community or - ganizations and service clubs. : ¦ • As we reflect on the work being done in Nebraska's rural'communi - ties a &lt; few. of-many, types of community cooperation stand out as possibly suggestive of lines of approach in other places. Knowing that good books can be an important factor in the character - development ofi young people, service organizations have helped to en - rich libraries by collecting books and magazines for the schools and by promoting Book Week annually. .. Chambers of commerce, Kiwanis, Rotarians, Lions, and many other clubs in counties throughout the state have sponsored and cooperated in fall- festivals, children's clubs, Christmas Caroling, music and reading contests, rural field day, county junior fair play-day for rural and town children, and May festivals. One town gave, a Hallowe'en. show for all of ihe boys and girls in the surrounding districts. •; . \ The Dawes County Junior Red Cross sees to it that children re - ceive needed eye, ear, and throat treatment. In this Work physicians and den ists have contributed much time and treatment at small cost. Many other organizations have cooperated in health programs which have included immunization, vaccination, sanitation, nutrition, corrective 21 </seg>
         <seg id="p022">treatment for eyes, teeth, tonsils, etc Fire departments have given dem - onstrations of resuscitation and first aid, and have sponsored fire drills ami jingle contests. Hot lunch equipment and equipment for school - rooms and playgrounds have been provided by parent-teacher associations, lianquets featuring helpful programs for county school officers have been given by chambers of commerce in a few counties. Members of patriotic organizations have given talks during Constitution Week, and have spon - sored young-citizen contests and citizen-day programs. Tree planting on M-hool grounds has been encouraged by all organizations. Isaac Walton 1 .vague* have cooperated with schools in providing feed for birds and wild life during winter months. Local high schools have held open house and extended other cour - usies for eighth-grade students at the close of eighth-grade examina - tions In order to give to boys and girls the educational advantages which they should have, we must have a strong spirit of cooperation and har - mony. The spirit of cooperation and neighborliness best finds expres - sion and opportunity for growth when patrons come together; the use of the school as a recreation center for parent-teacher associations and community organizations offers great possibilities for bringing the school ;iml community together. School Officers' Conventions. V county school hoard association is one of the very best agencies for developing an active interest in the improvement of school conditions throughout the county and for inspir - ing a more united and cooperative program of work. School board mem - bers may become better informed as to the needs of the school, educa - tional progress and policies, plans for modern school buildings, and financing of schools through school officers' association meetings. Some states require county school officers' meetings by law. During the Biennium, School Officers' Meetings were reported in the following counties: Adams, Buffalo, Butler, Clay, Custer, Dawson, Deuel. Dixon, Dodge. Douglas, Fillmore, Garfield, Gosper, Hamilton, Howard. Kimball, Lincoln, Madison, Merrick, Nance, Otoe, Phelps, Pierce, I'olk. Sarpy. Saunders. Sheridan, Sherman, Thayer, Washington, and V..rk. Parent-Teacher Association. According to the reports received, there are 1028 Parent-Teacher Associations or community organizations co - operating with the rural schools. For helps in organizing a Parent-Teacher Association, for suggestions for maintaining interest, for basic program discussion material, and for themes for programs, see pages 143-212, "lU4O Rural Education Moving Forward." Patrons' Day. Patrons' Day or Go-To-School Day was observed in 2.266 rural school districts. Additional reports show that 101 elementary 22 </seg>

Knighthooa of Ybuth Clubs were organized in 3,200 rural schools last year. Refer to the Knighthood of Youth Club guide). All counties are carrying on this work. The following counties report organization of Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts: Antelope, Cass," Cedar Cheyenne, Clay, Colfax, Ciister, Dawes, Deuel, Dixon, Fillmore, Franklin Gage,] Garden, Greeley, Hall, Keith, Knox; Lancaster, Logan, Nemaha! Pawnee, Platte, Rock, Sarpy, Saunders, Scottsbluff, Seward, Sheridan, Sherman, Sioux, Thayer, Thomas, Wayne, and Lincoln. Reverence of State and National Constitutions. Reverence of State and Rational Constitutions was taught in 4,378 rural districts last year. Teachers from 4,700 rural districts reported that the Flag salute was given regularly. Junior Red Cross. Teachers in 2184 rural districts reported Junior Red Cross Units last year. . Health and Safety Education in Wartime Safety. Each year, Nebraska schools begin the study of safety during the m|&gt;nth of. September. Safety on the street and highway, in the home and at school, at play, on the farm, and fire prevention are presented through safety activities. Pupil progress in safety should be judged by fewer I street and highway accidents, fewer accidents at home, at school, on the farm, and greater interest in fire prevention. Last year, 4,959 rural teachers and elementary teachers in the towns reported that they had taught safety and fire prevention. It is interesting to note that 1,566 storm caves were reported. . ¦'.•'. Hpt Lunches. For; many years the rural school teachers have had hot lunches during the winter months. Hot lunches were served in 2,693 elementary schools in rural districts last year. Nutrition has been taught in all :schools since 1929, and is emphasized as a wartime measure at this time. ' ¦'¦: ... -'. \v v. ;: ; .-¦¦..

Standard Rural Schools in Nebraska Standard Schools have met certain requirements that have been established for the best educational interests of and healthful environ - ment for the boys and girls. Many of the schools that formerly met all requirements have not maintained all standards. For example, many nf the outbuildings, recently erected, do not have the board shields in front of the doors and are not the required distance apart in accord - ance with the law. Those districts listed as pending have reported that the&gt; have not completely maintained all standards, due in many instances to the recent conditions. We trust that they may be back on the list of Standard Schools in a few months. A school has been omitted from the list if the Standard School re - port has not been re-checked during the past two years.

Putney, Lincoln; Sidney Owen, Lincoln, Director. Total Number of Employees: 105 (Including National Defense and State Trade School employees). Appropriation, 1941-1943: $1,901,700.06 (National Defense allotments es - timated). (From State appropriations and allotments from Federal Acts, including Smith-Hughes, George Deen, Smith-Bankhead, and National Defense Public Laws' Numbers 812, 146, 463, and 647.), Publications : Biennial Report; also occasional bulletins whenever neces - sary concerning some new phases of the Vocational Training Program. Act of Congress, known as the Smith-Hughes Act, approved February 23, 1917, was the dccasion of the creation of this board by the Nebraska Legislature, then in session. The purpose of the Act is to provide for promoting vocational education, and for cooperation with the states in such promotion, and in preparing teachers in vocational subjects. Vocational education means training for the common wage - earning employments, and for a useful, productive life. No academic subject can have support from Smith-Hughes or George-Deen Funds. They are solely for paying teachers' salaries and for training teachers. After the passage of the Smith-Hughes Act, Congress passed sev - eral supplemental acts. In 1929, the George-Reed Act added funds for agricultural and home-economics education. Still later, the George- Ellzey Act superseded the George-Reed Act. On July 1, 1937, the George- Deen Act superseded the George-Ellzey Act, making larger appropria - tions to carry on an expanded program, including training in the dis - tributive occupations. The board began its work January 1, 1918. The department is housed in the capital. M&amp;ny schools within the state have had the bene - fit of the cooperation of the board, and of the funds it administers. A legislative act authorized the school board of any public school, in co - operation with the State Board for Vocational Education, to establish vocational schools, departments or classes in agricultural, trade, or in - dustrial branches, or in home economics. The schools may be all-day schools, part-time schools, or evening schools. '¦¦-¦• In 1921, the Nebraska Legislature accepted the provisions of a new act 6J Congress for re-training men and women disabled by accident, in - jury, or disease, in industry or on farms, or otherwise, and restoring their capacity to earn a livelihood. The aim of the act is to help people 29 </seg>
         <seg id="p030">help themselves, to assist disabled persons to become readjusted to other occupations in which they may be self-supporting and self-respecting citi - zens, rather than recipients of public or private charity. Early in March, 1941, the Nebraska Legislature transferred title to the Soldiers and Sailors Home at Milford from the Board of Control - of state institutions to the State Board of Vocational Education, for the purpose of establishing the Nebraska State Trade School. The objective of the school "shall be to afford the inhabitants of this state the means of acquiring skills and related technical knowledge, other than that taught at college level, by training methods necessary to prepare them for advantageous entrance and satisfactory advancement in trade and industrial occupations." In June. IU4O, Congress made the first appropriations for National Defense Training Fund. A series of subsequent acts has been passed liy Congress for the same purpose. These funds were appropriated to provide training for workers in occupations designated by the War Pro - duction Board as essential to National Defense for the War Production effort. No specific allotments from these funds are made to the states on any population or pro-rata basis. The allotments to the states from these funds are on the basis of budgetary requests submitted by the states as they are able to develop classes to fill the needs for workers in the War Production plants and for workers engaged in the production of essential farm commodities. The funds are advanced to the states as they are able to make use of them in the designated categories. In view of these facts, that portion of the defense funds for the last half of the second year of the biennium (January 1, to June 30, 1943) is based on estimates.

         <seg id="p032">CHARACTER EDUCATION Edna H. Jackson, Supervisor In time of national crisis, our schools will give increased attention to character education. The very existence of a democracy is dependent upon the loyalty, honesty, and integrity of a free people. Education for citizenship necessarily involves education for living with others. The good citizen recognizes duties and responsibilities, as well as rights and privileges. He is willing to do his best. We have made continued effort to help teachers direct their teaching so that character education will be adequately emphasized. We have given suggestions for directing activi - ties that should help in forming desirable habits, attitudes, and under - standings. All of these will aid in the moral and spiritual defense so necessary to everyone in troubled times and in times of peace. There is wide discussion about winning the peace. Boys and girls who are now in the classrooms must maintain that peace if we are to have a world free from strife. Unity, understandings, appreciation of the rights of others, a firm belief in a Divine Power that guides the destinies of human beings everywhere do not "just happen." Careful teaching while children are young is fundamental to facing realties and to necessary adjustments. Character education is the responsibility of all who participate in education. It is not confined to one place or to one institution. Narcotic Education The law requires that pupils in all schools supported by public money or tinder state control shall be instructed in the harmful effects of al - i-ohnlic beverages and other narcotics. We have completely revised the bulletin on narcotic education and have made it available to the schools of the state. It contains unbiased facts based on scientific investigation and authentic reports. The in - struction may be integrated with the regular school curriculum and be - come a part of courses in health, science, social science, safety, economics and human relations. Narcotic education is particularly important at a time when accuracy, speed, alertness, endurance, and correct judgment are vital to the safety and welfare of a nation. To take that which weakens the body, retards judgment and impairs efficiency is foolish. To do so at a time when sr&gt; doing may weaken our defense and add to the danger in hazardous situa - tions is not patriotic. Local authorities and teachers must make greater effort to train young people to do serious thinking and make wise decisions. Educators have 32 </seg>
         <seg id="p033">a serious problem in offsetting skilled advertising and false propaganda. Society cannot afford merely to legislate in regard to proper train - ing and education. The local community must cooperate with local school authorities and with teachers. The home must accept heavy responsi - bility! In this, as in other learning, example is a powerful factor. I ' ¦'.

         <seg id="p034">BUREAU OF EDUCATION AND REGISTRATION FOR NURSES The Bureau of Education and Registration for Nurses is maintained entirely through fees paid by registered nurses and student nurses in accredited schools of nursing who are preparing for registration by ex - amination. No other income is provided for the support of the Bureau. The legislature in 1941 reduced the annual re-registration fee to one dollar ($1.00). This was done in compliance with the wishes of the rha - jurity of registered nurses after a referendum vote on the reduction of the annual re-registration fee had been conducted by the Bureau. Under ordinary circumstances, this measure would have resulted in a reduction of income for the maintenance of the Bureau, but due to the present war situation, more inactive nurses have returned to active practice. They have been reinstated through payment of fees for which they were in arrears for several years. Other nurses who had been assigned to non - practice (temporary retirement) have returned to active service through payment of the re-registration fee of one dollar for the current year. By law the bureau is required to remit fifteen percent (15%) ol all fees received to the state treasury. To date during this biennium the state treasurer has collected $1905.60. Owing to the unsettled conditions of the war situation, the funds of the bureau should be carefully safe - guarded to insure its maintenance and to avoid problems which arose after World War I. When an increased number of nurses request to be assigned to non-practice (either because of leaving the state or due to unemployment), the income of the bureau is reduced as no fees are required from those who, at their own request, are assigned to non-prac - tice. It is commendable that the registered nurses themselves, through their own efforts, maintain the bureau. Otherwise it would be necessary for the state to provide a constant source of properly prepared nurses through accredited schools of nursing in Nebraska, and to protect the people against those who are unqualified because of inadequate prepara - tion. The purpose of licensure or registration of nurses is the sanie as for the licensure of physicians, dentists, pharmacists, and the certifica - tion of teachers —to protect the public against incompetence in those professional services. Education of Nurses Under a State System of Education Probably the most important function of the bureau is in the field of education. It is concerned primarily with methods and the process of education in accredited schools of nursing, and with the preparation that graduate nurses from other states have had who seek registration in 34 </seg>
         <seg id="p035">this state. It surveys all accredited schools of nursing in Nebraska for datajto be used as a basis for their accreditment each year. It arranges for and conducts state examinations for the graduates of these schools. Through definitely established legal requirements, the bureau also pro - tects! the interest of young women who enter the accredited schools of nursing in Nebraska so that they 'will receive preparation according to acceptable standards of nursing education. Therefore, schools of nursing belong under a state system of education such as has been provided for the preparation in the professions of medicine, dentistry, pharmacy, teach - ing, etc., under the state university. ¦' Since 1935, the bureau has functioned under the State Department of Public Instruction. The State Superintendent of Public Instruction and members of his department have been exceedingly helpful in suggestions and | advice pertaining to educational matters in connection with our schools of nursing and in preparing for examinations and grading of papers.' .¦'" ' ¦ •". ' ¦" ..'¦¦¦. '- ••¦-¦' -.-.'. War-Born Efforts and Problems .•¦¦'¦ I - ¦¦ ¦¦¦' - ' '¦¦"' ¦ - '• r The demands on the bureau have increased greatly under: the present emergency. Routine duties have been delayed to give priority to requests from the American Red Cross, the different military nursing services, and especially to assist our own Nebraska registered nurses who wish to enroll for service by supplying the individual credentials as adequately and speedily as possible, Requests for information, reinstatement of registration, certified statements, records, etc., are overwhelming at times, and they come from all parts of the United States and even its territorial possessions. Nurses are transferred from place to place so rapidly that often our replies do not reach them, and complicated situations arise; also, | hours of work are involved in tracing out records of schools of nursing now out of existence. Questionnaires from various services and national organizations, and frequent changes of addresses which must be recorded, have increased greatly. If this situation continues, more as - sistance will be needed in the office of the bureau, and therefore a greater appropriation of our funds for the use of the bureau should be granted. In order to help relieve the nursing situation due to the war, it was decided at the annual meeting of the bureau in November, 1941, to con - duct a special examination for./ eligible nurses who graduated from ac - credited schools of nursing prior to 1930 and who have located here but liave never become licensed in this state. This was given in June, 1943. Those who have graduated since ; 1930 and who are eligible; may take the regular examinations, which are given three times each year. Another measure to accelerate the production of registered nurses here is one permitting senior student nurses who have completed their classroom workj in full, and who are within three months of completion of the prescribed course of three years, to take the state examinations for 35 </seg>
         <seg id="p036">nurses and not wait to do so until after they have graduated. The li - censes are withheld until they have received their diplomas and satisfactory grades have been received in the state examination. The members of the Division of Registration are to be commended for their arduous effort in grading examination papers so promptly in order to speed nurses on their way to the front. The bureau has collaborated with the National Nursing Council on Ik-tense in making a careful study of the present emergency situation and how to meet it as constructively as possible. It wishes to avoid hysterical haste and the mistakes made during the last war, which re - sulted in over production of poorly qualified nurses, and therefore wide - spread dissatisfaction and unemployment. The majority of registered nurses in Nebraska desire to retain present standards and qualifications fur Rood nursing service. In so doing, they are keeping apace with out - standing members of the nursing profession through the country, who keenly realize their heavy responsibilities for good service for the duration and afterward. We quote from a recent issuance by the Na - tional League of Nursing Education, members of which comprise the National \ursing Council for War Service: "The public must be assured of the best service. Now, as per - haps never before, it is essential to preserve all that has been gained through years of experience to see that the effort to make haste does not betray schools into turning out nurses unequal to the emer - gency. it is by maintaining high standards in nursing schools that we can attract the best type of student nurse. To weaken her prepara - tion at this moment is to invite disaster. It is the general public as well as the armed forces of the nation that will be affected by a shortage of good nurses." As with Boards of Nurse Examiners in many other states, demands and requests have been made by one or two groups of nurses with which our Board cannot always comply legally, and the office of the Attorney (leneral has been very helpful in interpreting the law govern - ing the activities of the bureau. Efforts are made to act as liberally as possible within the legal enactments under which we function. Members "i the bureau believe it advisable to adhere at least to the educational standards of the American Red Cross Nursing Service which is in greater need of nurses than any other organization in the nation; yet, it Still adheres to acceptable and safe standards. We quote from the American Journal of Nursing, June, 1942: "Requirements for enrollment in the Red ' Cross First reserve were reviewed and it was the consensus that it would not be -justi - fiable to accept standards for the nursing care of pur soldiers and sailors lower than those which have been generally recognized as 36 </seg>
         <seg id="p037">minimum for civilian nursing service. It was recommended that the present educational standards for enrollment in the Red Cross First Reserve be maintained." Greater exertion is necessary to use every means possible to supple - menj:]nursing service now available through: (1) Increased enrollment -¦¦'¦¦ of students in accredited schools of nursing: (2) Curtailment of "luxury special nursing" (registered nurse caring for only one patient) except in cases of very serious illness; (3) More widespread use of auxiliary . groups (Nurse Aides and others) under the supervision of registered nurses; (4) Return to active practice of more nurses who have been registered in Nebraska who have been retired; (5) Refresher courses . - for * graduate nurses given in some hospital or under the auspices of the Nebraska State Nurses' Association or the Nebraska League of Nursing . Education. Federal funds for Refresher Courses are now available under , the. United States Public Health Service; (6) Pooling of resources. We &#132;-.. quote Paul V. McNutt, chairman of the war manpower commission, No - vember 11, 1942: "The best way to meet the emergency would seem to be. to exercise some-control over the movement of physicians both into ...and put of civilian practice, plus more 'pooling 1 of medical services, hos - pital facilities, and nurses in the community." No mention is made of .' reducing standards of preparation or lowering of qualifications for those . to serve as registered nurses. :. 1 ) General Information of Accredited Schools of Nursing Since July 1, 1041, surveys have been made of all accredited schools of nursing in the state and reports on which the accreditment of schools .: is based have been presented to the bureau. At present there are thir - teen accredited schools of nursing in Nebraska. . A letter from the American Red Cross Nursing Service of June 3, : 3042, informs us that all of the accredited schools of nursing at present •¦ in Nebraska have been approved by that great organization for the de - velopment of a Student Reserve among senior students in these schools. This is not true of all accredited schools now in all states, neither have all schools in Nebraska.in the past been approved for enrollment of their graduates in the American * Red Cross Nursing Service; therefore, we are very appreciative of this recognition. The registered nurses of Ne - braska have endeavored long and faithfully to attain the standards of education and preparation established by the American Red Cross Nurs - ¦¦ ing Service. ¦;. . ':;¦ ::.-' \- -'!¦ -1 ' ..¦;.... ".-.,,¦¦¦. The total number of sti dents enrolled in Nebraska Schools of Nurs - ing on November 1, 1942, was 1120. Under the present emergency, a greater! increase in the em ollment of students is necessary. With so many activities for women under the military services and so many new fields of employment open to them, there is some apprehension that many 37 </seg>
         <seg id="p038">will be deflected from the field of nursing where they are needed so crcatl}. Present Regime in Schools of Nursing—The selection of students proceeds as heretofore, and it is generally recognized that the admission of poorly qualified applicants is costly to the institution and detrimental to the standing of the school of nursing. The program of health exam - inations for all student nurses is being maintained regularly. No out - standing improvement has been made in teaching equipment during the hiennium and the use of obsolete editions of textbooks has been prac - tically eliminated. The curriculum, established legally, is being followed closely During the past year more emphasis has been placed in the teaching program, on the Prevention of Disease and on a more effective coupe in Emergency and First Aid Nursing to prepare our nurses more adequately to meet present day needs. The ward teaching program is uraduallv improving and this depends largely on the qualifications and preparation of the supervisors appointed as faculty members. Still needed throughout the state are better facilities for teaching pediatnc nursing \n excellent affiliative course in Psychiatric Nursing is being conducted at Hastings State Hospital, and eight schools are offering this course to their students. licenses Issued by the Bureau from January, 1941, to January, : 15, reciprocity, 112; by examination, 561. Nurses Licensed for Active Service October 1, 1942, 3844; Nurses Assigned to non-practice October i. 1942, 2252. Total number of nurses licensed in Nebraska on October 1. 1942. was 5496. It is commendable that so many nurses, 223 in number, who have been inactive in their profession are again making their services available through becoming reinstated for active practice in the present emergency situation. \n increased enrollment now of qualified young women in our ac - credited schools of nursing is vital to meet most constructively our na - tion's military and civilian needs for professional nurses. 38 </seg>
