            <seg id="p007">LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL STATE OF NEBRASKA OFFICE OF THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION. * * * * * * Lincoln, Nebraska, April 12, 1927. Honorable Adam McMuIlen, Governor of Nebraska. Your Excellency : In conformity with the provisions of Section 5478 of the com - piled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, we have the honor to submit the Nineteenth Annual Report of the Nebraska State Railway Com - mission, covering the year ending December 31, 1926. The following is a resume of the filings and disposition of ap - plications and complaints and a statement of other items handled by the Commission. APPLICATIONS: During the past year there were filed with the Commission, 441 applications and there were 479 disposed of. This is the largest number of applications filed and the largest number disposed of during a like period since the establishment of the Commission. A survey of the applications filed and disposed of will be found on page 29 of this report. FORMAL COMPLAINTS: There were 18 formal complaints filed during the year and 31 disposed of. These formal complaints require formal plead - ings by the parties and are disposed of by hearing and written orders, as are the applications. An analysis of the formal complaints filed and disposed of will be found on page 27. INFORMAL COMPLAINTS: The written informal complaints amounted to 196 while 206 were disposed of. No account is made of the verbal informal com - plaints, a number of which are disposed of daily. An analysis of the informal complaints filed and disposed of will be found on page 28. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 8 RESOLUTIONS: k Three resolutions were entered, being investigations on the Com - on's own motion. Final orders were entered in eleven resolu - previously instituted. BONDS FOR BUS LINES: Liability bonds for 56 common carriers operating bus lines in this state were filed with the Commission. These bonds were re - quired by the Commission on its own motion and the companies carrying these risks have paid losses on account of accidents and injuries to the amount of $23,622.33. PUBLIC GRAIN WAREHOUSES: One hundred seventy-one licenses were issued to grain ware - houses during 1926. Bonds were checked, approved and filed for each. Weekly and monthly reports were received, checked and filed covering the operation of each warehouse. A list of the warehouses bonded and the amount of the bond will be found on page 44. ENGINEERING DEPARTMENT: There were issued during the year, 36 transmission line orders, 408 agent's tractor permits and 8 manufacturers' permits. Sixteen physical valuations were made by the engineering department of the Commission and 8 special investigations were conducted by that de - partment. References to these actions may be found in Part V of this report. SECURITIES: Thirty-nine applications were filed by the public service corpo - rations during 1926 requesting authority to issue securities under the Stocks and Bonds Act in the amount of $18,236,959.13. After earing and investigation the Commission authorized $16,764,409.13, ius reducing, for what appeared to be good and sufficient reason, the mount asked for by $1,472,550. The legislature in 1925 provided lat such applications be accompanied by a certain fee. Since this act became effective in 1925, $2,931.88 in fees has been collected &gt;y the Commission and placed in the general fund of the state. ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT: There are two hundred and one telephone companies reporting annually to the Commission, whose reports are audited and carefully checked by the accounting department. Of this number there are </seg>
            <seg id="p009">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 9 approximately sixty-five which report monthly. Monthly reports are required from companies which the Commission believes might be in need of further supervision from the accounting department in the matter of keeping accounts. These monthly reports are given the same careful audit and check as the annual reports, which has a tendency to improve the accounting practices of the companies. The accounting department made forty inspections during the past year for the purpose of supervising the accounting" work and to install accounting systems for the telephone companies. These inspections become necessary when secretaries resign or the organization is changed in some manner, which places unexperienced secretaries and bookkeepers in charge of the company. The reports filed with the Commission indicate the success which has followed the installation of the uniform system of account - ing. The reports in almost every instance reflect the true financial condition of the company and materially assist the Commission in reaching intelligent conclusions as to the needs of the company when faced with rate applications. Since the installation of the accounting system the Commission observes a decrease of 40 per cent in the number of complaints filed with it annually which may be attributed to the fact that the accounting system has enabled the companies to keep in closer touch with the financial side of their business, and to better perfect their management and service. At this time there are twenty-one light, power and gas com - panies, made up of the larger public utilities in this state, who re - port periodically to the Commission in compliance with orders writ - ten by the Commission in securities cases. These reports are audit - ed and checked by the accounting department for the purpose of de - termining whether or not the Commission's orders have been com - plied with. RATE DEPARTMENT Other activities of the Commission relate to the filing of tariffs. Over 12,000 tariffs and supplements alone were received and filed. The railway station records are kept up to the latest possible date and almost every day requests are made from interested parties from every part of the State of Nebraska for certain information as to shipments received or forwarded from stations in Nebraska. Rate quotations, miscellaneous exhibits and rate comparisons, are being given and made daily. The Commission furnishes a great number of rate quotations each month from phone requests, of which no record is made. Numerous written complaints were filed by various shippers throughout the state and the Commission has </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT been very successful in securing a large number of refunds and other adjustments. Many of these cases are taken up with the car - riers informally and a reasonable and satisfactory adjustment has been accomplished in almost every case. In passing it might be well to state that these requests oi* complaints do not all originate with people living within the state but are received from parties living in various surrounding states. The rate department is constantly preparing exhibits, either for the benefit of this Commission, or for preparation in cases to be heard by the Interstate Commerce Commission. This work necessitates a complete set of tariffs covering the movement of commodities from and to all parts of the United States. Tariffs are on file covering movements of various commodities to and from points in the South - western territory, the New England territory, Central Freight As - sociation territory, Pacific Coast territory, Western Trunk line ter - ritory, Trans-Missouri territory, Official Classification territory, Southern Classification territory and Western Classification ter - ritory. The Commission is in a position to quote rates to and from all portions of the country. The Commission has a complete set of tariffs covering the ex - press movements, tariffs showing all stations in the United States and their respective block numbers. Tariffs are on file in this office showing the telegraph rates to and from all points in the United States. The files of the Commission contain much valuable information that is available to the public, which information is furnished with - out charge. COMMISSION ACTION ON RAILROAD RATE MATTERS: As a result of the action of the Commission in connection with railroad rate matters brought to its attention by railroad companies or which it has reviewed on its own motion or on complaint during the year 1926, much benefit has been derived by the interested shippers. The following is a brief review of railroad rate cases, a more complete analysis being contained in Parts II and III. Application No. 5702, filed by all railroads operating in Ne - braska, requested authority to publish a rule providing for charges on cars of sand and gravel on a basis of 110 per cent of the mark - ed capacity of the car. Shippers of sand vigorously protested against the establishment of such a rule and several hearings were held in connection with the application. An order was issued ma - terially reducing the ultimate charges that would have accrued to the shippers of this commodity had they been forced to pay on the </seg>
            <seg id="p011">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 11 basis desired by the applicants. Several supplemental orders were issued in connection with this application, one of which promulgated the rule that where carriers were unable to weigh cars of sand or gravel for any reason, the minimum weight of a car should be found by estimating the cubic yards of sand or gravel contained in the car, the weight of 2,900 pounds to be applied on a cubic yard of sand and 3,000 pounds to a cubic yard of gravel. Application No. 6045, gave authority to the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. to publish switching rates on grain, hay and potatoes between Mitchell, Scottsbluff and Bayard, and the various beet dumps located near-by. This action created a material reduction of what the ship - pers would have been required to pay had class rates applied. In Application 6151, authority was granted the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. to reduce rates on canned goods between various points, which resulted in considerable saving to interested shippers. In Application No. 6177, the C. St. P. M. ft O. Ry Co. re - quested authority to reduce the rate on wheat and related pro - ducts on its line of railway. A very careful check of the proposed rates was made. The order granting the application resulted in a substantial reduction at numerous points. Application No. 6206 granted authority to the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. to publish a rate of 20 1-2 cents per cwt. on furniture and household refrigerators between Lincoln and Omaha and South Omaha, which action marks not only a material reduction in rates but will enable the shipper to compete with interstate traffic. During the year 1926, the Commission granted many appli - cations increasing milling in transit privileges in this state, which resulted in benefit to the shipper, miller and consumer. Nebraska is singularly fortunate in being granted these transit privileges, as they permit the millers to originate grain in one territory and move to another territory at the through rate, point of origin to destina - tion. Throughout the year numerous applications were filed for the publication of rates on sand and gravel from points located near the so-called Platte river points. These applications in the main, granted reductions and were authorized without formal hearings. Application No. 6233 was filed by the C. B. ft Q.. R R. Co. asking authority to publish a rate of $22 per standard car on horses, mules and asses when moving between Hastings and Grand Island, in order to meet the rate published by the St. J. ft G. I. Ry. Co. The order granting the application resulted in a material re - duction to interested shippers. Application No. 6251 filed on behalf of C. B. ft. Q. R. R. Co., </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT C. &amp;. N. W. Ry. Co. and U. P. R. R. Co. for authority to publish reduced rates on petroleum and its products, was found to be in line with other applications which the Commission had granted. The application was granted and a considerable saving to shippers is the result. Application No. 6258 granted authority to the American Rail - way Express Co. to increase the estimated weights on shipments of ice cream. Very little opposition developed against the grant - ing of this application after it was clearly established that the actual weight of ice cream shipments are larger than the estimated weight. In Application No. 6262, the Union Pacific Railroad Co. re - quested authority to reduce rates on live stock from Nantasket to Omaha to meet cross-country competition of the C. 6. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. at Ravenna. On investigation it was established that this ap - plication would materially reduce live stock rates. Order was issued granting the application. Application No. 6287 granted authority to the U. P. R. R. Co. and St. J. &amp;. G. I. Ry. Co. to establish less than carload joint rates on petroleum and its products. This order established a very ma - terial reduction of rates affecting less than carload shipments mov - ing between points on these lines. • Application No. 6296 was filed by the U. P. R. R. Co. re - questing authority to reduce its rates on carload shipments of lumber between Lincoln and points on its North Platte branch. As this application would mean a substantial reduction of rates, it was granted by the Commission. In order to meet competition of the U. P. R. R. Co. at Toohey, the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. filed an application seeking a reduction on potato rates from Toohey to Kearney. This appli - cation was granted by the Commission without question, as it will serve greatly to reduce rates on this product. Throughout the year the Commission has considered numerous applications concerning stopping in transit to finish loading of live poultry, eggs etc. In every instance the applications meant a ma - terial reduction, and they were consequently granted without formal hearings. An unusual subject in this territory was covered by Application No. 6372. The C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. asked authority to establish trap car service between South Omaha and Omaha and for the move - ment of packing house products and fresh meats. This application was granted and it has been found to work very satisfactorily and to be of great benefit to the shippers. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 13 Application No. 6375 was filed by the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R| Co. asking authority to amend its live stock tariffs so as to provide for the sorting and consolidation of hogs at Fremont. This privilege the Commission found was very much desired by the shippers, especially those shipping lighter hogs to California and other points on the west coast. The Commission's order granting the application has been greatly appreciated by interested shippers. Application No. 6432 was filed on behalf of all Nebraska lines asking authority to amend tariffs carrying one-half of the regular tariff rates on live stock, so as to apply on jacks and jennets. The order granting the application had the effect of allowing the shippers additional privileges. Application No. 6441 covered an application by the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. reducing rates on ice from Lincoln to Hastings. This subject was first brought to the attention of the Commission by Hastings shippers who contended they were forced to pay on the basis of class "E" rates on ice. The rates authorized in the appli - cation were very satisfactory to the shippers at Hastings, being substantial reductions over the rates complained of in the first in - stance. Application No. 6481 was filed by the C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. and C. St. P. M. &amp; O. Ry. Co. requesting authority to establish a joint distance scale of rates on coal. This application reduced the rates very materially, as previous to the granting of the same the sum of the locals applied to this commodity. Application No 6503 was an application filed by the U. P. R. R. Co. providing for through continuous milage rates on shipments of grain to be milled at Omaha and South Omaha and destined intrastate points. The application was granted and as a result the C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. requested the same rule, the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. having previously been granted authority to publish these rates. These applications had the effect of reducing very materially the rates on grain milled at Omaha or South Omaha, and moving intrastate. Application No. 6531, filed on behalf of the U. P. R. R. Co. and St. J. &amp; G. I. Ry. Co., granted authority to establish continuous mileage rates on live stock as joint through rates. Application No. 6551 granted authority on behalf of the C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. and C. St. P. M. &amp; O. Ry. Co. to establish "joint distance class rates on a continuous mileage basis. In view of the fact that this would make a very substantial reduction in the rates on commodities moving under class rates, this application was granted without the necessity of a formal hearing. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT In Application No. 6577 all railroads operating in Nebraska were granted authority to continue indefinitely the half rate on pure bred live stock in less than carload quantities. This rule the Com - mission has found to be of great benefit to shippers and has resulted in a very substantial saving. Application No. 6444 granted authority to all Nebraska lines to publish a rule permitting the stopping in transit, to partly unload, of packing house products and fresh meats, where the stop was within thirty miles of the ultimate destination, the number of stops being limited to two. Where the intermediate points are a greater distance than thirty miles from the ultimate destination, other charges were authorized. This rule permitted the unloading of small quan - tities of meat at a minimum charge and has resulted in great bene - fit to the shippers and increased movement of these commodities. Resolution No. 96 was an investigation instituted by the Com - mission on its own motion pertaining to the complicated condition of live stock rates in Nebraska. At the present time three scales of live stock rates are in effect in Nebraska. After a hearing, however, the Commission deemed it wise to await the ultimate de - cision of Interstate Commerce Commission in Ex Parte 87 and Doc - ket No. 17,000. Resolution No. 97 covered the rule regulating the number of attendants accompanying shipments of livestock where more than five cars belonging to one shipper were transported in one train, all Nebraska railroads being called upon to appear. This investigation was instituted on the Commission's own motion. An order was en - tered, after a hearing, in which the Commission directed the Ne - braska carriers to publish the interstate rule on traffc within the state. The order carried the proviso that the rule would be changed at any time experience showed that the number of attendants should be increased. Resolution No. 99 was instituted by the Commission on its own motion covering continuous mileage class rates between the C. &amp; N. W. Ry. Co. and C. St. P. M. &amp; O. Ry. Co. A hearing was held at which the interested carriers signified their willingness to file an application to take care of the matter. The subject matter was previously covered under Application No. 6581. Formal complaint No. 567 was filed by the North Platte Valley Cooperative Cheese Co. v. C. B. ft Q. R. R. Co. and U. P. R. R. Co.,. asking that - a lower rate be established on carload shipments of cheese to Omaha from factories located at Gering and Scottsbluff. At a hearing at which interested parties appeared, it developed that the carload rate on cheese from Wisconsin points to Omaha was </seg>
            <seg id="p015">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 15 eighty-four cents per cwt. while the rate from Gering and Scotts - bluff was $1.07%. The Commission issued an order directing that the defendant companies publish the lower rate with a minimum weight of 30,000 pounds, on cheese moving from Gering and Scotts - bluff to Omaha, which will result in great advantage to the industry bringing the complaint. It was the opinion of the Commission that the Nebraska producer should have the benefit of this location, which is 443 miles from Omaha, while the Wisconsin producing point is 550 miles. The cheese industry in the North Platte valley is a new one for Nebraska. It has grown until it now owns five factories with an output of from 1,000,000 to 1, 500,000 pounds of commercial cheese although only five years old. The Commission was of the opinion that it should be encouraged in every possible way. A resume of cases before the Interstate Commerce Commission in which the Nebraska Commission has either filed or intervened and which are, with one or two exceptions, pending at the present time. f&lt;\ In 1924 this Commission filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission under Docket 16322, attacking rates on corn moving from Nebraska points through Superior, Nebraska, to sta - tions in Kansas and Oklahoma. This case was heard before Examiner Weaver of the Interstate Commerce Commission who submitted a tentative report which was not satisfactory to this Commission and a brief was filed objecting to this report. As yet the Interstate Commission has not entered its decision in connection with this case. It is our hope, however, that we will be able to secure relief for the shippers of this commodity. The present indications are that a substantial reduction will be made in the rates on this commodity moving into the above mentioned territory. This Commission also filed a case with the Interstate Commerce Commission under Docket 16341 attacking the rates on sugar from New Orleans and related points to points in Nebraska. This case was also heard before Examiner Weaver and his conclusions were that Ne - braska was entitled to a reduction in its sugar rates. This was objected to by the defendants but the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion sustained the position of the examiner in this case and we were granted substantial reductions in these rates. A petition of the Hawaiian Sugar Company of California and the carriers for a re - opening of this case was objected to by this Commission, together with intervenors, and the Commission has ordered that the reduced rates shall become effective, December 27, 1926. In I. C. C. Docket 17330 wherein the Illinois Coal Traffic Bur - eau attacked the lack of uniformity in sizes and shapes of the per - forations for coal screening equipment, this Commission intervened and was represented at the hearing held in Chicago the early part </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT of October. Briefs have been filed and it is our hope that substantial relief will be given to the various miners in order that uniformity may exist in the screening part of the coal industry and that our receivers of coal within the state of Nebraska will be able to secure coal from either the Illinois district or the Wyoming district, on the same gradation. That is, egg coal, for instance, will be of uniform size whether it is received from the western or eastern districts. In previous annual reports we have mentioned the fact that various complaints have been filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission attacking the class and commodity rate structure in western trunk line territory, more especially from points east of the Illinois-Indiana state line to Omaha and other Missouri River cities. This case is known as Docket 16226. The Lincoln Chamber of Com - merce has intervened and been given a sub number. Other Cham - )ers of Commerce have filed like complaints which have been con - solidated with this docket. Traffic organizations throughout the en - ire western trunk line territory have intervened. A similar case las been filed with this Commission by the railroads. As a result le Interstate Commerce Commission first set the whole matter down or investigation under its Docket 14629, and later consolidated all roceedings for disposition under Docket 17,000 — Part 2. One of the first hearings has been set for the latter part of January 1927. The reason the Nebraska case proper has not been set down for hearing was because it was the desire of this Commission to co-oper - ate and work with the Interstate Commerce Commission in an en - deavor to secure a proper level of rates for this territory. As a step along that line the Nebraska Commission has authorized the cancellation of Nebraska Classification with a few exceptions and has allowed the carriers to establish Western Classification in lieu thereof which has put the entire classification structure on a uniform basis. As a basis for the showing it expects to make, this Commis - sion is conducting an extensive study into costs and has a large force of extra people at work assembling and analyzing data. It will be necessary to make a study of the wheel reports of the various car - riers, of the operating expenses and revenues accruing to each sta - tion, what the final net income is to the roads operating in the state of Nebraska as well as in the entire western trunk line territory. It will necessitate going over the records of the carriers and segre - gating all items of expense and revenues and classifying them in what we consider a proper classification. It will be our purpose, if possible, to show that the carriers operating in Nebraska are mak - ing a reasonable return upon their investment. It may be that there will be spots in certain portions of the western trunk line territory that should be decreased, others in portions of the territory, may be increased in order to wipe out the depressions that now exist. This case promises to be of momentous importance. We are </seg>
            <seg id="p017">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 17 of the opinion that in the final analysis the entire class rate struc - ture will be on a proper level and that the adjustment will be satis - factory for several years. We are unable to estimate how long a period will be required to make this investigation or how long it will be before the Interstate Commerce Commission will render its decision. In August 1926 the Southwestern Millers League, the Kansas City Millers Club and other parties at interest, filed a petition with the Interstate Commerce Commission requesting a suspension of the proposal by the Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Railroad to reduce the pro - portional rates on wheat and products from Minneapolis and other points in Minnesota to eastern points. The railroad in that instance proposed a reduction of 6 cents per 100 pounds in the proportional rates which would mean a spread of 10% cents between the rates applying from Nebraska and those applying from Minnesota on traffic moving to the east. The spread in these rates has been for a number of years 4% cents and when the proposed spread was made 10% cents, this Commission felt that the shippers and pro - ducers of this commodity in the state of Nebraska were being dis - criminated against and intervened. Hearing was held at Minneapolis. This Commission had a representative present who introduced testi - mony to the effect that while this Commission had no objection to reductions in rates on wheat and related products from Minnesota points, it was our position that a like reduction should be made from Nebraska and that should the carriers be allowed to make this re - duction from Minnesota and not from Nebraska that we would file a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission attacking our rates as unreasonable in violation of Section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act. This case was attended by all of the milling inter - ests of Minneapolis, Duluth, Buffalo and other big milling centers. It was also attended by representatives from the states of Washing - ton and Oregon. It is our hope that whatever is done in this case, Nebraska will continue to retain the present relationship. This case is known as I. &amp; S. Docket 2729. In the latter part of 1926 the American Salt Company and other producers in Kansas, filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission attacking the rates on salt from Kansas fields to points in western trunk line territory and western and northern Nebraska as well as North and South Dakota, alleging that the rates were unreasonable in violation of Section 1 of the Commerce Act and that they were being discriminated against in favor of shippers moving salt from Michigan, Ohio and Utah. Hearing was held on this case, I. C. C. Docket 17968, in October at Chicago, Illinois, the Commission being represented and a number of exhibits present - ed. Should the contentions urged in the complaints be sustained, a </seg>

In I. G. C. Docket 17569, a complaint filed in connection with the rates on horses and mules and other live stock from points in Wyoming and Montana, the rates in Nebraska were brought into review and this Commission sent a representative to the horse and mule market at Grand Island, Nebraska, to make an investigation in connection with this docket. Several conferences have been held with the complainants in this case. As yet, the matter has not been set down for hearing by the Interstate Commerce Commission. In early April the attention of the Commission was called to a docket issued by the Trans-Continental Freight Bureau wherein the bureau was endeavoring to close several routes of grain and grain products moving to the western coast. A conference was held in Omaha with representatives of the Trans-Continental Freight Bureau, the railroads and the Missouri River markets. The result of this conference was that the carriers withdrew their proposal in connec - tion with the restriction of the routing. In passing it might be well to state that a number of I. C. C. dockets are received relating to the ratings and classifications on various commodities, some of which seem to involve the interests of Nebraska. Whenever this is true, we make an investigation a;; to what the probable result of such a case would be and if it appears that the interests of Nebraska shippers are placed in jeopardy, steps are taken to protect them. The Commission either intervenes in the case or takes the matter up informally with the Interstate Com - merce Commission and endeavors to make an informal adjustment of some of the questions raised in the various complaints before they are set down for hearing. Our records indicate that we have a number of I. C. C. dockets in our files that have never been set down for hearing and probably will be dismissed by reason of the fact that an agreement was reached between the complainants and defendants.

            <seg id="p019">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 19 HISTORY— JURISDICTION The Nebraska State Railway Commission had its genesis in an act of the Nebraska Legislature approved March 5, 1885, creating the board of transportation, whose purpose was railroad regulation. The act was declared unconstitutional by the state supreme o&gt;urt on November 21, 1900 (60 Neb. 741). The present Railway Com - mission was created by constitutional amendment adopted November 1906. The Commission consists of three members elected at large for term of six years. Its powers and duties under the constitution includes the regulation of rates, service and general control of com - mon carriers. By specific legislative enactment the Commission has control and jurisdiction over the following: (a) Railroads 1. Rates 2. Depot facilities — size, adequacy, sanitation. 3. Stockyards — adequacy, water and shelter facilities. 4. Industrial relations — leasholds, switchtrack connections. 5. Train service — frequency, scales, equipment. 6. Safety laws — use of switch lines, size of switching crews, operation of light engines, etc. 7. Operation of stock trains with reference to accomodations for caretakers and protection of stock. 8. Transfer tracks between railroads. 9. Telephone communication with depots. 10. Antipass law. 11. Railroad crossings — public and private. Protective devices such as signs and bells. Special crossings — underground and overhead. 12. Policing of all state laws relative to railroads and furnish - ing of proof of violations in the case of prosecutions. 13. Compiles station reports. 14. Check and file annual and (b) Street Railway* other reports required by law. Rates and service. (c) Telephone companies Rates, service, extensions into new territory, physical connec- tions between, consolidations, accounting. (d) Stocks and bonds Security issues by any public utility doing business within the state. Must be approved by the Commission. (e) Express companies Rates and service. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT (f) Telegraph companies Rates and service. (g) The Pullman Company Rates and service. (h) Public grain warehouses Licensing, bonding, policing, checking monthly reports. (i) Tractor sales Licensing of manufacturer to do business within the state and policing state laws. (j) Motor bus companies Operation of intertown bus lines as to rates, service and opera - tion requiring liability insurance or bonds (power from constitution.) (k) Electric transmission lines Controversies between wire companies, method of construction and routing of lines. (1) Consolidations of any competing public utility companies (m) Rural electric districts Rates and securities of semi-public rural electric districts. (n) Irrigation companies Rates and service. The Commission has been given power to conduct investigations, hear testimony, administer oaths and compel attendance -of wit - nesses — appeals from orders and rulings of the Commission are taken direct to the Supreme Court of the state. The Commission has jurisdiction over rates of railroads and all other common carriers in this state except it has no authority to prescribe a rate which operates to discriminate against interstate or foreign commerce. In the event the Nebraska Commission estab - lishes a rate which discriminates against interstate or foreign com - merce, the Interstate Commerce Commission may set such discrimin - atory rate aside. In forming its decision, however, the latter may and does confer with the Nebraska Commission as to the probable effect of such rate. The Transportation Act of 1920 paragraph 3 of Section 13 reads as follows: "(3) Whenever in any 'investigation under the provisions of this Act, or in any investigation instituted upon petition of the carrier concerned, which petition is hereby authorized to be filed, there shall be brought in issue any rate, fare, charge, classification, regulation, or practice, made or imposed by au- </seg>
            <seg id="p021">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 21 thority of any State, or initiated by the President during the period of Federal control, the Commission, before proceeding to hear and dispose of such issue, shall cause the State or States interested to be notified of the proceeding. The Commission may confer with the authorities of any State having regulatory jurisdiction over the class of persons and corporations subject to this Act with respect to the relationship between rate structures and practices of carriers subject to the jurisdiction of such State bodies and of the Commission; and to that end is au - thorized and empowered under rules to be prescribed by it, and which may be modified from time to time, to hold joint hearings with any such State regulating bodies on any matters wherein the Commission is empowered to act and where the rate-making authority of a State is or may be affected by the action taken by the Commission. The Commission is also authorized to avail itself of the cooperation, services, records, and facilities of such State authorities in the enforcement of any provision of this Act." At the meeting of the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, held at Washington, D. C, October, 1925, the following cooperative procedure was agreed to by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the state commissions. The agreement reads as follows: "Paragraph 3 of Section 13 of the interstate commerce act authorizes the Interstate Commerce Commission to avail itself of the cooperation, services, records, and facilities of state commissions, to confer with them with respect to the relationship between rate structures and practices of carriers, and to hold joint hearings with them "where the rate-making authority of a State is or may be affected by the action taken by the Commission." Our common purpose is to give the ut - most force and effect to the provision of the law. While co-operation between the Interstate Commerce Com - mission and the state commissions must in the nature of things be of the spirit and not a matter of rules and regulations, we are of the opinion that the following suggested procedure, with such modifications as time and experience shall prove advisable, and, except in special cases where it may be found necessary or desirable to deviate therefrom, should be followed: PROCEDURE RECOMMENDED 1. Whenever a petition is filed with the Interstate Commerce Commission alleging that intrastate rates unjustly discriminate against interstate commerce, or persons or localities engaged therein, and asking the federal commission to remove such discrimination, the state commission of the state or states affected thereby shall im - mediately be notified of such petition by the federal commission. If either a state commission having jurisdiction over rates thus attacked, or the federal commission desires a conference thereon, it should notify the other without delay, and thereupon such conference should be arranged likewise without delay. If the case goes to trial, a joint hearing by the Interstate Commerce Commission and the com - mission of the state or states affected should be held, provided a proceeding or proceedings be pending before the state commission in </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 which action can be taken upon the common record. Such joint hearing should be followed by conference to consider the facts de - veloped of record so as to provide opportunity for the removal of the unlawful discrimination, if any, by agreement. 2. Joint conferences should be held on complaints attacking interstate rates in those cases where the decision of the Interstate Commerce Commission appears likely to affect in substantial and important respects the relationship between state and ' interstate rate structures; likewise, conference should be held in the case of com - plaints attacking intrastate rates in those cases where the decision of the state commission appears likely to affect in substantial and important respects the relationship between state and interstate rate structures; and a joint hearing may be mutually agreed upon, with conferences on the record in either of such classes of cases. Participation in such hearings or in conferences following sub - mission will be upon invitation of the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion, if the complaint is filed with it, or of the state commission if the complaint is filed with it; but this shall not preclude either the federal or a state commission from suggesting a conference in either a state or a federal case where it shall appear to the one commission that the decision by the other commission may affect in substantial and important respects the rates primarily within t'.'e jurisdiction of the other commission. Joint hearings will be appropriate where similar issues are pending before the Interstate Commerce Commission and a state commission, or informal conference pending the decision of coses where there has been no participation in the prior hearings. 3. The provisions of the foregoing paragraph (2) include cases where it appears that the rate structures of two or more states, or in a group of states, may be affected by the proceedings pending. If by reason of the number of states affected, or otherwise, it shall be found impracticable or inconvenient for a member or employee of the commission of each such state to participate in the joint hear - ings or conferences, the commission of the states affected should select a limited number of representatives to so participate on their behalf and to report back to the several state commissions for ap - propriate action by them. Provided, the commission of any state may appoint a representative or representatives to sit with the ex - aminer or examiners of the Interstate Commerce Commission in joint hearings or conferences. 4. It shall be considered appropriate and desirable for either the federal or a state commission to suggest a conference to the other on any matter or proceeding where the one commission may be of the opinion that matters of mutual concern are involved and where cooperation may be had to advantage. 5. It is our judgment that state commissioners or their repre - sentatives would not expect or desire to sit with members of the Interstate Commerce Commission or its examiners in joint hearing in any case in which they appear as advocates. This is not to be understood as precluding a state commission from causing pertinent evidence to be presented in any such case with respect to the mat - ters in issue. 6. The federal and state commissions should feel free to sug- </seg>
            <seg id="p023">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 23 gest to each other, and the state commissions to hold among them - selves, conferences on matters arising under their respective juris - dictions, with a view to harmonizing in so far as practicable rates and practices in neighboring states by appropriate action of the com - missions of those states without proceedings before the federal com - mission. 7. It is desirable that there be continued, in so far as practi - cable, the practice of the Interstate Commerce Commission of call - ing upon a state commission to hold hearings for it upon applications for certificates of public convenience and necessity, involving con - struction of new lines or abandonment of old lines. In such matters joint conferences between the Interstate Commerce Commission and a state commission may also be held upon request of either com - mission. 8. In joint hearings involving interstate rates, the rules of practice prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission shall govern as far as applicable. 9. When a joint hearing is held under the co-operative plan, and the case afterwards comes to argument before the Interstate Commerce Commission, it is to be understood that the co-operating state commissioners will be expected to sit with the Interstate Com - merce Commission at the argument, if they so desire, and after - wards to take part in a joint conference to consider the disposition of the case. Notice of the assignment for oral argument will be sent to the interested state commission or commissions in each in - stance, and the notice will be understood to carry with it an invita - tion to the state commissioners to be present at the oral argument and sit with the Interstate Commerce Commission in conference when held. It is suggested, however, that in response to the notice the state commission or commissions should seasonably advise the Secre - tary of the Interstate Commerce Commission of the number who will be present, in order that seating arrangements may be made. The aim is to establish the understanding that co-operative ac - tion involves always opportunity to sit at the argument and in subsequent conferences. However, special invitations will not be sent by the Interstate Commerce Commission, and it will be under - stood that cooperating state commissioners will act upon informa - tion contained in the mimeographed notice from the Section of Dockets, if they desire to sit at the argument. At the conclusion of a joint hearing the presiding Interstate Commerce Commission examiner and the participating state com - missioners or state commission representatives may, if practicable, hold an informal conference for an exchange of views in the case. It is obvious, of course, that in many cases the difficulties and com - plexities of the cases will make a satisfactory exchange of views impracticable at such times, in which event such state commission - ers or state commission representatives may give the Interstate Com - merce Commission examiner the benefit of their views in writing or otherwise, as may be convenient, before the proposed report of the Interstate Commerce Commission examiner is served. It will of course, be understood that under the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion practice the proposed report embodies the independent views of the examiner. At the same time, it is believed that an exchange of views with the state commissioners may aid the examiner in </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT formulating his proposed report. A similar course is contemplated with respect to the forthcoming decisions of the state commissions based upon the record made in joint hearings. Provided, state com - missioners or state commission representatives may indicate to the Interstate Commerce Commission their separate views, in writing. Where there has been no oral argument, or the state Commis - sioners have been unable to be present, an exchange of views, in writing or by joint conference, may be desirable. 10. The Interstate Commerce Act and the rules of the Inter - state Commerce Commission provide for notice to the states in cer - tain matters affecting them, and the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion has been complying therewith. A state commission should ad - vise the Interstate Commerce Commission of matters or proceedings before it in which it believes the Interstate Commerce -Commission has an interest, as indicated in the foregoing text, by reason of the fact that interstate commerce may be affected by action of the state commission. 11. The utmost promptitude compatible with the circumstances is urged in order that co-operative action between the federal end the state commissions may not be productive of delay in disposing of important matters and cases. 12. Applying the co-operative principle, conferences may be arranged for the development of car service, distribution, and ad - ministration, and in other matters which may occur to either the Federal or a state commission where it is the opinion that co-opera - tion may be beneficial or advisable.

Adopted by the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners this 14th day of October, 1925. From the above it is clearly shown that the amendment to the Interstate Commerce Commission Act of 1920 materially changed the method of regulation of interstate rates with regard to the ad - justment of intrastate rates. The procedure above quoted has been put into practice by the state and Interstate commissions and has proven entirely satisfactory to both parties. The Nebraska Commission is now engaged, jointly with the Inter - state Commerce Commission, in the investigation of five class and commodity rates that affect Nebraska intrastate and interstate ad - justments. </seg>

            <seg id="p034">34 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT CASES BEFORE THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION 1926 Corn Case In our 1925 report we referred to I. C. C. Docket No. 16322 with the advice that this case had been set down for oral argument before the Interstate Commerce Commission at Washington, D. C. The date of the argument was March 12, 1926, and Chairman Browne of the Commission was present to make the argument on behalf of the Nebraska Commission asking that the proposed report of the Examiner be set aside and that proper relief be given our shippers on the movement of corn from Nebraska points to territory in Kan - sas and Oklahoma. The Interstate Commerce Commission has not as yet handed down its decision in this case possibly by reason of the fact that there have been filed a number of other cases involving corn and grain rates and also by reason of the fact that a general investigation of the grain rate structure through this territory has been set down for hearing before the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion in connection with I. C. C. Docket No. 17000, Part II and Ex Parte 87, Sub. No. 1. Hearings on the general grain case will prob - ably be held the latter part of 1927. Class and Commodity Rates We mentioned in our last report that the Omaha Chamber of tmnierce had filed a formal complaint with the Interstate Commerce mmission attacking proposed class and commodity rates suggested by that body on traffic moving from points east of the Illinois-In - diana state line to Omaha and other Missouri river cities. This case was assigned Docket No. 16226. Later the Lincoln Chamber of Com - merce intervened and their case was given a sub-number to this docket. Later the Board of Railroad Commissioners of the State of South Dakota intervened and their case was assigned to Docket No. 15265. The same Commission had another case involving practically the same thing-known as Docket No. 16838. The Kansas City Cham - ber of Commerce filed a case known as Docket No. 16913. In an - other case against certain railroads the State of South Dakota filed a case known as Docket No. 16945 ; also a case known as Docket No. 16981. The Sioux Falls Chamber of Commerce filed a case known as Docket 17030. Intrastate class rates within the state of South Dakota became involved under Docket No. 17235. The Bis - marck Association of Commerce filed a complaint known as Docket No. 17980. The Chamber of Commerce of Kansas City filed another case known as Docket No. 10390. The Commercial Club of Fargo, North Dakota, filed a complaint known as Docket No. 18454; the Grand Forks Commercial Club filed a case known as Docket No. 18735 and the Dodge City Chamber of Commerce filed a case known </seg>
            <seg id="p035">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 35 as Docket No. 18790. The Nebraska Commission case relative to the class rates to and from Nebraska stations is known as Docket No. 14625. All of these cases, together with a petition by the Western Trunk Line roads involving investigation of class rates within the Western Trunk Line territory known as Docket No. 17000 Part II and Ex Parte 87, Sub. No. 1, have been consolidated and will be heard at one time. This Commission has put on an extra large force to develop the class rate situation in the entire trunk line territory as well as Nebraska. The reason that the Nebraska case proper has not been set down for hearing is because it was the desire of the Commission to cooperate with the Interstate Commerce Commission in their endeavor to promulgate a proper level of rates in this terri - tory. As a step along the line of cooperation the Nebraska Com - mission authorized the cancellation of the Nebraska classification with a few exceptions and allowed the carriers to establish Western Clas - sification in lieu thereof which has put the entire classification struc - ture, as far as Nebraska is concerned, on a uniform basis. As mentioned above, in order to develop the present class rate structure situation in Nebraska, this Commission has been compelled to put on an extra large force in order to determine, if possible, what should be a proper terminal cost in conection with class rates. It will be necessary to make a study of the wheel reports of the vari - ous carriers, of the operating revenues and expenses accruing to each station; determine what the final net income is to the roads operating in the state of Nebraska as well as in the entire Western Trunk Line territory. It will necessitate going through the records of the carriers and segregating all items of expenses and revenues and classifying them into what we consider a proper classification. It will be our purpose, if possible, to show that the carriers operating in Nebraska are making a reasonable rate of return upon their invest - ment and that our class rates ought not to be increased. We hope to prove that the present class rate scale applying to and from the Kebraska jobbing points such as Omaha, Lincoln, Hastings and Grand land is unreasonably high and should be reduced. We shall also endeavor to prove that the class rate adjustment as a whole should not be disturbed. It may be that there will be certain spots in West - ern Trunk Line territory that should be increased in order to wipe out the small depressions that may now exist. On the other hand, it may be that these depressions caused by a higher rate level in some localities will be wiped out by reducing the rates in the higher rated localities. This case promises to be one of the most gigantic tasks ever undertaken by the Interstate Commerce Commission or this Commission. It is our hope that in the end we will be able to say that we have made a very substantial saving to the shippers and receivers of freight moving on the class rate basis. We are of the opinion that in the final analysis of these cases that the entire </seg>
            <seg id="p036">36 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT rate structure will be on a proper level and will not need ting for a good many years to come. Every territory will have benefit of its geographical location in connection with any jobbing nt. We are unable to estimate at this time the cost or how long t period will be required to make this investigation. In passing might be well to state that these class rates are the outgrowth the Hoch-Smith resolution passed by Congress and set down by the Interstate Commerce Commission under Docket No. 17000, and the petitions of the carriers in Western district for an increase in rates, known as Docket Ex Parte 87. Sugar Case tThis case, known as I. C. C. Docket No. 16341, was heard at icoln on March 3, 1925. Briefs were submitted and a tentative :ision handed down by Examiner Weaver in which he found that ; rates from the south to the so-called Omaha-Lincoln-Fremont Ferential territory were not unreasonable or otherwise unlawful. is case was argued before the entire Commission on January 29, 26. The conclusion of the I. C. C. differed somewhat from those of Examiner Weaver and the roads were ordered to put in reduced rates from New Orleans to certain specified points in Nebraska. The rendants filed objections to this decision and certain parties went far as to file a petition asking for a reopening of the case. The Commission, however, issued its decision ordering the reduced rates to become effective not later than December 27, 1926. This means that once more our shippers are the recipients of a reduction in rates. Coal Case As mentioned in our previous report, this Commission proposed to intervene in I. C. C. Docket No. 17330, which was a coal case instigated by the Illinois Coal Traffic Bureau attacking the lack of uniformity in size and shapes in the perforations for coal screening equipment. The hearing attended by a representative of the Com - mission was heard in Chicago, the early part of October. Briefs have tn filed and it is our hope that substantial relief will be given to miners in order that uniformity may exist in that part of the coal industry relative to uniform perforations of coal screens and that our shippers within the state will be able to secure coal from either the east or the west with a uniform gradation, that is, egg coal for instance, will be of uniform size whether it may come from the eastern district or the western district. A decision in this case has not as yet been handed down. Cemeat Case On January 9, 1926, the Atlas Portland Cement Company of Kansas filed a complaint attacking the rating on empty cement bams </seg>
            <seg id="p037">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 37 returned to their plants in various parts of Kansas and Missouri from points in the state of Nebraska alleging that these were unlawful and unreasonable ratings, in violation of section I of I. C. C. Act, unlawful discrimination in violation of section 2 and unduly perferen - tial and prejudicial in violation of sections S and 13. This case was assigned to Docket No. 17942, Sub. L and 3. Under date of Febru - ary 13, this Commission filed a petition of intervention by reason of the fact that we had previously issued an order directing the car - riers to apply a certain reduced rating on empty cement bags re - turned. This case was set down for hearing on February 3, 1926, at Estes Park, Colorado, before Examiner Ames and oral argument is to be heard March 18, 1927, at the offices of the Interstate Com - merce Commission at Washington, D. C. It is our hope that the Commission will see fit to establish the same reduced rating on move - ment of empty cement bags returned as is now obtained in Nebraska. Grain Case In August 1926, the Southwestern Millers League, the Kansas City Millers Club and other parties at interest, filed a petition with the Interstate Commerce Commission requesting a suspension of the proposal by the Minneapolis &amp; St. Louis Railroad to reduce the pro - portional rates on wheat and products from Minneapolis and other points in Minnesota to eastern points. The railroad in this instance proposed a reduction of 6 cents per 100 pounds in the proportional rates which would mean a spread of 10% cents between the rates applying from Nebraska and those applying from Minnesota on traffic moving to the east. The spread in these rates has been for a num - ber of years 4% cents and when the proposed spread was made IOV2 cents, this Commission felt that the shippers and producers of this commodity in the state of Nebraska were being discriminated against and intervened in this case. Hearing was held at Minneapolis. The Commission had a representative present who introduced testimony to the effect that while this Commission had no objection to reduc - tions in rates on wheat and related products from Minnesota points, it was our position that a like reduction should be made from Ne - braska and that should the carriers be allowed to make this reduc - tion from Minnesota and not from Nebraska that we would file a complaint with the Interstate Commerce Commission attacking our rates as unreasonable in violation of section I of the Interstate Com - merce Act. This hearing was attended by all of the milling interests t Minneapolis, Duluth, Buffalo and by other big milling centers, was also attended by representatives from the states of Washington and Oregon. This case is known as I &amp; S Docket 2729. Salt Cate In the latter part of 1926 the American Salt Company and other producers in Kansas, filed a complaint with the Interstate Commerce </seg>
            <seg id="p038">38 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Commission attacking the rates on salt from Kansas fields to points in western trunk line territory and western and northern Nebraska as well as North and South Dakota, alleging that the rates were un - reasonable in violation of Section I of the Commerce Act and that they were being discriminated against in favor of the shippers mov - ing salt from Michigan, Ohio and Utah. Hearing was held on this case, I. C. C. Docket 17968, in October at Chicago, Illinois, the Commission was represented and a number of exhibits introduced and we cannot help but feel that the entire adjustment on salt from Kansas fields to northern and western Nebraska will be given a substantial reduction and that our shippers and receivers will be able tmove this commodity at a very much lower rate than is r.ow in :ct. The record in this case indicates that there is a substantial cement of salt from the Kansas fields both to jobbers and live :k growers and should we be successful in securing reductions it will mean a substantial saving to the people of Nebraska. Lit* Stock In I. C. C. Docket 17569 a complaint filed in connection with the rates on horses and mules and other live stock from points in Wyoming and Montana brought into review the rates from Nebraska and this Commission sent a representative to the horse and mule market at Grand Island, Nebraska, to make an investigation in con - nection with this docket. Several conferences have been held with the complainants in this case with the result that as yet the matter has not been set down for hearing by the Interstate Commerce Com - mission. It will be our position that the live stock rates in Nebraska ought not to be disturbed and that the horse and mule market at Grand Island should not be put on a basis that would not enable it to compete with other markets of a like character. Hoch-Smith Resolution In our previous Annual Report we referred to I. C. C. Docket No. 17000, the Hoch-Smith resolution and Ex Parte 87, the petition of the Western District Roads for an increase in rates. These two cases were consolidated and hearings were held in Chicago, Illinois, Kansas City, Missouri, Denver, Colorado, San Francisco, California and Dallas, Texas. This Commission submitted exhibits and other testimony purporting to show that the carriers were not entitled to an increase in their rates. This was a more or less cooperative case and the data as worked out by the Rate Committee was presented before the Interstate Commerce Commission with the result that the carriers were not permitted to increase their rates the 5% requested and that generally speaking the rates in the western district were not unreasonably low and also that the grain rates in this territory were not unreasonably high. The Commission in its decision did say that </seg>
            <seg id="p039">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 39 there were certain spots in portions of the Western Trunk Line terri - tory that were unreasonably low. This might have been caused by a higher rate level in the surrounding localities. In this case we feel that the work of the Commission prevented the railroads from in - creasing their rates and we hope that in the cases previously men - tioned to which have been assigned sub-numbers under these two dockets we will be able to prove that the roads in the Western Trunk Line territory are making a substantial rate of return on their in - vestment, although the figures will show that the passenger business has fallen off considerably while on the other hand the freight busi - ness was materially increased for 1926. rES HEARD ON BEHALF OF THE INTERSTATE COMMERCE COMMISSION BY THE NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Finance Docket No. 5514 was the result of an application filed by the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company for a cer - tificate of public convenience and necessity permitting it to abandon a portion of its line between Chalco and Yutan. In order to carry out the spirit of cooperation now existing be - tween the Interstate Commerce Commission and the various state commissions, the Interstate Commerce Commission requested the Nebraska Commission to hear the evidence submitted in connection with this application and to submit copies of exhibits together with whatever recommendations this Commission felt proper to make. The Nebraska Commission set the place and time of hearing at Omaha on September 21, 1926, notice of which was transmitted to the Inter - state Commerce Commission and that body officially advised all par - ties at interest. Evidence was submitted by the interested parties. This Commission forwarded its recommendations to the Interstate Commerce Commission stating what its conclusions were. The in - terested parties were permitted to file briefs and the matter was then submitted to the Interstate Commerce Commission. That body ap - proved the unanimous recommendations as submitted by the Ne - braska State Railway Commission, which were that the carriers be permitted to abandon approximately seven miles of line, from Chalco west toward Yutan. The evidence showed that this road was built to fulfill a promise made to the Omaha business people in order to enable them to develop fe greater tonnage from points north of Yutan. The road was ope - ned for a period of about nine months in 1923 and 1924, at a is. Since that period, the road has not been operated and by allow - ing the carriers to abandon this line it will enable them to salvage about $45,000 worth of material on an approximate expenditure of </seg>
            <seg id="p040">40 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT about one million dollars. The bridge at Yutan, being the main item I expense, will still be used in order to move the commodities that :ht originate at Cone's Spur and Allis, points east of the Platte ;r. It might be well to state that the Omaha Chamber of Com - •ce, Omaha Live Stock Exchange and various other bodies offered objection to the granting of this application, provided it would be sible to maintain the same rates as are now in effect. While this lid be only a gentleman's agreement, this Commission has juris - ion over the rate situation and there apparently would be no son for not maintaining the present rates between Omaha on the i hand and points north of Yutan on the other, although the fFic would have to move via Ashland, as it did prior to this time. The Interstate Commerce Commission expressed its sincere ap- of our efforts in helping it dispose of this case in a co- manner. It is the hope of this department that the present spirit of cooperation will continue and that the Nebraska Commission will be instrumental in handling such cases involving Nebraska ship - pers, when their interests involve interstate matters. It will enable this Commission to speak with authority relative to conditions as they actually exist in this territory, and with a wider vision than can possibly be obtained by a representative of the Interstate Com - merce Commission.

Approximately nine miles east of the city, the defendants railroad crosses a public highway at grade. The highway extends east and west and the railroad crosses it at a sharp angle in a southeasterly direction. Approaching the crossing on the highway from the west the road is in a valley below the level of the railroad and the view to the north is more or less obscured by trees. Close to the track the view at points is cut off by natural ridges where the low land joins to the table beyond. The approach to the track rises sharply on about a 10 percent grade. The view to the south is reasonably clear. East of the track the ground is above the railroad and comparatively level. The view is clear in all directions. The train service consists of two trains each way a day. Plaintiff maintained that an undergrade crossing is necessary to insure safety. It is proposed to cut a highway under the track and carry the railroad over with five twelve foot timber spans. This would require a long deep excavation and one of the timber sup - ports would be in the center of the road way. This was the least expensive construction that could be planned. It is open to serious </seg>

The railroad objected for the reason that the construction would be temporary and hazardous to moving trains. A structure that would be safe and reasonably permanent would cost from $13,500 to $17,500. The vehicular traffic on the highway is small as compared with the main roads. It is possible that the volume would increase if the highway were graded to meet modern standards. The railroad company expressed a willingness to join with the county in grading the west approach to make the rise more gradual and removing obstacles to the view on the railroad right of way. The Commission believes and so finds that the situation is not riciently hazardous to justify the expenditure of so large a sum money for an undergrade crossing. The complaint will be dis - missed without prejudice.

Taylor, Vice-Chairman. Attest: Leonard D. Densmore, Secretary. (SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 519 A. L. Weinstein, Complainant, v. Chicago &amp; Nortb Weitern Railway Company, Defendant. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This complaint was submitted to the Commission on a stipulation signed by both parties, hearing being waived. The complainant A. L. Weinstein is engaged in the fruit, vege - table and produce business in the city of Omaha. According to stipu - lation it is agreed that the complainant shipped eight carloads of potatoes over the North Western railway from Ainsworth, Gordon and Hay Springs to Omaha between October, 1922, and March, 1923; that the North Western collected a reconsignment charge of $6.30 per car, a total of $50.40 for the eight cars; that said amount has been paid by the complainant to said North Western Railway com - pany; and that on the tenth day of February, 1923, on application of the defendant the Commission authorized and directed the North- Western to cancel its reconsignment charge of $6.30 per car at Omaha, the order having been entered on the above mentioned date in Application No. 5039, effective March 31, 1923. In the prayer the complainant asks that the Commission order the defendant to pay to the complainant $50.40 as reparation of the reconsigning charges collected on the eight cars of potatoes. At the time the shipments in question moved the North Western had in effect a legal tariff which provided a charge of $6.30 per car for the privilege of reconsigning carload shipments of potatoes at Omaha. The question to be decided by the Commission, is whether or not the defendant should be directed to make reparation to the con - signee of the amount paid. Complainant relies, as proof why this reparation should be granted, on the fact that the carrier asked to </seg>
            <seg id="p154">154 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 1923, and on the further proof that other carriers operating in Omaha did not have a similar charge in effect on their several lines of railroad. The history of these charges, as shown by the tariffs on file with the Commission, shows that: "When the carrier came out from under federal control on Feb. 28, 1920, a charge of $5.00 per car was provided for in their tariff G. F. D. 16390. This charge was continued until Sept. 1, 1920", when under our Application 4299 (25% advance) the charge became $6.25 which rate on March 10, 1921, was advanced the full 35% making same $7.00 (I. C. C. docket 11829). On July 1, 1922 (10% reduction) the charge became $6.30. January 24, 1923, the carrier made application (5039) for authority to cancel this charge on Nebraska intrastate traffic. Feb. 10, 1923, upon 30 days notice "to the Commission and the public" we granted them permission to cancel." The order of the Commission became effective thirty days from the date said order was mailed to the defendant, regardless of the fact that the defendant did not cancel the charge by tariff application until August 1, 1924. A check of the tariffs on file with the Commission shows that other Nebraska lines did not have in effect, at any time subsequent to federal control, a reconsigning charge for the movement of potatoes at Omaha similar to the one carried by the defendant. f&gt;m the record it would appear that the North Western had over - ked its tariff provision here under review and allowed the same stand regardless of the fact that its competitors in Omaha and all other stations in Nebraska were not assessing a similar charge. In Application 5039 the defendant justified its action of ask - ing the authority of the Commission to cancel the reconsigning charge herein complained of as follows:. "Our present reconsigning charges on potatoes are not as liberal in Nebraska as in effect via other carriers which situation has been called to our attention through complaint from your Commission. It is therefore our purpose to cancel the present charges applicable on traffic in question and establish rules stated above." The company asked to have the charge canceled for all of its sta - tions in this state and as heretofore stated, the same was granted. From this record we are unable to find that there was any change in the transportation conditions surrounding the handling of the traffic herein complained of between October, 1922, and Feb - ruary, 1923. In view of all the facts in this case it is the con - clusion of the Commission and it so finds that the reconsignment charges here under review were unreasonable and that reparation </seg>
            <seg id="p155">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 155 should be made to complainant in amount $50.40. This conclusion must not be taken to mean that whenever a carrier voluntarily pro - rto reduce a rate the fact may be construed as strong evidence the previous rate was unreasonably high and excessive. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company be, and it hereby is directed and ordered to pay to A. L. Weinstein, or assigns, the sum of $50.40 representing the unreasonable charge for reconsignment on certain car lots of potatoes at Omaha between Oc - tober, 1922, and March, 1923, as set forth in detail in freight bills attached to the stipulation of facts filed in the case.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman: Complainant in this case is a voluntary association representing business interests, rural and town, in the territory of Orleans. It asks that the defendant company be required to furnish a service for 24 hours each day on its telephone system at Orleans, in lieu of present part-time service on Sundays and holidays. Defendant corporation operates exchanges at Alma, Orleans, Republican City and Stamford, as well as certain exchanges in Kan - sas. It undertakes to furnish free connections to all subscribers throughout the territory served by it. In its answer, defendant objected to the complaint, alleging </seg>
            <seg id="p156">156 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Pt the demand was from a very small number of subscribers, that re is really no necessity for full-time service on Sundays and days, that such additional service would cost an additional amount operating expenses which in turn, without an increase in rates, would be a net loss to the earnings which it is alleged are not more than fair at this time. In an informal cross petition at the time of the hearing, defen - dant company asked that rates be increased in sufficient amount to Eride the cost of another operator at Orleans, as well as in amount cient to pay the cost of all .day Sunday and holiday service, if latter were decided by the Commission as proper. Complainants trcrusly objected to the cost of an additional operator, alleging that the service did not require it. Two years ago hearing was held on a similar but broader com - plaint, and upon an application by the Farmers &amp; Merchants company for an increase in rates sufficient to provide all-day Sunday and holiday service at all its Nebraska exchanges. The complaint of the Orleans Community Club at that time was bottomed upon the necessity for such all-day service, but complainants denied that ap - plicant was entitled to any increase in revenue to meet the additional cost. As a result of the hearing on the application of the complain - ant two years ago, the Commission found that the additional service would increase the operating expenses and that the company's reve - nues were insufficient to meet that additional cost without reducing enet earnings below a fair total. It also found that the demand the service was not widespread. It found too, against the com - y's application for an increase in rates. The conclusions were a general denial all around without prejudice. kin the present complaint, the issues are confined to the Orleans ■itory and complainants take the position that if the company is itled to additional revenue to meet the additional cost, the sub - scribers stand ready to pay such additional cost. In support of their position, complainants introduced a considerable number of witnesses, both businessmen of the town and rural subscribers, indicating a rather wide demand for the Sunday service and a readiness to pay whatever additional rate is found by the Commission to be proper. k Complainants attacked the efficiency of the management of the pany and set forth instances of improper transactions. All these sactions were vigorously defended by the telephone company's manager. It may be that the instances cited are subject to criticism made. If so, such improvodent transactions are certainly Eit by economical management and operation in other directions, use, as we stated in the order on Application 5439, (17 N. S. !. 371-374), the company is serving with reasonable efficiency a </seg>

In the year 1925, the net revenue available for interest and dividends was $5,860. The net for the preceding three years was for 1923, $6,665, for 1922, $4,683 and for 1921, $4,195. We found on Application 5439, supra, that the value of the property Croximated $87,000. We see no reason to change that conclusion, ept that the company has added some property since the pre - vious finding. The net revenue now available for interest and divi - dends is not more than a fair return. The company should not be asked to surrender a portion of this net to meet the additional ser - vice demands and the cost thereof. The level of the rates of de - fendant company indicates a service not ( fully comparable with the service of the companies charging considerably higher rates, the rate paid and the class of service, having a definite relationship. The territory served by the defendant at Orleans is prosperous, wide - awake and growing. The testimony indicates quite clearly that there is considerable inconvenience in failure to provide 24-hour service, particularly on Sundays. Defendant public utility ought not to object to meeting the demand for additional service, in the face of the willingness of the subscribers to bear the expense in the rate. It is our conclusion, based upon the record, that the subscribers of the Farmers &amp; Merchants Telephone company of Alma, located in the neighborhood of Orleans, should have 24-hour service on Sundays, but that the cost of such service should be added to the rates at that exchange. Full service is given on all but four of the legal holidays. The necessity for 24-hour service on these holidays does not appear strong. Complainants offered of record to withdraw that portion of the com - plaint. We find that the 24-hour service should not be extended to the four holidays in question. Defendant asked for sufficient increase in rates not only to meet the cost of the additional Sunday service, but to pay the cost of the additional operator at Orleans. Complainants alleged that the service is reasonably prompt and they have no complaint on that ■core. Defendant urged that it was impossiable to give satisfactory service without additional central office help. A peg count at Alma and Orleans on three days of January, 1926, does not indicate over - burdened operators at Orleans. It is our conclusion that at this time such additional operator is. not particularly essential and the proposal of the company in this respect is denied without prejudice to again bringinng up the subject, if it becomes clear that service at Orleans is unsatisfactory because of lack of central office attention. </seg>
            <seg id="p158">158 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT It . is true that there is an additional operator at Alma. Alma has somewhat more long distance work, but not more local calls. Prob - ably the service at Alma is somewhat quicker than at Orleans but Alma is paying a slightly higher rate as compensation for such bet - ter service. It is our conclusion from the record, that the cost of the addi - tional Sunday service at Orleans will be somewhat more than $100 Kyear. An increase of ten cents per month on business sub - bers at Orleans, and five cents per month on residence subscribers in Orleans, will furnish the needed revenue. We do not extend the increased rate to the farm subscribers, as that class of service is now on the same rate basis at both Alma and Orleans, whereas the town subscribers in Orleans are paying slightly less than at Alma. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that, effective not later than May 1, 1926, the Farmers A Merchants Telephone company of Alma, Nebraska, shall, at its exchange at Orleans, provide service on Sundays of the same extent as they now furnish on week days, excepting certain holidays. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that effective May 1, 1926, the following amendments to the rate schedule at Orleans may be put into effect by the defendant company: Gross Net Business service $2.35 $2.20 Residence service 1.55 1.30 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that rates at Orleans for all other classes of service, shall remain in full force and effect as existing at the date of this order.

For the Commission: C. A. Ross, rate clerk. TAYLOR, Commissioner: This complaint is brought under section 5500, Compiled Sta - tutes of Nebraska, 1922, commonly referred to as the reparation law. During the months of October and November, 1924, 26 cars of sand were shipped by the Moffitt Sand and Gravel company from Ashland to Florence, the County of Douglas being the consignee. The rates charged were 3 cents per cwt. by the Burlington for the movement, Ashland to Omaha, and 3 1-2 cents per cwt. by the Chi - cago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha, for the movement, Omaha to Florence. Complainant alleges that the charges were unreasonable and asks reparation down to the basis of 4 1-2 cents per cwt. for the entire movement, this being the rate now in effect. The Burlington answers and says that the rates charged were authorized by the Interstate Commerce Commission and should not be changed except by the order of that Commission; that the rates charged were the only rates that could legally be collected and that to compel reparation would take defendant's property without due pro - cess of law; that to make an order of reparation would be to deprive defendant of its right to trial by jury; that section 5500 Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, is unconstitutional for the reasons above stated and for the further reason that it amends without reference thereto, certain named sections of the statutes. ■ The Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha is content with a general denial. </seg>
            <seg id="p160">160 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT tWe have already passed on the legal questions raised in this case. . C. No. 543 — Sunderland Brothers company v. C. B. &amp; Q. and C. &amp; N. W. Railway company, (18 N. S. R. C. 199-202). It is unnecessary therefore, to repeat those findings here except to point out that the supreme court of the United States in Louisville and Nashville Railroad company v. Sloss-Sheffield Steel and Iron company, reported in Traffic World of November 25th, 1925, page 1277 (269 U. S. 217; Sup. Crt. Rep. 73), establishes principles in keeping with the position taken by us in the case referred to. With reference to carriers' contention that the rate charged was the legal rate and, therefore, not subject to reparation, the court says: "Nor does the fact that the connecting carriers may have been induced to enter into these agreements for joint through rates because the Interstate Commerce Act had declared this to be the general duty of all carriers, prevent the agreement ac - tijallor entered into from being the joint «ct of these carriers. Every local or individual rate is likewise established pursuant to a duty. Whether a rate be individual or joint the Commis - sion may enforce performance if the duty to establish it is ne- glected. The liability in the case at bar arises out of the wrong - ful exaction from the shipper, not out of the unlawful receipt or unjust enrichment by the carrier. Every carrier who par - ticipates in the infliction of this wrong is liable in solido like every other joint tort feasor. The tariff rate, although unlawful because excessive, was as between shipper and carrier the only legal rate. Neither would have been at liberty to avail itself of more favorable rates for any part of the through carriage. Compare Baltimore and Ohio Southwestern R. R. Co. vs. Settle, 260 U. S. 166, 171. The Louisville ft Nashville, the initial car - rier, exacted the excessive joint rates on behalf of itself and of all of the connecting carriers who with it were parties to the joint through rates." i view of the doctrine thus laid down, it may be unnecessary as a matter of interest, to point out that the rates involved were never found to be reasonable by the Interstate Commerce On the contrary that body in its order of August 26, 1921, made the specific reservation that: "This order shall continue in force until the further order of the Commission and shall not be construed as approving any rates established heieunder, which rates revision in appropriate proceedings." With reference contention, moreover, that the rates are still within jurisdiction of the Interstate Commerce Commission, it is only issary to call attention to the order of that Commission issued 24, 1922, in which it vacated and set aside its original order set 11829, this having the effect of restoring the jurisdiction Nebraska Commission over all intrastate rates. The record clearly establishes the fact that the County of Doug - las paid the freight on the shipments complained of. These rates were the legal tariff charges in effect at the time the shipments </seg>
            <seg id="p161">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 161 moved. In support of its contention that the rates are unjust and unreasonable, complainant makes comparison with Iowa rates on sand and gravel, which are less than those charged in the present Iance. It also points out that the movement from Omaha to rence is in all respects a switching movement for which a charge not to exceed $6.30 per car should be assessed. It is also urged t an industry like the water plant of the Metropolitan Utilities trict which is located on the M. &amp; 0. in Florence, receives simi - shipments and pays only the road haul of the originating carrier, latter absorbing all switching charges down to a minimum reve - i per car of $18.50. This is presented as evidence that a com - bined rate of 6 1-2 cents for the movement Ashland to Florence, is excessive and unreasonable if the rate of 3 cents from Ashland to the water plant of the Metropolitan Utilities District is just and reasonable. Defendant argues, of course, that the rate to the water plant is based on the fact that this is a movement to an industry having a definite location on its tracks and being named as such in its tariffs. It is also pointed out by complainant that advantage is quite commonly taken of the industry switching rate by shippers who secure the consent of tariff named industries to the use of such industry locations for the purpose of consignment and unloading. Carriers respond that even though this practice has been indulged in, it is not legal and should not be used as a measure of a reason - able rate. On the shipments in dispute the distance from Ashland to Omaha is 31 miles and Omaha to Florence 5.1 miles. Under the application at the rates as challenged, the rate for the 31 miles to Omaha was 3 cents and for the 5.1 miles to Florence 3 1-2 cents. As is pointed out in Formal Complaint No. 543, the disparity in these two rates is more apparent than real because of the zoning of a very con- siderable territory in which a rate of 3 cents is made into Omaha and Lincoln. For that reason the rate charged and collected by the Burlington on the movement from Ashland to Omaha is found to be reasonable. In our order dated November 7, 1924, we 'found that for a joint haul of the kind herein described, a rate of 4 1-2 cents per cwt. was reasonable. Under all of the circumstances sur - rounding the movements involved in this proceeding, we are of the opinion that the rate of 3 1-2 cents as assessed by the Chicago, St Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha was unreasonable to the extent that i exceeded 1 1-2 cents.

Defendant owns and operates an electric light and power plant within the corporate limits of Omaha. At certain points the com - pany's lines extend across the boundaries and supply electric service </seg>
            <seg id="p163">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 163 Plaintiffs have their homes outside the limits of Omaha, scattered over an area about 900 feet long and 300 feet wide. The company now owns and operates a line about 400 feet long, outside the city limits, which is a city block from the nearest home of the plaintiffs. It will be necessary to reconstruct the existing pole line by adding now cross arms and wires and construct about 1,000 feet of new pole line, including branches, to serve all of the potential customers. The company has made the following estimate of the cost of the necessary construction, on the assumption that the property will belong to the company in the consideration of rates and deduc - tion described as below. Estimated Cost of Construction $ 972.00 Less 1-2 cost of poles 192.00 I $780.00 Defendant has an agreement with the Northwestern Bell Telephone company which provides for the joint use of poles and accounts for the deduction of one-half cost of the poles which is paid for by the telephone company. The estimate is unchallenged except as to anchors and guys which are properly a part of the pole cost and the company agreed to reduce the amount accordingly. In considera - tion of ttie new business the company offered a further reduction of the construction costs in the sum of $150. This results in a net cost of $630, or $126 per customer. Annual revenues were completed at $15.00 per customer, based on five cents per k. w. hour and a minimum charge of one dollar per month. The rates include maintainance and all expense, result - ing from the new connections. Plaintiff alleges discrimination as to the rate. Certain large consumers served by defendant outside of Omaha have a lower rate but it has always been the practice of electric utilities to use a rate graduated downward as the volume con - sumed increases. The Commission believes and so finds that defendants construc - tion estimates, with deductions as above set forth and the rates pro - posed in connection therewith, are reasonable under the conditions described.

Two other roads connect the boule - vards in the same vicinity, the Smith or Hillcrest road being approx - imately 1200 feet north of the Gregg road, and the A very road being about 700 feet north of that. The Smith road is the shortest of the three, being 1900 feet long, as compared to 3,000 feet for the Gregg road, and 2,000 feet for the Avery road. Responding to complaints registered by a few people residing in the vicinity of the Gregg road, the county of Sarpy, through proper authorities, files complaint with this Commission, asking that defendant be ordered to restore the overhead crossing on the Gregg road. It is urged in the complaint that the territory that would be served by the Gregg road, accommodates the people in the thickly settled community; that land values are being greatly depreciated immediately west of said right of way accessible to said road; and ft the owners of land are being deprived of the benefits assessed said land for the gravel improvements on the boulevard road. In answer, defendant denies that the Gregg road was at any time, now is, an established county highway; denies that the territory is densely populated; that the Gregg road accommodates people in a rly settled community; that the owners of the lands adjacent to, in the vicinity of said road are being deprived of the benefits assessed for improvements on the boulevard; avers that the Gregg road has been abandoned as a public thoroughfare for more than ten years last past; that there is at this time no need or demand by the public for the opening of said road; and further avers that there is a public highway within 1200 feet of the proposed crossing, which is well improved, and affords all necessary means of travel for the public, and that since the relief prayed for would amount to the establishment of a new public highway crossing, that this Commission is without jurisdiction; that further, this Commission has no juris - diction to require defendant to construct an overhead bridge. It is further contended by defendant, that if the crossing prayed for were constructed, it would not be so situated, that the traveling public would use the same to any extent; that the topography of the county at the place where said crossing is demanded, is such that it would be impracticable, and that a crossing at grade would be more de - sirable, defendant having offered, and being now ready and willing, to establish such grade crossing in the event the Gregg road is established and opened for public travel. It is further contended that the financial condition of defendant is such that it has been, and is now, operating at a loss, and any order requiring the erection of an overhead crossing, would be unreasonable, inequitable and unjust. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 166 The record in the case is rather complete, particularly with re- ference to the topography of the country, the condition of the Gregg road, the impracticability of an overhead crossing, the disadvantages that would attend the construction and use of a grade crossing, and the use, or lack of use, to which the proposed road would be put. The Gregg road has been legally established. This is shown by a transcript of the records of the Sarpy county commissioners. There is nothing in the evidence to show that it was ever vacated, except proof that it has not been used for ten years, and it is our under- standing that non-use, in and of itself, is not sufficient to vacate a highway in Nebraska. The record discloses that the road was never used to any extent It may have received some attention from road authorities, when first laid out, although as stated by one of the witnesses for complainant, (Mr. Brown) "it never was properly graded, that is an admitted fact". In 1915, the overhead bridge was found to be in need of repair. Defendant made an investigation, concluded the bridge was not being used, and because of its dangerous condition, barricaded both ends. It remained in this condition for two years. The record shows that no complaints were filed, either by citizens or county authorities. In May, 1917, therefore, the company removed the bridge entirely. It is conceded that it did so without authority. The road is still open from the west, up to the edge of defendant's right of way. It is used, up to this point, almost exclusively by a Mr. Johnson, who lives a few hundred feet south. From the east side of the right of way, to a point where the road connects with the Bellevue boulevard, the old highway is now cultivated and a fence runs down its center. The failure of the public to use the road when it was first estab- lished was undoubtedly due to its condition. The railroad bisects a large hill, the cut being slightly to the east of the ridge. The cut on the west side is approximately 20 feet deep, and about 12 to 14 on the east side. The Gregg road climbs this hill from the west, on a grade of about 15 per cent in places. The climb is so steep that i is very difficult for automobiles to negotiate it. Mr. Johnson one o the principal complainants, and who has been previously referred to testified, referring to the Gregg road, that "there is a hill there tha is almost impossible to go up going home, and all these fellow coming in with coal or anything of that kind, they unload half of it before they get up the hill". Further on in his testimony (pages 59 60 and 61), Mr. Johnson says that the Gregg road is on such a stee incline, that it is almost impassable in inclement weather, and with the 4 or 5 inches of snow that was on the ground at the time of the hearing, he could not get through. In muddy weather, he stated it is almost impossible to climb the hill. </seg>
            <seg id="p167">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 167 Chris Hansen, the local road overseer, testified that the road was never worked, and says if a bridge should be constructed, the road should be graded. H. D. Patterson, county surveyor of Sarpy county, admits the Gregg road would not have much travel, and that east of the crossing it would require "somewhat" of a fill. He stated that the steepest place in the road is now about 15 per cent, and that it would be difficult to travel a much steeper grade than that. R. H. Findley, superintendent of tracks and roadway for defendant, testi - fied that a survey shows that the grade on the west side leading up to the top of the hill, is now 15 per cent. On the east side from the edge of the cut to the bottom of the depression, the grade is 15 per cent. Because of the lower east bank, it would be necessary, in order to procure clearance for the bridge, to have the east end two to three feet higher than the present level of the bank. This would make the incline at least 18 per cent, unless the grade was carried back at least 200 feet, in which event a 15 per cent grade would still re - main. In his opinion, no one would travel a road with a 15 per cent It is manifest that if an overhead bridge were to be made access - ible, a large amount of grading and filling would be necessary. No - where in the record does the county indicate its willingness or inten - tion, to do such work. In the days of horse-drawn vehicles, a road such as this was more practicable, although the history of this one indicates that it was used very little. With present motor vehicles, the road could be used only under the most favorable conditions, and then with great difficulty and inconvenience. : Other roads cross defendant's tracks in this vicinity. The Smith or Hillcrest road crosses the tracks at a point about 1200 feet north, where it makes connection with the Bellevue boulevard. The Avery road, which appears to be the most traveled, is 700 feet north of the Hillcrest crossing. Since it is only a little over one-half mile between the twa boukvards, residents on either side of the railroad, have ready access to these well kept thoroughfares. For that reason, none of them, with the possible exception of Mr. Johnson, would have occasion to use the Gre,gg road to reach a paved or graveled highway. As an alternative to an overhead crossing, defendant, while not conceding the need for a highway at this point, suggests a crossing at a level with its tracks. This would necessitate a heavy cut through the hill from the west, it being estimated that in order to secure an eight per cent rise, from 5700 to 6000 yards of earth would have to be removed. On the east, from 1300 to 1675 yards would have to be removed. This would still leave a portion of the 15 per cent grade on the west hill. The deep cut on the west would probably be object - ionable to adjoining land owners. A grade crossing under such cir- </seg>
            <seg id="p168">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 168 cumstances, would be particularly hazardous. The approach to the tracks would be on an incline, and the view in either direction would be limited. The fact that there is another such crossing in the same county, which has existed for a number of years, hardly justifies the construction of a second. The grade crossing would produce a better highway, but its disadvantages from the standpoint of safety, make it wholly impracticable in our opinion. There is considerable testimony submitted by complainant, that this is in a thickly settled territory, and that development is likely to be rapid. The section is suburban, but in the immediate vicinity of this road there are but few houses, seven being located between the railroad and the Fort Crook boulevard, and none between the railroad and the Bellevue boulevard. The location of the boulevards and the other cross roads already in existence, indicate but little need, if any at all, for an additional highway. Our discussion of the record thus far, indicates that in our opinion, no crossing at this point is necessary or desirable. This is without reference to the financial condition of defendant, which is admittedly such as to make an expenditure of $3,000 to $3,600 difficult and un- wise. We are confronted, however, with a statute which apparently leaves us little discretion. Under the statute as it then existed, and the grant of authority under the constitution, the supreme court in C. R. I. &amp; P. R- Co. v Neb. State Ry. Com., 88 Neb. 239, (I N. S. R. C. 188) held that the Commission was without power to order a grade crossing where a public street had not been opened. In the course of its discussion, the court said: P"In the instant case, any order the Commission might make will be a vain thing. If the crossing is constructed, the public will not thereby secure any relief, because the railway company controls all approaches thereto. We do not question the Commis- sion's authority to inspect railway crossings and to compel a rail- way company to construct them so as to safeguard the lives _ of passengers and employes upon its cars, but no such contention exists in the case at bar. The evidence introduced before the Commission and in the district court, is before us, and it clearly appears therefrom that the Commission tried the question of whether public interest dictated that Walnut Street should be opened across the railway company's right of way. We are convinced the legislature did not intend to withdraw from village and city authorities, the jurisdiction theretofore granted them over this subject." Upon rehearing, the court refused to recede from its opinion, and said: i'Tf those provisions of statute are constitutional and the village authorities have proceeded regularly and ordered the street opened over the right of way and tracks of the company, and a proper crossing constructed, the courts will enforce such order as they will the orders of the Railway Commission in matters within its jurisdiction. The village is not required to ; </seg>
            <seg id="p169">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 169 wait for the approval of the Railway Commission, but is entitled to immediate obedience of its proper order in that regard. II the Railway Commission can review and approve the findings and orders of the village authorities, it can of course also annul them, and, both being administrative bodies the right to open and con - trol the streets and regulate railroad crossings within the village would thereby be taken away from the local authority and con - 4 «j oi_j n l : i_:_i- i_ j *- iv. * * ferred upon the State Commission, which is contrary to the plain Tetter of the statute." In State, ex rel., P. C. Jensen, et al., appellees, v. Omaha and Southern Interurban Railway company, 103 Neb. 40, which, it will be noted, involves the defendant in this case, the court says: "The first point argued is that, after a legal highway has been established, application for a railroad crossing should be made to the railway commission. Several cases are cited in which language is used implying that the railway commission has juris - diction as to railway crossings over highways. This is true in a certain sense. If crossings were about to be built in such a manner as to jeopardize the running of trains, or to affect the convenience or safety of operation of the railroads, there can be no doubt that the railway commission would have power to require a different method of crossing to be installed. But it has no power to determine whether or not a highway shall extend across the right of way of a railroad company. This is the function of the county authorities. To give the commission such power would allow it to veto the opening of any public highway which crossed the right of way of a railroad. Neither the constitutional amendment creating the commission, nor the statute defining its powers, confers such authority upon it." And further on - "If there was no legally established highway connecting with the road petitioned for across the right of way, and no necessity for the condemnation, as respondent now asserts, it should have appeared and objected on this ground when the establishment of the latter road was under consideration by the county board. It is too late to raise this question now. Neither can the cost of the bridge be considered. This goes to the question of damages. If the amount of the damages allowed by the appraisers and county board was insufficient, an appeal might have been taken. "It is said the county board had no jurisdiction to establish this road as it is a mere pleasure drive. The discretion of the county board in the establishment of the road cannot be attacked in this collateral manner. This question also should have been raised at the hearing." Both of these cases were decided prior to the amendment of the crossing statute in 1921. While the present law gives the Com - mission more latitude in determining the kind of crossing that shall be established over or under a railroad, it apparently does not modify the doctrine laid down in the cases above quoted, to the effect that the establishment of the highway is the sole prerogative of the state, </seg>

(2) That under the pleadings and evidence it appears there is no necessity for the construction of an overhead bridge, nor is there evidence that the condition will ever be changed so as to make such overhead crossing necessary. (3) That, whereas there were no conditions existing at the time complaint was filed, or at the time order was entered requiring the construction of an overhead crossing, there is no justification for, nor jurisdiction in the Commission to make such order. (4) That the Commission, being without authority to require Sarpy County to place the highway leading to the proposed overhead bridge in a reasonably passable condition, it was improper to make the conditional order. (5) That since the highway is not in a passable condition and there is no affirmative proof that it ever will be put in passable con - dition, the Commission has no power to make the order. t(6) That the enforcement of the order would not be of any mable benefit to complainant, or to the people living in the com - ity, and would be financially disastrous to defendant company. .Argument was had on this motion in the offices of the Com - mission, on Thursday, March 11, 1926, counsel for both parties ap - pearing.

Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 546 J. F. Moredick, Complainant, v. Union Pacific Railroad Company, Defendant. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: LThe complaint herein was filed by J. F. Moredick, Chairman of State Legislative Board of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, against the Union Pacific Railroad company, a common carrier for hire, for running gasoline motor cars, sometimes singly and some - times with a trailer or coach attached, carrying passengers, mail, baggage and express, on its main lines outside of yard limits each with a crew consisting of a motorman and conductor, but without either brakeman or flagman. The complaint alleges a violation of section 6385, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, which reads as follows: "It shall be unlawful for any railroad company doing business in the State of Nebraska to operate or run over its roads or any part thereof, or suffer or permit to be run over its road or any part thereof, outside of the yard limits, any passenger, mail or express train carrying passengers, whose regular equipment consists of more than five cars, with a crew, consisting of less r, one fireman, one conductor, one brakeman and further provided, passenger trains whose regular s of five cars or less, may be operated with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one conductor and one brakeman or flagman." Specific instances of violation were charged. The defendant answered, alleging that in the instances complained of three men were employed, viz., a motorman, a conductor and a van, the baggageman being in all instances competent and to do flagging and further alleged that no more were neces- sary. Portions of the complaint were abandoned by complainant at the ■ing. It was narrowed to a charge of violation of the statute. It appears from the evidence that in each instance where there </seg>
            <seg id="p173">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 173 was a "trailer" or coach attached to the motor car three men, viz., a motorman, a conductor, and a baggageman were employed, and that the baggageman, who is competent to flag, was at all times available as a flagman at the direction of the conductor. It is conceded by the r plaint that there is no need of the fireman, that he would have functions to perform and that he may be dispensed with, without violation of the statute. The sole question then is whether the omis - sion to carry a brakeman or flagman, where a motor car is operated singly, is a violation of the statutory provision above quoted. The first consideration is whether or not a motor, operated singly, is a train within the meaning of the statute above quoted. The Com - mission has had occasion recently to consider this subject in connection with the operation of bridge derricks, Formal Complaint No. 554, J. F. Moredick v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. C, 19 N. S R C. 176, and our conclu - sion there reached is that a self-propelled bridge derrick, operated singly, does not constitute a train within the meaning of Section 5337, which relates to freight trains. The same reasoning applies to the operation of a motor car, singly, with respect to Section 6336. In addition to the conclusion reached in Formal Complaint No.554. supra, there is a further consideration. The statute above quoted was approved March 31, 1909. At the same session an act was passed relating to the operation of gasoline motor trains or gasoline motor cars. The latter act, chapter 97, laws 1909, was approved April 3, 1909. The first two sections are as follows: "That each and every railroad company operating gasoline motor cars or gasoline trains in this state on which passengers are transported, shall on and after January 1st, 1910, cause such cars to be equipped with separate toilet closets for men and women and shall also maintain a smoking apartment; either as a separate . .i . . i_j i__ i^^i. i =*m l - n — VI— ...«11 car in the train or completely partitioned off by a suitable wall and tightly closing door and suitably furnished." "The State Railway Commission shall have power to release any railway company from the provisions of this act on new roads where steam passenger trains have not been regularly run until such time as the business will warrant better service, also on parts of roads where at least one steam passenger train is run, ■ .*\ a « i _a 1 i • J !_ At »_ »1 !J_O which makes regular stops at least six days in the week. Provided that mixed freight and passenger trains shall not be considered passenger trains." These two acts must have been considered simultaneously by the legislature. They indicate that the legislature itself differentiated between trains and motor cars operated singly. It is concluded that a motor car operated singly is not a train within the meaning of section 5336 and may be operated without a brakeman or flagman. </seg>
            <seg id="p174">174 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The reasons leading to the conclusion that a motor car may be operated singly without a brakeman or flagman indicate that where a "trailer" is used a brakeman or flagman should be employed. As above stated it is shown in all the specific instances complained of that a flagman was available, so that under the evidence we conclude there was no violation of the statute and that the complaint should be dismissed.

It is alleged in chief that the property is' old; that the instruments are erratic and the lines too frequently out of commission; that poles break down under moderate weather stress, wires break, and that interruptions to service have been exas - peratingly frequent. A very considerable number of witnesses testified in such detail as to rather sustain the allegations in the complaint. The remedies suggested by complainants were first, reconstruction of the property, second, the location of a repair man at Filley, readily accessible when </seg>
            <seg id="p175">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 175 This property is about twenty years old and was rather lightly constructed. It is approaching a period of major replacements, par - ticularly in the distribution system. It is evident that defendants have been attempting to get as much life as possible out of units. This is in the interest of economy and is to be commended. They appear, however, to have erred somewhat on the side of economy, with the result that service at Filley has not been up to standard of efficiency sought by and generally achieved by this company. A more liberal policy for the next year or two, of pole replacements should be fol - lowed and some rather extensive wire replacements should be made. These things can be done with due regard to economy anH remaining life in certain portions of the property. Detailed directions from the Commission as to what is essential might and probably would result in waste. Low rates can only be maintained when all passible econo - mies are followed. t Complainants suggest the location of a lineman at Filley. There only about 80 subscribers on this exchange. If a lineman is re - ed from a larger exchange and is to serve more than one exchange, what would be Filley 's gain would be some other territory's loss. There is not enough work at Filley to occupy one-fourth of a lineman's time. Such a remedy should not be essential to proper service. LWe will not enter an order at this time. No order should be ssary. In the light of our findings the company can proceed according to its best judgment, altering its settled plan only to meet the conclusions here expressed. We will, however, call for a consolidated statement monthly for four months regarding reported trouble from Filley and the nature of the trouble by classification, together with a statement of the aver - age time after the report was received, before the trouble was cor - rected, and also particular details of each case where trouble is not rred within three days. We will also require monthly statements the above period of the work done on the plant. We recommend also that subscribers may appoint a committee of one or three, to keep also in touch with the question of adequate service and lapses from adequate service, and from time to time to file with us their conclusions on the matter and any detail in support of those conclusions deemed advisable. If at the end of six months' time, the checks we are here providing for indicate that service is still inadequate, an order will be entered. The spirit evidenced by both company and subscribers indicates how - ever, that cooperatively all necessary adjustments can and will be maae. </seg>

Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 554 J. F. Moredick, Complainant, v. Chicago, Burlington tc Quincy Railroad Company, Defendant, OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This is an application filed by J. F. Moredick, Chairman of the Nebraska State Legislative Board of the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, against the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad com - pany. It is alleged that on or about May 6, 1925, and continuing for a period of seven days thereafter, and at other times, the defendant, a common carrier by railroad, operated a self-propelling bridge derrick, "work extra" train number 204611, outside of yard limits on its main line track near Sweetwater; also a few days later the derrick was operated on its main line track near Berwyn, with a crew consisting of only one engineer, one fireman and one conductor; that no brakeman was employed on the train notwithstanding the fact that said "work extra" train had to be protected against other work extra trains and main line local and passenger trains; that the safety and convenience of the public and of the employees of the defendant require that self-propelling bridge derricks and "work extra" trains be operated with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one conductor and two brakemen; that such number of employees is required under section 5337 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, The prayer is that the Commission direct the defendant to oper - ate self-propelling bridge derricks and work extra trains each with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one conductor and two brakemen. The defendant's answer admits the formal allegations and admits that it operates the self-propelling bridge derrick on main line tracks, </seg>
            <seg id="p177">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 177 outside of yard limits, with only one engineer, one fireman, one con - ductor and no brakeman. It denies that it is required under section 5337 of the statutes to employ a brakeman thereon owing to the fact that self-propelled bridge derricks are not used in the transpor - tation of either passengers or freight but are solely instruments for the construction and repair of the defendant's facilities. The juris - diction of the Commission is also denied. A hearing was had at which the methods of handling and operat - ing bridge derricks were fully shown. The derricks or pile drivers move under their own power when going short distances between stations. In moving long distances they are usually attached to trains and become a part thereof. If an emergency exists, they some times move longer distances under their own power. There is the same necessity for flagging that there is in case of ordinary trains. They move undeT train orders from the dispatcher. The con - ductor in charge of the derrick receives the train orders from the dispatcher. When it becomes necessary to protect the derrick while it is on a main line, the conductor directs the bridge foreman in charge of the bridge building gang to designate one of the gang as a flagman. The conductor then gives the designated man proper direc - tions as to how to flag. The bridge crews that are sent out on the derrick vary in number but always contain some skilled men. The man who is selected as a flagman is a skilled man. He is not, however, necessarily one who has passed an examination in the operating rules. There are always at least three examined and com - petent men in each crew who understand flagging. There is no set rule as to putting a flagman on a bridge derrick but where they are needed they are supplied under the orders of the superintendent of the division. Sometimes, where the work is to last a considerable period of time, a spur is built on which the pile driver is run when other trains are using the main line. While the complaint is founded on an alleged violation of statute, which this Commission cannot enforce directly, no reason is perceived for declining to hear the complaint. The Commission is required by statute to investigate violations of law. Sec. 5467 Comp. Stat. of Neb., 1923. Furthermore, the Commission has jurisdiction of service, facilities and equipment of railroads. Sections 5521-5522 Comp. Stat. of Neb., 1922. Unless legislative action has covered the subject the Commission has power to provide regulations. The posi - tion of the defendants, that the Commission is without jurisdic - tion, is untenable. The sale question is whether the additional men are required under section 5337, Comp. Stat. for 1922. It reads as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p178">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 178 "It shall be unlawful for any railroad doing business m Ne - braska to operate or run over its road, or any part thereof, or to suffer or permit to be operated or run over its road, or any part thereof, outside of yard limits any freight train which is not manned with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one conductor and two brakemen: Provided, main line local fseigbt trains running one hundred miles or more and carrying passen - gers, local merchandise and doing station switching shaU be provided with a crew consisting of one conductor, one engineer, one fireman, and three brakemen." .The first consideration is whether or not a self-propelled derrick is a train. The definition of a train, in the latest International dictionary is "A connected line of cars etc, on a railroad, without or with the locomotive." The encyclopaedic dictionary defines it as "A continuous line or series of carriages on a railway coupled with the engine". The Century dictionary defines it as "a connected line of car - riages, cars or wagons intended to be moved on a railway". In derivation and in its ordinary use the word "train" connotes a continuous or connected line of objects drawn by some common motive power. kThe reported cases, with a few exceptions, use the term "train" applying only where there are a locomotive and one or more cars. In Dacey v. Old Colony R. Co., 153 Mass. 112, 26 N.

Complainant calls attention to the definition of a train in the operating 1 rules of Nebraska carriers, which is as follows: "Train — An engine, or motor, or more than one engine, or motor, coupled, with or without cars, displaying markers".

Bartos, Complainants, v. Chicago, Burlington * Quincy Railroad Company, Defendant Appearances: For complainants — Bartos, Bartos &amp; Placek, attorneys. For defendent — Jesse L. Root, attorney. L. B. Lyman, general superintendent. F. C. Darrow, chief assistant engineer of maintenance of way. W. G. McDonald, superintendent of buildings. W. F. Giles, division superintendent. OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL, Commissioner: I The complaint in this proceeding was filed by the city of Wilber, mayor and the members of its council and F. W. Bartos. The first se of action relates to the depot facilities at the city of Wilber. After alleging formal matters with regard to the corporate organiza- tion of the complainant, city of Wilber, and with regard to the cor- porate organization of the defendant railroad company, the complain- ants describe the condition of the depot as inconvenient, inadequate, unsanitary and unsightly. They set forth the character of the com- munity and the surrounding country, giving a general description of the buildings and of the business and other activities carried on. They pray that the Commission will order the construction of a new a second cause of action the petitioners allege that the live c feeding yards or loading yards, maintained by the defendant within a block of the main street of the city and in such position o be highly objectionable; that the yards are ill-maintained and initary to a degree endangering the health of the community. They pray for the removal of the stockyards. Objection was made to the jurisdiction of the Commission to hear the second cause of action. On account of the form of the allegations of the complaint we sustained such objection and no evi- dence was received thereon. We do not wish to be understood, how- ever, as deciding that we have no jurisdiction over stockyards. We have such jurisdiction and should not hesitate to exercise it under proper allegations. The answer admitted that the city of Wilber has grown from a small hamlet to a city of more than fifteen hundred inhabitants, </seg>
            <seg id="p181">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 181 Ethe territory about Wilber has become much more densely popu - i and has been highly improved. It also admits general state - ts as to conditions in the city of Wilber. tit alleges, generally, that the terminal facilities at Wilber are uate and sufficient and admits that it refuses to construct a depot. I It also pleads a defense to the second cause of action but owing the ruling of the Commission it will not be necessary to set it forth herein. - The defendant also alleges that to do and perform the things that are requested by the complainant would involve an expenditure of from $20,000 to $25,000 without adding anything to defendant's income and without furnishing the public any convenience, that is reasonably necessary, that is not afforded at the present time by the facilities at the station at Wilber. The answer also denies the jurisdiction of the State Railway Commission over railway stations and alleges that the Interstate Commerce Commission has exclusive jurisdiction Hearing was held May 20, 1926, at which a large amount of tes - timony was taken. Briefs were submitted by the attorneys for the respective parties, and the complaint now comes on for determination by the Commission. The jurisdictional matter will be first considered. The sole purpose of the application is to secure adequate and sanitary provisions for patrons of the road using the depot. The civic pride of the community may demand a depot in keeping with the general appearance of the city but we shall not order greater facilities than necessary on that account, we shall base our order solely on the needs of the community for a larger and better ar - ranged waiting room, a better express room and for more sanitary toilet arrangements and shall ignore other considerations. t Prior to the enactment of the statute on the subject of depots, supreme court of this state in, State v. R. R. Co. 17 Nebr. 647, d that, in the absence of a statute, legal authority existed to require railroad company to erect and maintain a depot. The court said: "The more important and quasi-public question of the power of the courts in the absence of legislation to compel the respondent to establish and maintain a depot at Blue Springs, is raised by respondent in its brief, and that question will be first considered." "But in the opinion of this court it has authority to grant relief in cases such as that presented in this case, yet for the source of its authority it must look to the principles of the com- mon law rather than to legislative enactments." </seg>
            <seg id="p182">182 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT While some courts have declined to order the construction of depots, in the absence of a statute authorizing such action, no ques- tion seems to have been raised where a statute gave such authority. After the adoption of the constitutional provision creating this Commission and after the enactment of the statute, now Section 6874, Compiled Statutes of 1922, an application was made to require the erection and maintenance of a depot at University Place, C. R. I. »P. R. R. Co. v. Nebraska State Railway Commission, 85 Neb. 818. deciding in favor of the application, the court said: "The railroad company insists that the cost of constructing a I station and necessary side-tracks, etc., would much exceed the pecuniary benefit derived by it from such establishment, would not justify the outlay, and would be to that extent connscatory. The cost of the proposed improvement is not in all cases a proper test for determining the reasonableness of such an order. It is proper to be taken into consideration, but it is not con- trolling. It is not contended that the amount to be expended is so excessive that it will diminish the company's revenues, rela- tively, to any great extent. The mere fact that the income from the expenditure at that particular point upon its line may not earn a fair return upon the capital invested at that point can only he considered in connection with the revenue from the entire operation of the road within the state, at least. As said by Mr. Justice White in his opinion in Atlantic Coast line R. Co. v. North Carolina Corporation Commission, 206 U. S. 1, 26: "It fol- lows, therefore, that the mere incurring of a loss from the per- formance of such duty; does not in and of itself necessarily give rise to the conclusion of unreasonableness, as would be the case where the whole scheme of rates was unreasonable under the doc- trine of Smyth v. Ames, 169 U. S. 466, or under the concessions made in the two propositions we have stated. Of course, the fact that the furnishing 1 of a necessary facility ordered may occasion an incidental pecuniary loss is an important criterion to be taken into view in determining the reasonableness of the order, but it is not the only one. As the duty to furnish neces- sary facilities is coterminous with the powers of the corporation, the obligation to discharge that duty must be considered in connection with the nature and productiveness of the corporate business as a whole, the character of the services required, and the public need for its performance." Since the rendition of that decision the statute above cited has been supplemented by Sec. 5521 et seq., which specifically authorize the State Railway Commission to require railroad companies to pro- vide suitable facilities. Sec. 5874 reads as follows: ■ "Waiting rooms- water closets. Every railroad corporation shall keep open suitable waiting rooms and provide for convenient access to water closets for the accommodation of the passengers and the shippers of live stock at all passenger depots at least one-half hour before the schedule time for arrival of trains and until the departure thereof; and all such waiting rooms shall be </seg>
            <seg id="p183">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 183 made comfortable, and properly heated and lighted when nec - essary; and all such water closets shall be kept in decent con- dition. Section 5521 reads a. follows: "The state railway commission shall have and exercise juris - diction over the service, facilities and equipment of all railroads in this state and shall, upon due notice and hearing, render judgment, orders, and decrees as to the efficiency, sufficiency and safety of Jie service, facilities or equipment furnished; and if any service, facilities or equipment is found inadequate, insuf - ficient or unsafe, the state railway commission shall order such changes therein or additions thereto made as shall to the com - mission seem necessary to render the same sufficient, efficient and safe." In Northern Pacific R. R. Co. v. Territory of Washington, 142 U. S., 492, 35 L. Ed. 1092, the court declined to order a station as the statute&lt; made no provision for such action. In discussing the subject the court said: "The location of stations and warehouses for receiving and delivering passengers and freight involves a comprehensive view of the interests of the public, as well as of the corporation and its stockholders, and a consideration of many circumstances concerning the amount of population and business at or near, or within convenient access to one point or another, which are more appropriate to be determined by the directors, or, in case of abuse of their discretion, by the legislature, or by administra- tive boards entrusted by the Legislature with the duty, than by the ordinary judicial tribunals. "In Com. v. Eastern R. Co. the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, in holding that a railroad corporation, whose charter was subject to amendment, alteration or repeal at the pleasure of the Legislature, might be required by subsequent statute to construct a station and stop its trains at a particular place on its road said: "If the directors of a railroad were to find it for the interest of the stockholders to refuse to carry any freight or passengers except such as they might take at one end of the road and carry entirely through to the other end, and were to refuse to establish any way stations, or do any business for that reason, though the road passed for a long distance through a populous part of the state, this would be a case mani - festly requiring and authorizing legislative interference under the clause in question. And on the same ground if they refuse to provide reasonable accommodation for the people of any smaller locality, the Legislature may reasonably alter and modify the discretionary power which the charter confers upon the directors, so as to make the duty to provide the accommodation absolute. Whether a reasonable ground for interference is presented in any particular case is for the Legislature to determine; and their determination on this point must be conclusive. 103 Mass. 254, 258. Upon the same principle, the Supreme Judicial Court of Maine compelled a railroad corporation to build a station at a specified place on its road in accordance with an order of </seg>
            <seg id="p184">184 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT railroad commissioners, expressly empowered by the statutes of the State to make such an order, and to apply to the court to enforce it. Maine Stat. 1871, chap. 204; Railroad Com. v. Portland &amp; O. Cont. R. Co 63 Me. 270." The same question subsequently reached the supreme court of the United States from Minnesota, where there was a statute gov - erning the subject. M. &amp; St. L. R. R. Co. v. Minn. 193 U. S. 53, 48 L. Ed. 614. In sustaining the order requiring the construction at a station, the court said: "The statute, as thus construed, does not transcend the power of the state. In other words, and meeting exactly the contention of plaintiff in error the statute does not deny plaintiff in error the right to reasonably manage or control or arbitrarily take its property without its consent miDensation or due process of law. Wisconsin, R. &amp; its or without compensation or due process of law. Wisconsin, R. &amp; P. R. Co. v. Jacobsen, 179 U. S. 287, 45 L. Ed. 194, 21 Sup. Ct Rep. 115. To establish stations at proper places is the first duty of the railroad company. The state can certainly provide for the enforcement of that duty. An incorporated village might be said to be such a place without an express declaration of the statute. To make it prima facie so by statute and to impose the burden of meeting the presumption thence arising, certainly does not amount to an invasion of the rights of property or an un - reasonable control of property." See also, Covington S. Y. Co. v. Keith, 139 U. S. 128, 35 L. Ed. 73. Southern Ry. Co. v. State, 48 So. 236. The railroad company claims in this proceeding that the juris - diction which may have formerly been exercised by this Commission and has been transferred to the Interstate Commerce Commission by virtue of the Transportation Act, 1920. It is hardly conceivable that Congress would place jurisdiction over every depot in the United States in the Interstate Commerce Commission and wherever a controversy arose would either require the n to hold a hearing locally or require the parties and the to go to Washington. Congress unquestionably has power to vest the Interstate Commerce Commission with such in under the Commerce clause of the constitution and we only mention the effects bearing on the intention of the law makers. the Transportation Act, 1920, it should be premised that going through Wilber is operated in both inter- business, also that there is no evidence in the record that the making of the improvements prayed for at Wilber impair the power of the company to perform its would adversely affect the financial condition of or would require the issue of additional securities. </seg>
            <seg id="p185">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 185 Section 1, of the Interstate Commerce Act, as it originally existed, denned a railroad thus: "The term "railroad" as used in this Act shall include all bridges and ferries used by or operated in connection with any railroad, and also all the road in use by any corporation operating a rail- road, whether owned or operated under a contract, agreement or lease." I The act of June 29, 1906, amended the definition so that it read follows: "The term "railroad" as used in this Act shall include all bridges and ferries used or operated in connection with any railroad, and also all the road in use by any corporation operating a railroad, whether owned or operated under a contract, agreement, or lease, and shall also include all switches, spurs, tracks, and terminal facilities of every kind used or necessary in the transportation of the persons or property, designated herein, and also all freight depots, yards and grounds used or necessary in the transporta - tion or delivery of any said property." It now reads thus: "The term "railroad" as used in this Act shall include all bridges, car floats, lighters, and ferries used by or operated in connection with any railroad, and also all the road in use by any common carrier operating a railroad, whether owned or operated under a contract, agreement, or lease, and also all switches, spurs, tracks, terminals, and terminal facilities of every kind used or necessary in the transportation of the persons or property desig - nated herein, including all freight depots, yards, and grounds, used or necessary in the transportation or delivery of any such property." If Congress, by the Hepburn Act (June 29, 1906), actually occupied the field and put the jurisdiction over depots in the hands at the Interstate Commerce Commission all provisions of state law at once fell and the states were thereafter powerless to order the construction and maintenance of depots. That such was not true is evidenced by the fact that the case of M. &amp; S. L. R. R. Co. v. Minne - sota, etc., supra, was cited approvingly by the supreme court of the United States in Michigan Central R. R. Co. v. Michigan R. R. Com - mission 236 U. S. 616, 59 L. ed. 750 and in the C. &amp; N. W. R. R. Co. v. Ochs, 249 U. S. 416, 63 L. ed. 679; both of which cases were decided after the passage of the Hepburn Act. Thus prior to the Transportation Act it is clear that the states had the power to re - quire, through their regulatory bodies the construction arfB main - tenance of suitable depots. See also Atlantic Coast Line v. State, 234 U. S. 280, 58 L. ed. 1312. The company in this case cites and relies upon subdivision 2, of Section 8563 U. S. Compiled Statutes of 1923, which is quoted above. </seg>

Congress not having given the power to order construction to the Interstate Commerce Commission that power is still possessed by the states. The definition of a railroad above set forth in part of Section 1, of the Commerce Act as amended by the Transportation Act. The amendment must be read in connection with the previously existing provisions of the act. Texas v. Eastern Texas R I. Co. 258 U. S. 204, 66 L. ed. 566. Section 1, par. 17, a part of the Transportation Act, must also be read in connection therewith. It provides in part as follows: nothing in this Act shall impair or affect the right of a in the exercise of its police power, to require just and eise of its police power, to require just and and passenger service for intrastate business, in so far as such requirement is inconsistent with any order of the Commission made under the provisions of this Act" kit is clear that the general provisions contained in the para - iph defining railroads do not confer upon the Interstate Commerce mmission specific power tor require the building of stations, and, therefore, the matter is still a subject of state action. This is doubly assured by the provision of paragraph 17 cf section 1, above quoted. In the case of Alabama &amp; Vicksburg R. R. Co. v. Jackson, etc., Railroad Company, decided May 24, 1926 and cited by the plaintiff a similar situation was discussed by the supreme court. In the opinion it is said: "The Act to Regulate Commerce, February 4, 1887 chap. 104, 24 Stat. at L. 379, Comp. Stat. Par. 8565, 4 Fed. Stat Anno. 2d Ed. p. 379, provided, by what is now Par. 3 of Sec. 3, that car- riers shall "afford all reasonable proper and equal facilities for the interchange of traffic, between their respective lines;" but it did not confer upon the Commission authority to permit and to require the construction of the physical connection needed to effectuate such interchange. Paragraph 9 al Sec. 1, introduced by Act of June 18, 1910, chap. 309, Sec. 7, 36 Stat. at L. 539, 544, Comp. Stat Sec. 8563, 4 Fed. Stat.

Supp. 1920, p. 72, conferred upon the Commission additional authority, that it acquired full power over connections between interstate carriers. By paragraphs 18-20 added to Sec. 1, it vested in the Commis - sion power to authorize constructions or extensions of lines, al - though the railroad is located wholly within one state; and by paragraph 21 authorized the Commission to require the carriei "to extend its line or lines" By paragraph 4 of Sec. 3 it em - powered the Commission to require one such carrier to permit another to use its terminal facilities "including main-line track or tracks for a reasonable distance outside of such terminal." Justice Brandeis said that the only limitation set by the Trans - portation Act 1920, upon the broad power conferred upon the Com - mission over the construction, extension atad abandonment of lines is that contained in paragraph 22 of Section 1. That would, however, not mean that there was no limitation upon the power of the Com - mission with regard to the construction and maintenance of other facilities. This case does not involve the construction, extension or abandonment of any line. LThe only case in which the subject has been before the Supreme rt of the United States is in Railroad Commission v. So. Pac. Co. 264 U. S. 331, 68 L Ed. 713. In that case the Railroad Commission of California issued an order requiring the construction of a union station in the city of Los Angeles, and as a part of the order re - quired the extension of certain tracks and the abandonment of valuable terminal facilities then existing and which were adequate for the conduct of the business of the companies owning the same. The Supreme Court of California reversed the order of the State Commission, basing the opinion on Transportation Act, 1920. The case was then carried to the supreme court of the United States rre the decision of the supreme court of California was affirmed, its discussion the supreme court of the United States said: "This is a palpable distinction between the main tracks of an interstate carrier, and its spur, industrial, switching, or side tracks, and shows the legislative intention to retain any sub - stantial change in the main tracks within the control of the Inter - state Commerce Commission. It may well be that a mere relo - cation of a main track of an interstate carrier which does not involve a real addition to, or abandonment of, main tracks and terminals, or a substantial change in destination, does not come within paragraphs 18 to 21. One might, too, readily con - ceive of railroad crossings or connections of interstate carriers in which the exercise by a state commission of the power to direct the construction of merely local union stations or termi - nals without extensions of main tracks and substantial capital outlay should be regarded as an ordinary exercise of the police power of the state for the public convenience, and would not trench upon the power and supervision of the Interstate Com - merce Commission in securing proper regulation of an inter- </seg>

Only a lawful order of the Interstate Commerce Commission would raise a question of the power of (346) a state commission in such cases, as the proviso erf paragraph 17, Section 402, of the Transportation Act, shown: "That nothing in this act shall impair or affect the right of a state in the exercise of its police power, to require just and freight and passenger service for intrastate busi- ness, except in so far as such requirement is inconsistent with order of the Commission made under the provisions of this act."

If any further authority were needed it could be found in the records of this Commission and other state regulatory bodies where innumerable instances are reported in which railroad companies have been required to supply facilities after the enactment of the Trans - portation Act, 1920, and there was no thought of carrying them to the federal courts cm account of lack of jurisdiction. In the case of Lindeman v. St. J. &amp; G. I. Ry. Co., 113, Nebr. 284, the supreme court sustained an order of the Nebraska State Railway Commission requiring the building of a crossing long after the enactment of Transportation Act. In view of the language of the Supreme Court of the United States in the Los Angeles depot case above cited and the uniform practice of regulatory bodies and of the specific language of the transportation act itself, there seems to be no ground for saying that this Commission has no jurisdiction. We shall enter an appropriate order for the improvement of facilities at Wilber, which we feel are necessary to the reasonable convenience and to the comfort and safety of the persons using the station. It appears from the evidence that Wilber is the county seat of Saline county, Nebraska, having a population of about fifteen hundred inhabitants. The city maintains municipal water works, an electric light plant, storage plant, an ice plant and a steam heating plant. The city also has an extensive sewerage system, embracing both sanitary and storm water sewers. It has over six Pes of paving. At the time of the hearing in May, 1926, contracts I been let for nearly three miles more paving, all of which is lpleted at this time. There is a fine school house and a number church buildings. With but few exceptions the business houses are substantial brick buildings and the residences are for most part substantial and modern. The buildings both residential and business, are well maintained. The streets are well cared for and the city, in general, presents a very neat and prosperous appearance. </seg>
            <seg id="p189">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 189 The country tributary to the city of Wilber is largely in the val - ley of the Blue River and is one of the richest agricultural sections of the state. It is well settled and the farms are mostly well improved and in a high state of cultivation. In 1872, the defendant company constructed a line of railroad branching off from its main line at Crete in a southeasterly direction to Beatrice and Wymore. Wilber is located upon this line. Sub - sequently this extension was connected at Wymore with the main line between Kansas City and Denver. About two years after the railroad was constructed the company built a low one story frame building at Wilber which, due to the scanty population and small business done at that time, was of sufficient capacity. The building stands a little south of the main street where the ground was originally quite low. It was built upon piling or posts but later a foundation was put under it and some other improvements were made. Originally the floor was of wood. Afterward the wooden floor was removed and a brick floor was laid in the freight room and a tile floor in the waiting room. After the city established a sewage system and a water system the Cmpany partitioned off a part of the west end of the ticket office id installed a ladies' toilet, the door opening directly into the waiting room; it also partitioned off a small space in one corner of the wait - ing room for a gentlemens' toilet with the door opening directly into the waiting room. The waiting room is used by both men and women. It is small and the seats crowd close to the doors of the toilet rooms. There is a drinking fountain just between the two toilet rooms. There is no separate waiting room for ladies and it appears there is con - siderable smoking in the waiting room. The toilet facilities are bad and they are offensive and unsanitary. They are also located so that the entrances thereto are close to the seats in the waiting room and in full view of persons sitting therein, thus making them embarrassing to ladies. Owing to the small size of the waiting room and to the amount of smoking therein, it is also rendered additionally unsanitary and unsuitable for use. While it is true that the railroad company keeps the depot in as nearly a sanitary condition as a building of that kind and equipment can be kept, it is impossible to keep it in a really sanitary condition. A less important feature, but still worth mentioning, is the appear - ance of the structure, both inside and outside. It presents a very bad appearance in both ways and is not at all in keeping with the appear - ance of the city of Wilber and with the general surroundings. Our order, however, will not be based upon this ground but upon the incon - venience and inadequacy and unsanitary condition of the station. During the year 1926, the business transacted by the railroad company at Wilber was as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p190">190 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Revenue received from freight forwarded $ 40,145.04 Freight received 94,444.71 12,170.28 Ticket sales $146,760.03 Total There was no testimony introduced to show the amount of express, cream and telegraph business furnished the company at that point, but from the number of business houses located in the town and from ex - perience in cases where the volume of business is taken into consider - ation these figures would undoubtedly reflect sufficient revenue to bring the total business transacted at the station up to at least $160, - 000. With this amount of business furnished the railroad company by £ patrons of the road at Wilber and as the town is a county seat i, of considerable importance, and as has been recited having d streets, modern houses and substantial brick business buildings, the railroad company is not furnishing as adequate depot facilities as the traveling public and the citizens of Wilber are entitled to and the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the complaint of the citizens of Wilber asking for a new and more commodious depot should be sustained. We have carefully studied the record and considered the low and squatty character of the depot, its light construction and the fact that it has been added to and repeatedly repaired and have considered the cost of working over the old building and it appears to us that a renovation of the building would be a mere make-shift and that the construction of a new building is the only reasonable method of rem - edying the difficulty. We, therefore, find that the company should construct an entirely new depot suitable in size and suitably appointed for the convenient, comfortable and sanitary care of its patrons and convenient and sanitary for the care of food products that are stored t There should be a general waiting room, and a separate rest m for women and smoking room for men, with toilet facilities for h and a drinking fountain located remote from the toilets. While shall not prescribe the exact size of the station or the material with which it is to be built, we think that it should be relatively as good as the stations at DeWitt and Friend, both of which are in Saline county. The station at Tecumseh seems to have an ideal arrangement, but it is not necessary to build as large a station as the Tecumseh station, at Wilber. A depot on the plan of the one at Tecumseh, but of the size of that at DeWitt would probably be sufficient.

Defendant carrier resisted the complaint, first because it was alleged that such viaduct was unnecessary, and second because no- highway existed across their right of way at the point it was desired the overhead crossing be located. Under the terms of Sections 5524 to 5529, inclusive, compiled statutes of Nebraska for 1922, the Commission took testimony for the purposp of ascertaining whether an overhead crossing was es- sential. No road exists for a distance of one mile on the east side of the section immediately east of the town of Tobias. Virgin soil for approx- imately the required width, indicates that adjacent property owners considered that a highway had been established. In the middle of the section and running at right angles to the section line, the railroad crosses in a cut some fifteen to seventeen feet deep. This section line is open south of the section in the direction of Daykin, and north from the north side of the section in the direction of Friend. Neither the north road nor the south road is the main highway to the two towns. No homes have been built adjacent to the unused highway in this mile. Before dealing with the neccessity for other than a grade cross- ing at this point, it is essential to determine whether the Commission has jurisdiction over the matters complained of. The railroad at this point was constructed in 1884. On July 7, 1885, petition was filed with the county board of supervisors, asking for the opening of a highway north and south for a distance of several miles, of which one mile is that involved in this complaint. On July 9, according to the county records, the county commissioners, acted upon the petition and established the road. All the road involved in that resolution is now a highway and being used, except the one mile, which is crossed by the railroad. The action taken was evidently, as shown by the resolution of the county board, under the provisions of Section 2598, and was pre- sumed to be a consent highway. It must be assumed also that the signers of the petition were, in the opinion of the board, all those who owned land which would be taken by the county in establishing the highway. The name of the defendant railroad, however, does not appear upon the petition. Because this was a consent highway, the usual procedure of survey, report, notice, hearing and award of dam- </seg>
            <seg id="p193">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 193 Section 2598 provides that before a consent highway may be es - tablished, all owners of land which would be taken for highway pur- Eis, must sign the petition. The question is presented as tor whether easement of the right of way at the point where the railroad ses the highway, constitutes an ownership within the meaning of Section 2598. This question is settled in Missouri Pacific Railroad Company v. Cass county, 76 Nebr. 296, 400, wherein the Supreme Court of the state said in a similar case, "We think, however, that for the land condemned within the plaintiff's right of way for public use there should have been compensatory and not mere nominal damages awarded. It matters not whether the right of the plaintiff in the land was a mere ease - ment or a fee simple title. It had acquired its right by its own condemnation proceedings and was entitled to the uninterrupted use and enjoyment of the right of way. subject only, as all property is, to the right of eminent domain." tAll section lines in Nebraska are potential roads, 54 Nebr. 443, but me actual existing roads only under certain procedure. It is ent that the county commissioners in the action in 1886, did not iider the railroad as a property owner under the provisions of Section 2598, which was then on the statute books. Hence, it seems clear that this particular road, as it relates to the portion assumed to cross the railroad right of way, was never legally established. There has been no easement acquired by adverse use. This Commission acquires jurisdiction as to the nature of a crossing of a highway and a railroad, only when the county has legally established the road, C.R.I.&amp; P. v. Nebraska State Railway Commission, 88 Nebr. 239. We must find, therefore, that we have no jurisdiction to designate the kind of crossing involved in this complaint, until such time as the county commissioners shall have completed the establish - ment of the road. In this conclusion, the county attorney of Saline county appears to have acquiesced. In the light of these conclusions, it is not necessary to discuss the question as to the necessity of an overhead crossing as compared with a grade crossing.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman Between October 27 and November 11, 1922, inclusive, complain - ant moved four carloads of sand from Fremont to Florence, via Chic - ago &amp; North Western Railway comany and Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company, paying thereon the sum of the locals over Omaha, or 6- % cents per cwt. Between October 31 and November 11, 1922, inclusive, complainant moved 49 carloads of Kd from Sandall to Florsnce, via Union Pacific Railroad company, and cago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company, paying thereon the sum of the locals over Omaha, or 6-J cents per cwt. By petition filed with this Commission January 19, 1926, complain - ant alleges that the rate paid was unreasonable, and asks for repar - ation from the North Western and the M. &amp; O. in amount {152.75 and from the Union Pacific and M. &amp; O. in amount $1,798.89, with interest in both instances. Defendant carriers plead the specific statute of limitations set forth in section 5500, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. </seg>
            <seg id="p195">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 195 No challenge was made by defendants that the shipments moved as alleged and that complainants paid the sum of the locals over Omaha, or 6-1 cents per cwt. At the beginning of the hearing, de - fendants moved dismissal of the complaints on the ground that the claim for reparation must be filed with this Commission not later than two years after the alleged unreasonable 1 rate had been paid, and that in the present instance, a period of approximately four years had elapsed. Complainant's position is that it did, through Formal Complaint 461, file charge that it had paid an unreasonable rate, and an implied request for reparation, and that this complaint was still alive, placing complainant within the time limit of the law in which to file its de - mand for refund. We must, therefore, examine the proceedings before the Com - mission, both regarding' the two complaints here concerned, and cor - related matters. On November 6, 1922, during the period when the shipments to Florence were moving, and before the last of them had moved, a complaint was filed by the National Construction company against the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company, praying for an order against that carrier to publish a reasonable charge for switching cars between Omaha and Florence, "and for such other and further orders as the Commission may deem just and reasonable". The body of the prayer indicated that it desired to be named in the switching tariff of the defendant, with a rate between Omaha and Florence of $6.25 per car for switching, a rate which ordinarily would be absorbed by the line haul carrier. If such order were entered, complainant would pay 3 cents where it, under the tariffs, was paying 6-% cents per cwt. On January 16, 1923, the Omaha road filed an application, asking authority to amend its switching tariff to include the National Construction company. This application was approved on January 27, effective on one day's notice to the Commission. On January 15, complaint in Formal Complaint No. 461 directed the Commission to dismiss the complaint, inasmuch as the carrier had conceded, by its Application No. 5036, the contentions of complainant in Formal Complaint 461. The Commission, therefore, under date of March 1, 1923, did dismiss the complaint without a hearing. In neither application of the carrier or in complaint of the National Construction company in Formal Complaint No. 461, was any reference made to any shipments which may have moved under the combination of the locals against which complaint was made. No complaint was, therefore, filed with the Nebraska Commission during 1 </seg>
            <seg id="p196">196 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT diction to order reparations was granted by the legislature in the en - actment of section 5500 of the Compiled Statutes for 1922. That statute set forth the procedure, which this Commission cannot amend. But complainant says that there was a verbal agreement that the carriers would make reparations on the shipments already moved, and that it would not have dismissed Formal Complaint 461 had it not been for this verbal agreement. It offered testimony to prove this contention. Its position is stated by Mr. L. J. Wickham, general manager erf complainant, on page 39 of the record as follows: "I am depending entirely upon a gentleman's agreement for refund, the same as nine-tenths of other business is conducted." The carriers offered no testimony in dispute of the allegation of the verbal agreement. It may be that a moral obligation rested upon the defendant carriers to have, within the time limit of the law, taken such steps as would have resulted in reparations prayed for. But when complainant rests its petition to this Commission upon a verbal agreement, the situation is changed. We find from the records and the pleadings in the two cases here involved, and the history on file with the Com nission concerning Formal Complaint 461 and Application 5036, that claims for reparation with which we are here concerned, were not filed in sufficient time to give the Commission jurisdiction.

FINDING AND ORDER Taylor, Chairman: In this proceeding, two complaints are carried under one number. While they run against the same defendant, they are not otherwise related. For purposes of clarity and convenience, therefore, we will consider them separately. LThe first cause of action relates to a grade crossing on the ty, state and federal highway running between sections 28 and 29, township 12, range 13, county of Sarpy. The highway crosses de - fendant's line of railroad at the top of a hill, and an underground crossing is prayed for. As stated, the road involved is a state and federal highway known as federal highway No. 16. It directly connects Fort Crook with Ral - ston and Papillion and also makes connection with the D. L. D. high - way running between Omaha and Lincoln. It has been graded and graveled with the exception of about three-quarters of a mile north of the crossing in question, and this of course has been held in abeyance awaiting decision with reference to what shall be done with this cross - ing. Traffic from the south and southwest to Omaha and South Omaha would naturally pass over this highway. Its importance as a public road, therefore, is well indicated. Testimony as to the condition of the crossing is all of one import. It is to the effect that the approach from the north is unusually steep, representing in the last 50 feet before the track is reached, an 18 per cent grade. It is even sharper immediately at the track. The railroad grade follows a ridge or hill, and the tracks are from two to three feet above the natural level of the ground. The descent on the south side is not so precipitous. One of the principal witnesses for com - plainant, Mr. John W. Towle, lives in Omaha but owns a farm on the Platte river, and makes frequent trips over this crossing between his home and the farm. Mr. Towle is a civil engineer connected with the Omaha Steel Works. His testimony with reference to the physical condition of the crossing, conforms to what has just been stated, and in addition thereto, he adds that the railroad is on a curve at this point so that the view from the north is completely obscured, it being necessary for the driver of a car or other vehicle to be practically on the track before an approaching train can be seen. The ascent to the track is so sharp that the car must be put in low gear, and in muddy weather it is almost impossible to negotiate the grade. In Mr. Towle's </seg>
            <seg id="p198">198 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT raska". He follows the practice of stopping his car, walking to the track and then signalling the driver to proceed when the way is clear. His daughter, Mrs. F. H. Bucholz, has occasion to visit the farm re- ferred to, five or six times a week during the summer, and testified that on July 17 her car containing seven people, was stalled on the track. William Zurcher, a farmer living 60 or 70 yards from the crossing, testified that during wet weather, people are compelled to drive into his yard and from there, use a private road over the track, thus es- caping the steep climb on the public highway. Heavy loads find great difficulty in crossing at any time. Gates Lilly, county com- missioner living one mile south, of the crossing, testifies that the grade is impassable from the north for a heavy load, or any mach- inery with a long wheel base, such as threshing machines, hay balers, etc The latter are likely to drag upon the rails in attempting to cross. Other witnesses testified to much the same facts, J. M. Gates relating that an automobile was hit at this crossing two or three years ago, and that other cars have stalled their engines and have had to be pushed clear of the tracks. Defendant's witnesses, including the division engineer who has personally surveyed the situation, do not dispute the testimony at to the condition of the crossing. It is contended, however, that the crossing could be avoided by making a detour to the southwest, where a bridge is already in place over a small stream. The engineer asserts that such detour would increase the distance only 440 feet, and that this alternative would prove much less expensive than the construc- |&gt;n of an underground crossing. He submitted an estimate of the st of an underground way, the figure for the structure being ,084.00 exclusive of grading. He estimates that 3,944 cubic yards earth would have tor be removed from the right of way, and 1,970 bic yards from the highway outside the right of way. Aside om the cost of removing the earth immediately under the track, which he placed at $1.10 per cubic yard, he offered no estimate as to the cost of grading. All the witnesses agree that it would be impossible to relieve the sharp approach to the track by an earth fill. The road slopes back sharply for a considerable distance to a point where it crosses a bridge, and dirt is not available at any nearby point with which to make a fill. . Complainant's witnesses, including Mr. Towle, civil engineer, object to the detour proposed, on the ground that it would greatly lengthen the road, that at least one bridge would have to be con- Exd, and possibly two, and even then, the road would not be actory as a highway. It is also insisted that the cost of such r would greatly exceed the cost of an underground structure. </seg>
            <seg id="p199">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 199 In view of the importance of this highway, it would appear that an adequate crossing is required at this point. Construction of the highway is being held up, and it is stated that if the present crossing is continued, it would be unwise to attempt to gravel the road. It is quite clear that the crossing in its present condition is dangerous. As traffic increases over the new highway, it would be - come an increasing menace to life and a great inconvenience to those compelled to use it for transporting heavy commodities. The detour proposed does not appear to be feasible since it would result in an unsatisfactory highway, the construction of at least one bridge, and an increase in the length of the highway with a probable cost that would equal, if not exceed, the construction of an underground way. Due to the contour of the ground, it is evident that the grade crossing at this point cannot be improved. The only alternative, therefore, appears to be to go under the tracks. This is feasible, as sufficient clearance can be secured under the rails, and no drainage difficulties are involved. We agree with the contention of defendant that all of the grade crossings in this state cannot be eliminated because of the prohibitive cost to the railroad company. In such a case as this, however, a separation of the railroad and the highway appears to be the only method of securing a safe and adequate crossing. We are of the opinion, therefore, and so find, that the present grade crossing at this point should be abandoned and an underground crossing to be constructed in lieu thereof. Defendant has urged that there should be a division of the cost between the county, state and railroad company. We have no authority to require such division. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company be, and the same hereby is ordered and directed to abandon the grade crossing where the public highway in Sarpy county, between sections 28 and 29, in township 12, range 13, crosses said railroad, and that in lieu thereof it construct an under - ground way under said track, adequate to accommodate said highway, plans for such structure to be submitted to this Commission for ap- Kval within ninety days from the date hereof, and such underground ssing to be completed by not later than June 1, 1927.

Appearances: For the complainant, H. A. Collins, county attorney, Sarpy Coun - ty. For the defendant, Judge E. P. Holmes, attorney, Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company, Lincoln. FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Chairman This is the second cause of action under Docket No. F. C. 563. It relates to the inadequacy of an underground crossing under de - fendant's line of railroad about three and one-half miles southwest of the town of Richfield. The railroad crosses over a public highway running between sections 8 and 17, township 13, range 12, Sarpy county. This is a state highway running east and west, and has re - cently been graded and graveled, and otherwise improved. The coun - try at this point is quite rolling and the highway in question traverses rather steep hills, the railroad cutting across the shoulder of the east ascent of one of them about 300 feet above the bottom of a ravine. The railroad does not intersect the highway at right angles, but runs in a northeasterly and southwesterly direction, so that the overhead bridge carrying the railroad is diagonal to the highway. The result is that the north pier of the bridge projects into the reconstructed highway to a point a little beyond the center, thus necessitating a re - verse curve in the road. The lateral clearance at right angles to the center line is 19 feet, but is 23-1/2 feet if taken diagonally. The complaint asks that the north pier which projects into the highway, be moved 15 feet further north so as to permit of extending the highway through on a straight line. Drainage under the bridge in the highway is complained of, and it is asked that this be remedied at the time reconstruction of the bridge takes place. The record as testified to by a number of witnesses, including the engineer representing the state highway department and the en- for defendant, supports the description of the conditions as above outlined. It is urged by complainants that the vertical clearance from the highway to the lower part of the bridge is less than 12 feet, and insufficient to permit safe passage of loads of hay, large vans, thresh- </seg>
            <seg id="p201">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 201 ing machines, etc. A wooden culvert extends diagonally across the highway under the bridge and is intended to handle the drainage from the hill. It has proven inadequate, however, and testimony clearly shows that during wet weather, water stands under the bridge and makes the highway slippery and unsafe. In surveying the new highway, the state engineer planned for a taight road under the bridge. He contends that the reverse curve der the existing bridge is not practicable because of a high bank on the east side of the bridge, the cost of removal of which would be excessive. It is his opinion also that adequate drainage cannot be secured under the present arrangement. Four photographs submitted by this engineer disclose that it is possible for drivers of vehicles ap - proaching from either direction, to see over the top of the bridge, and when within about 200 feet of the bridge, to see through it, so Eit the danger of collisions under the bridge is reduced to a minimum, count of vehicles passing on this highway was made for three days September, and shows that on May 15, 215 automobiles, trucks 1 other vehicles passed the bridge; on May 17, 182, and on May 19, i. So far as any of the witnesses knew, no accident has ever taken ,ce at this point. Defendant admits that the drainage is unsatisfactory, but offers to correct that by putting a 30-inch pipe through the embankment at one side of the highway. It is stated also, that the highway could be lowered at least a foot under the bridge, and thus afford clearance of approximately 13 feet. It is contended by the company that to lengthen the bridge to the extent of 15 feet would require a steel girder 48 feet long, and that the depth of this girder would have to be increased to five feet, which would result in cutting the overhead clearance one foot and five inches. The cost of lengthening the bridge would be between $18,000 and $20,000. It is estimated by the rail - road engineer that the present concrete abutments will last for an - other ten years. While the present bridge is not as satisfactory, per - haps, as it should be, and while its present condition interferes with the appearance of the highway, the record does not sustain the con - tention of complainant that it is unsafe or entirely inadequate. To subject the company to a large expenditure of money at this time, be - fore the full life of the bridge has been realized, appears to be un - warranted. Public safety is not seriously involved by the present con - dition. There are many dangerous grade crossings in Nebraska, and rs of them might be eliminated with the money that would be used improve the conditions complained of here. We are of the opinion, therefore, and so find that that portion of the complaint praying for the lengthening of the bridge, should be </seg>
            <seg id="p202">202 denied. The railroad company, however, will be required to provide adequate drainage, and to lower the highway so as to secure as much clearance as the physical conditions will permit. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the complaint, in so far as it applies to the lengthening of the bridge maintained by defendant over the highway between sections 8 and 17, township 13, range 12, Sarpy county, be and the same hereby is denied. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Chicago, Rock Island ft Pacific Railway company be, and the same hereby is required to pro - vide sufficient and adequate drainage under its roadway at the point just above described, preferably by an opening through its embank - ment, and to lower the highway across its right of way at this point to the fullest extent permitted by drainage and other physical condi - tions, such improvements to be completed on or before May 1, 1927.

For the defense, Roy Page, assistant general manager; J. A. C. Kennedy, attorney. For the Comission, B. E. Forbes, chief engineer. BY THE COMMISSION: I The Happy Hollow Club is a corporation organized and existing der and by virtue of the laws of Nebraska. The purpose of the •poration is to maintain and operate a country club near Omaha. In 1924, the club purchased and leased the ground fcr its present location which is seven miles from Omaha and lies between Pacific </seg>
            <seg id="p203">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 203 and Center streets one mile west of 92nd street. The club uses elec - tric energy for pumping water, lighting and cooking. Elaborate electric kitchen equipment has been installed in the club house and all buildings are lighted with electricity. The operating season is the six summer months, although service may be had in the winter if required and some energy is used in connection with the maintenance of the buildings. I Plaintiff made a contract with defendant to furnish ana install electric equipment and pole lines on its property at cost, plus fifteen cent, but has no contract covering the rate for service. No com - plaint is made on account of the expense of the above installation but discrimination is alleged as to the rates, particularly the fixed charge per month which continues through the year. The rates at the High - land Country Club, the Omaha Country Club, Carter Lake Club and the Field Club are cited as evidence. I Defendant is a public utility and owns and operates the light power plant in Omaha. It has extended its lines beyond the cor - tte limits of the city to supply the demands for suburban service. ;he time plaintiff began negotiations with the power company, the pany owned and operated a transmission line to 90th and Pacific ets. The line crossed the city limits at 72nd street and had been nded to 90th street with sufficient carrying capacity to supply ice for the territory adjacent. When the Happy Hollow Club ded on its present location the line was extended from 90th street t one and one-fourth miles to the new location. It has since d extended west on Pacific street two and one-half miles to the Highland Country Club. When the Happy Hollow Club began negotiations for service the company made a comprehensive survey of the territory to be supplied with service and the line was reconstructed from 55th to 90th street, with a transformer station at 72nd street to provide sufficient capacity for private residences along the line, the potential demand of the new additions and the Highland Club. The following statement shows the total cost of construction and its allocation to the plaintiff on the basis of transformer capacity: (A) 18,200 volt line from 56th ft Pacific Sts. to 72nd ft Pacific Sts., and step-down substation at 72nd ft x-acinc ou». . ---♦ o,i±o.vv - , B) 2800-4000 volt distribution system to Happy Hollow and Highland Clubs and to Father Flanagan's Home, exclusive of transformers 20,887.00 c Transformer capacity served by the construction in Item \A) -. &lt;"" o.yj%. </seg>

The established rule for rate-making provides for a fair return on the value of the property devoted to the public use after operating expenses and fixed charges have been deducted. This treats the prop - erty as a whole and points to general conclusions. A rate schedule spreads the charges between the different classes of services. The general rule assumes that all the property is used in common by the public. The schedule requires consideration of time, volume and char - acteristics of the service as they may be reflected in the use of the Here the cost of construction is directly related to the "»"")nni if computed on an average monthly or annual basis. The charges that flow from the investment are continuous irrespective of its use. The service may be transitory. This case is an illustration of a high demand during the summer months with little or no service required in the winter season. We have the construction cost west of 55th street divided on the basis of the existing and potential demand, for the different pur- G) Cost of (A) chargeable to Happy Hollow Club, (A x E) $ 1,450.00 H) Cost of (B) chargeable to Happy Hollow Club, (B x P) 8,650.00 Total construction chargeable to Happy Hollow Club $10,100.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p205">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 205 poses as determined by the transformer capacity required as a founda - tion for the fixed charges. The energy charge measures the volume of service at all times and includes operating expenses and fixed charges back of 55th street. In short, it is an attempt to allocate directly as much of the expense as possible as determined by the use of the property. Construction costs were not the subject of serious disagreement. The case turns on the application of a fixed charge. It is impossible to make electric rates on the basis of investment to reach each consumer. Such a rate structure would be cumbersome and unworkable as a practicable thing. In Omaha the city rates disre - garded this factor except as a whole. Defendant has a second zone, termed a suburban zone, and in that has superimposed a large user rate known as "country club" rate, available to any large user of cur - rent. The rate to this classification as a whole is not too high, and is not so alleged by complainant. It seems proper that all "country club" customers in a reasonable demand and may have little or no relation to the energy transmitted zone should be on the same rate, if that rate is reasonable for the classification, regardless of the favorable location of any one of such customers, measured by investment cost to reach him with an electric line. Defendant has used five percent for depreciation, one and one-half percent for taxes, five percent for maintenance and eight percent for re - turn on the additional fixed investment required for the service west of 72nd street. This is all depreciable property and of a nature that requires frequent replacement, with the exception of the copper wire which has a much longer life than the poles and transformers. A composite rate applied to all classes of power property might result in a lower figure and even if the company should not set aside as much as five percent computed on all of its depreciable property as a re - serve, this fact will not excuse the user of the service from his obliga - tion. Taxes have been conservatively estimated. The percentage of maintenance is admitted to be higher than the experience within the city of Omaha, but the additional two percent is set up by reason of the extra expense in maintaining suburban lines. The rate of return has been approved by the courts and if we were inclined to reduce it to seven percent we would have to have in mind that the full development in the use of the line has not been made and even if eight percent is used here, the probabilities are that the company will operate the line for a much lower return for a number of years. Discrimination is also alleged. The Carter Lake Club is on the Iowa side of the Missouri river and is supplied with electric energy from Council Bluffs, by a subsidiary corporation.

(SEAL) conditions in general are so entirely different from plaintiff's club that it cannot be used for the purpose of comparison. If the Happy Hol- low Club had been located in Omaha it is estimated that the invest- ment to provide service would have been $1,700 therefore the differ- ence between the investment on account of the suburban location and one in Omaha of $8,400 is used as a basis for the fixed charge. The other clubs referred to outside of the city limits are now, or will be shortly, required to pay on the "country club" schedule. It is true that the fixed charge to the Highland Club west of the Happy Hollow Club is less than the plaintiffs, but this results from the allocation of the investment on the demand basis. The energy charge to all clubs is practically the same. » Regardless of the method used in computation and as a fair test the schedule we find the answer in the fact that the average cost to the Happy Hollow Club per kilowatt including all charges, is 4.8c. As the consumption of current increases, the average will decline. It b a matter of common knowledge that few institutions outside of commercial and manufacturing lines, which have almost exclusively a day load, enjoy as low an average kilowatt cost as the plaintiff admits. ■e Commission believes and so finds that the "country club" schedule ered by the defendant is not excessive under existing conditions. The Commission also finds no discrimination as between customers of this class, which plaintiff has alleged. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the complaint as to rates and fixed charges on ac- count of electric service at the Happy Hollow Club, near the city of Omaha, running against the Nebraska Power company be and the same is hereby dismissed. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this ninth day of Sep- tember, 1926. </seg>
            <seg id="p207">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 207 FORMAL COMPLAINT NO. 567 North Platte Valley Cooperative Cheese Company, Complainant, v. rigo, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company and Union Pacifiic Railroad Company, Defendants. Appearances: For complainant, Clyde Mills, president; E. D. Warner, treasurer; Harold C. Marsh, of Marsh &amp; Marsh, Inc. and C. E. Childe of the Omaha Chamber of Commerce. For defendants, J. B. Driggs, assistant general freight agent, Chi - cago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company; C. Franken- berger, assistant general freight agent, Union Pacific Rail - road company. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This case came on for hearing on petition of the North Platte Valley Cooperative Cheese company against the Chicago, Burlington ft Quincy Railroad company and the Union Pacific Railroad company, asking that the Commission establish a lower rate than is now in effect on carload shipments of cheese, to Omaha from North Platte Valley cheese producing territory represented by Gering on the Union Pacific and Scottsbluff on the Burlington. The petition asks that a rate be established from Gering and Scottsbluff to Omaha on carload shipments of cheese not higher than the rate in effect from Wisconsin cheese producing points to Omaha which, in the record, is shown to be 84 cents per cwt. At the time of hearing the rate from Gering and Scottsbluff to Omaha on cheese, carload, was $1.07% per cwt. Cheese, carload, in Western Classification territory, which includes Nebraska intrastate traffic, is classified as 3rd class, minimum weight 20,000 pounds. The same classification applies in southern and offi - cial classification territories. From the record it appears that the manufacture of cheese in r North Platte Valley commenced about five years ago, has gradual - grown until in 1926 there are five factories located in the vicinity of Gering and Scottsbluff, with an estimated output this year of be - tween 1,000,000 and 1,500,000 pounds of commercial cheese. The industry has been established by a cooperative association of farmers </seg>
            <seg id="p208">208 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT E treated in dairying in that territory, and has been fostered and en - raged by business interests located in the producing territory. Ac - ding to the testimony, cheese is being produced in the North Platte ley that compares favorably with the cheese manufactured in Wis - sin. The plan of the association has been to market their output through a jobbing firm located in Omaha that handles cheese exten - sively. From the record, it appears that the North Platte Valley territory is well adapted to the production of large quantities of milk, on ac - count of the large sugar beet industry located there, when considered in connection with the production of alfalfa and sweet clover that are extensively grown in that territory. Witnesses for the complainant testified that a number of new cheese factories were expected to be constructed in the near future; that within a year or two, there would be from ten to fifteen factories operated in that territory. A witness for the complainant showed that the distance from a prominent Wisconsin cheese producing point to Omaha was 550 miles and that for a minimum car of 20,000 pounds, and at a rate of 84 cents, the total charges on a carload would be $168 or at a rate of 3.5 cents per ton per mile. For Gering and Scottsbluff the following Dist- Min. Gar- Total Gents per I The same witness introduced an exhibit that compared the rates cents per cwt. and the revenue per ton per mile in cents, for a number of commodities now being hauled from Gering and Scottsbluff to Omaha at a very much less rate than is in effect on carload ship - ments of cheese.

            <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 209 The following is quoted from the record: "At the bottom of .page 1 of Exhibit 3 I call special attention to the fact that the rate on cream in 10 gallon cans on baggage car service is maintained on the Burlington and the Union Pacific. The Commissioners are of course familiar with this cream traffic in Nebraska. It is handled by the passenger trains in cans loaded by the carrier at destination, and the cans are returned empty free of charge. The Gering to Omaha rate on 10 gallon cans, a can being substantially 100 pounds, is 80 cents and from Scotts bluff to Omaha the rate is 84 cents. It does seem obvious that if the rate for the transportation of this cream by passenger trains is 80 and 84 cents, and that is not in quantity lots, no carloads, then the rate on cheese by freight train without any empties returned, at 1.07 is out of line." t Defendants offered testimony tending to show that butter, eggs cheese are generally rated the same in the Western Classification tory, the rating being 2nd Class for less-than-carload and 3rd 3 when shipped in carload quantities. Mr. Frankenberger for the Union Pacific introduced an exhibit that showed that the 84-cent rate from Wisconsin points to Omaha, is blanketed over a wide origin ter - ritory the distance varying from 403 miles New Richmond, Wisconsin to 650 miles Manitowoc, Wisconsin; that in a portion of the Wiscon - sin territory the 3rd Class rate to Omaha is 96 cents while the com - modity rate on carload shipments of cheese is 84 cents per cwt. which is represented by the rate from Grain ton, 519 miles from Omaha, where* the commodity rate is 84 cents and the 3rd Class rate is 96 cents. CONCLUSIONS Generally speaking, commodity rates are established at less than classification rates and ratings, in order to give consideration in the rate to a quantity movement of a given commodity. This is the thing that we are asked to give attention to in this case, and from the record it does appear that some rate less than the classification provision should be accorded the commodity here under consideration. In this case we have before us the question of how much con - sideration should be given to a young and growing industry in the adjustment of freight rates between producing territory and a central point of distribution where consuming markets may be reached. In the record, complainants testified that they had loaded some cars of cheese with 30,000 pounds in a car, and that under certain circum - stances they might load 35,000 pounds in a car, but that excessive loading was detrimental to the shipment on account of the cheese containers not being constructed strong enough to stand excessive heavy loading. </seg>
            <seg id="p210">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 210 The carriers have established as a result of hearings before this Commission, and similar hearings before the Interstate Commission low rates on shipments of milk and cream on passenger trains from country stations to concentrating points where the same is manufactur - ed into butter. The fact that there is now in effect lower rates on small quantity shipments of milk and cream from the North Platte Valley territory to Omaha, handled in passenger train service, in cer - tain times of the year under refrigeration and the added expense of returning the empties, does appear to justify a lower rate than is now in effect on carload shipments of cheese from said producing territory to Omaha. The Nebraska Commission, jointly with the Interstate Commerce Commission, expects to enter soon upon an extensive investigation of the adjustment of intra and interstate Nebraska class rates. During the time that these class rates are under consideration it appears to us and we so find from this record that the present rate on carload ship - ments of cheese from Gering and Scottsbluff to Omaha is excessive and should be reduced. IFrom the record it appears that cheese can be loaded considerably excess of the minimum of 20,000 pounds now provided in the classification. The short-line distance from North Platte territory to Omaha is somewhat over 100 miles less than the average distance from Wisconsin producing points to Omaha. After a careful consideration of the facts of record the Com - mission is of the opinion and so finds, that a reasonable rate for the transportation of cheese in carload lots from stations on the lines of the Union Pacific and the Burlington west of Northport to the state R: inclusive, is 84 cents per cwt. for a minimum carload weight of 000 pounds. In reaching the conclusion herein found, we do not wish to be understood as laying down a precedent that pioneer in- Eies should always be given preference in making rates, although is a factor to be given consideration. Our decision has been ed in this case from the record as made before the Commission. The order herein entered will be made without prejudice to the carriers calling the rate herein established to the attention of the Com - mission, after a final decision has been reached in the pending class rate adjustment of Nebraska interstate and intrastate rates.

            <seg id="p212">212 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This matter came on for hearing before the Commission on a formal complaint of the Weeping Water Stone company of Weeping Water, against all Nebraska carriers. The petition alleges that "crushed limestone" as a substitute for oyster shells, is unlawfully discriminated against by reason of the fact that crushed oyster shells are allowed to be included with mixed car - load shipments of feed at the feed rates and that crushed limestone is not. In the testimony, it was shown that agricultural colleges have found from investigation that crushed limestone is a satisfactory sub - stitute for crushed oyster shells; that crushed limestone can be sold at about one-half the price that is asked for crushed oyster shells and that the complainant has equipped its plant for the furnishing of crushed limestone for feeding purposes. The carriers represented at the hearing said they had no objec - tion to allowing crushed limestone to be included in mixed carload shipments of feed in the same manner as is now provided for shells, clam, mussel or oyster, crushed or ground. The tariffs of Nebraska lines with regard to mixing carload ship - ments of grain and grain products provide as follows: "Shells, clam, mussel or oyster, crushed or ground, in mixed carloads with articles specified in Section B will take corn rates subject to the following note. Note 4. When shells, clam, mussel or oyster, crushed or ground, are shipped in mixed carloads with grain or grain products, the rates on the shells, actual weight, shall be the carload rate appli - cable to the highest rated grain or grain product in the car; the weight of the shells to be applied toward the minimum weight weight of the shells to be applied prescribed for such mixed carload." From the record in this case we are of the opinion and so find that crushed or ground limestone should be allowed to mix with grain products in the same manner as now provided for shells, clam, mussel or oyster. An order will be entered in accordance with these findings. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that all Nebraska lines viz: Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R.

In its application the company directs the Commission's attention to sub-paragraph (c) of the original order which provides in part « follows: </seg>

Because of the fact that applicant did not avail itself of the Commission's authorization until December 31, 1925, and conse - quently did not issue the stock which was authorized by the Com - mission, and which authorization was made contingent upon the above proviso and other requirements, applicant requests the Commission to amend the effective date of said requirement to December 31, 1925.

            <seg id="p215">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 215 SECOND SUPPLEMENTAL OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This applicant, by reason of an error made by its trustees in disposing of a certain block of securities, has issued $2000 of first mortgage bonds without Commission approval and now asks that the sale be validated. The reason for the issue of these securities is clearly set forth as a matter of record in a letter from the assistant treasurer of the company under date of October 29, 1925, which reads in part as follows: "The error in issuing $2000.00 in excess of the $730,000 au - thorized was first made by the Minneapolis Trust Company in this way. On May 1st, 1921, the Trust Company ordered pur - chased through their Bond Department $2000.00 bonds for the sinking fund account, and at the time these bonds were turned over to the sinking fund* they did not receive payment therefor. In other words, this purchase was not consummated. Therefore, the Huron Light &amp; Power Company records show $2000.00 less than was actually outstanding. Before the Minnapolis Trust Com - pany discovered their error, the Huron Light &amp; Power Company did some refinancing and Arthur Anderson and Company secured a statement from the trust company showing outstanding the erroneous amount. The Huron Light &amp; Power company records were then adjusted to agree with the Trust Company's erroneous statement. Just recently the Minneapolis Trust Company discovered their error and called our attention to it. We found them to be correct and collected from the old stockholders of the Huron Light &amp; Power Company $2,000.00 in cash, charging cash and increasing the amount of the Huron Light &amp; Power Company's First Mort - gage bonds outstanding." It is clear that these securities were issued without any inten - tional violation of the law and that the proceeds of the bonds were properly expended for corporate purposes. Under the circumstances and for reasons shown, we will validate the issue.

Appearances: For applicant — Leonard A. Flansburg, George A. Lee, attorneys. For city of Lincoln — C. Petrus Peterson, city attorney. For the Commission — Hugh LaMaster, assistant attorney general. OPINION AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: In the original order in this case, the Commission gave its ap - proval to the general plan of the Continental Gas and Electric cor - poration for the consolidation of The Lincoln Traction company and Lincoln Gas &amp; Electric company subject to conditions, one of which was that such consolidation should be consummated within one year. Upon subsequent showing that such consolidation could not be ef - rsd within that period, a supplemental order was issued extend - the time to March 7, 1926. Applicant now submits its petition for final authority to consoli - date. It avers that it has purchased all of the capital stock of Lincoln Gas &amp; Electric company, and with the exception of a few scattering shares, all of capital stock of The Lincoln Traction com - pany, and is prepared to amalgamate all of the physical properties of the two corporations with the exception of the transportation rperties of The Lincoln Traction company. A new corporation is be formed to take over for ownership and operation the electric, gas and heating 1 properties, but the street railway is to remain the property of The Lincoln Traction company. Application No. 6084, filed subsequently, is joined with the ap - plication for authority to consolidate and has been considered in connection therewith. It prays for authority to issue the necessary new securities and to make such transfer and interchange of securi - ties as are necessary in the consummation of the final consolidation. </seg>
            <seg id="p218">218 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT No protests were filed either in the original proceedings or in the present. Hearings have been had at which representatives of the city of Lincoln appeared but without prejudice to the applica- tions. Hatters of financing, operation, management and policy have been exhaustively inquired into. Applicant has exhibited a ready willingness to make full disclosure of all facts bearing upon the consolidation. The plan of consolidation proposed by applicant may be sum- marized as follows: First: A new corporation will be organized to be known as Lin- coln Public Service company. This corporation will commence busi- ness with an original issue of common stock of the par value of K 00,000. It will execute a mortgage to be known as Lincoln Pub- Service company's first and refunding! mortgage which will pre- fer the issuance of bonds in series, the first series of which will be known as Series A. Jn this series will be an issue of $1,500,000 of gold bonds of $1,000 denomination bearing the same date of ma- turity, same rate of interest, same provisions respecting redemption, and in all other respects to be similar to the present outstanding bonds of The Lincoln Traction company for which they will be ex- changed. An additional issue of $1,500,000 of bonds, same series, will be issued and deposited with a trustee for the sole purpose of retir- ing at or before maturity a like amount of the bonds of Lincoln Gas and Electric company. The new corporation would thus have $3,500,000 of stock and $3,000,000 of bonds outstanding. Second: To Lincoln Public Service company will be conveyed all the property of Lincoln Gas and Electric Light company, such conveyance being subject to the mortgage referred to in paragraph I. Upon the refunding of these bonds, Lincoln Gas and Electric Light company will be dissolved. Third: The Lincoln Heat, Light and Power company, a subsid- iary of The Lincoln Traction company, will for a nominal consideration convey all of its property which consists of heating* mains, to Lin- coln Public Service company. Thereupon the Lincoln, Heat, Light and Power company will be dissolved. Fourth: The Lincoln Traction company will transfer all of its property except the street railway tracks, overhead trolley and feeder lines and its rolling equipment to Lincoln Public Service com- pany free and clear of encumbrance. The consideration for this transfer will be as follows: PA. The exchange by Lincoln Public Service company of $1,500,000 of its bonds for a like amount of the bonds of The Lincoln Traction company. B. The cancellation of $700,000 par value of such bonds. G. The cancellation by the owners thereof of all of the preferred stock of The Lincoln Traction company amount- ing to $1,578,200. to </seg>
            <seg id="p219">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 219 D. The cancellation by the owners thereof of $352,000 par value of the common stock at The Lincoln Traction com- pany. Fifth: The Lincoln Traction company will continue in existence as owner and operator of the street railway system with an outstanding capitalization of $1,300,000 of common stock and $800,000 of bonds. The common stock will be owned by Continental Gas and Electric corporation, the bonds to be the property of Lincoln Public Service company and will be deposited as collateral under its mortgage. At present, the outstanding securities of all the companies in - volved in the consolidation aggregate $8,630,200. Under the proposed plan, the outstanding securities would amount to $8,600,000. This would result in a shrinkage of the total outstanding securities of $30,200. During the progress of the hearings and as a result of sugges - tions by the Commission and a more mature consideration of the problem, the plan was modified somewhat, more particularly with reference to the amount of real estate to be retained by The Lin - coln Traction company. The original intention was to convey all real estate to Lincoln Public Service company, The Lincoln Traction com - pany to be treated as a lessee. Under the modification, The Lincoln Traction company is to retain the machine shop, paint shop, car shed and the land upon which they stand, together with the east half of Block 102, except a small portion of Lots 9, 10, 11 and 12. The latter tract is to be used for storage tracks. The retention of this property by The Lincoln Traction company will not affect the consideration paid by Lincoln Public Service company. Proposed Status of the Lincoln Traction Company When the plan was first presented, there were misgivings as to its effect upon the future of The Lincoln Traction company. The situation of the street railway was discussed in the original opinion and is too well understood to require elaboration here. The pro - posal to segregate the transportation property from the more pros - perous electric and heating departments gave rise to the apprehen - sion that the owners contemplated abandoning the street railway to its fate without sustained effort to determine whether its condition could be improved. Happily a full development of all of the ad - vantages of consolidation, together with further assurances by the management as to their intentions, has dispelled such misgivings and proven to our satisfaction that the interests of the public in street railway transportation in the city of Lincoln are to be fully safeguarded.

(By Commissioner Randall) What is the reason you say five years instead of ten years, the life of the contract ? "A. Because the future of the street railway business is too [uncertain. The past five years have made us think serious- ly about continuing indefinitely investments in railway prop- erties, and ten years is rather too long to make a definite agreement, because when we make that agreement it is our intention to comply with it ,and I didn't want to make state- ments and then wish we had not, or ask to be released from them." Based upon the actual showing for the year ending September 30, 1925, there would remain, after payment of interest on $800,000 bonds, approximately $28,000, which under Mr. Denman's proposal, could be applied to the financing of street railway improvements. If ricipated economies due to consolidation are realized, this would increased to upwards of $54,000. In a period of five years, there- fore, there would be available for additions and betterments, over and above the regular expenditures for maintenance and deprecia- tion, more than $250,000. This should be ample. Under the plan for the transfer of the power plant of The tcoln Traction company to the new company, it is proposed that the «r shall sell to the former all the electric power it requires for operation of the street railway, plus a sufficient amount to sup- two electric railway customers, namely, Omaha, Lincoln &amp; Beat- rice Railway company and Lincoln, Capital Beach &amp; Milford Railway Eipany. A contract between the two corporations has already been otiated and is submitted to the Commission for approval. Under terms The Lincoln Traction company is to pay 1.6 cents per kOo- t hour for all energy delivered to its switch board in its plant </seg>

For each increase or decrease of ten cents per ton above or below the maximum and minimum named, the rate shall be increased or decreased .015 of one cent per kilowatt hour. The rate of 1.6 cents per kilowatt hour compares with a cost now being experienced by the traction company of 2.1 cents per kilowatt hour. Cost of conversion from alternating current to direct current is Ewed for in the comparison. The saving to the traction company, ■efore, amounts to one-half cent per kilowatt hour, aggregating ap - dmately $18,000 per year. b Provision against the uncertainty as to we Commission's juris - on over a contract of this nature is made in Section V of the con - ■ submitted, which is as follows: "It is further understood and agreed by and between the par - ties hereto that the price of electrical energy as hereinabove fixed shall not be modified in any way during the term hereof (except through action of the foregoing coal clause) without joint and mutual application for a new rate by the parties hereto to the State Railway Commission of the state of Nebraska, and the de - finite approval by the said State Railway Commission of any such new rate; provided, however, that the Commission may, upon its own initiative, and at any time during the term hereof, and upon notice to the parties hereto, order an inquiry and upon hearing de - termine a new rate base which parties hereto agree to accept. In case an application is made and approval secured, such order of the Nebraska State Railway Commission shall be deemed to be part of this agreement, and shall act as an automatic revis - ion of the rate schedule hereinabove fixed it being the intent of the parties hereto that the foregoing rate schedule (including any in - creases or decreases through action of the foregoing coal clause) shall be fixed and irrevocable, and subject to modification only by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, as hereinabove provided." This provision would appear to amply safeguard the public interest since it gives the Commission authority not only to approve when a change is submitted by the parties themselves but authorizes an in - vestigation on the Commission's own motion at any time. The con - tract appears to be equitable and in the public interest. It will be ap - proved. Applicant presents a carefully considered estimate of revenues and operating expenses for The Lincoln Traction company, giving full effect to the economies and adjustments that will result from the re - organization. The reduction in operating expenses and taxes will amount to $12,900 annually. This saving conies from the reduction in cost of electric power, a decrease in the salaries of the genera! officers and letral exDense and a substantial rf^duetion in federal state and local </seg>

An increase in gross revenue of $12,656 results from the transfer of the two electric railway customers above referred to from the electri - cal department of The Lincoln Traction company to the transportation department The net income of The Lincoln Traction company is increas - ed from $68,359.14 to $93,816.32. The operating ratio decreases from 86.64 per cent to 82.10 per cent. An analysis of the estimate of operat - ing expenses discloses a more than liberal attitude on the part of the management toward The Lincoln Traction company. The economies thus to be realized through reorganization, together with the assurance of the management as to its policy relating to the street railway prop - erty, indicates beyond a doubt that the consolidation insofar as it will effect this utility will be of distinct advantage and in the public inter - est EFFECT OF CONSOLIDATION ON OPERATION We can conceive of no useful purpose in presenting an extended review of the changes in plant and facilities which it is proposed to make as a result of consolidation. It is sufficient to say that appli - cant has presented a ninety-three page report made by its engineers, embodying their recommendations as to what should be done to amal - gamate the physical properties (except the electrical distribution sys - tem) for the most efficient operation. They propose five plans, the second of which has been adopted by the management and which in brief is as follows: "Plan Number Two contemplates the construction of an elec- trical tie-line between the two plants. The Traction plant under this plan, will furnish only such steam as is required to supply the - . . . . . «._« •!« _ 1i * heating system and generate only such power as will result for furnishing exhaust steam to the heating system." The savings estimated as a result of the application of this plan will be $139,000 per year, for all the properties. Mr. Denman in testimony supplemented at length the recommen - rions made by the engineers. Their proposals relate almost wholly improvements in the generating plants. Giving consideration to all of the savings, that will ensue as a result of consolidation, Mr. Denman places the figure at $200,000 a year. Complete plans for the re-routing rl amalgamation of the distribution systems have not been made. It anticipated that substantial savings in maintenance and carrying y result from such reconstruction. In the opinion te estimates made by applicant as to the savings «d from consolidation are conservative.

(as revised January 8, 1926) At the time the Lincoln Gas &amp; Efcctric Light company was organ - ised in December, 1901, the plant account was arbitrarily increased $1,574,100 over the amount shown on the books of the Lincoln Gas &amp; rtric company at date of closing November 30, 1901, and against plant account so set up was issued among other securities, $2,249, - 100 of common stock. That common stock has remained constant from that period until the present. During the period 1901 to 1925, the company has acquired a surplus of $1,153,410.45 which has been accumulated from revenue rl reinvested in the plant of the company. It was the operating plan this company to use its earnings in additions and betterments to its plant at the sacrifice of dividends. This plan of procedure would have the effect of putting value in the securities issued in December, 1901. In the above asset and liability statement of the Lincoln Public the franchise and intangibles is shown at $2,089,230. is arrived at by adding to the $1,574,100 heretofore men- which is the amount of the franchise and intangibles to the Lincoln Public Service company from The Lincoln General railway plant Franchise and intangibks Stocks and bonds of other companies Miscellaneous assets Total Assets $1,742,970 601,030 44 000 190,000 $2,578,000 LIABILITIES Common stock Bonds Miscellaneous liabilities Total Liabilities 1,300,000 800,000 478,000 $2,578,000 </seg>
            <seg id="p225">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 225 Traction company books with the property acquired. The amount of $2,089,230 here mentioned is greater in our opinion, than it should be in the opening entry of the Lincoln Public Service company. After due consideration of all of the facts of record the Conunis sion finds that the item erf franchise and intangibles, as set up in the proposed asset statement of the Lincoln Public Service company should be decreased $800,000, and as an off-set against this deduction common stock of said company should be reduced from $3,500,000 to $3,000,000, and from the surplus account should be deducted $300,000. At the time the Lincoln Traction company and the citizens and In - terurban companies were consolidated there was set up in the assets of the company under the title of "franchise and good will" an amount of $1,652,000 in round figures, which was off-set on the liability side of the assets and liability statement by the issue of $1,652,000 of com - mon stock. This action took place before the Commission had authority over the issue of capital securities of public service companies in this Ftats. The question of the issue of $1,652,000 common stock has been under consideration by this Commission and the court several times since the reorganization of The Lincoln Traction Company, and it ap - pears that now is a proper time for the cancellation of a considerable amount cf this franchise and good will item. In view of the fact that the combined operating company, the Lincoln Public Service company, will hold all of the securities of The Lincoln Traction company, the nearer the securities correspond to the property investment, the better it will be for the company and the public interest. In discussing this item of franchise and intangibles in the opening asset and liability statement of the two companies we are mindful of that the plant account of the Lincoln Gas &amp; Electric company The Lincoln Traction company has been increased only by the ac - tual expenditures of money for labor and material. It has never been the policy of either company to include in plant account any overhead expenses such as superintendence, engineering, interest during con - struction, and related charges, which now are quite generally taken in - to the plant account of public utilities companies. If the plant accounts were adjusted to show these overhead charges, the effect of the intan - gibles would be reduced. After making due allowance for the things here discussed, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that the item of franchise fcl intangibles shown in the asset and liability statement of The Lin - n Traction company after consolidation, which is shown to be $601, - 030, shall be decreased in the sum of $300,000; and a like amount of the common stock of the said company in an amount of $300,000 shall be placed in the treasury of The Lincoln Traction company and appear upon the balance sheet of said company as treasury stock. </seg>

PROPERTY VALUES The Lincoln Traction Company. The value of the property of the Lincoln Traction company devoted I the different services has been subject to review and check by the nmissicm for a number of years. In 1919, a classified appraisal of company properties was presented for the information of the Com - ision in support of the company's application for a change in rates. &gt; appraisal showed the cost of reproduction new and the same less ireciation of the property devoted to transportation, light and power I the heating utility. The Commission also had the corresponding fk values and estimated original cost of the property devoted to importation which included the generating plant and all of the real ate which will pass to the new company. From the Hagenah ap - isal, less depreciation, working capital, and going concern, there ap - irs the following value data on the property to pass to the new own - to which we have added the current and miscellaneous assets and additions and betterments: Hagenah Appraisal Less Depreciation.

Traction property $ 699,609 Distribution (light and power) Heating utility 234,522 118,563 167,717 Current and miscellaneous items Total $1,220,411 The following estimate is made of the Traction property tcr be Bold on the price level used by the Commission in its opinion in 1921.

Estimate. $ 922,992 Traction property Distribution (light and power) Heating utility 250,000 150,000 167,717 Current and miscellaneous items Total $1,490,709 We have three figures: (A) $1,747,077 which is based on price levels prevailing in 1919; (B) estimated cost in the sum of $1,220,411; (C) the estimate of the Commission having present price levels in mind, of $1,490,709. The investigation in 1919 disclosed that the Hagenah figures were too high and likewise the estimated cost was too low to reflect current values. The above figures may be used as a test of the reasonableness of the consideration being received for its transfer. The fixed capital of the Lincoln Traction company will be reduced by reason of the sale as follows: • The market value of the common stock is much less than par and the new company has acquired the preferred stock by purchase at ap - rximately $60 per share. Some of the bonds have been purchased 85%, while a large amount have been surrendered for exchange for the bonds of the new company. The statement below will show the compensation received on the basis of current prices. immon stock 3,520 shares @ $1(H eferred stock 15,780 shares @ 100 &gt;nas 1,578,000 700,000 12,630,000 </seg>

This includes the property of the Lincoln Gas &amp; Electric Light company and the pro - perty purchased from the Traction company with the exception of the heating utility which passes by the purchase of the stock and is inclu - ded in the securities owned in the amount of $150,000. The books of the Lincoln Gas &amp; Electric Light company have been kept through the years under different systems of accounting, which during certain per - iods did not provide for credits to plant for property removed. How - ever, intangibles were not charged to the plant with the exception of thr $1,574,100 heretofore mentioned. For a number of years, the pro - per entries for new construction and removals have been made. In August, 1922 the company had an appraisal of its properties. This will be used in testing the book value. The estimated cost new in 1922, less working capital and going concern, plus additions and bet - terments, August, 1922, to October, 1925, is $4,148,977. When the property purchased from the Traction company, exclusive of the heat - ing utility and current and miscellaneous items is added, we have the sum of $5,320,875. It is probable that the appraisal exceeds the cost figure. Moreover the sum used by the Commission for the value of the Traction property acquired is increased therefore to some extent by appreciation. Therefore, the plant and investment account in the sum of $5,068,058 which is comparable with the above estimate will be accepted in measuring the securities to be issued. LINCOLN PUBLIC SERVICE COMPANY OPERATING RESULTS We have heretofore discussed the probable operating results of the Traction company as it is expected the same will be after consolidation. An exhibit was introduced in testimony which purported to estimate the net earnings, expenses and operating income for the Lincoln Public Service company. The summary of this exhibit is as follows: Total earnings $1,661,398 Operating expenses 1,036,304 Operating income ' 625,095 103,264 Net corporate income 521,831 </seg>
            <seg id="p229">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 229 In the total earnings an amount of $162,000 is included as representing the sale of ten million kilowatt hours to the Nebraska Electric and Iowa Service company, subsidiaries of the United light &amp; Power and in the operating expenses is included an item of depreciation in the sum of $106,271. There is also included in the operating expenses, an item entitled "management fees" based on 31 per cent of the total gross revenue including merchandise sales of the company which, in the estimated year, is shown to be $61,519. The bond interest amounts to $150,000 per annum, being 5 per cent of $3,000,000, which is the bond issue asked for in the application. From the above statement, it is shown that the bond interest under the estimated year here discussed would be 3.48 times the amount neces - sary to pay the interest on bonds. The operating revenues and ex - penses have been based on a twelve month period ending October 30, 1926, and do not make allowance for the natural increase in the local consumption of gas and electric current which during the last few years, has equalled about 5 per cent per annum. t During the hearing, testimony was offered by representatives of applicant regarding superintendence, engineering and management ges made to the plant account on account of services rendered to applicant by the United Engineering &amp; Construction company. The percentage used in making this charge range between 2 and 10 per cent At this time we do not feel called upon to decide whether or not the percentages adopted by the applicant are just and reasonable under all the circumstances. Inasmuch as the applicant has indicated its willingness to comply with any accounting provisions, the Com - mission may require that the matter be considered at a later date if found necessary. It follows from what has been said in the foregoing that we are of the opinion that the consolidation of the properties involved is well justified and we find it to be in the public interest. It will be ap - proved subject to conditions. We are of the opinion and so find that the new corporation, Lin - coin Public Service company, should, upon completion of its corporate organization, be authorized to issue $3,000,000 of its common stock and $3,000,000 of its first mortgage bonds, subject to certain conditions. The amalgamation of the physical properties, the details of which can be estimated and engineered in advance only in part, and the re - adjustment of corporate relationship being so involved and complicated, it is impracticable if not impossible to prepare a final order at this </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 5671 In the Matter of the Application of the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railroad Company for Authority to increase the minimum weight on Alfalfa Hay and Refuse Syrup at Fairbury, Nebraska. OPINION AND FINDING SUPPLEMENT NO. 1 BY THE COMMISSION kin the original application the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy lroad company requested authority to increase the minimum weight alfalfa hay and refuse syrup when milled in transit at Fairbury, m 30,000 pounds to 40,000 pounds. The matter was taken up with the shippers and they advised that they had no objections to the granting of the application and an order was, therefore, issued in - creasing the minimum weight to 40000 pounds. Later, the carriers advised that it was their thought to cancel that part of the milling in transit rules providing that the rate on the outbound product would be the remainder of the through rate on alfalfa feed from point of origin to ultimate destination. This matter was submitted to the Fairbury Alfalfa Mills and they requested that the application be set down for a formal hearing. destination. This matter was submitted to the Under date of June 26, 1925, a hearing was held in the offices of the Commission and the record indicates that a sort of around - the-table discussion took place. In passing, it might be well to state that J. B. Driggs, assistant general freight agent of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, requested permission to amend their application by making same to read that the rate out </seg>
            <seg id="p233">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 233 of Fairbury would be the balance of the through rate on the several ingredients of the feed, stating in connection therewith that the amended application was in conformity with the Missouri river ar - rangement. At the conclusion of the hearing, the carrier and ship - pers agreed that they would take steps to get together on the propo - sition and decide on some definite arrangement and if such an ar - rangement could not be arrived at by agreement, then the Commission would enter its own conclusions as to the granting of the applica - tion. It was understood by the Commission that certain data would be submitted, together with the proposal of the carrier and ship - pers. This was done and then the rate department of the Com - mission got in touch with the carrier and shippers and a con - ference was arranged for. Owing to the press of other business it was impossible to get the parties together at one time. Mr. Cox of the Fairbury Alfalfa Mills was in the office and indicated what he desired. Later, Mr. Driggs of the Burlington was called into a conference and advised what his company was willing to do towards getting this matter straightened out. The carrier, as we understood it, was to submit a new application in conformity with the ideas as threshed out in the conference between the rate depart - ment of the Commission and the carrier. This application has never been filed and the Commission, under date of February 10, advised the Fairbury Alfalfa Mills that an order would be entered conform - ing to the agreement between the carrier and the shippers but in order that there might not be any misunderstanding, the matter was again taken up with the carrier and they were advised as to the decision of the Commission to enter an order in conformity with the rtative agreement reached. The file was held open for some time enable the carrier to reply to that communication. To date we have not received a reply and the Commission, therefore, is of the opinion and so finds that an order in conformity with the agreement as reached should be entered, reparation to be authorized on any shipments moving on or after February 10, 1926. The agreement indicated that the carrier would be willing to can - cel the 2i cent milling in transit charge on traffic originating west of Endicott on the Republican Valley line and from the Scottsbluff territory if routed via Sterling when milled at Fairbury, final desti - nation Endicott or east thereof on the Republican Valley line. In other words, Fairbury would be considered directly intermediate on traffic originating in the above mentioned territory when moving 1 eastward on a direct line. It was also agreed that on traffic originating north or west of Eont milled at Fairbury, final destination north or east of Fair - that a penalty charge of 2* cents would be assessed. On ship - originating on the Republican Valley line and west thereof, </seg>
            <seg id="p234">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 234 milled in transit at Fairbury, destined Lincoln or beyond on a direct line movement there would be no penalty charge.

OPINION AND FINDING SUPPLEMENT NO. 3 BY THE COMMISSION: In Supplemental Order No. 2, issued by the Commission under this application, February 8, 1925, in paragraph "b", of Section 3, the order provided: "In case of a controversy between the con - signor or consignee and the carrier as to the weight of the contents of a car billed as per paragraph "a" of this order, the weight of the car shall be ascertained in the following manner: The cubic yards of sand or gravel contained in the car shall be ascertained by proper measurements, and to. the cubic yards so found the following esti- Pted weights shall be applied, on sand 2900 pounds per cubic yard; gravel 3000 pounds per cubic yard." On account of the disagreement relative to the above weights per cubic yard, the Commission asked both miners and carriers to make studies and submit them for the information of the Commis - sion. This hearing- was held in the office of the Commission, October </seg>
            <seg id="p238">238 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company offered testimony to show the weight of sand, gravel and sand-gravel per cubic yard. This was based on the weights and measurements of approximately forty cars of the above materials, which were mined at Plattsmouth, Louisville, Ashland, South Bend and near Hastings. The cars were weighed, loaded and empty, carefully measured and the weight per cubic yard determined. The percentage of moisture was found to vary between 18 and 24. The material was all taken from pits. Gravel, or the material used for road surfacing, consists of 70% of coarse material and 30% of sand. Sand-gravel, or concrete material, is approximately t gravel and 500% sand. Sand is screened and is entirely free from coarse material. The sand was further classified as sand and plaster ■and. The gravel was divided between curb gravel, sand-gravel, pit-run gravel, and gravel. Pit-run gravel and gravel may be widely dif - ferent materials, depending on the way the material is naturally graded in the pit. Pit-run gravel, sand-gravel and perhaps gravel, might easily be mistaken for each other, unless carefully graded at the time the weight is taken. The percentage of moisture and the length of haul to the scales are also factors in the conclusion. The cars were selected because they are as nearly water-tight as possible. This would affect the weight by retaining moisture. The length of haul from the scales varied from a few miles to as many as thirty or forty. The effect of hauling this class of material long distances is to reduce the volume by condensation. Finally, the average weights of each class of material were not sufficiently different to account for the effect of the combination. The miners did not submit data based on actual weights. Their Etimony was largely confined to opinion evidence, but this will not disregarded as it included knowledge of the weights of the materials en from many cars which had been weighed. No measurements were made of the weight of dry or blow sand, but the testimony shows that this material is lighter than any of the materials we have discussed, and in the conclusions we will provide for an additional class of material described as blow sand, and fix the weight. Commission believes and so finds that paragraph "b" of ion 3, of Supplemental Order No. 2, under Application No. 570? Id be annulled.

Full and complete hearings were held by the Commission at Beatrice on May 8, 1925, and at Fairbury on July 30, 1926. The order issued May 26, 1925, was experimental in its nature and required the railway company to furnish the Commission a weekly report of the time of the departure and arrival of said trains at Horton, Fairbury and Nelson. The Commission has also required the railway company to furnish a monthly report of the passenger earnings on the Nelson-Horton line.

            <seg id="p245">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 245 OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman: Applicant is a Nebraska corporation engaged in transporting water for irrigation purposes through a ditch 15.8 miles long, which taps the Republican river west of Laird, Colorado, and serves an acreage in the states of Colorado and Nebraska. Of the total mileage of ditch 6.96 miles lies in Colorado. The appropriation of water consists of 15 second feet for use in Colorado and 29 second feet measured at the state line, for use in Nebraska. The full appropriation is used. In Nebraska, 2,030 acres are irrigated, 1,050 being under water right owned by the land. The remainder uses water under annual rental contract. t Under rates approved by the Commission in 1916 owners of ter rights pay 50 cents per acre per annum for maintenance, and iters pay $2.50 per acre per annum. The company is in the hands of a receiver, who was apointed by the federal court in response to- the petition of the chief creditor of the company, whose claims arose out of legal services unpaid. The rates applied for in Nebraska are $2.92 per acre per annum from the owners of water rights and $6.13 per acre per annum from renters of water. We have no interest in the portion, of the application within the jurisdiction of Colorado, but the rates asked for are considerably higher in that state. The Nebraska State Railway Commission has jurisdiction of the rates and service within the state erf Nebraska. Valuation of Properties Most of the evidence denoted that the right of way for the canal was given by the land owners, or at least in part payment for the water rights. The excavation of the ditch was done almost en - tirely by interested farmers who were paid from eight to ten cents per yard for the excavation. This was in the day of cheap labor, construction occurring in 1891. There is no better direct evidence as to original cost. Indirectly it might be said to appear from the prices quoted for water rights, that the promoters expected to con - struct the canal and take their profit out of $20,000. There have En improvements since then in headgate, diversion dam, measuring rs, and lateral gates. The amount spent on improvements is larently now unknown. </seg>
            <seg id="p246">246 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Applicant through an engineering witness, presented a study of estimated cost to reproduce as of the present day. This cost and ap - plicant's division of cost between Colorado and Nebraska are af Total Valuation Not Including Unsold Water Right* or Value of Adjudication of Water Right for COLORADO NEBRASKA $36236.47 $37142.80 $73579.27 It is not necessary to go into the procedure used in dividing the valuation between states. It appears to be fair. We are concerned only with the Nebraska portion of the valuation. Structural repro - duction costs, sometimes called "bare bones" reproduction costs, are contained in the first six items, but these also include the struc - tural overheads including contractor's profits and various additions to quantities upon the theory that the estimate must be high to be safe. The right of way in Nebraska consists of 53.75 acres which is put in the valuation at $100 per acre upon the assumption that a conservative figure for irrigated land should be used. However, this is not irrigated land and under no kind of valuation, be it repro - duction or original cost, could it be considered irrigated land. On the one side of the right of way the land is valuable. On the other side it is very cheap. Mr. Griggsby, witness for applicant, says that the dry land along the ditch is worth from $5 to $20 per acre. We will use the latter figure and include therein severance damages which would be paid in reproducing the right of way. This amendment from irrigated land to dry land will reduce the value of the right of way $4300. t Witness measured his yardage of dirt from the ditch as it ex - , and then added ten per cent for good measure. He consented the removal of this ten per cent, which at the figured cost of i N.

            <seg id="p247">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 247 excavation would reduce that item $740. The corrected figures for the reproduction cost of the physical properties in Nebraska, exclusive of general overheads, are, therefore, found to be $15,069. General Overhead* I Applicant's witness added to his costs of labor and materials contractor's profits, 56.2 per cent, to represent cost of engineering, ervision of construction, organization of the company, legal costs, *est during construction, and miscellaneous matters of corporate t. In dollars this was $12,069. Testimony regarding these, in ites considerable duplication. The percentage is far too liberal erwise. On rather simple construction jobs like this, it has been standard practice of the Nebraska Commission for many years, add 15 per cent to the structural costs for overheads. In this case, howevre, the interest item should be larger. It was admitted that the ditch and structures could be completed in one summer. It is, however, a seasonal business and could not be used in such event until the end of one year. There might be still other delays in signing up for the water on the part of farmers and thereby delays in securing revenue, while the investment would continue. Where ordinarily four per cent would be allowed for interest in this case, we are using ten. This makes a total of 21 per cent for gen - eral overheads. The total value of the Nebraska properties based upon reproduc - tion cost alone, exclusive of intangibles, can be set down then as follows: $18,453.00 This ditch is thirty-five years old and its important structures are twelve to fifteen years old. No allowance was made in the com - pany's reproduction valuation for depreciation. This has deferred maintenance but not depreciation. The structures in the main are concrete and of long life. We will take a liberal attitude and will accept the conclusion of the witness and will not deduct for depre - ciation.

            <seg id="p248">248 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT part of the properties, figuring this conclusion from hypothetical early losses. In our estimates of interest during construction we allow for early losses, but not so liberally as applicant's witness, it appearing to us that his hypotheses were contrary to general irrigation exper - ience. Some other factors usually considered in arriving at going value appear in this case to be neutral or negative. This company is under contract to dispose of its property with transfer of water rights. It is today oppressed by debts. Its management has been loose. It cannot dispose of its remaining water rights. No adequate record has been kept of earnings and expenses. It is in the hands of a receiver. We can see no basis for a conclusion that a value exists in excess of the reproduction cost of the physical properties, except in the value of water priority. That value under our findings the company cannot claim. We find there is no other going value in this property than that recognized by us in handling the matter of depreciation and the interest-during-construction item. Using reproduction new as the sole factor, in the absence of other factors, we find the value of the Nebraska property for pur - poses of rate-making to be $18,500. The Matter of Ownership Title to this property apparently rests in applicant corporation. This Commission has no jurisdiction to pass on disputes involving property title. (McCook Irrigation &amp; Power Company v. Burtless, 98 Nebr. 141). tn the present instance we cannot, however, overlook the facts of record. Fifteen water rights have been sold in Nebraska and three in Colorado, out of forty-four under the appropriation. Water deeds were entered into shortly before the construction of the ditch, which deeds provide inter alia that when all the water rights available have been sold, a new corporation shall be formed, the stockholders of which will be the owners of water rights to whom thereupon the ditch and its appurtenances will be deeded and the obli - gation of applicant to furnish water shall cease. hln the absence of evidences to the contrary, it is assumed that all iter deeds contain these provisions. Admitting that applicant cor - poration has exclusive control and that title to the property still rests in it, can it be said that it is entitled to earn on the entire value of the property, on the same basis as if no water rights had been sold ana no deeds issued?

It is our opinion and we so find that under all the circumstances, Nebraska water right owners adjacent to the ditch of the Pioneer Irrigation company have a one-half interest in the value of the ditch in Nebraska as a matter of arriving at a fair return on the fair value of the property. It follows, therefore, that in arriving at rates which will pay such fair return on a fair value plus cost of operating, Nebraska water right owners should pay no return on the value of the pro - perty. Renters of water have no such equity. This conclusion has no relation whatever to the company's claims regarding water rights as yet unsold. Operating Cost* Applicants' engineering witness estimated cost of property operating the ditch in question for one year, exclusive of return on restment, at $4447, which he divided $2057 to Nebraska and $2390 Colorado. This testimony is in no wise related up to company experience. It is purely estimate. The company's witness says it should require $1600 a year for cleaning the ditch. The receiver, Mr. Clegg, spent $2118 from May, 1924, tc September, 1925, almost all of two seasons, and in that total paid a considerable number of bills hanging over from 1923 operation. In the figure also was the cost of an extra clean - ing and repair of the ditch, due to a heavy storm. This cost was estimated at $700 to $800. The receiver, Mr. Clegg, has been for many years in charge of the ditch. He testified that in some years now he could keep the ditch clean with $300 to $500, but this did not apparently include cutting and trimming of banks. The company's expert witness es - timated the excess cost due to floods and failure to exclude sur - face waters from the canal, and the annual cutting down of banks to keep the capacity good, at $650. From all the testimony we will use the figure $1200 per annum for cleaning of ditch. The company's engineering witness estimated $750 per year for ditch rider at the rate of $125 per month. The company spent $400 in 1923 and $100 a month in 1925 for the time a rider was Piployed. He should be employed through the irrigating season, e allow $700 in our computations. The company's expert witness estimated the maintenance of an office and a general manager at $1,500 a year. The receiver, Mr. </seg>
            <seg id="p250">250 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Clegg, a company witness, thought that $300 a year plus small office expense should be enough for a manager. He is directly in charge and his testimony should be worth while. We will use $450 in place of the hypothetical estimate of $1500. Other items in the engineer's estimate will be left undisturbed, as the testimony against them in inadequate. We thus find the fair operating costs excluding taxes and re - turn on investment should be $2860 per annum and that this cost divided as the company's witness divided it would mean $1885 expenses chargeable to the Nebraska operation. Our conclusion is, therefore, that when all proper operating costs are figured and depreciation set up for possible disaster to structures but before return on the property is computed, the rate necessary in Nebraska for maintenance purposes is ninety-five cents per acre per annum. Under our conclusions as to the equities of the water right owners we find that this is the rate which such water right owners should pay. We have already found that the renters are obligated to pay a return on the part of the ditch not disposed of under contract. Since they must pay a return on one-half of the value of the ditch in Nebraska, the fair rate for renters is $1.65 per acre per annum. It was stated in evidence that there are claims aggregating $10,000 against the company growing out of litigation over the right to divert water from streams in Colorado for purpose of irrigation in Nebraska. It was stated that this should be eap - rized and interest paid annually thereon. It was this claim that to the receivership as we understand it. The claim is not out - lawed and constitutes an obligation of the corporation. Whether 6 entire claim will be approved by the court is for the future, regular rule in rate cases is that the rate shall be such as to uce a fair return on a fair value of the property. A debt not constitute value although it may necessarily have been in - curred, as here, in preserving such values as we have found. Both corporation and water right owners benefited from this litigation. Ordinarily in a situation of this kind the debt would be off - set in assets by a suspense account and it would be the duty of the account and it would be the duty of the rate to liquidate the obligation. Here, however, is a If the property is disposed of to satisfy the debt, the of the rate-payer would appear to have ended because the new owner would not find the debt in existence. It may be, however, that a reorganization will result and an effort be made with the approval of the court to pay out the obligation. ■ - ■■ </seg>
            <seg id="p251">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 251 We are asked by the receiver to include in the rate a suffi - rit amount per acre to pay seven per cent interest on the claim $10,000. We will add thirty-five cents per acre per annum to the rate because of this indebtedness. Because of the uncertain status of the property we will approve rates for a period of one year only in the hope that at the end of that time conditions will have clarified. We will also provide that - the amount collected under the special rate of thirty-five cents per acre per annum shall be kept by the receiver in a special account and payments be made from it only as directed by the court. If the property is sold to satisfy creditors, the fund thus created will be considered by us when we review the rates at the close of one year. Petitioner asks for a return on the value of the unsold water rights in Nebraska. These were appraised at $3,000 each or a total of $42,000. This follows the assumption that the appropriation belongs to the company because of the fact that it has the right of diversion. We can see that the right to use the water is valuable property which has increased through the years with the land to which it has dc en applied. The question is not one of appraisal but whether any amount should be included in the renters' rate base. The constitution of Colorado provides that the water of natural C tarns within the state are the property of the public. In 1911, ifornia made the same declaration - Wyoming and Nebraska have said that it belongs to the state. In Wheeler v. Northern Tr. Co., 10 Colo. 582, the court said that the distributor is "an inter - mediate agency" and is not the owner of the right to the water. In Wyatt v. Larimer, 18 Col. 298, the court said that the con - sumer is the appropriator through the intermediate agency of the ditch. In Fanners Co. v. Southworth, 13 Col. Ill, the court went further and said "The carrier is the agent, the consumer is the principal. Neither the title nor a salable interest in the water of natural streams vests in the; carrier". In Denver v. Union Water Co. 246 U. S. 178, the master found value for the water rights but the court did not find it necessary to decide the question, confiscation was the issue and the court deducted the value of the water rights before reaching its conclusion. In Nebraska - "The doctrine of private ownership of water for irrigation purposes, disassociated from the land .to which it is designated to be applied, has been approved by long experience to be detrimental to the public welfare . . . The other doctrine is that the right to the use of water should never be separated from the land to which it is to be applied. Where this doctrine pre- </seg>

The irrigation company does not own the water; it is only the servant of the public to carry it to the land for which it has been appropriated." Wiel 2, Sec. 1341, Farmers' Irri. Dist. v. Frank, 72 Neb. 136. The first use of this appropriation was made in 1890. In 1895, the legislature of this state said that the water of the running streams in Nebraska was the property of the state and set forth how and on what conditions the right to use the water might be acquired for private purposes. Beneficial application to the land on a fixed ratio of water to land was made the measure. Adjud- ication of vested rights was provided for on the rule set forth above. The wasteful use of water was prohibited. Applicant's appropriation was adjudicated under the Nebraska law. Subsequent litigation has fixed the amount of water to be delivered to the Nebraska line. The water so delivered is subject to the laws of the state for which it was decreed. The water right deeds show that the policy of this company is to sell its canal system to the land owners under the ditch. When all the rights have been sold a new company will be formed and the management will rest in the water users. Apparently the consideration for the water rights was based on investment in the property. This was common practice in Nebraska. It shows that the company did not intend to continue as a common carrier, nor did it regard the use of the water as a thing of value in addition to the physical property. The Commission will not add any value for unsold water rights to those who have not yet purchased. We conclude and so find that the value of the ditch property used in common carrier service in Nebraska is $18,500 of which for re-making purposes water right owners will be deemed to have half interest; that a rate of return of seven per cent is fair; that the expenses for operating the portion of properties in Nebraska excluding a fair return on the value of the properties is $1885; that the annual renter of water should pay on such basis as will produce his equitable part of operating expenses and a fair re- turn on one-half the fair value of the properties located in Neb- raska; that rate of ninety-five cents per acre per annum is fair and equitable as applied to the water right owners for the trans- portation of water by applicant company and $1.65 per acre per annum is a fair and equitable rate for the transportation of water used by annual renters of water; that a special charge of thirty- five cents per acre should be applied to all irrigated acres in Neb- </seg>

            <seg id="p254">254 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT BY THE COMMISSION: t Applicant herein is engaged in the generation, transmission and of electric energy to the public. It has applied to this Conv - ion for a permit to construct, operate and maintain a transmiss - line near North Platte, in Lincoln county, to be operated as a sixty cycle, single phase, alternating current line, having a potential of approximately 6600 volts between wires. The proposed construct - ion will parallel the telephone lines of the Farmers Independent Tel - ephone company and the North Platte-Dickens Telephone company west of the state experimental farm. The applicant was unable to agree in writing with these parties at interest and a hearing was held in the offices of the Commission December 30, 1925. The testimony shows that applicant now owns and operates a transmission line from North Platte south to the state experimental En, a distance of approximately three miks. The new construction connect with the existing power line near the experimental farm extend west on the public highway approximately three miles, testant's telephone lines are already paralleled by the transmission line to the state farm, which is operated at 2300 volts and three miles of new parallel will be created by the new construction. The power line to the farm was authorized by the Commission under an application which showed that the Northwestern Bell Tele - phone company was the only party at interest. The hearing disclosed that the interests of the North Platte — Dickens Telephone company, the Farmers Independent Telephone company, the South Side Mutual Telephone company, the County Center Telephone company and the A. F. Wheeler Telephone company were not represented when the first application was granted. Applicant and protestants agreed verbally as to the North Platte - Dickens Telephone company and the Farmers Independent Telephone company at the time of the hearing and kpiicant further agreed to supply written agreements with the other rties at interest, which would include their interests as affected by the new construction west of the farm and the line already construct - ed and operated. These agreements have been filed. The Commission finds that applicant has now complied with the law and the prayer of its petition should be granted, subject to the terms and conditions of the written agreements with the parties at interest and the transmission line laws adopted by this Commission and effective September 5, 1919. The Commission also finds that six months from the date of this order is a reasonable length of time in which to complete the proposed construction. The Commission will retain its jurisdiction over the service on the signal circuits involved in the parallel created by the proposed </seg>

Steward, secretary Nebraska Farm Bureau Fed - eration. For the Commission — Hugh LaMaster, attorney; U. G. Powell, rate expert. FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner The Legislature of 1913 enacted a statute (Compiled Statute of Nebraska 1922, Section 7083 and 7084) by the terms of which a flat basic rate of 25 cents for all ten-word messages transmitted in Neb - raska, was made effective until such time as the State Railway Com - mission, after hearing and investigation, should determine whether or not such charges were so low as to be non-remunerative or unjust to the telegraph company. Prior to the effective date of the law, the Western Union Telegraph company made application in the federal court for a temporary injunction restraining the State Rail - way Commissioners from attempting to enforce the provisions of the act. The court denied the application for the temporary injunction, however, on the ground that the company should first avail itself of the relief provided in the act, whereby showing could be made to the Commission, if the rates were non-compensatory. Thereupon, the company made application to the Commission for authority to con - tinue in effect the schedule of rates theretofore applicable. It was agreed between the Commission and the company that the reduced rates would be put into effect for a temporary or test period, and in the meantime the physical valuation of the property would be made, and certain accounting studies outlined by the Commission's accounting department, would be attempted. This investigation became quite complicated, particularly with reference to the valuation of the physical property. The matter dragged for two or three years, and on August 1, 1919, the telegraph company having been taken over by the postmaster general of the United States, an order was issued by him promulgating an increase of the intrastate rates twenty per cent. This made the intrastate statutory rate of 25 cents, 30 cents. Upon the return of the property from the government, the company made application on July 28, 1920, to this Commission, to continue the rates prescribed by the postmaster was authorized by the Commission. In that application, the company expressly stated that it was not </seg>

On December 31, 1924, the Commission, because of the lapse of time and the failure of the applicant to prosecute, dismissed Application No. 1792 without prejudice. The present application, which amounts practically to a renewal of that under Application No. 1792, was filed with the Commission on October 30, 1925. The fundamental Eiod for stating rates is described later. This method is in effect in states surrounding Nebraska, and applied also to interstate traffic company would substitute for the present flat basis, the following &gt; of rates: First Zone: For full-rate telegrams: Thirty cents (30c) for ten (10) words or less, and two and one-half cents (21c) a word for each word in excess of ten. For night messages: Twenty-four cents (24c) for ten (10) words or less, and one and two-tenths cents (1.2c) a word for each word in excess of ten. Second Zone: For full-rate telegrams: Thirty-six cents (36c) for ten (10) words or less, and two and one-half cents (2-Jc) a word for each word in excess of ten. For night messages: Thirty cents (30c) for ten (10) words ct less.and one and two-tenths cents (1.2c) a word for each word in excess of ten. Third Zone: For full-rate telegrams: Forty-eight cents (48c) for ten (10) words or less, and three and one-half cents (3-lc) a word for each word in excess of ten. For night messages: Thirty-six cents (36c) for ten (10) words or less, and one and two tenths cents (1.2c) a word for each word word in excess of ten. The effect of the application would be to make no increase in t first zone, a six cent increase in the second zone, and an eighteen t increase in the third zone. METHOD OF MAKING WESTERN UNION RATES The nation-wide system adopted many years ago by the West - ern Union for the purpose of establishing rates between all points in the country, briefly stated, is as follows: The United States is divided into 50-mile square blocks, arranged in staggered or brick fashion, all rates within a given block being the same, with in - creases to points in adjoining blocks. The blocks so determined are used to establish state and interstate rates. </seg>
            <seg id="p258">258 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT In establishing interstate rates, the rate from a given block to a point located in the next two contiguous blocks is 30c In the next circle of blocks beyond the two adjoining blocks a rate of 36c applies, and to the next circle of blocks 48c, and beyond that number of blocks the interstate rate is established by state lines. In laying down interstate rates the rate between points in the same block is 30c. This rate applies to the next two adjoining circle of blocks making a maximum distance from the edge of the origi- nating block, to the extreme edge of the third block a possible 150 miles. To th« next circle of blocks beyond the second blocks, the rate is 36c and to all the points beyond the third circle of blocks from the point of origin to any point located in the same state the rate is 48c. In all of the states surrounding Nebraska namely, North Dakota, South Dakota, Minnesota, Iowa, Colorado, Wyoming, Missouri and Kansas the intrastate rates in effect at the present time are 30c, 36c, and 48c for the zones of blocks as explained above. Applicant asks to establish the same rates for Nebraska intrastate business. At the time the original application was filed exhaustive studies were made by the accounting department of the Commission. A considerable amount of data was collected from the operations of the company in this state and as a result of these studies objection was made to the showing presented by the Western Union at that time, in that they had not given consideration to the fact that a con- siderable amount of business transacted in Nebraska was trans- state traffic and the further fact that the number of words in a message on an average, was materially less in Nebraska intrastate traffic than in the total business handled by the company. In the application here under consideration, the applicant has made extensive additional studies to those presented in the pre- vious case and has given consideration to all of the matters complain- ed of by the Commission in the former application. The exhibits introduced in testimony, upon which the applicant relies for an increase in its rates, were submitted to the accounting department several months before the hearing and copies of th« same were sent to commercial clubs of the larger centers in the state. At the time of the hearing no data was submitted in opposition to the exhibit introduced by the applicant, although witnesses for applicant were vigorously cross-examined on all matters of revenue, expenses, management, service and other material issues. In support of its petition, the applicant presented elaborate exhibits purporting to show the results of operation in the state of Nebraska. For this purpose the year ending December 31, 1924, </seg>

            <seg id="p261">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 261 The correctness of the revenues thus shown was not specifically checked by the Commission. This was considered unnecessary for the reason that they correspond to the figures contained in the annual report of the company for the year 1924, filed with this Commission, and are a part of the total revenues of the company as reported to the Interstate Commerce Commission for the same year. More - over, the studies made in the previous investigation, which involved analysis of thousands of messages, furnished a measure for testing the accuracy of the figures. We have no doubt, therefore, that the revenues for the year shown were as reprsentd. OPERATING EXPENSES tThe operating organization of the Western Union in this state ists of three distinct departments namely, plant, traffic and com- The plant department reconstructs and maintains the outside plant and installs equipment. The traffic department assigns the circuits to be used for the transmission of messages and has direct charge of the actual operations in the handling of messages in the larger cities of Die state where functional offices are located, viz: Lincoln, Omaha, Grand Island, etc. : The joint or non-functional offices are those offices located at smaller railroad stations where the railroad agent acts as the West - en Union manager and operator. In all such offices a commission of 10% of the tolls on all business received and forwarded is paid to the railroad agent for the services rendered to the Western Union company. There are three functional offices in Nebraska, 613 joint - railroad and 19 non-functional offices located in this state. The man - agement of the joint-railroad offices is under the direction and super - vision of the respective railroads through their superintendents of telegraph who report to the general manager of the Western Union in the Central division. The commercial department at functional offices handles all of the dealings between the public and the company. The securing of new business, and seeing that customers are satisfied with the serv - ices are under this department. Non-functional and railroad joint offices are under the general supervision of the commercial depart - ment. Revenues collected and money expended at the small offices are reported to this department. For the purpose of operation the Western Union has divided the United States into seven divisions known as Eastern, Southern, Lake, Central (of which Nebraska is a part) Mountain, Gulf and Pacific The division in which Nebraska is located consists of the following </seg>
            <seg id="p262">262 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT states: North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Minnesota. The headquarters of this division are located at Omaha. The operating expenses relating to the commercial de - partment are directly allocated to the state, but as to the plant and traffic departments the expenses cannot be directly allocated to Ne - braska. The plant and traffic department expenditures incurred in the Central division are charged to this division, together with a proportion of the overhead expenses that are expended outside of the Central division. These expenses are then prorated between the dif- ferent states of the division on different bases which will be explained in more or less detail later on. The operating expenses necessary to maintain the plant in Ne- braska are prorated to the state on the ratio of the wire mileage lo - cated in Nebraska as to the total wire mileage of the Western Union in the Central division. This basis of division is more or less arbitrary but in view of the fact that the plant department is organized for taking care of the entire facilities of the appli- cant within the Central division and are not used continually in any part of the division; it appears that such division is equitable and may be accepted.

            <seg id="p265">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 265 fairness with which they are separated depends the conclusion as to whether present state rates are reasonable. As previously stated, a very careful analysis of the plant used, messages handled, length of messages, and all other factors was made by the Com - mission's accounting department in 1913-1916. Whether as a result of that investigation or otherwise, the company readjusted its show - ing so as to comply in every particular with the department's require - ments. If the method prescribed by the accounting department was correct, and we are of the opinion it was, it follows that the con - clusion is equally reliable, assuming no errors in calculation. The ex- hibits were submitted several weeks in advance of the hearing, thus affording opportunity for a thorough analysis. tit goes without saying, therefore, that the statement thus pre - sd shows conclusively that the flat rate in 1924 was insufficient only to pay any return upon the property investment n Nebraska, was inadequate to meet the actual expenses of operation. The nue for 1926 was greater than for 1924, the receipts from com - :ial telegraph tolls for 1925 being $202,000 as compared to $185, - for 1924. The receipts from other sources in 1925 are not given were doubtless correspondingly increased. This gain in business d not all be net to the company as the expenses would be some - t more. It is evident, therefore, that the growth in traffic will of itself overcome the operating deficit. The company has experienced both gains and losses from the advent of the radio. Congratulatory telegrams to Omaha, Lincoln, Hastings and other broadcasting stations have been a source of revenue. Much of this traffic, of course, is interstate. A study made by applicant for the months of January, February, March, April, fctember, October, November and December shows a total of 34, - messages received at the Nebraska broadcasting points. Assuming 20 per cent of these messages to be intrastate, or approximately 7,000, they represent only 11 per cent of the total intrastate busi - ness for the year. If it were assumed that all were intrastate the ratio to the total would only be about 6 per cent. This increase is offset to some extent by the loss of market report service. Revenue from this source was formerly quite substantial, but the broadcasting of grain and livestock quotations and commercial news has taken the place of telegraph service and many customers have cancelled their contracts. On the basis of the financial showing applicant has clearly justi - fied its request for an increase. There is another cogent reason for </seg>
            <seg id="p266">266 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT a rate readjustment. The sharp difference between the state level and the interstate schedule of rates, in the absence of dissimilar operating or traffic conditions, constitutes an undue discrimination against interstate commerce. The conditions, so far as telegraph service is concerned, are no different in Nebraska than they are in Kansas, Missouri, Iowa or South Dakota, where higher levels are in effect. If it could be shown that operating costs were lower in Ne - braska or if there was a greater volume of traffic in this state than in adjoining states there might be justification for a lower basis of rates. But these favorable conditions do not exist. The schedule proposed will, if approved, remove this discrimination and restore uniformity in telegraph schedules in this territory. We are therefore of the opinion, and so find, that the rates for telegraph service on intrastate traffic in Nebraska, as fixed and determined by Section 7083, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, and as later modified by this Commission in Application No. 4061, are non-remunerative and unjust in so far as they apply to the Western Union Telegraph company and we further find that the schedule of rates as applied for herein are reasonable and should be approved. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Western Union Tele - graph company be, and the same hereby is, authorized and directed to charge and collect on Nebraska intrastate traffic, the schedule of rates described in the application herein, the basic rates being as follows: First Zone: For full-rate telegrams: Thirty cents (30c) for ten (10) words or less, and two and one-half cents (2Jc) a word for each word in excess of ten.

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, Thome A. Browne, Chairman. Attest: Mary E. Sheehan, Assistant Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6078 fthe Matter of the Application of the Chicago, Burlington £ Quincy Railroad Company for Authority to Publish Revised Schedule of Switching Rates between Ralston, Omaha and South Omaha. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This cause came on for hearing before the Commission on the application of the Burlington to amend its switching tariff between Ralston and Omaha and South Omaha. The application asks the au - thority of the Commission to allow the applicant to cancel its present rates which provide a charge of 1% cents per cwt., minimum charge $6.30 on competitive traffic and $8.10 on traffic originating or destined on connecting lines at Omaha and South Omaha consigned to or from industry and team tracks in Ralston and establish in lieu thereof a rate of 1% cents per cwt., minimum $6.30 and $8.10 between certain industries located in Ralston and industries in Omaha and South Omaha located on the Burlington and connecting lines and that the rates so established are not to apply on carload shipments of grain and live stock. In Informal Complaint No. 6450 in an order entered in August, 1924, the Commission denied the application of the Burlington to rge its switching rates between Ralston and Omaha and dismissed informal complaint which caused the action and in bo doing, in - structed the Burlington to file a new application for the consideration </seg>
            <seg id="p268">268 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The present rates were established by the Burlington in 1921 on application of the Howard Stove Works, an industry located on appli - cant's track at Ralston, who asked that a switching rate be established, in order that said stove works might compete with similar manu - facturing companies located in Omaha, on an equal basis to state and interstate points. Since that time other industries have located on the tracks of the applicant in Ralston. In support of the application testimony was offered to show that under the present rate the state and interstate rates on carload ship - ments of grain are reduced by reason of this switching charge. Ap - plicant showed that carload shipments of wheat from Ashland to Chicago by basing the rate on the combination of Ralston, local in and switching rate out plus the proportional rate beyond, would re - sult in reducing the rate from 26% cents to 25 cents. Applicant claims that the switching rates established between Oma - ha and Ralston were made primarily to take care of established manu - facturing industries located at Ralston, in order to place Ralston Manu - facturing concerns on a parity with Omaha companies engaged in the same line of manufacture; that in order to make it possible for con - necting lines to absorb the charges on the shipments from Ralston to Omaha it was necessary to publish the rates as switching rates; that from a recent check of manufacturing industries located at Ralston they found that these rates should be limited to the three firms set out in the application to-wit; Barker Evans Paint company, Howard Stove Works and Orchard &amp; Wilhelm Furniture company; that they did not include the firms located at Ralston engaged in handling hay, grain, and live stock for the reason that they did not consider them manu - facturing institutions. The The Omaha Grain exchange, South Omaha Live Stock exchange, Omaha Hay exchange and live stock feeders located at Ralston ired in opposition to the granting of the application. Representa - of the grain exchange said they had no objection to the cancel - l of the rates as applying on carload shipments of grain originat- at Ralston consigned to Omaha or beyond, but insisted that the ching rates should be continued on carload shipments of grain ori- ginating at Omaha, consigned to Ralston. The hay exchange opposed the granting of the application on the ground that live stock feeding plants had been established at Ralston and that the Ralston elevator bandied large quantities of hay and coarse grain that was sold to feed - ers located in and around Ralston; that the Missouri Pacific maintained a switching rate between Omaha and Seymour Park, which is the Mis - souri Pacific station for the village of Ralston; that the bulk of tKe </seg>
            <seg id="p269">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 269 hay that is sold to feeders at Ralston, originates on lines other than the Burlington and that unless this switching rate is continued, it will t impossible for the feeders located at Ralston to buy hay off the ion Pacific and North Western, in competition with feeders located other points in the Ralston territory. I Representatives of the Omaha Live Stock exchange gave testi - ny, that the Missouri Pacific maintained a switching rate of $8.10 ■ car on carload shipments of live stock between South Omaha and rmour Park; that the Union Pacific maintained a rate of $8.00 per ' to Gilmore, $5.00 per car to Avery and $9.00 per car on carload pments of live stock moving between South Omaha and the points t mentioned and that if the application was allowed, this situation uld create an unlawful discrimination between the feeders located Seymour Park, Avery and Gilmore as compared with the live stock ders served by the Burlington at Ralston; that the Rock Island has ablished a rate of 2 cents per 100 pounds on carload shipments of tin and live stock between Rumsey and South Omaha. Representatives of the Liberty Laboratories, a concern which pro - duces hog cholera serum, testified that part of their property is lo - cated on ground leased from the Burlington; that in the production of hog cholera serum they found it necessary to feed large quantities of hogs and that a large number of cattle were fed in connection with the feeding of hogs. Two other feeders who have feeding lots located some distance from Ralston appeared in opposition to the granting of this application, and stated that if the application was allowed it would be impossible for them to feed live stock on the same basis with other feeders located in a territory contiguous to South Omaha, and would compel them to handle all of their shipments via the Missouri Pacific. CONCLUSIONS In this application the Burlington asks the authority of the Com - mission to allow the present switching rates to continue as to certain industries, and be denied to other industries located on its tracks at Ralston. There are four sidings at Ralston owned by the applicant, one on the north side of the main line which serves Barker Evans Paint com - pany, Howard Stove Works, Orchard &amp; Wilhelm Furniture company and a live stock feeding company located on the west end of this track. On the south side is a passing track, an industry track and a house track, the industry track serving the applicant's live stock yards, a lumber and coal company, and a grain elevator. The Liberty Labora - tories' feeding lots are located contiguous to this track. Can set for team track delivery are, according to the record, set some times on the north track but mostlv on the south industrv track </seg>
            <seg id="p270">270 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The application proposes to limit the switching rates to three in - dustries located on the north industry track namely, the Barker Evans* Paint company, Howard Stove Works and Orchard &amp; Wilhelm Furni - ture company. Applicant proposes to place all other industries located on its tracks at Ralston on a regular road haul basis which would have the effect of increasing the rates from two to three times those in effect at the present time. We are unable to find from the testimony in this case any good reason why certain industries located on appli - cant's tracks at Ralston should be accorded the privilege of a switch - ing rate, and other industries which do a considerably larger business be denied the same rates. In recent years there has grown up around South Omaha a con - siderable industry in the way of livestock feeding yards and, as shown by the record, other carriers as well as the Burlington have established Sless than the regular road haul rates, generally on a switching which has made it possible for these industries to secure live , hay, and grain from connecting lines on a switching rate basis. This has had the effect of allowing the road haul carrier to absorb the Ktching charges necessary to set the cars from connecting lines to ustries located at live stock feeding stations such as Avery, Albright, Gilmore, West Lawn, Seymour Park and Ralston. Applicant's present tariff provides that switching rates will apply on "all carload freight" handled between South Omaha and Avery, with the exception that said rates will not apply between Avery and connecting lines, thereby excluding the use of the applicant's team tracks at Avery for the handling of freight going to or coming from connecting lines. In the Grand Island Switching case Ninth Annual Report, page 180, we laid down the principle that the team tracks of a carrier could not be open for the indiscriminate use of competing Lin the Omaha Belt Line case, now pending before the supreme rt, we found that same was built as a switching belt line as shown by their certificate of incorporation and that the rates between con - necting carriers and team tracks located on the Belt Line should be continued. This was largely bottomed on the fact that the road was built primarily as a switch road and had been in effect for more than forty years. In this application the Burlington is attempting to close its team tracks at Ralston for shipments received from or delivered to connecting lines at Omaha. Generally speaking, carriers operating in this state do not allow their team tracks to be used by connecting carriers. The applicant now has in effect a switching rate applying on all carload traffic moving between South Omaha and Avery. This rate, however, does not apply on traffic delivered to or received from connecting lines in South Omaha. </seg>
            <seg id="p271">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 271 We are of the opinion and 90 find that the applicant may amend its tariff so as to exclude team track delivery at Ralston on traffic interchanged with connecting lines at Omaha and South Omaha. The application asks authority to allow the present rates to apply to three industries at Ralston. We are unable to find from this record, that ft part of the application should be allowed. The applicant should end its tariffs so as to provide that all of the industries located on tracks at Ralston or contiguous to its right of way should be served the same rates as other industries. The applicant should further amend its tariffs so as to provide that the present rates will apply between industry and team tracks in Omaha, South Omaha and Ralston. The applicant will be expected to file within thirty days from the date of these findings, for the approval of the Commission, a tariff embodying the suggestions contained herein. The case will be held open for the making of such formal order as may be necessary if this is not done. L Dated at Lincoln, Nebraska, this seventeenth day of February, 6.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6079 In the Matter of the Application of the Glenwood Telephone Company (Blue Hill District) for Authority to Publish Increased Rates for Exchange Service. Appearances : For applicant — E. McBride, secretary and director. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: This is an application by the Blue Hill district of the Glen - wood Telephone company for authority to increase its exchange rates and to readjust the same so as to more nearly equalize the relations of stockholders and renters. While the Glenwood Tele - phone company is a corporation, the ten or twelve exchanges, fich constitute the system, are operated as individual units, the enues and expenses of each being: collected and disbursed with - the local district territory. The Blue Hill district is one of the </seg>
            <seg id="p272">272 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT largest and the headquarters of this company are at Blue Hill. There are directly connected to and served by the exchange at Blue Hill 398 patrons. Of this number 80 are renters, meaning by that that they do not own stock in the corporation. The re - mainder are stockholders. At the present time and for several years past the district has been charging a uniform rate of $15.00 per year, payable semi-annually, to all patrons connected to the exchange. The company is a cooperative organization and the Blue Hill district pays no dividends. For that reason stockholders have never received any return upon the money they have invests ed in the property. It follows, therefore, that to the extent at least of the return there is a discrimination against this class of sub - scribers. The management desires in the new application to charge a higher rate for non-stockholders and thus retmove the discrimina - tion. The rates proposed are as follows: It is estimated that the proposed rates would produce increased revenue in the amount of $1,261.80. This assumes that there would be no loss in number of subscribers. The officers of the district do not keep any but the most simple records. There is no property accounts set up on the books and no inventory of the plant has ever been made. No classification of ex - penditures is attempted. The secretary of the company who keeps the record is a banker and he has a bank record of moneys received and paid out. It is impossible, therefore, to allocate expenses defin - itely to any one year, since maintenance and replacement items are charged as they occur and the annual expense statement is distorted as these expenditures are large or small. At the hearing, however, were submitted covering the operations of the district ; thirteen months. From that we have been able to compile for that period which is probably, with exceptions that noted, representative of normal operation. Gross revenue including toll aggregated $8,031.91. Deducting therefrom $1,379.31 for payments to connecting toll companies and deducting $50 for uncollectible accounts, leaves a total gross revenue for thirteen months Individual business, stockholders $1.75 per month Individual business, renters 2.00 per month Individual residence, stockholders 1.60 per month Individual residence, renters 1.85 per month Party lines, stockholders 1.40 per month Party lines, renters $1.65 per month Extension sets .60 per month Extension bells .25 per month Installation charge 1.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p273">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 273 of $6,602.60. The total expenses for the same period, exclusive of taxes, interest and dividends, were $6,252.01. This leaves a net in - come for thirteen months of $350.59. If taxes and interest on out - standing notes were deducted, this would probably be reduced to approximately $250. The 318 stockholders have an investment of $40 each in the property. If dividends at 7 per cent were figured on this amount, they would amount to approximately $890 per year. The above statement as to expenses is abnormal for the reason that the district has been making rather extensive improvements on the town exchange, having installed a considerable amount of cable. Some of this is in the form of additions and betterments to the property but the most of the expenditures represents necessary replacements and repairs. The company's rates have never permitted the ac umulation erf any depreciation reserve. As a consequence, the practice is to borrow money at the bank to provide for large ex - penditures and retire the notes out of revenues. It was stated by the secretary and lineman at the time of hearing that the farm lines will require rebuilding and that at least a carload of poles will be required each season for the next few years for this work. The property is much of it old and rather heavy replacements may be reasonably expected during the next few years. It is probable, therefore, that the expenditures for maintenance and depreciation will continue on a rather high level for some time. kVery little objection was made to the proposed increase although lie twenty or thirty stockholders and renters attended the hearing, ring the past two years, because of discrimination against the stockholders, there has been a tendency on their part to surrender their stock, giving it away if necessary. The. district regards this movement with some alarm and, while it recognizes its obligations as a common carrier, it is not desirous of increasing the number of rented telephones. The differential as proposed by the stockholders and renters appears to be reasonable. It would represent approx - imately the dividends to which the stockholders would be entitled if dividends were paid. The rates as proposed do not correspond to schedules of other companies with reference to the relationship be - ween classes but because of the necessity of applying the stock - holder and non-stockholder differential, it is rather difficult to maintain t correct relationship. The rates as proposed are not unreasonable der the circumstances. The subscribers in this district have access to all of the subscribers of the Glenwood Telephone system as well as to the several other ex - changes with which there is an interchange of service. While practically all of the lines are grounded, the extent of the service </seg>
            <seg id="p274">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 274 Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. is a factor in the cost and value to the subscriber. Because of the lack of an accurate accounting system, however, and our inability to definitely determine operating results, the rates as proposed will be approved for a trial period only. In the meantime the district should install the commission's accounting system so that the actual effect of increased revenues can be measured. The rates as applied for will be approved for the period of a year and their renewal at the end of that time will depend on installation of the accounting system and the results as shown thereby. L. The officers of the district have refused to accept rentals for the first six months of 1926 in anticipation of the change of rates for which application has been pending. Since collection from sub- scribers is made for a six months period, the Commission will approve the new rates effective as of January 1, 1926. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Blue Hill district of tGlenwood Telephone company be, and the same hereby is, author- to charge and collect the following schedule of rates for exchange f Individual business, stockholders $1.75 per month Individual business, renters 2.00 per month Individual residence, stockholders 1.60 per month Individual residence, renters . 1.86 per month I Party lines, stockholders 1.40 per month Party lines, renters 1.65 per month Extension sets : .50 per month Extension bells .25 per month Installation charge 1.00 IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that these rates shall because of emergency become effective as of January 1, 1926, and remain in effect for a period of one year or until January 1, 1927, and that the said Blue Hill district of the Glenwood Telephone company shall promptly install the accounting system prescribed by this Commis- sion, the continuation of the rates being conditioned upon the in- stallation of such accounting system and the results of operation as Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this twenty-sixth day of NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, Thome A.

OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL, Commissioner The applicants in these cases are the Chicago and North Western Railway company and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company asking for permission to discontinue the employment of agents and telegraph operators at the town of Inland and to substitute therefor caretakers to serve the people of Inland and vicinity. The population of Inland is about one hundred and forty. There are two stores, an elevator, a bank, a garage and one or two other busi - ness houses in the town. It is located nine miles east of Hastings and seven miles west of Harvard, on the D. L. D. highway. The town is served by both the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company and rmain line of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company, that the business of the town is divided between the two railroads. The country tributary to the town is very fertile and thickly settled and is the logical shipping point for the farmers living adjacent there - to, but owing to the good roads the local freight and mercantile busi - ness has fallen off materially as the residents tributary to the town do a large part of their purchasing at Hastings on the west, or Har - vard on the east. As Hastings is a city of over 12,000 inhabitants and Harvard of over 1,000 inhabitants, the people find it more advan - tageous to trade at these larger towns on account of a larger number of stores and greater variety of merchandise to choose from. A large part of the merchandise that is purchased by the merchants at Inland is delivered to them by truck from the wholesale houses at Hastings, so that the L. C. L. business has fallen off and owing to improved conditions of the highways, the private owned automobiles and busses Eve reduced the passenger revenues.

            <seg id="p278">278 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The expense incident to maintaining the stations with agents has been* $3,566.94 for a year. Of this amount approximately $2,916.48 was paid to the agents as salary. The balance which goes to make up the total expense of the stations would be somewhat reduced in case of the substitution of caretakers to handle the business of each station. There is no question but that the present volume of business does not warrant the expense of maintaining two agents at Inland, but there is sufficient business to require service that cannot be furnished by a caretaker. In order to reduce the expense and at the same time give adequate service and materially reduce the expense, the Commission is of the opinion that there should be a joint agency provided by the companies. In case of a joint agent being substituted for the present service, the salary of the agent could be apportioned between the com- Eies in proportion to the business handled by each road, and bring ut a substantial saving to the railroad companies without discom - ling the patrons of the roads. The applicants ask to substitute caretakers for agents at both of the stations and make a showing that the expenses of conducting the business at the stations would be materially reduced. The Commission is of the opinion that wherever, owing to the falling off of business, that economies should be practiced, but where the volume of business is of sufficient magnitude to warrant the expense, the Commission is of the opinion that an agent should be employed. While it is true that about the only difference in the service between caretaker and agency service is the prepayment of freight and the purchasing of tickets on the train and the handling of telegrams, yet there is a certain feeling of satisfaction among the patrons of the railroad to do business with an agent at the station and is more satisfactory than having to have it passed on by the caretaker to the agent at the bill - ing station. The Chicago &amp; North Western Ry. Company and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R.R. Company tracks run parallel through the town of Inland and are in close proximity to each other. The stations are only two or three blocks distant from each other. Both depots are in fairly good repair and have living quarters for the agent. "Hie time of the arrival and departure of trains on the two roads would not conflict with one agent handling the business of both stations, and the Commission is of the opinion that the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company and the Chicago, Burlington ft Quincy Railroad company should employ an agent to act as a joint agent for both roads. The manner of conducting and handling the business un - der this plan will be left to the management of the roads to decide themselves, unless the management cannot come to an ami- agreement and then in that case the Nebraska State Railway lission will offer their assistance in making recommendations or g an order that in their judgment would be fair and equitable in </seg>

The directors may divide the fixed capital between preferred and common stock, as in their judgement the interests of the corporation may re- quire. It proposes to finance a new project and sell its common stock in the amount of $200,000 and its eight per cent preferred stock in the sum of $500,000 par value, to finance new construction and pur- chase property necessary to the proposed development. Hearings were held in the offices of the Commission, December 18 and 19, 1925, and February 11, 1926. The plans and estimates submitted in December, 1925, were amended at the February hearing. The changes affect the quantities of construction and the estimated costs, also the plan of financing as at first proposed. The last es- timates were offered to support the financing set forth above, where- in the preferred stock is to be sold at 85% of par. The expense of the sale of preferred stock is to be paid in common stock at par. The remainder of the common stock is to be sold for cash at its face value. The new construction comprises a hydroelectric generating plant on the Niobrara river near Spencer, in Boyd county, with a trans- mission system which will consist of 258 miles of pole lines which will extend to the east as far as Wausa, in Enox County, and south to Neligh and Oakdale, in Antelope county. New distribution sys- tems will be constructed in sixteen towns, which will be supplied by the company and current will also be sold wholesale to a number of villages which own their own plants. The dam will be a solid concrete structure of the overfall type about 375 feet in length, in the channel of the river, connected with an earth dyke, approximately 2,400 feet long;. The generating equipment will consist of two water wheels directly connected to generators with the additional small equipment necessary for operation. The effective head will be twelve feet for the present which may be increased to sixteen feet, if required. This has been provided for in the modified plans. The Niobrara river is a very dependable stream within its range of discharge. The minimum flow at Valentine seldom falls below 800 cubic feet per second of time in the dry season of the year and the maximum rarely exceeds 4,000. Once or twice in a number of years the discharge touched 6,000 cubic feet per second for a short time. The extremes are important as they both affect the generating plant as a dependable source of power. Low water restricts the output of current and high water reduces the effective head with the same re- sult. Daily fluctuations in the load on the generating plant require more power at the peak of demand than the stream affords in the dry ■•moil Applicant proposes to use flash boards on the crest of the </seg>
            <seg id="p281">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 281 dam for storage purposes when the water is low, in order to pull the peak. The feasibility of storage by this method is subject to the criticism that the reservoir may fill with silt when the water is checked and the required capacity may -not be realized. Applicant has not included the cost of standby equipment in its estimates, except as one water wheel will be substituted for the other in the event of a break down within the plant. Changes in the water supply affect both wheels in the same manner and for this En applicant proposes to acquire the use of generating! plants as a by in certain towns which it will supply. More dependable by equipment may be necessary if the market is fully developed. Applicant's estimated construction costs with supporting details were made a part of the record. The summary is as follows: Transmission lines $203,337.36 Sub-stations 40,220.00 Distribution systems, including meters 103,300.00 Dam, flumes, gates and power-house complete for 12-foot head, with provisions for increasing head to 16 feet by adding 400 yards of concrete to crest of dam, less mechanical and electrical equipment 125366.00 Dyke (70,000 cubic yards at 40c per yard) 28,000.00 Cost of machinery (Two units, each 1,000 KVA) 68,000.00 Cost of land and site (18-foot head) 22,600.00 Engineering 8,400.00 Organization Total 6,000.00 1694,713.36 The costs are conservative. The engineering department of the Commission checked the units and found them lower than similar estimates on file in the department. This is especially true as to general expenditures. These amount to less than 2%%, computed on the cost of the physical property. Interest during construction has been included in the sale of the preferred stock at 86% with the understanding that no dividends will be paid until they are earned from operation. This item will amount to about 6%. Contingencies and taxes have been omitted. The Commission has used from 12 to </seg>
            <seg id="p282">282 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The market for the power is a matter for serious consideration. Applicant proposes to sell current either wholesale or retail, in wenty-seven towns in its territory and find a market for 3,152 376 ilowatt hours annually, which will yield a gross revenue of $148,708.36. n ten of these towns applicant will have competition and where this occurs one-half of the estimated consumption has been used in the estimates. The total population of all the towns is 18,016 of which &gt;,608 reside where the competition will take place. Assuming app - icant can get one-half of the business in competitive localities it will supply a population of 13,212. This assumption is highly specu - ative. It is a matter of common knowledge that when rates are cut to meet competition under these conditions the outcome may be dis - ppointing to the newcomer in the field. Petitioner proposes a number of rate schedules intended to apply to the different situations. These are set up on a sliding scale and show that the rate declines as the quantity consumed increases. The principal difference in the schedule depends on whether the current will be sold wholesale to the town, or retailed through the company's distribution systems. A further differentiation is made between the price of current used for light as compared with power. The average return per K. W. H. for all current sold, including power, is approx - imately five cents. Data on the average consumption of current per capita was se - cured from a NUMBER OF TOWNS in Nebraska. This shows 240 K. W. H. per year. The Commission secured information of the same character from a large electric utility operating in Nebraska, Iowa and Missouri. This shows an average annual consumption of 100 K. W. H. This information is taken from towns with a population of 600 or less. A company operating in Nebraska only, supplies results which show that the average consumption in fifteen small towns was 150 K. W. H. in 1928 and 192 K. W. H. in 1924. This data is most nearly representative of the territory which applicant will serve, how - ever, the average of 192 K. W. H. follows several yean operation in these towns. The Commission believes that applicant's annual consump - tion per capita is too high and will use 150 K. W. H. for the purpose of this case, although this may not be realized for a few years after oper - ation begins. Our estimated annual revenues and expenses, assuming the cap - italization asked for by applicant, appear below: Revenue Population (13,212) @ $7.50 $99,090.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p283">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 283 Expenses Managers $ 4,800.00 Plant operators 3,600.00 Taxes 10,000.00 Office expenses 1,800.00 Depreciation 12,000.00 Total $47,200.00 Available for dividends and surplus $51,890.00 Deduct preferred stock dividends 40,000.00 For common stock and surplus 411,890.00 These figures are necessarily approximate. The set up for depre - ciation reserve may not be used for some time and it is also probable that full allowance for supplies and labor may not be exhausted an - nually when the property is first constructed. We are especially con - cerned in the prospect for return on the preferred stock as this will be more generally in the hands of the investing public. The promoters who have developed the project from its inception represent that they are willing and able to take a large block of common stock for cash, at par. They are familiar with all the details of the develop - ment, including the market for the company's product. The profits belong- to the common stock and it should assume the major risk. Investors in the preferred stock may not have the time nor opportunity to know the details. Manifestly this is a pioneering enterprise. It arises out of the Kition of the promoters to develop the possibilities of the Niobrara • as a source of power, fostered by the desire of the people of con - tiguous communities to secure cheaper electricity and create a new in - dustry in their midst. The generation of power from this river and its distribution over a wide and sparcely settled area on a basis economically sound is yet to be demonstrated. The promoters and the people in the territory have great confidence in the project. If its entire cost could be borne by them this Commission would have no hesitation in approving the necessary securities, because in that event the promoters having full knowledge of the hazards involved, would stake their own money on their judgement, while the people in the communities served would have the benefit of the low rates pro - posed and 1 would have their savings as a substitute for any lack of earnings if the venture does not prove the success anticipated. It is proposed, however, to sell stock to people in distant communities where, forsooth, it must be offered strictly on an investment basis. This has prompted the Commission to weigh the prosp-cts of succes* Supplies and labor 15,000.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p284">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 284 very carefully. The chief difficulty lies in the marketing of a suffici - ent amount of the power produced to provide a return on the large investment necessary. Estimates of the possible consumption must be largely speculative. This uncertainty clouds the prospects of the enterprise. Purchasers of stock should be fully aware, therefore, that they are embarking in a speculative venture that may or may not realize the success which its Dromoters so confidently anticipate. The estimate shows that the company will need about $000,000 in cash. The Commission will authorize the issue and sale of the common stock for cash at par and provide that when this stock is sold and the proceeds have been expended or plant contracted for in this amount, the company may issue and sell its preferred stock in the sum of $470,000 par value, to net applicant not less than 86 percentum of par. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission that the Northern Nebraska Power company of Omaha, be and the same is hereby permitted to issue and sell its common stock in the sum of $200,000 par value, for cash, at par. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that if and when petitioner's common stock is sold as above described and satisfactory proof is made to the Commission of the sale, and not otherwise, it may sell its 8«fc preferred stock in the sum of $470,000 par value, to net it not less than 85 percentum of par. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall charge oper - ating revenue and credit depreciation reserve not less than $12,000 per annum, charges against the reserve to be made only for the cost of property retired.

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, Thome A. Browne, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6082 In the Matter of the Application of the Northern Nebraska Pow - er Company for Permit to Issue and Sell its Common and Preferred Stock in amount of $700,000 par value. SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: In the original order, 8 per cent preferred stock in the amount of $470,000 par value was authorized by the Commission. While not referred to in the opinion or order, this preferred stock, under the charter provisions of the company, was made a participating stock to the extent that in addition to the eight per cent cumulative dividends, it was to share in dividends above that amount up to 12 per cent. After further consideration, applicant has decided that these provisions are more liberal to prospective preferred stockholders than conditions demand. They now ask, therefore, that they be permitted to issue non-participating, cumulative seven per cent preferred stock. The proposal has the virtue of reducing the con - tracted charges against net revenues. It also is more favorable to common stockholders, who are to bear the brunt of the initial financing of the enterprise. The change would, therefore, appear to be reasonable, and we know of no reason why it should not be approved. Since the issuance of the original order, applicant finds that it may, and probably will, be necessary to go outside the circle of promoters to sell a portion of the common stock. No provision is made in the order for the cost of the sale of common stock, be- </seg>
            <seg id="p286">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 286 cause it was assumed that this stock would all be absorbed by the promoters. If any of it is sold, necessarily some expense will be incurred. There appears to be no good reason why such selling expense should not be allowed, providing it does not exceed 16 per cent and provided further that such cost be charged out later against earned surplus. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that paragraph 1 of the original order be amended by striking the period at the end thereof and adding the following words: "provided that any expense not exceeding 15 per centum of the par value, incurred in the selling thereof, shall be allowed and shall be carried on the books of applicant under an account to be known as 'Discount and Expense on Sale of Stock', which account may not be charged off without the consent of the Commission, except against earned surplus." IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that paragraph 2 of the original order be eliminated and the following substituted: "IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that if and when petitioner's common stock is sold as above described, and satisfactory proof is made to the Commission of the sale, and not otherwise, it may sell its 7 per cent non-participating, cumulative pre - ferred stock in the sum of $470,000 par value, to net it not iess than 85 per centum of par."

Appearances: For applicant - Sackett &amp; Brewster, attorneys; W. C. Black, C. L. Aller. For the Commission - B. E. Forbes, engineer, I. J. Devoe, accountant. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman: This applicant is in a formative stage. It has not completed its articles of incorporation, awaiting the conclusions of the Commission in order to conform to the provisions of the articles where neces - sary, to those conclusions. What is here said, and the conclusions reached, are, of course, conditioned upon the legal birth of ap - plicant as a corporation. The electric properties considered in the hearing on this ap - plication, are owned by Black Brothers, and during their develop - ment have been carried in the books of that company as an elec - tric department. It is now purposed to form a corporation which will purchase the electric properties from Black Brothers. The financing involved is for the purpose of paying for the properties. In the original application it was proposed to frame the ar - ticles with an authorized capitalization of $750,000, and to issue as of November 1, 1925, (a) six per cent first mortgage bonds in par amount $250,000; (b) seven per cent preferred stock in par amount $150,000; (c) common stock in par amount $100,000. It was proposed to sell the bonds at 95 per centum of par, the preferred stock at 90 per centum of par, and the common stock at 80 per centum of par. It was alleged that the property was worth $443,200. Later the application was amended to ask for authority to issue (a) six per cent first mortgage bonds in par amount $200,000; (b) seven per cent preferred stock in par amount $100,000; (c) common stock in par amount $210,000. It was alleged that the property, tangible and intangible, plus the discounts mentioned, would provide total assets of $525,352. The property which applicant proposes to buy consists of a hydro - electric development at Blue Springs, Nebraska; a hydro-electric de- Epment several miles south of Beatrice; oil engine plants at Beatrice; transmission lines inter-connecting the generating plants and con - ng the current to designated master meters in Wymore and </seg>
            <seg id="p288">288 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Beatrice. The Commission's engineer checked the properties, and the Commission's accountant made a careful check of costs as shown by the books of Black Brothers. The Commission's accountant found the balance sheet of the electric department of Black Brothers Flour Mills, as of September 80, 1925, to contain the following assets and liabilities, (stated in ma- jor accounts only) : ASSETS Total plant .$282,677.16 Total current assets '. 21,296.28 Deferred assets 9.98 Total assets ..$803,882.82 LIABILITIES Black Brothers investment $269,901.91 Accrued taxes 4,183.90 Insurance reserve 886.17 Maintenance reserve 6,692.00 Depreciation reserve 18,378.90 Undivided profits 8,839.94 Total liabilities $803,882.82 As of January 1, 1926, the plant account had increased to $285,- 166. In the plant account, which is intended to represent cost, is an item of approximately $26,000 representing a transfer of the original Blue Springs water power properties, to the electrical department. After this transfer the company very generally rebuilt and improved the properties at Blue Springs, so that the total cost including the original entry now stands at approximately $123,000 on the books. Black Brothers began to advance funds for the construction of these properties in the latter part of 1922. The books do not indicate that any interest has been paid on these advances, or any amounts credited to Black Brothers and charged to the plant for such interest. In costs of construction, the charging of interest is legitimate and al- lowance for it must be made in this instance, in order to show the total cost from the books. Although the entire construction covered a period of only three rs, and was hardly concluded at the time the application was filed, company had an appraisal made, and endeavored to arrive at a </seg>
            <seg id="p289">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 289 cost of reproduction as of September 30, 1925. A comparison of the inventory value by classifications and the book value, is set out below, the latter figures not having been adjusted to represent interest, charges whereas the former figure includes allowances and interest, as well as other overheads. Classification Inventory Value Book Value Careful book records of costs of properties, just completed, should coincide with an engineer's appraisal or reproduction cost new. Where they do not so coincide, the book record is of superior value, although it is fair to adjust such book value for obvious expenditures not in - cluded, such as interest during construction. Interest during construc - tion should be computed for the period between the advancement of funds and the putting of elements of property into service. Under all the circumstances connected with this case, a careful consideration of the nature of the construction, and time actually experienced in the construction, we find that the book costs should be increased in an amount of five per cent for interest and that the new corporation may reasonably include such amount in its plant account, and pay for it on that basis. As of January 1, 1926, the fixed investment would therefore be $299,424. The company should also pay in securities or cash, for only the working assets that are transferred to it by the former owner. To this principle applicant agrees and indicates its intention of purchas - ing working assets in amount $12,849. The assets which applicant desires to set up on its books after it Es completed its purchases from Black Brothers, and on which assets is desired to issue the securities already mentioned, read as follows of date January 1, 1926: lant No. 2 $136,041 $123,221.75 'lant No. 3 78,144 62,312.73 'lant No. 4 61,820 - 64,882.95 'ransmission lines, etc. 46,821 41,517.23 "telephone lines -- 1,375 _. 642.50 forking capital ._ 16,210 2i.296.28 Vater rights ._: 102,789 . _ . .

The organization item of $4,800 should include the legal expenses, which have been considerable in this case. On showing made by the company as to actual costs, we will use a figure for organization and legal expenses, of $7,727, which obligation Black Brothers will pay, in turn for payment, in some form, of the amount stated, to that company. The item of financing and legal expense in amount $42,000, is in fact the proposed discount on common stock. This common stock will largely represent an investment by applicant in the intangible values, such as water rights. Where such intangible values are pur- chased for a consideration in common stock, the Commission has said that it should be considered as worth par in the transfer. It will ad- here to that rule here. Therefore, the item of $42,000 will be stricken. We will treat in like manner, the assets item proposed, of intangibles in amount $31,233.50. This obviously occurs in the assets, because of the amount of capital securities it is proposed to issue. Applicant proposes to buy the water rights from Black Brothers Flour Mills for $102,789. This figure is arrived at by comparing the •cost of producing 3,250,000 k.w.h. per annum by a steam plant, as compared with its production cost with the present hydro-electric gen- erating plants aided by internal combustion engines. Applicant figures that it will save $7,709 per annum by use of its present equipment, as compared with the hypothetical steam plant, and by capitalizing this amount at 7-1/2 per cent, arrives at the value stated above. </seg>
            <seg id="p291">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 291 The cost of making current by steam plant, as used in the above computations, is 2.853 cents per k.w.h. The use of this cost figure in arriving at the value of the water rights, is faulty, if applicant could buy its current from other companies for less than that figure. The record is silent on the possibility, but it is well known that a large hydro-electric plant is situated at Barneston, which could probably sell at a profit to itself, to applicant for less than this figure, represent - ing cost of production by steam plant. A second fault to be found with the computations is that applicant is bound by long-time contract, to Bell most of its current wholesale at 2-1/2 cents per k.w.h. It should not claim in water power value, a profit which its contracts forbid it to get. ..^ !The .water power under consideration at plants Nos. 2 and 3, are of undoubted value to their users. One right is in perpetuity and dates back to an early grant. The other right is good for 50 years, at small rental value per annum to the state. We will follow the rule laid down by us in findings on Applica - tion No. 4460 of the Southern Nebraska Power company of Superior, Nebraska. N. S. R. C. report Vol. 14, page 326, which finding was sustained by the supreme court Of Nebraska, 109 Neb. 683. It is not necessary here to repeat the reasoning set forth in full in that case. There is an additional intangible value which the seller in this case is entitled to claim, and for which he can probably secure dol - lars in payment, in a free transaction such as this is not. This addi - tional intangible may be properly called "going value" and represents the fact that the coordination of generating plants has been carried to a successful conclusion, and a steady market for a large amount of production has been secured. It is somewhat difficult to separate the consideration of this intangible, from the consideration of the Other intangible called water rights. They appear to blend together and to overlap. We find a fair ledger entry for the total intangibles to be — "Water power and going value $60,000". : We find also that in the capitalization of applicant company, se - curities may properly be sold to represent the purchase of that amount of. intangible property. Applicant proposes to sell its bonds at a price of 95. It proposes also to dispose of the preferred stock in customer ownership through - out the territory served by it, and estimates the selling cost to be $10 share. We find both estimates reasonable. • We further find that the property which is to be purchased, shall appear on the ledger of applicant as opening plant entries, under date of January 1, 1926, (stated in main subdivisions only) as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p292">292 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Opening entries as to liabilities, except as to capital liabilities, shall include accounts payable $1,211.64, and depreciation reserve |14, 140.94. This will leave for a total of bonds and stock to be approved, $884,647.42. There is still to be considered, the question of the relation of stocks and bonds. Applicant will be a Nebraska corporation. Section 462, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides "The articles of in - rporation must fix the highest amount of indebtedness or liability which the corporation shall, at any one time, be subject, which must in no case exceed two-thirds of the capital stock". Section 676 provides that public utility corporations may issue securities under conditions, and in amounts set forth by the Railway Commission. As to foreign corporations, the Commission has ruled many times that the limitation provided in section 462 does not apply, and that reason - able financing does not necessitate so low a limit of indebtedness. It has also considered the question of whether the enactment of specific legislation in 1909, relative to public utility corporation financing supersedes the general corporate provision of section 462, enacted in the early days of the state. If section 462 applies to applicant, it is a statutory direction to the corporation, and not to the Commission. The validity of debts is not limited by the restrictions of section 462. The question of the re - lation of stocks and bonds is primarily a corporate one. Unless there is a legal bar, this Commission has no objection to applicant issuing and selling $200,000 par amount of first mortgage bonds. We will, therefore, authorize the election by applicant of one of two options, dependent upon what its articles of incorporation shall ultimately say. The first option will be upon the assumption that the corporation does not find it necessary to put the limitations of section t2 into its articles. The second option will be used by the company case the limitations of section 462 are included in the articles.

OPINION AN© FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: The applicant herein asks the authority of the Commission to sell "at not less than ninety per cent (90%) of their par value its First Mortgage Six Percent Bonds in the sum of $732,000, par value." The specific purposes for which the proceeds of the bonds here asked to be authorized are as follows: ; Purpoie Original Amended Petition Petition Additions and betterments now in . place To finish uncompleted plant now in $140,289.04 $140,289.04 place 86,746.65 86,746.65 Additions and betterments to be placed at Columbus, Nebraska 143,183.00 171,808.00 Additions and betterments to be placed at Michell, South Da - kota .._ Additions and betterments to be 228,967.50 249,658.30 placed at Aberdeen, South Da - kota _ _. 58,967.00 82,660.00 $659,153.19 $731,161.99 </seg>
            <seg id="p295">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 295 We will consider consecutively the purposes for which the issue is asked, At the hearing applicant made a showing of its assets and liabili- ties and results of operation as of September 30, 1925. The total ad- ditions and betterments including acquisition of new properties as of September 30, 1925, as shown by Exhibit A are as follows: June 30 to Dec. 31, 1924, $209,255.97 Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, 1925, 473,522.83 Unfinished plant to Sept. 30, 1925, 284,979.17 Acquisition Webster property 70,800.00 Acquisition of Iroquois property 36,154.00 Total $1,074,711.97 As sources of funds for the above additional assets acquired by the company since June 30, 1924, the applicant shows the following in Exhibit A. Reserve for depreciation . $221,695.63 Received from sale of preferred stock 4600 shares 462,727.30 Deduction Commission's order April 28, 1924, 250,000.00 Total $934,422.93 When the last sum shown above is deducted from the total additions, betterments and acquisitions to the property it leaves $140,289.04 against which applicant asks to have bonds authorized. The amount received from the sale of preferred stock and the amount of $250,000 stipulated in our order of April 28, 1924, are de- ducted in the computations above for reasons stated elsewhere. It is less obvious that the amount of the depreciation reserve account should also be deducted, as it accumulates, the reserve account is represented by cash. It has a specific corporate purpose. When the cash is used for construction purposes, as may readily have happened here, it con- stitutes a temporary use of other corporate funds for construction. The property thus acquired may be capitalized through sale of securi- ties and the corporate funds be restored. In this case if the property built from use of depreciation funds is capitalized, cash will appear in this company's assets. Generally speaking it is economy to again invest the cash in property additions. Handled in this way the reserve, not presently needed to meet retire- ments, may become a sort of revolving construction account. We will so consider it here. The amount of preferred stock which has been deducted from ad- ditions and betterments in the sum of $462,727.30 is proper, and will be so considered by us in our final summary. </seg>
            <seg id="p296">296 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Our order of August, 1924, required that the company put $250, - 000 cash into the property without securities being issued therefor. This company is operated under a no-par stock plan and whatever value there is in the fixed investment above outstanding debts and pre - ferred stock is represented either in surplus or in no-par stock. Responding to the condition of the order referred to, the owners of the common stock placed $130,000 in the treasury of the company, this being a cash payment without the imposition of a corresponding liability upon the corporation. An analysis of the assets and liabilities discloses that the remaining $"120,000 has been extended for additions and betterments. A portion of the amount has been derived from earnings which would otherwise have gone to the credit of the common stockholders either as dividends or surplus. The remainder is rep - resented by money owed to the parent corporation in the amount of $85,000 and shown in the liabilities as accounts payable. Applicant, under the order, was to have completed payment of the $250,000 .by December 31, 1925. The Commission has previously declined to per - mit revaluations of purchased properties to be used to discharge this obligation. It follows, therefore, that the common stockholders should either advance the balance of $120,000 in cash, or as an alternative cancel the accounts payable owing to the parent corporation in the sum of $35,000 and charge earned surplus to the extent of $85,000. On September 30, 1925, the earned surplus amounted to $80,943, so that by December 31, the amount should have been sufficient for this Aggregating the preferred stock sold as of September 30, 1925, and that deduction by reason of the Commission's order, we have the total sum of $712,727.30. The amount just stated deducted from the total of additions, betterments, and acquisitions of $1,074,711.97, leaves $361,984.47 instead of $140,289.04 as set up by the applicant on page 1 of Exhibit A, which may properly be capitalized after same has been adjusted as hereinafter provided. In our order entered in Application 5812 dated August 21, 1924 we discussed at some length the propriety of the applicant placing o its books, purchased property based upon an engineer's estimate of th value of the plant acquired. We find from this record the same gen - eral policy has been applied to the purchase of the Webster and Iro - quois property. According to Exhibit A the Webster property has been placed on the books at an estimated value of $70,800. Accon ing to the record the applicant actually paid $20,000 for this property The Iroquois plant has been entered at an estimated value of $"36,15 fox which the company paid $25,000. There was some place around $6,000 or $7,000 additional money expended for the acquisition o these properties, making in round figures a total of $52,000 actual </seg>
            <seg id="p297">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 297 cost to the applicant instead of $106,954, as the same were entered »the books. Again we want to emphasize our disapproval of such on, and in this case we will consider the properties of Webster and Iroquois as having a value of $52,000. The additions and betterments to the property from June 30, 1924, to September 30, 1925, have been checked by our auditing department and found to have been placed on the books at the cost to the appli - cant. The total of additions and betterments as shown by Exhibit A is $967,757.97. Included in the sum just mentioned is overhead ex - penses in the way of engineering and office supervision which has been charged to the plant account, and as to engineering credited to the Electric Management and Engineering corporation of New York, a subsidiary of the National Electric Power company, the parent com - pany of the applicant. From June, 1924, until July, 1925, five per cent of the cost of labor and material of additions and betterments to the properties was added for engineering. Beginning August 1, 1925, 15 per cent was added to the plant account and credited to the engineering company. During the whole period two per cent of the cost of additions and betterments was charged to the plant account and credited to operating expenses as representing "office supervision and expenses." Fifteen per cent of the cost of material and labor as an engineering charge for all classes of property added to the plant is, in our estimation, exces - sive particularly when part of the engineering is locally done. For the purpose of this application we will assume that the five per cent charge, as entered on the books for engineering services up to August 1, 1925, was fair and reasonable. The office supervision and expenses of two per cent will be allowed. By recasting the additions and betterments and unfinished plant to September 30 on the basis of five per cent engineering and by in - cluding the Webster and Iroquois properties at $52,000 as heretofore found, we find that the applicant has added to its plant in the way of additions, betterments and acquisitions to September 30, 1925, $286, - 941.53. Addition* and Betterments to be Placed ■ According to the record it appears that the petition was amended, to the additions and betterments that are to be placed at Columbus, Aberdeen and Mitchell, on account of a further study by the engineer - ing company and officers of the applicant in which it was found that the amount stated in the original petition would not be sufficient to cover the expenditures necessary to put the additional property in </seg>
            <seg id="p298">298 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT In the estimates ten per cent has been added to the cost of ma- terial and labor as an engineering item. We shall reduce this amount to five per cent which we have found to be reasonable. The balance of the overheads stated in the estimates will be considered as reasonable and will be accepted. Omissions and contingencies in the amount of ten per cent has been added to the estimates, by the applicant. This item of overheads would not be necessary if the property had actually been put in place. The Commission realizes, however, that in the in- stallation of new equipment cost can seldom be exactly determined. We will require in our order that the applicant keep a detailed record of the expenditures chargeable to the several plants, and that the same be carried under the company's application number as outlined in the "Authorization Application" to-wit: Columbus Application No. 20 dated Nov. 3, 1925 Mitchell " " 45 " " " " 45 Aberdeen 90 " After making the correction in the engineering item for additions and betterments to be placed we find the amended items to be as fol- lows: Columbus $164,834.50 Mitchell 239,529.30 Aberdeen 79,340.00 Total $483,703.80 At the time of hearing some testimony was given as to the amount of money that will be necessary to be expended to complete "the un- finished plant investment of September 30, 1925", which the applicant estimates in the original petition will cost $86,746.65. It is assumed that the item of engineering on the 15 per cent basis has been in- eluded in this item, but in view of the fact that there are no detailed figures as to this item of expenditure the amount as asked for by ap- plicant will be accepted. The total expenditures will be checked when the unfinished property has been completed. Summarizing: Additions and betterments now in place including Webster and Iroquois plants at the adjusted figure $-286,941.53 To complete unfinished plant 86,746.65 Additions and betterments Mitchell, Columbus and Aberdeen 483,703.80 Total $857,391.98 </seg>
            <seg id="p299">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 299 The applicant asks authority to issue its six per cent bonds in the sum of $732,000 par value. The general rule of this Commission is that bonds should not be issued in excess of 75 per cent of the actual cost of the property added or acquired. Seventy-five per cent of the total cost of the property here under consideration is $643,043.99. From the record we find that the applicant should be allowed to issue and sell its six per cent first mortgage bonds is the sum of $640, - 000. The price at which the applicant proposes to sell its bonds namely 90 per cent of par seems to us lower than necessary. In applicants' operating statement for the period January 1 to September 30, 1925, is found the following: The interest requirements per annum based on the interest pay - ments January 1 to September 30, 1925 are $317,333.28. These figures show that the applicant is earning almost twice the interest re - quirements. These figures would appear to justify the sale of bonds at more than 90. In this case we will authorize the applicant to sell the bonds for not less than 92 per cent of face value. IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Northwestern Public Service company be and it hereby is authorized to issue and sell its first mortgage six per cent bonds in amount $640,000 for cash at not less than 92 percentum of the face value of said bonds. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the approval of the issue of these bonds is made only upon the following conditions: (a) The property against which these bonds are issued shall be carried into plant ledger accounts at cost to applicant. (b) "Cost" as used in paragraph (a) shall include not more than 7% per cent for the services of the Electric Management &amp; En - gineering company of New York, or other engineering aid outside ap - plicant's own organization. (c) Record of expenditures shall be kept in accordance with the findings herein on page five, which findings are hereby made a part of this order, and reports shall be made to the Commission monthly until the proceeds of the bond issue here approved have been invested together with 331/3 per cent additional property from other funds. rross earnings * Operating expenses including taxes Operating incomes ,ess amortization, and income tax ret income 12 months basis (1,385,417.18 930,636.31 458,019.53 26,634.23 375,113.68 </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6090 In the Matter of the Application of the Northwestern Public Service company, a Corporation, for an Order Authorizing it to Issue Securities. SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: Applicant prays for a modification of the original order entered in this case on January 26, 1926, in the following particulars: (1) That five per cent of the cost of labor and materials for additions and betterments, is insufficient to cover engineering, and the allowance should be increased. t(2) That bonds in excess of 75 per cent of the actual cost of property added or acquired, should be permitted, for the reason a margin of 25 per cent is greater than is required by law or ty, under the facts in this case. (3) That the provisions of the order prescribing certain methods of accounting, should be changed. Hearing upon the motion for modification was had in the offices of the Commission. After conference, and a more complete under - standing of the accounting provision of the order complained of, ap - plicant withdrew its objection to such provision. </seg>
            <seg id="p301">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 301 It is pointed out by applicant that inasmuch as the discount on the bonds authorized in this order, amounting to $8.00 on each $100 bond, is to be ratably amortized out of earnings of the company over the life of the bonds, the discount thus amortized will be added to the assets of the company and will improve the security to that extent. This is contingent, of course, on the reinvestment in plant of the amortization fund. The face value of bonds thus authorized should not exceed 75 per cent of the additions and betterments plus the re - invested amortized discount. The contention of applicant appears justified, therefore, and a modification of the order will be made in - creasing the amount of bonds authorized. As stated in the original opinion, it was the practice of this com - pany from June, 1924, to July, 1925, to add five per cent of the cost of labor and material in additions and betterments to the properties, for engineering. Beginning August 1, 1925, however, 15 per cent was added to the plant account for this purpose. At the time of re - hearing, applicant submitted its chief engineer for examination as to the services performed by the Electric Management and Engineering corporation of New York, whom it is claimed performs all of the en - gineering service for applicant company. He quite vigorously asserted that the fifteen per cent charged for engineering, plus an additional two per cent for accounting and administration, plus five per cent of gross revenue as a management fee, are in nowise excessive and that services are performed to the full value of such charges. The Com - mission has given very careful consideration to this contention and to the testimony submitted in its support. We continue of the same opinion, however, that such charges are excessive and go far beyond those claimed by any of the other utilities coming within our jurisdic - tion. It appears unnecessary to analyze in detail, the evidence sub - mitted by applicant. It follows that the prayer for modification, in this particular, should be denied. It developed, however, that there is an apparent discrepency be - tween the finding in the original order and the order itself. Condition (b) in the order reads as follows: " 'Cost' as used in paragraph (a) shall include not more than 7-1/2 per cent for the services of the Electric Management and En - gineering Company of New York, or other engineering aid outside ap - plicant's own organization". It is pointed out that the two per cent for accounting and administra - tion, hitherto referred to, is not paid to the Electric Management and Engineering company. Calculations of the base figure in the original finding included only five per cent for engineering. It follows, there - fore, that a correction to the extent of an increase of 2-1/2 per cent should be made. </seg>
            <seg id="p302">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 302 Because of modification in the amount of bonds agreed to, and for the purpose of completely financing the acquired properties and the additions and betterments as approved by the Commission, applicant has filed a supplemental application asking authority to issue $230, - 000 of its seven per cent preferred stock, to be sold so as to net 'not less than 98 per centum of par to the company. We found, in the original order, that the new property subject to capitalization, aggre - gated $857,391.98. After the correction on account of the engineer - ing allowance this would be increased to $868,000 in round numbers; If bonds in the face amount of $700,000 are authorized on the basis of sale at 92 the discount would amount to $56,000. If, during the life of the bonds, this is invested in plant, there would be property in amount $924,000. The bonds would then have a ratio slightly in ex - cess of 75 per cent of this amount. Bonds in the sum of $700,000 will, therefore, be approved. This leaves a balance of $224,000 to be otherwise financed and applicant asks to issue $230,000 of its seven per cent preferred stock at 98 for this purpose. We find this to be reasonably necessary and it will be authorized. Since the issuance of the original order, applicant has submitted affidavits to show that the common stockholders of the company have paid cash in the amount of $120,000 into the treasury of the company, in compliance with the requirement of our order of August, 1924. The common stockholders preferred the alternative of paying cash into the treasury, instead of canceling certain accounts payable, in the amount of $35,000 and charging earned surplus with the remainder. t follows, therefore, that applicant has fully discharged its obligation, der the condition imposed in our order of August, 1924, wherein 50,000 in cash was required to be put into the property without ad - ional securities being issued therefor. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the original order in thw case be amended so as to provide for the authorization of first mort - gage six per cent bonds, in the amount of $700,000, same to be sold for cash, at not less than 92 per centum of the face value of said bonds, such approval to be subject to the following conditions: (a) The property against which these bonds are issued shall be carried into plant ledger accounts at cost to applicant. (b) "Cost" as used in paragraph (a) shall include not more than 7-1/2 per cent for the services of the Electric Management and Engineering company of New York, or other engineering aid outside applicant's own organization. </seg>

(d) Applicant shall file with this Commission not later than the last day of the month, a copy of the regular monthly summary of operation and construction same to continue through the year 1926, and a similar cumulative report quarterly thereafter until further order.

            <seg id="p304">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 304 OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL, Commissioner: The applicant in this case, the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway company, asks for permission to discontinue the employment of an agent and telegraph operator at the town of Millerton, Butler County, and substitute therefor a custodian. The hearing was held in the depot at Millerton, March 4, 1926, that being the time and place specified in a notice to the citizens of Millerton for the holding of the hearing. Millerton is situated on the Hastings branch of the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway, 6.7 miles southwest of David City; Foley a shipping point on the Union Pacific is 3.5 miles northeast; Garrison is 3.6 miles southeast on the Burlington railroad; Rising City 5.5 miles northwest on the Union Pacific; Surprise 7.5 miles southwest on the Northwestern Railway. Millerton is not an incorporated village. There is one large store and post office, one elevator and a limited number of houses. Testimony shows that there are thirty-two inhabi - tants in and closely tributary to what might be considered the limits of the town. There has been a gradual falling off in the company's business at this point for some years past which undoubtedly has been caused by the improvement of roads leading to David City and other towns with larger market facilities, both in the disposing of products and of the purchasing of merchandise. The close proximity of other towns to Millerton also makes the territory very limited and there is no prospect of any improvement so far as business at this station is con - cerned, except what might be produced from increased production on the farms adjacent thereto, which would add to the carload shipments, but not materially to the L.

The railroad company produced testimony to show that if they are permitted to substitute custodian service for agency service, it will make a saving of $1,000 per annum, without any inconvenience to the public. The railroad company proposes to have the billing for all freight done in its office at David City or Surprise, and all telegrams sent from Millerton are to be telephoned by the custodian over the com - pany's private telephone to David City or Surprise, to be transmitted by the operator; all telegrams received at either of these stations for Millerton would be telephoned over the company's private wire to the custodian, to be delivered by him to the parties to whom sent, or tele - phoned from either David City or Surprise, direct from David City or Surprise to the parties to whom they were sent. All express, both outbound and inbound, would be handled by the custodian, the same as it is at the present time, by the agent. The depot will be kept open during the business hours of the day and will be heated when heat is necessary and lighted during the time of the year when trains arrive either before sunrise or after sundown. Patrons desiring cars for shipment of grain or livestock can place their order for cars with the custodian, the same as they now do with the agent, so that the only difference there would be between agency service and custodian service is that patrons of the station would be required to pay their fare op the train, without any extra expense and all freight would have to be prepaid. The Commission is of the opinion that where economies of this Kd can be practiced by the railroads without materially discommoding public, such economies should be permitted.

C. 452-454), the Rock Island asked authority to publish a rate of four cents per cwt. from Fair - bury to Lincoln. Hearing was held on that application and much latitude was given to a discussion of the general level and scale of sand and gravel rates in Nebraska. In its conclusion on that case, the Commission denied authority to publish the four cent rate, but in its findings indicated that the rate should bo 3 i cents per cwt. in order to conform to rates for simi - lar distances on the same commodities elsewhere within Nebraska. This application is the result of that finding, hence no further hearing appears necessary or advisable. It is not necessary to repeat here what was said on Application 6076, supra, except the conclusion that the rate between Fairbury and Lincoln on sand and gravel should be 3% cents per cwt. in order that there may be no discrimination and in order that the sand and gravel rate structure in Nebraska shall be comprehensive and consis - tent. Approval of a rate of 31 cents conforms to the Commission's conclusions in many preceding cases. It will be approved.

Hearing was held on this application at the City Hall at Norfolk, at 9 o'clock A. M. on the eighth day of February, 1926, Commissioners Browne and Randall sitting, pursuant to notice duly given to all towns r would be affected by the granting of the application to the railway pany. Only two towns that had received notice of the application for the discontinuance of the trains seemed sufficiently interested to make an appearance at the hearing. The commercial club of O'Neill was represented by T. V. Golden of O'Neill and the town of Inman was represented by J. S. Jackson and George W. Davies. The railway company produced very complete exhibits showing the result of the operation of trains Nos. 11 and 12, showing that the trains were not being sufficiently patronized to justify the continuing of the running of these trains west of Oakdale. Previous to October 11, 1925, train No. 11 departed from Omaha at 7:55 a. m. and arrived at O'Neill at 3:25 p. m. and train No. 12 running in reverse direction departed from O'Neill at 2:00 p. m. and arrived at Omaha at 10:30 p. m. Train No. 3 departs from Omaha for the west at 4:30 p. m. and arrives at O'Neill at 11:25 p. m. and train No. 22 departs from O'Neill at 10 a. m. and arrives at Omaha at 5 p. m. </seg>
            <seg id="p311">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 311 On April 27, 1924, the railway company installed train No. 13 which left Omaha at 12:15 a. m. arriving at O'Neill at 7:16 a. m. This train carries a sleeper and passangers for the west on that train can avail themselves of sleeping car service, which they do, and this train has been very popular and well patronized. On October 11, 1925, the departing time of train No. 12 from O'Neill east was changed from 2 p. m. to such an early hour that patrons did not avail themselves of its use, but transferred their pat- ronage to train No. 22, which leaves O'Neill at 10:26 a. m., arriving in Omaha at 5 :35 p. m. The transferring of patronage from train No. 12 has made the operation of this train very unprofitable west of Oak- dale, owing to the early hour of the day of its departure. The chang- ing of the schedule time of train No. 12 was brought about in order to make connections at Scribner with train No. 510 on the Oakdale- Scribner branch at Scribner, as train No. 510 is attached to train No. 12 at that point and obviated the necessity of the company running train No. 510 from Scribner to Omaha and return as the equipment is brought back to Scribner on train No. 11 and run as train No. 509 from Scribner to Oakdale, which brought about a very decided economy in the operation of trains No. 509 and 510. Train No. 3 leaves Omaha at 4:10 p. m. and arrives at O'Neill at 11:25 p. m. This is a very popular train for patrons of the road as it makes connection with eastern trains, so also is train No. 13, which leaves Omaha at 12:15 a. m. and these two last mentioned trains are handling the passenger, express and mail business of the road west of Norfolk, sufficiently to take care of the business. The exhibits produced by the company show that the earnings from October 12 to November 11, 1925, on train No. 11 from Norfolk to O'Neill was $1,619.07 that the cost of operating was 1,239.03 and that this left net earnings of 380.04 On the same date the earnings from line No. 11 from Oakdale to O'Neill was $ 773.90 and the cost of operation was 703.51 leaving a net earning of 70.39 On the same dates, October 12 to November 11, 1925 earnings on No. 12 from O'Neill to Norfolk was $ 452.06 and the expense of operating the train was 1,239.03 showing a loss in operation of 776.97 Train No. 12 from O'Neill to Oakdale, the same date. showed earnings of $ 177.67 and expense of operating of train 703.61 showing a net loss of 525.84 </seg>
            <seg id="p312">312 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT This leaves a net loss on the operating of No. 11 and No. 12 from October 12 to November 11 of $396.93 between Norfolk and O'Neill. This clearly indicates that the large part of loss occurs between O'Neill and Oakdale where the time of the arrival of the train is so early that the train is not patronized as passengers for the east are taking the later train. The figures showing the expense of operating these trains are the actual out of pocket expense in the operation and do not contain any maintenance cost of roadway or equipment, or return on in - vestment. The company produced exhibits showing the earnings and expense of train No. 11 for January, 1926 from Norfolk to O'Neill, This plainly shows that the larger part of the earnings on train No. 11 between Norfolk and O'Neill was between Oakdale and Norfolk. Train No. 12, January, 1926, O'Neill to Norfolk, This plainly shows that a large percentage of the loss on train No. 12 is between O'Neill and Oakdale. The Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway company does not have any terminal facilities at O'Neill but is using the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy R. R. company's terminal facilities and round house at an ex - pense of $280.80 per month, which if added to the operating expenses of trains No. 11 and 12, would make the out of pocket expenses $280. - tmore on trains No. 11 and 12. From the exhibits introduced and past experience of the use of No. 12 it is very evident that the Be of the large falling off in the patronage of No. 12 is the time of departure in the morning from O'Neill and this has thrown the pas- learnings $1,000.0 1 Expense 1,193.14 Net earnings 475.78 a Oakdale to O'Neill, Earnings 882.71 Expense 676.78 Net earnings 205.93 juaiiimgB .... __ &lt;p ovo.v i Expenses 1,193.14 Showing a loss of 889.17 n No. 12, January, 1926, from O'Neill to Oakdale, Earnings 123.39 Expenses 676.78 Showing a loss of 553.89 </seg>

This condition cannot be corrected owing to the connections at Scribner with train No. 510. There is another factor that undoubtedly enters into the reason for the falling off of patronage on trains No. 11 and 12 and that is the construction and maintenance of highways paralleling the railway right of way. The privately owned automobile and the public bus is taking the short haul passenger business between stations and also between O'Neill and Norfolk so that there has naturally been a reduc - tion in passenger patronage on trains No. 11 and 12. The Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway company maintain terminal facilities at Oak - dale where they have a round house, turn table and a "Y", so that if the company are permitted to make the terminus of No. 11 and 12 at Oakdale, the terminal expense would be eliminated. The out of pocket expense for the company to run No. 11 to Oakdale and No. 12 from Oakdale instead of discontinuing it at Nor - folk is small, as the engine expense is the only added expense over terminating at Norfolk and the trains would serve four additional towns in a well populated section. With train No. 13 leaving Omaha at 12:15 a. m. giving passengers an opportunity to take a sleeper to points that are served by train No. 11 and arriving at O'Neill at 7:16 a. m. and with train No. 3 leaving Omaha at 4:10 p. m. and arriving at O'Neill at 11:25 p. m., this gives the patrons west of Oakdale a train arriving at their des - tination in the morning and one in the evening, both at reasonable hours. In moving in the reverse direction it gives the patrons of the road at O'Neill and intermediate stations between O'Neill and Nor - folk train No. 14 which leaves O'Neill at 1:53 a. m. and arrives at Norfolk at 4:45 a. m. and at Omaha at 9:50 a. m. and train No. 22 which leaves O'Neill at 10:26 a. m. arriving in Norfolk at 12:55 p. m. and Omaha at 5:35 p. m. The Commission is of the opinion that with the showing made by the railroad company of the loss of business on trains No. 11 and 12 and the service rendered patrons by trains No. 3 and 13 west and No. 14 and 22 east, that the application should be granted and that the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway company be permitted to discontinue running trains No. 11 and 12 west of Oakdale.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6143 Pe Matter of the Application of the Union Pacific Railroad Company for Authority to Discontinue the Operation of Trains Nos. 137 and 138 between Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Valparaiso, Nebraska. Appearances For applicant, C. A. Magaw, attorney; For village of Mead, John Jeppson, R. M. Erway. OPINION AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: About a year and a half ago the Union Pacific installed a new train between Council Bluffs, Iowa, and Kansas City, Missouri, running through Lincoln, Nebraska, and Topeka, Kansas, which is known as No. 13,8 southbound and No. 137 northbound. This train service was instituted as an experiment, the thought being that traffic between the capital cities of Nebraska and Kansas would justify through service, and for operating convenience the schedule was extended to Council Bluffs on the north and Kansas City at the southern end. This train has failed to meet expectations in the development of traffic. Appli- Kon is now made to this Commission for authority to operate the n between Valparaiso, Nebraska, and Kansas City, Missouri, thus eliminating the mileage between Valparaiso and Council Bluffs, a dis - tance of 66 or 130 miles for the round trip. The effect of the proposed change would be to restore the service to approximately what it was before these trains were installed. Slight changes in the running time of the other passenger trains were made when Nos. 137 and 138 were put on. i Notice of the filing of this application was sent by the Commission to all towns, Valparaiso to Valley inclusive and to points west on the Central City line as far as Polk. No protests were received from the towns on the Central City line. Objections were made, however, by </seg>
            <seg id="p315">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 315 citizens of Wahoo, Mead and Weston. The first hearing on the appli - cation was held on January 15 and on the morning of that day repre - sentatives of Wahoo telephoned that it would be impossible for them to be present and asked for a later date. The testimony of the company was taken on that date and the protest of the village of Mead was presented at the same time by two witnesses of that town. The re - quest of Wahoo was granted and January 21 was fixed as the date for the second hearing, the data presented by applicant being submitted to the Wahoo representatives for advance study. When that time ar - rived, the Commission was again advised that it would be impossible for representatives of that city to appear in person and that they de - sired to submit written objections, which they did. Representatives of the carrier, including counsel, general passenger agent and general manager appeared for this hearing but as no protestants presented themselves no further hearing was had. In the evidence submitted by the applicant, it is shown that in re - sponse to the requests made by the Commission a study of the traffic on trains Nos. 137 and 138 for the month of December from stations Valley to Valparaiso was made and disclosed that gross revenue of 1689.19 for train No. 137 and $425.73 for train No. 138 was earned. This included all revenue from tickets sold at stations between Valley and Valparaiso, inclusive. Train No. 137 carries no mail. Number 138 carries a small amount of mail for which the total annual rev - enue for the entire run is $800. The express revenue for the month of December for the entire trip Council Bluffs to Kansas. City was $994.17. Two hundred twenty-seven dollars and eight cents of this amount accrued between Valparaiso and Omaha. The railroad company receives only a portion of this revenue, approximately 50 per cent. It will be seen, therefore, that the express and mail revenue is not a large factor in the operation of the train. In view of the showing just made we are at a loss to understand that portion of the protest of Wahoo in which it is stated that if mail and express were handled pn these trains they could be made to pay. : Applicants submit a statement covering the out-of-pocket cost of operation of these trains between Council Bluffs and Valparaiso. The amount for a month totaled $1,473.52. Objection was made to this statement by the representatives from Mead on the ground that these trains made no stops between Valley and Omaha and hence receive no revenues; hence the expense of that portion of the trip should not be charged against the operation of the train. We have made a calculation on the basis of operating the train through the Valley instead of Val - paraiso and find that the added mileage would result in a cost for the month of $887. At our request the company has made a careful analy - sis of all passenger traffic for the period December 1 to December 21 inclusive, originating and terminating on the line Valparaiso to Omaha. </seg>
            <seg id="p316">316 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT In this analysis credit is given for business originating and terminating on this section of the line. This analysis shows that $377.64 of revenue would be lost if the trains are stopped at Valparaiso, that is, this amount would be lost directly, but the remainder of the revenue de - rived from passengers originating or terminating between these points would go to other trains. While there might be some difference of opinion as to just how passengers would travel between various points in the event these trains are discontinued from Valparaiso to Omaha, we have given careful attention to the statement submitted by the company and find it to be based on fair assumption. The statement submitted by the company at the time of the hear - ing shows that for the month of December there was a total of 489% tickets sold for train No. 137 and 331 tickets sold for train No. 138. This is an average of less than sixteen per day for train No. 137 and an average of less than eleven for train No. 138. There is now a graveled highway from Lincoln to Fremont passing through Wahoo. There is a paved highway from Fremont to Omaha. Both of these roads are readily accessible to the towns on the Union Pacific between Valparaiso and Valley. The traffic during December or for any winter month will be heavier than during the remainder of the year on account of the universal disposition to use automobiles in good weather. A bus line operates between Lincoln and Fremont passing through Wahoo and another line operates from Fremont to Omaha. The towns protesting complain principally of the interference with Sunday mail which will be caused by the discontinuance of these trains. It is manifest, however, that a revenue of only $800 for the entire year and for the full distance Kansas City to Omaha will not justify the operation of these trains even between Valparaiso and Valley. The citizens of Wahoo assert that if "an effort had been made by the rail - road company to get sufficient patronage for their train * * * it might be continued" and pledge the cooperation of Wahoo citizens to increase traffic if the trains are continued. We hardly know what more the railroad company could do than it has done in securing business for these trains. They have operated the trains on a schedule which pro - testants say is very satisfactory. The record shows that even in the most favorable month people have not patronized the service thus pro - vided. Mr. Jeppson, one of the representatives from Mead, in a state - ment in writing submitted to the Commission subsequent to the hearing •ays: "We that are on the politic firing line have our ears close enough to the ground so we notice the rumblings that the Commis - sion favors the corporations at the expense of the people. And. as this is an election year I fear that (should your decision be for the R. R.) such talk would influence the voter to the detriment of </seg>

This precinct that I have represented for the last 20 years is normally strongly republican, and I should hate to see it go the other way." The Commission is govened by the law and the facts. In this par - ticular case neither appears to justify the continued operation of this train between Valparaiso and Council Bluffs. It is our opinion, there - fore, that the application of the company should be granted. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Union Pacific Railroad company be, and the same hereby is, authorized to discontinue the operation of its trains Nos. 137 and 138 between Valparaiso, Nebraska, and Council Bluffs, Iowa, same to become effective Sunday, February 14, 1926.

There is a high school, one bank, one large store and post office, and one elevator, lumber yard, garage, pool hall and several comfortable homes. Owing to the close proximity of other lines of railroads and other towns the territory is not very extensive, but it is a rich fertile farming country and well settled with thrifty farmers and everyone of them boosters for the town of Garrison. i M The business at Garrison has not fallen off perceptibly during the year 1925 in comparison with 1924. The total business, less cream and express done by the company at Garrison in 1924, was $22,697.14. During the year 1925, the business transacted at the 1 - Garrison station was as follows: The salary of the agent at Garrison amounts to $1,450.00 and with the salary of the custodian, which is $120.00 makes a total of $1,570.00 that is paid to the agent and custodian. This is 6.83% on the amount of business transacted by the company at this station, which in the judgment of the Commission is not excessive for the amount of business furnished the company by the patrons of the road at Garri - son. The larger part of the earnings of the road at Garrison is carload shipments, which could be billed from David City or Ulysses without inconvenience to the public. By the substitution of custodian for agen - cy service at Garrison, there would be probably $1,000 saved to the company. The commission is of the opinion that where the L. C. L. freight, ticket sales, cream and express business amounts to as large a sum as it does at Garrison, agency service should be provided. rnings L. C. L. _.. $ 1,392,78 C.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 61S3 In the Matter of the Application of the Platte Valley Telephone Com - pany for Authority to Reconstruct its Exchange a Minatare and to Publish Amended Rate Schedule. Appearances : For applicant, Eben D. Warner, president. For subscribers, L. L. Conklin, mayor of Minatare. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman: This application comes to us in the unusual form of proposed rate increases asked for both by the company and subacribeVe. The sub - scribers desire the exchange rebuilt to common battery service. It is now metallic magneto service. The company is willing to make the added investment, provided it is assured of rates which it is estimated will produce a return on that added investment -■.- A petition was filed setting forth a scale of proposed rates aa follows: Gross Net Business individual, wall Business party, wall Residence individual, wall Residence party line, wall Business extension station Residence extension station Extension bells Extension gong Switch or key Push button and buzzer with extension station ?4.25 3.75 2.75 2.25 1.00 .60 .25 .50 .50 .50 $4.00 3.50 2.50 2.00 1.00 .50 .25 .50 .50 .50 </seg>

The application also covers private branch exchange rates. This application is signed not only by the Platte Valley Telephone rpany, but by almost all the subscribers of the company, other than tl subscribers. Protest was filed by letter and telegram from the Great Western Sugar eompany, and by one business subscriber. That company is building a beet sugar factory at Minatar?. It is not stated whether the protest is on behalf of the corporation, or on behalf of subscribers. May - or Conklin is authority for the statement that he and a Minatare banker circulated the petition for signers, on their own responsibility, as an inducement both to company and Commission, to approve the program, and that all subscribers were well advised as to the rates proposed, if the new class of service were installed. It is the Commission's duty, however, to pass on proposed rates, and to make such investigation as will indicate whether the rates will produce more than the fair return allowed by law. We refused to approve the application until such data was forthcoming. It has been filed by applicant company. At the Minatare exchange are now approximately 230 subscribers, of which less than 100 would be affected by the proposed improvement of service and increase in rates. The company's estimate of increased investment is $13,000, details of which are filed with the application. It estimates also that with the completion of the sugar factory, the number of subscribers will increase within a year, from 93 to 235 with - in the town, and that this increase will be further augmented to 295 subscribers before the end of two years. The present plant serving Minatare, has almost capacity use. If the development of the town begins as these witnesses say it is certain to do, there must be in any event, a definite additional investment by the company. That fact must be taken into account. is the opinion of the Commission, not only on this application, others which we have considered in the past, that exchanges of </seg>
            <seg id="p321">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 321 the size it is estimated Minatare will be within two years from this date, do not warrant the installation of common battery service as economical service. It is doubtful whether we would require it upon petition of subscribers, if the company were hostile as to the invest - ment. It is doubtful if we would require it upon petition of the com - pany, when accompanied by proposal to increase rates to this extent. The petition before us, however, has the support of both subscribers and company. The subscribers are willing to pay the higher rate, the company is willing to risk investment and its estimate of growth. We will not stand in the way of improvement, but will content ourselves with recording our seasoned conclusion, that if the subscribers were willing to be served with present magneto service, lower rates could be enjoyed. We are handicapped by not having before us seasoned estimates of operating expenses. If the exchange doubles or triples its number of subscribers within two or three years, it is certain that the expenses will be very considerably heavier than in 1924. Those expenses were approximately $5,000. Added investment will call for maintenance and depreciation in amount $1,350 additional. Traffic, general and com - mercial expenses now amounting to $2,150, will increase very materi - ally. The expenses at the Oshkosh exchange which has two-thirds the number of town subscribers it is estimated Minatare will have within a year or so, are $5,200 per year, excluding return on the investment. If the proposed rates are approved by us and if the growth of the exchange approximates the company's estimate, the gross revenue should be, within one year from this time, about $800 per month, and within two years, $900 per month. The proposed increase in plant is on so extensive a scale as to represent individual service as a maximum to 300 subscribers in the town of Minatare, with extensive cable capacity for this number of subscribers. The rates proposed are those recently promulgated for the neigh- Iing town of Oshkosh, after very careful investigation. Under all circumstances, we will approve the application for Minatare, with - further hearing than has already been had. In that approval it st be understood that we are not passing judgment upon the extent the reconstruction and improvement of the plant at Minatare. It y be that it will prove to be excessive in advance construction, and t the rates here approved will not warrent the investment proposed. i adequacy of the rate structure proposed is of course dependent &gt;n the development of the town. Here again those who put their ney in are taking the risk. If the development approximates the imates, the rates will produce an adequate return within two years, the development exceeds the estimate, the rates may be more than </seg>
            <seg id="p322">322 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT essential. If the development is less, the rates may be inadequate to produce the full return contemplated by law. In that event, however, the question of an overbuilt plant will have to be considered, if the company complains of inadequate revenues. These statements are made for cautionary effect. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that the Platte Valley Telephone company be, and it here - by is authorized to publish and collect the following rates for tele - phone service on its exchange at Minatare, Nebraska: IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the above rates be collected upon the following conditions: k(a) The above rates shall not be published and collected until the int within the exchange area of Minatare, has been reconstructed for mmon battery service.

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, Thome A. Browne, Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6162 In the Matter of the Application of the York Water Company for Au - thority to Issue Securities. Appearances: For applicant, W. L. Kirkpatrick, attorney. For the Commission, I. J. Devoe, accountant. B. E. Forbes, chief engineer. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman: Applicant is a Nebraska corporation with maximum authorized capital stock of $100,000 divided into one thousand shares par value $100 each. It has outstanding at the present time, $40,000 first mort - gage six per cent bonds, due and payable in 1932, and $$0,000 of common capital stock. Applicant seeks the approval of the Commission to an issue of 965,000 in par amount of six per cent first mortage bonds to be sold to net applicant not less than 95 per centum of par, and to issue $40, - 000 in face amount of additional common stock. The purpose of the bond issue is to retire the present mortgage indebtedness, to fund float - ing debts in amount of $11,000 and to secure additional funds for needed extensions and betterments. The purpose of the additional stock </seg>
            <seg id="p324">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 324 issue is to recompense present stockholders for uncapitalized invest - ments during the past life of the company. From the books the following is taken: Under Nebraska law, a Nebraska corporation cannot incur in - debtedness in excess of two-thirds of the outstanding capital stock. The full amount of the bonds here prayed for cannot be approved un - less the capital stock is $100,000. The total amount of capital obli - gations, if the application is approved, will be $165,000. Plainly this capitalization will be much in excess of the assets shown by the books. On account of the testimony of applicant's witnesses, attacking the integrity of their own book accounts, the Commission's accounting de - partment made check of the books and certain underlying records. It is the practice of the Commission, unless throughly advised of the ac - counting system of a public utility applicant, to check their acocunts, and not to accept the book statement as conclusive. The original issue of $60,000 of stock and the corresponds: plant account set up after the sale of the property under receivership about thirty years ago, was not based upon a definite study of the value of the property. Inasmuch as the present plant account is based in part upon that original setup, and inasmuch as it was the practice of the company annually to shrink its plant account to represent an estimated depreciation, it was clear that other data than the plant ac - count, was necessary in order to ascertain the fair cost of existing properties. At our request, applicant furnished a copy of an inventory and appraisal made for the city of York by Burns and McDonnell in 1909. This appraisal showed a fair cost, exclusive of any intangible elements, &lt;o have been $60,111. The city officials pointed out in a circular is - sued at that time, that this inventory omitted $3,000 of property de- Fixed investment $117,458 Current assets 4,053 Total assets $121,512 LIABILITIES Common stock $ 60,000 First mortgage bonds 40,000 Bills and notes payable 11,041 Other liabilities 10,471 Total liabilities $121,512 </seg>
            <seg id="p325">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 325 finitely. Using this corrected inventory as a starting point, and ad - ding the additions and betterments to the end of 1925 as they are shown by the books, we arrive at a cost estimate of $138,357. This is an undepreciated total. We omit computations on depreciated value because, first, the Burns and McDonnell inventory depreciated the property more rigo - rously that we are able to approve, and second, although depreciation was charged off from year to year, the company's books indicate quite clearly that this was done at the expense of fair dividends, and that the rates currently enjoyed by the citizens of York did not provide an offset for depreciation of investment. There was also submitted of record, an additional appraisal of the same engineers under the date of May 15, 1919. It showed an un - depreciated appraisal of property then in existence in amount $110, - 490. Since that date additions and betterments shown by the books, amounted to $28,904. The resulting total of ?1393!)4 is fairly com - parable with the preceding estimated cost stated in this finding. The engineers for the city allowed overheads in their appraisal of the pro - perties, but these overheads were less than, on authority, this Commis - sion has steadily allowed in engineers appraisals of property. No over - heads were charged on the additions and betterments since 1909 in amount $61,500. The failure to add such overheads in the book ac - counts, is not an indication that no such expenses were incurred. It simply means that they were paid for and charged to current operating expenses. To the degree this was done, the profit and loss available for dividends, was reduced. For the purpose of measuring the fair cost of the property in a securities issue case, we will add $13,000 for overheads. This will conform to the general practice of the Commis - sion in engineering appraisals of property on an estimated cost basis. When the bonds are sold, there will be available for additions and betterments, which it is the purpose of the company to place in the near future, $10,500. Between this date and the end of the franchise period, it will be necessary for the company to set aside annually, for the amortization of the bond discount, which charge will amount to approximately $1,200 by the end of the franchise period. This money would either be in cash or be invested in property. Under such computations, which are reasonable or unreasonable according as one may view the original starting figure, namely the 1909 appraisal, we find a fair undepreciated estimated cost of the existing plant of the York Water Company to be §-163,000. This is approxi - mately the proposed total of stocks and bonds. Ordinarily, in treating an application for a stock dividend, this Commission makes a reduction for unrealized depreciation. We have </seg>
            <seg id="p326">326 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT already pointed out, however, that the earnings of the company, had dividends on the fair value of the property been paid, would not have provided an offset for depreciation which might be subtracted from the cost of the property, to represent deterioration. Under such circum - stances, the Commission has been in the past, and now is, reluctant to reduce the value to represent deterioration where excess dividends have not been the cause of failure to provide such offset. In 1912 applicant company secured a twenty-year franchise from the city of York under which inter alia it was agreed by applicant tha it would sell the property at any of certain dates for $50,000 plus the additions and betterments made between the date of the franchise and the date of purchase, less a stated depreciation of the property exist ing on date of franchise. This is a binding contract and if exercise* by the city, is the value of the property as such value will be realize* by the stockholder and bondholder. The last opportunity of the city to purchase under this contract, expires in 1932. It is clear that even after the additions and betterments to be taken care of from the sale of the proposed bonds, have been made, the contract sale price of the property will fall considerably below the proposed total issue of stocks and bonds. We have frequently said that we deemed the stock and bonds act of Nebraska statutes imposed upon the Commission a certain respon - sibility to the purchaser of securities approved by us. If the proposed additional stock is issued without restraint, it might readily find its way into the hands of purchasers who would know nothing about this contractual limitation of value of the property. And if the city's op - tion is exercised by it, such purchasers would find themselves, junior security holders, with less than the full value of their stock. The statutory duty is imposed upon the Commission to find, prece - dent to its approval of securities issues, that such issues are reasonably necessary for corporate purposes, and such corporate purposes are set out as "acquisition of property, the construction, completion, exten - sion or improvement of facilities or for the improvement or maintenance of its service, or for the discharge of lawful refunding of its obliga - tions." In the light of our conclusions as to the fair estimated cost of the properties of applicant, based upon prices of 1909 to 1925 inclu - sive, as they would have been experienced had the property been built during that period; our view as to the proper treatment of depreciation under the circumstances; the inability of the company, as shown by the record, in the light of the history of its earnings on stock to finance needed improvements by the sale of stock; and the existing contract between the city and applicant to purchase and sell at the option of the city, the Commission is of the opinion and so finds that it should ap - prove the proposed issue of stock, subject to certain restrictions. The </seg>

The agreement shall provide that the escrowed stock may be sold only as between existing stockholders, and such sale shall not release any of such stock from the hands of the trustee. The agree - ment must further provide that the escrowed stock may not be used as collateral. This agreement must be submitted to the Commission, and its approval be secured, before the stock is issued. It is proposed that the bonds shall be due and payable twenty years from the date of issue, or 1946. It has been the policy of the Commission, and the general requirements of banking houses, that issues of bonds shall not have a due date beyond the termination of franchise. There is no indication that the franchise will not be re - newed. A condition of the approval of the proposed bond issue will be that the trust agreement shall state, and the bonds shall carry a statement on their face, that the due date shall be May 1, 1932, if the city exercises its purchase option or refuses to extend the franchise, but if the franchise is extended to a date beyond 1946, the due date of the bonds shall be May 1, 1946. This requirement is not to be un - derstood as interfering with any conditions regarding call privileges which may be placed in the trust agreement. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that the York Water company be and it hereby is author - ized: First: To issue and sell $65,000 in par amount of first mortgage six per cent bonds, provided: (a) The bonds shall be sold for cash to net applicant not less than 95 per centum of par.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6170 In the Matter of the Application of the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway Company for authority to cancel Item 3396, U. P. tariff 3050-E (three-cent rate on corn Doniphan to Schimmer, etc.) and substitute rate of six cents therefor. </seg>
            <seg id="p329">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 329 OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This proceeding came on for hearing before the Commission on an application of the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway company asking authority to substitute a rate of six cents per one hundred pounds on carload shipments of corn from Doniphan to Schimmer and Grand Island in lieu of the present rate of three cents per one hun - dred pounds. S. E. Stohr, general freight agent of the Grand Island, appeared for the applicant and E. P. Ryan, traffic manager of the Chamber of Commerce of Grand Island appeared for interested ship - pers. The application was amended to read four and one half cents per 100 pounds instead of six cents per 100 pounds as asked for by the applicant in the original application. In support of the application Mr. Stohr offered a large number of rate comparisons between local points on the Union Pacific and showed that in no instance was the rate less than four and one-half cents per 100 pounds and that in many instances the rate for the distance from Doniphan to Grand Island, a distance of twelve miles, the rate was from one cent to two and one-half cents per 100 pounds higher. Mr. Stohr was unable to give a complete history of the three-cent rate now in effect. The records of the Commission show that for some unknown reason the advances in rates that were made effective during federal control, were not applied to the item which carries the rates on carload shipments of corn from Doniphan to Schimmer and Grand Island. Grain dealers located at Doniphan showed that the major portion ol their shipments of corn went to Grand Island. The shipments by years are shown to be as follows as per Exhibit No. 2 introduced in testimony by the applicant. Mr. Ryan sought to justify the three-cent rate Doniphan to Grand Is - land by comparing it with the two-cent rate that is in effect on car - load shipments of corn between South Omaha, and Gilmore, on the Union Pacific. He also showed that at other points on the Union 921 9 cars 922 7 cars 923 19 cars 924 20 cars 925 20 cars </seg>
            <seg id="p330">330 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT tained on carload shipments of corn. Mr. Ryan was unable to Bay whether or not the cars handled at the cheaper rate, were handled in switch service. The cars of corn shipped from Doniphan to Grand Island moved in road service. Prior to the filling of the application in this case grain dealers at Phillips had complained that by reason of the fact that Doniphan had a three-cent rate against a rate from Phillips to Grand Island of six cents, corn naturally tributary to Phillips was going to Doniphan. Grain dealers from other stations close to Doniphan had complained to the Commission that the three-cent rate from Doniphan was having the effect of drawing corn to Doniphan that would naturally come to their station. We can find no good reason from this record, why the rate should be cheaper on carload shipments of corn from Doniphan to Grand Island than is charged for similar movements between local stations on other parts of the Union Pacific railroad in this state. The rate com - parison that is made in the record, as between Doniphan and Grand Island, and Omaha-South Omaha and Gilmore, is not similar. In and around Omaha there is a large number of feeding lots located on dif - ferent railroads. The traffc handled is highly competitive and is usual - ly handled in switch service. From the record we are of the opinion and so find that the application has been justified and the same will be authorized. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway company be, and the same is, hereby authorized and directed to amend its tariff, not later than thirty days from date of this order, so as to provide a rate of four and one-half cents per one hundred pounds on carload shipments of corn, usual minimum weight, from Doniphan to Schimmer and Grand Island.

The year 1925 saw a very considerable refinancing program by this company, the result of which was the final elimination of some rather expensive war-time financing.

            <seg id="p332">332 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT applicant had outstanding $42,150,000 of common stock and $29,500, - 000 of bonds bearing interest at seven percent per annum. As of February 1, 1925, the company called the bonds for payment. At the time of the call there were outstanding $27,623,300 of this debt. It was necessary for the company to pay a premium of 71% on the called bonds, and to write out against its surplus account the debt discounted in process of amortization. The refinancing, therefore, called for approximately $31,000,000. To secure the funds it borrow - ed from system corporations $28,100,000 and increased its payables account by $3,000,000. The debt was thus transferred from the hands of the general public to the parent corporation. In March, 1925, applicant sold $22,850,000 of common stock and reduced its payables by $987,000. At the end of that month, it was indebted to the parent corporation in amount $6,200,000. The amount due the parent company was reduced during the year 1925 to $4,750,000 chiefly through surpluses earned. Mean - while, the total fixed property and long-time investments had increased about $900,000 although the total assets decreased $447,000. This latter result was brought about through the writing out of certain suspense accounts due to the payment of the long-term debt. kin previous orders we have found that the original indebtedness of 0,000,000 was incurred for proper corporate purposes.

Curtiss, Secretary (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6199 In the Matter of the Application of the Beaver Valley Telephone Com - pany of Danbury, for Authority to Remove Telephone Exchange from Marion to Danbury. FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: The Beaver Valley Telephone company operates three exchanges at Lebanon, Danbury and Marion, all in Red Willow County, Ne - braska. This system serves 365 subscribers, 46 of whom are served from Marion, 184 from Danbury and 135 from Lebanon. The com - pany represents that the Marion exchange is too small for profitable operation, and asks authority to abandon the switchboard at that point and connect the lines with the switchboard at Danbury. Following the filing of the application, citizens of Marion protested the proposed action and the matter was set down for hearing at McCook on July 16. At that time protestants, through counsel, filed a motion asking for dismissal of the application, on the ground that the Commission has no jurisdiction, for the reason that written consent of at least 60 per cent of the subscribers or patrons of the Marion exchange, has not been secured in accordance with chapter 144, session laws of Nebraska, 1922. In our opinion, this objection is without force for two reasons. First, the law is applicable only to companies operating ten or more exchanges. While the language with reference to the number of ex - changes is somewhat ambiguous, this would appear to be a responsible construction. Second, the status applies only to exchanges in incorpor - ated villages or towns. Marion is not an incorporated village. The statute, therefore, would not appear to be applicable in this case. With its provisions inapplicable, the general powers of the Commission would be effective, and as to these there can be no question. Herpol - sheimer Co., v. Lincoln Traction Co., 96 Neb., 154. </seg>
            <seg id="p334">334 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Applicant submits a showing as to the results of operation of its exchange at Marion. Its operating revenues for 1925 totaled $847.10. Operating expenses for the same year amounted to $1,043.64. The exchange was thus operated at a direct out-of-pocket deficit of $206.54. It should be stated in this connection that the expenses as given, in - clude nothing for commercial and general expense, and nothing for taxes. These expenses were not criticized by objectors, but it is alleg - ed that the Marion exchange would make a better showing as to Kenue if certain of the farm lines now connected to Danbury were erted to Marion. It is asserted that certain farm subscribers living north of Marion, and now served by the Danbury exchange, are logical - ly in Marion territory and should be served from that point, and that there was an agreement at the time of the opening of the Marion ex - rage that this division of territory should be made. Whatever the erstanding may have been, it is clear that revenue transferred to Marion would be taken from Danbury, and while the operating show - ing at the latter place is much better than at Marion, the exchange is not so prosperous as to permit a shrinkage of $'450 a year in its rev- Ee. The chief objection to such a transfer of subscribers is that it ild prevent the realization of economies in the operation of the system. Applicant estimates that if the Marion exchange can be aban - doned it can effect a net saving of at least $720 per year. This amount represents the salary paid to the Marion operator, the latter doing the operating, furnishing the central office building and providing light and fuel for this amount. Other small savings would result in main - tenance and general expense. It is estimated that it would cost $720 to remove the switchboard at Marion and make the necessary rearrange - ment in the lines. If the exchange is continued, an expenditure of at least $"200 for cable will be required. This would be an offset to that extent against the cost of abandonment, as would the salvage realized from the equipment removed at Marion. The company proposes, if it is permitted to abandon the exchange at Marion, to construct metallic lines between Marion and Danbury and with these render service to Marion subscribers. All service at the present time is grounded. At the present time, ten residence subscribers are connected to the Marion exchange and seven business subscribers. The latter will be reduced to six within a short time. It is proposed to give the bank and the Marion Equity exchange, the principal mercantile institutions in the town, individual lines. The other four business houses will be grouped with residence subscribers so that there will be not to exceed four or five on a line. Business competitors will not be placed on the same line. Of the 26 farm sub - scribers, 18 or 20 of the 26 will be carried to Danbury on two metallic lines. The remaining six or eight will be put on an existing farm line </seg>
            <seg id="p335">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 335 out of Danbury, following a regrouping and there will not be to ex - ceed 10 or 11 on any of the farm lines proposed. Toll service from Marion will be furnished over these metallic lines direct to Danbury. At the present time such service is secured through a grounded trunk line connecting the Marion and Danbury exchanges. It is asserted by representatives of the company, that the change will materially improve long distance service. There are now two operators at Danbury and if the subscribers at Marion are con - nected to the Danbury exchange, these operators would have not to exceed 250 subscribers to handle from that board. The lineman of the company, who has had twenty-two years experience in the tele - phone business, testified that the service from Danbury will be quicker and better, largely for the reason that with only 46 subscribers at Marion the operator is occupied such a small part of the time that she does not remain constantly at the switchboard, and calls are very fre quently delayed as a result. Actual transmission will be quicker be - cause of the metallic lines. There will be no change in the zone of service so far as Marion subscribers are concerned. They will continue to have access to Danbury and Lebanon as at present. Protestants object to removal of the Marion exchange because they 'think it will injure the town as a business center and one or two of the business men objected because they are to be grouped with other subscribers, and would thus be deprived of secret service. Fear was also expressed that the service through Danbury would not be as good as is now secured through the Marion switchboard. Reasons for this assumption were not very clear, except that they were based on an experience several years ago over grounded lines. It is admitted that the matter of abandoning the Marion exchange has been before the stockholders for several years, and that the latter voted at the last annual meeting, to place the matter in the hands of the Board of Directors with power to act. It was not clear from the testimony of two of the three directors who were present at the hearing, that the necessary action of that body had been taken to authorize the application to the Commission for authority to abandon the exchange. Following the hearing, there - fore, the Commission indicated that it would be necessary for the Board of Directors, or a majority thereof, to confirm the application as pre - sented to the Commission. Such action has been taken by two of the three members of the board of directors and the president and secre - tary of the company, an affidavit covering such action having been submitted to the Commission. </seg>
            <seg id="p336">336 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Upon consideration of all the facts and circumstances, the Com - mission is of the opinion that the application is reasonable and should be approved. The company ' is operating at low rates, compared to other companies in the state. It has paid no dividends for four yean, and has been compelled to use most of its net income to maintain the property, particularly since many of the lines were destroyed by a sleet storm a few years ago. The saving which it proposes, by the abandonment of the Marion exchange, is justified only if a reasonable service can be furnished to the people of Marion. The record indicates that as good, if not better service will be provided. The substitution of metallic lines for grounded should result in less interference, and more constant attention to the switchboard at Danbury will have the effect of more prompt response to calls. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that the Beaver Valley Telephone company be and the same hereby is authorized to abandon its switchboard at Marion and to connect the subscribers now served by such switchboard with its switchboard at Danbury, such subscribers to be served from Danbury over metallic lines and in accordance with the plan outlined in the Blication and the record herein.

C. 393-396), and Application 5013 under date of January 13, 1923 (16 N. S. R. C. 302-303), this Commission approved an indebtedness maximum of $42,000 and stock in total amount $70, - 000. There is thus available under existing authorization $6700 of stock. The full amount of the indebtedness was never issued. All debts consist of notes payable. Under its articles applicant, a Nebraska corporation, is entitled to issue a maximum of $100,000 or stock which is all of one grade, common, with a par value per share of $100. Application is now filed for authority to issue and sell a sufficient amount of the common stock, at par, so that the full authorized capital stock will be outstanding and with the proceeds of the issue to retire indebtedness in equal amount. It is proposed to sell the stock without commission or selling cost. The directors of applicant company are not sure that they can sell the full amount, but as nearly as is possible, it is desired to retire all existing indebtedness. Inasmuch as the purposes for which the indebtedness was created have been heretofore passed on by us, and inasmuch as it is desired merely to retire this indebtedness dollar for dollar, through the issue and sale of stock, no investigation requiring a further check of the books is essential at this time. We find that the purposes for which it is desired to sell the stock are proper corporate purposes under Ne - braska statutes. i This corporation falls within that provision of the constitution in section five of article ten requiring notice of intent to increase capital stock. The authorization here given presupposes that the provision of the constitution will be carried out.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6228 In the Matter of the Application of Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincj Railroad Company for authority to amend its G. F. O. 26-F, re - lating to switching charges between Omaha and South Omaha. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman In order to meet a competitive switching situation between Omaha and South Omaha, applicant railway has asked for authority to pub - lish on short notice, on account of an emergency existing, a rate of $6.30 per car for carload switching between Omaha and South Omaha. LAs to this particular switching the present tariff provision carried Item 1580 of C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. G. F. O. 26-F, reads: "All carload freight, except grain, minimum weight 40,000 pounds, two cents per hundred pounds."

            <seg id="p340">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 340 The proposed rate amounts to a reduction in charges between the two points named. It has been filed interstate to be effective April 16, 1926.

Kennedy, attorney; Roy Page, assistant general manager. For the Commission, B. E. Forbes, chief engineer. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman: In March the Nebraska Power company, a Maine corporation, with its physical properties within the state of Nebraska, made appli- </seg>
            <seg id="p341">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 341 cation for authority to issue $800,000 in par amount of first mortgage five percent Series A, thirty-year gold bonds, dated June 2, 1919, due and payable June 2, 1949, and 5,000 shares of preferred stock, from the sale of the bonds to construct certain physical properties, and from the sale of the stock to restore to the treasury what it tempor - arily borrowed for construction purposes. The company requested postponement of the application pending certain adjustments of the underlying mortgage. Recently it filed an amended application under the same caption, asking the approval of this Commission to an issuance of $1,000,000 par amount of the above Series A bonds and 10,000 shares of preferred stock. The amended application also asks for approval of an option to the company to sub - stitute some other series of bonds in like amount for Series A bonds, such other series to bear interest at not to exceed five percent; also option to issue either six percent or seven percent preferred stock, the option depending on which class of stock can be most advantage - ously sold. The company has outstanding at this time, no-par common stock carried on the books, $5,000,000, preferred stock in par amount $5, - 700,000, first mortgage five percent bonds in amount $8,600,000, first mortgage six percent bonds in amount $1,950,000 and six percent de - bentures in amount $3,500,000, or a total capital obligation $24,750, - 000. Most of this was issued before the Nebraska law empowered and directed the Commission to scrutinize the issues of a foreign corpora - tion doing business within the state. Making allowance for an overlap shown in the company's Exhibit 1 in amount equal to the expenditures for additions and betterments during the first seven months of 1926, the books show that between July, 1923, when the present law became effective, and January 1st, 1926, the company has added net to its Nebraska properties $3,884, - 000. It has loaned to the Citizens Gas and Electric company of Coun - cil Bluffs, which it controls, $942,375 for the retirement of bond obli - gations and the construction of property. The 1926 budget for Omaha and Council Bluffs was $1,605,747. Of this budget for the two cities, between $300,000 and $400,000 has been spent for improvements, and paid. The company has, therefore, during the three-year period, con - structed properties at a cost of more than $5,000,000, and has a con - struction program in progress and not yet paid for in Omaha and Coun - cil Bluffs, amounting to approximately $1,250,000. This Commission, during the same period, has approved securities in amount $4,200,000. The company's mortgage permits it to issue and sell bonds up to 80% of the cost of property. The million dollars asked for in this application is well below that percentage on property not yet subjected to mortgage bonds. </seg>
            <seg id="p342">342 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The building program now in progress calls for, as stated above, something more than a million dollars yet to be spent during the year Ei, or to be well under way during that year as per the budget isions. It is necessary for the company to secure the funds with h to construct this property. The issue and sale of bonds, with h to secure funds for the construction of property, up to a reason - able percentage of the total cost of the property, is a legitimate cor - porate purpose. The percentage represented in the present application is reasonable. The issue of the bonds prayed for will be approved, subject to the usual restrictive provisions. Under date of July 31, 1926, the company's balance sheets show - ed a surplus of $1,354,273. It is desired to issue and sell preferred stock against such of this surplus as is invested in property, up to $1, 000, 000, in order to make more liquid such surplus and to restore to the proper accounts the money so borrowed, that it may be used for legitimate corporate purposes. Among these corporate purposes are, of course, the retirement of obligations now current or funded, the construction of additional properties in 1927 or later, or the payment of dividends to the extent that surplus has been earned. The application was made at this time because of the very favor - able market. It has been pointed out above that the company is making rather rapid extensions of its plant to meet the necessities of growth, and while the 1927 budget has not yet been prepared, it seems reasonable to assume that a large outlay of capital will be neces - sary in that year and the funds secured from the sale of the stock will be available for that purpose if the board of directors so elect. No reliable data could be presented to the Commission by appli - cant with reference to the probable net sale price of either seven per - cent or six percent preferred stock. No six percent preferred stock has, up to this time, been offered to the public. Under the Stocks and Bonds Act, the Commission is concerned, in its scrutiny, with the per - centage of the par amount of sales of capital stock made available for construction of property, and concerned also that the selling cost shall not, for any reason, be excessive. It is the practice of the com - pany to carry the selling cost of stock in a ledger account, which will indicate at any time the cost of securing money through capital is - sues. It seems unnecessary in the light of the past management of the company and the present situation, to indicate a minimum net price for the stock. In lieu therefor the Commission will require that in the filing of reports containing balance sheets, applicant shall furnish in its assets statement separately from other accounts, the ledger account covering the sale price of the preferred stock here approved. Such sale price shall be deemed to be the difference between the par value and the net amount received by applicant. </seg>
            <seg id="p343">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 343 It appears to be a proper corporate purpose, within the purview of Nebraska statutes, to sell capital stock on a favorable market, be - fore the actual purposes to which the proceeds are to be put have been determined by the board of directors. We will approve the issue and sale of the stock indicated in the application, subject to certain conditions. Since the stock authorization under Application No. 5430 (17 N. S. R. C. 364-370), the company has changed its common stock from par to no-par, and increased number of shares and reduced the value of each share, without increasing the total ledger value of such stock. Careful analysis of all court decisions available on the subject in - dicates that this action is not construed to be a stock issue. Hood Rubber Co. v. Commonwealth, 131 N. W. 201, Re Fryeburg Water Co., 106 Atlantic 225, People v. Liberty Light &amp; Power Co., 201 N. Y. Supp., 302, Whitman v. Consolidated Gas, Electric Light &amp; Power Co., 129 Atlantic 22. Section 5, article 10 of the constitution of Nebraska provides that issues of additional stock shall be preceded by public notice for sixty days. Whether this provision applies to a foreign corporation was dis - cussed in our order and findings on Application No. 5430, supra, and need not be repeated. The conclusions there reached apply here. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that the Nebraska Power company be and it hereby is authorized to issue and sell under its mortgage and trust deed dated June 2, 1919, due and payable June 2, 1949, at its option.

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the difference between the par value of the bonds mentioned above, and the net price received by applicant, shall be carried in the books of the company under proper suspense account, and such difference shall be ratably amortized through the life of the bonds.

OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: On July 8, 1925, the Northwestern Bell Telephone company (here - after referred to as the Bell company) sold certain of its property at </seg>
            <seg id="p346">346 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Doniphan, to the Hamilton County Farmers Telephone association (hereafter referred to as the Farmers association). The property transferred consisted of the poles and wires serving 15 subscribers in the town of Doniphan and 18 rural subscribers served from Doniphan. The Bell company reserved the telephone instruments. The farm lines were first sold to the farmers served and by them conveyed to the Farmers association. The Bell company operated a switchboard at Doniphan for a few Era, but about 1908 abandoned its central office and entered into arrangement with the Farmers association whereby its lines were nected to the switchboard of that company. In addition to per - ming switching service for the Bell company, the Farmers associa - tion looked after the maintenance of the local lines and made collec - ri on billing furnished from the Bell's Grand Island offices. From date of this arrangement there was an interchange of service be - tween the subscribers of the two companies at Doniphan. The Bell Iipany continued to charge the exchange rates originally in effect, ept as they were modified from time to time by system rate ad - tments. These rates covered an interchange of service with the Bell lpany's larger exchange at Grand Island, but this service was limit - only to Bell subscribers and was not automatically extended to the ■men association subscribers when joint switching arrangements re entered into. The latter subscribers, however, had the right, &gt;n the payment of 55 cents per month in addition to the regular •mers association rates, to call Bell subscribers on the Grand Island hange. This was a one-way service and Grand Island patrons could call back being limited in that respect to the small group of sub - ibers of the Bell company at Doniphan. When the two companies completed negotiations for the convey - ance of the Bell company's property at Doniphan in July, 1925, it was not thought that the sale came within the purview of Section 3, Article X of the constitution of Nebraska, the pertinent portion of which rends as follows: "No public utility corporation shall consolidate its *♦♦* prop - erty **•• in whole or in part with any other public utility cor - poration or common carrier owning a parallel or competing prop - erty without permission of the Railway Commission." Upon suggestion from this Commission, however, application was later made, praying for approval of the purchase and sale. This is Application No. 6234. Shortly prior to the filing of that application the Bell company applied for authority to cancel its schedule of rates for exchange service at Doniphan and to modify its Grand Island schedule to meet the new conditions at Doniphan.

            <seg id="p347">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 347 6172) For convenience these two applications will be considered to - gether, the question raised in No. 6234 being taken up first. It seems clear that the only point to determine with reference to the jurisdiction of the Commission under the constitutional pro - vision quoted above is as to whether the two properties are, or were, "parallel or competing". The Commission has held (Application No. 6301) that even when actual competition is non-existant or quiescent circumstances and con - ditions may strongly indicate potential competition and in such cases the constitutional prohibition applies. Originally, the two companies at Doniphan undoubtedly engaged in a competitive struggle for con - trol of that field. The Bell company installed the first system, but within a short time the Farmers association began the construction of lines and installed a switchboard. Both actively canvassed for sub - scribers. Those were the pioneer days of the telephone and it was not as well understood then, as it is now that communities as small as Doni - phan have patronage barely sufficient for one exchange. Of course the town may have been regarded by both companies as an outpost an the competitive frontier and as such worth contending for even at a sacrifice. The record does not disclose the reason for the arrangement in 1908, whereby the Bell company abandoned its switchboard and car - ried its lines to the board of its rival. Perhaps by that early date the futility of further costly warfare had become apparent. At any rate, it does not appear that there was any competition for new business there - after. Indeed, the arrangement precluded competition. The Bell com - pany, so far as operation of its plant and management of its business was concerned, retired from the field in favor of the Farmers associa - tion. It continued to own a small amount of plant, but had surrendered the supervision, operation and maintenance of it to the former rival. Nor was there any competition as to rates. The Bell company's schedule was continuously higher than that of the Farmers association. This was true even after the tatter's subscribers paid the additional 55 cents per month for connection with Grand Island. The only advantage possessed by Bell subscribers lay in the fact that they had a two-way service with Grand Island whereas the 55-cent differential provided only for outbound service from Doniphan. Apparently this afforded the only inducement for the retention of the Bell company's service. This situation persisted for seventeen or eighteen years without substantial change. Had actual competition existed there would have been a shifting of subscribers from one to the other, but this does not appear to- have taken place. It seems quite clear, therefore, that con - solidation of these plants in everything except ownership of a portion of the property took place in 1908 and that competition ceased at that </seg>
            <seg id="p348">348 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Nor does it appear that potential competition continued. It might be urged that the Bell company was left in a position to re-enter the field at any time it so desired. That is answered by the obvious fact that to do so it would be compelled to restore the portion of the plant it had abandoned. Surely it was in no position to compete without a switch - board. It could as readily install a switchboard in any other neighboring town as in Doniphan. Potential competition involves a reasonable pro - bability of realizing a profit or desired advantage through soliciting the business of a rival, together with the possession of existing physical agencies by which such results can be made a reality. The mere fact that a competitor has at one time occupied a field and that it still re - tains a fragment of its property in that field lacks much of convincing that it is now prepared to compete even if it so desires. The consti - tutional prohibition deals with the present tense. The properties in - volved must be actually or potentially competitive at the time of con- There is no suggestion by the parties or by the facts that the pro - perties are parallel. Consequently, we can dismiss that phase of the provision as inapplicable. We are led to the conclusion, therefore, that these properties were not "parallel or competing" at the time of the sale and that the Com - mission is without jurisdiction of the transaction for that reason. With respect to the second application (No. 6172) counsel for the Bell company contends that if we find we are without jurisdiction to interfere with the sale of its property at Doniphan, we must, perforce, authorize the cancellation of its schedule of rates for Doniphan service and the withdrawal of Doniphan from the list of exchanges covered by the Grand Island rates. With this contention we cannot agree. Counsel argues that the transfer of its property at Doniphan to the Farmers association leaves it without facilities for furnishing any service whatsoever at that point and that continued publication of rates (superfluous and misleading. By the same token it is contended that, th its Doniphan property now in the hands of another company, it precluded from offering connection with that exchange to Grand and subscribers and that its schedule for such service is automatically tended. Counsel concedes that the matter of rates and service are thin the jurisdiction of this Commission but that they are not brought » review by a mere change in the physical plant and that they can only be considered upon a proceeding brought for the purpose either by this Commission on its own motion or upon complaint. "If a man has been offering oranges at 50c a dozen," says counsel in brief,- "but has sold all his oranges and no longer has any for sale at any price, he has not changed the price of oranges." So far as this </seg>
            <seg id="p349">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 349 illustration applies to the Doniphan exchange it is apt and convincing. Applied to the Grand Island situation, however, it becomes an argument against the company's contention. In the latter case the man continues to sell oranges but offers eleven instead of twelve for 50 cents. He has effectually changed the price of oranges. The rate schedule for Grand Island service now filed with the Com - mission provides that "the rates hereunder entitle the subscriber to service without other charge to all stations connected with the Grand Island, Alda, Cairo, St. Libory and Doniphan exchanges". The present application is to drop Doniphan from this provision of the schedule. It is an application to change the rate schedule. While it does not propose to change the quantity of the rate it would change the quan - tity of the service. The fact that only thirty-three subscribers would be eliminated does not alter the principle. Indeed, if there were 1000 subscribers on the Doniphan exchange who were thus withdrawn from the Grand Island connection the effect on the reasonableness of the Grand Island rate would be so manifest as to make argument unnecessary. Nor should we overlook the fact that the sale of the Doniphan property is the voluntary act of the company, affecting its relations with all its subscribers in that zone. The normal fluctuations in the number of subscribers on any exchange, due to growth or other cause, are anti - cipated when the rates for that exchange are made, but the elimination of a group of subscribers through voluntary action of the company and its effect on the remaining patrons is a proper subject for special con - sideration at the time of the transaction. We conclude, therefore, that the change in the service status at Grand Island and Doniphan, brought about by the transfer of Bell property at Doniphan and thu&amp; rendering necessary an application for appropriate amendment of the rate schedules, make this proceeding a rate matter, to whatever ex - tent is essential in determining the equities. While the question of degree of effect is not an element in deten mining jurisdiction, it may be important in deciding the merits. Thirty* tkree subscribers out of a total of over 3,000 in the Grand Island zone will, if the application be granted, be eliminated from the zone. They will continue to have, if they so desire it, the privilege of one-way ser - vice with Grand Island by paying the 55-cent differential at Doniphan. Likewise, Grand Island subscribers will continue to enjoy this incoming service. Present Bell subscribers at Doniphan, particularly certaii business men, and the farm subscribers between Doniphan and Grand Island, vigorously object to the proposed discontinuance of the flat rate connection between the two exchanges. Their protest is based on the fact that much of the intermediate territory, while largely served by Bell farm line, is tributary in a business way to Doniphan and that </seg>
            <seg id="p350">350 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT the imposition of a toll charge, even as small as ten cents, will deter farmers from calling business firms in the smaller town. This situa - tion, while not different from that in hundreds of localities in Nebraska, is aggravated by the fact that the few subscribers concerned have grown accustomed to the service and now feel it is a vested right. The farm- Ein the intermediate territory will be under a handicap, particularly heir communication with each other. It would seem that they might tinue to have access to the two-exchange zone. Such service could limited to the Bell lines extending into the Doniphan territory, and lid thus meet the community-of-interest requirements. It would jely overcome the objections of Doniphan business men, who would s have two-way service with their farm customers. The arrangement would open up the entire Doniphan exchange to such subscribers, but as their number would be few this would not be a serious objection. We are of the opinion, therefore, that this condition should attach to our approval of the amendment of the rate filing. It is realized that the elimination of Doniphan from the Grand Island service zone decreases to a small degree the value of the service to the subscribers in that zone. However, with an unlimited incoming service from Doniphan patrons who pay 5 5 -cents differential, the loss is negligible. At the maximum it covers service to only thirty-three subscribers and many of these will doubtless avail themselves of the 55-cent rate. The consolidation of the properties at Doniphan results in advan - tages to the public (1) in lower rates to the former Bell company's subscribers, (2) in an extension of their service so as to include free connection with all the exchanges of the Farmers Association's system, and (S) in a more economical and uniform maintenance of the property at Doniphan. These advantages outweigh the slight loss of service which the transfer will impose on Grand Island subscribers. We are of the opinion, therefore, and so find that the application to cancel the exchange rates for Doniphan service should be approved and that the application to amend the Grand Island schedule by elimin - ating Doniphan therefrom should be also approved subject to the con - dition heretofore discussed. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that Application No. 6234 be, and the same hereby is, dismissed for lack of jurisdiction.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6236. In the Matter of the Application of the Chicago &amp; North Western Rail - way Company for Authority to make certain adjustments in Live Stock Rates. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman: The matter here under consideration arises by reason of the state - wide readjustment of live stock rates to intrastate markets as a result iour order on Resolution No. 74 made in conjunction with the con - jsions of the interstate commerce commission on docket 13273. The suit of these two orders taken in connection with the order of the terstate commerce commission on South Dakota live stock rates was rate break on the Winner branch of the North Western at the South ikota state line, amounting to 41c on cattle and 51c on hogs le rate break at the same point to Sioux City destination was almost sharp. It was recognized at the time the orders relating to Nebraska live stock were issued, that certain adjustments at state lines would subse - quently be necessary. Shippers just across the state line in South Dakota complained over the wide spread between adjacent towns and </seg>
            <seg id="p353">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 353 authorities suggested reduction in South Dakota rates to the interstate markets from four to five towns across the state line so that the rates would grade into the Nebraska scale. The railway company suggested increases from six Nebraska stations on the Winner branch to both Omaha and Sioux City with no reductions in South Dakota. Informal conferences were held between the railway company, a representative of this Commission and a representative of the inter - state commerce commission at which it was suggested by the Nebraska representative that rates be increased at two Nebraska stations and de - creased from two South Dakota stations so that the rates would grade together without so sharp a break. This compromise was finally agreed to as it was stated by the representative of the interstate commerce commission that that body would not look with favor on merely reduc - tions from the South Dakota stations. The compromise was intended to preserve approximately the present revenues. Application has now been made to the Nebraska Commission for authority to increase slightly the rates on cattle, hogs double deck, and sheep double deck, from Spencer, Nebraska, to Omaha, to 28c per hun - dred, from Anoka, Nebraska, to Omaha, to 29c. Likewise the appli - cation asks for an increase on rates on hogs single deck from Spencer to Omaha, to 32|c and from Anoka to 33c. The Nebraska Commission has no jurisdiction on the rates except to the Omaha markets. In order that the agreement may be carried out, it will be necessary for the applicant railway to file changes in the interstate rates from Nebraska to Sioux City market and from the South Dakota stations of Fairfax and Bonesteel to both Sioux City and Omaha. It will also be necessary for the interstate commerce commission to approve these filings before the disturbing situation is removed. To illustrate the present situation, the rates on cattle and hogs to South Omaha and to Sioux City from two stations in Nebraska, and two in South Dakota as they exist at present and as compromise under - standing would have them exist, are as follows: CATTLE HOGS. rom Present Proposed Present Pro] -posed I j I M 27% 28 27% 29 32 30 31% 31% 32% 82 31 37 36 </seg>

The application for the different sized cans reads as follows: Over five gallons in the same tub or barrel 21 pounds per gal - lon."

These weights were dis - tributed over the state. The following shows the average weight at representative Nebraska towns. Point of No. of Total Average Gross Shipment Tubs. Weight Weight per Tub.

An exhibit was introduced in the record that shows that the aver - age weight per five-gallon tub was 152 pounds on a total number of 1697 tubs that were weighed in June, 1923, March and July, 1925, and May, 1926, at Omaha and Lincoln. The average for 521 tubs that were weighed at Lincoln during the same period was shown to be 157.8 pounds per five-gallon tub. The applicant showed that there were 401 five-gallon tubs of ice cream weighed at Omaha in July of 1926 that averaged 155 pounds per tub. It is shown in the record that of recent years there has been an increased amount of ice cream shipped by express in "jacketed con - tainers". The "jacketed containers" weigh some place between 48 pounds and 50 pounds per five-gallon can. Applicant states that they would much rather handle ice cream in "jacketed containers" than in tubs, even at the higher minimum that is asked for in this application, on account of shipments being very much more easier to handle and less liable to damage other freight. A number of protestants attended the hearing and were largely represented by the testimony given by Mr. Bergen of the Omaha Cham - ber of Commerce and Mr. Gilbertson of the Lincoln Chamber of Com - merce. Very little testimony was offered against the allowing of the ap - plication. The testimony given by protestants was largely related to the question of an increased charge for the transportation of ice cream by increase in minimum weights, and that this increased charge might have the effect of forcing more of the shipments to move by auto truck than is now handled in that manner. </seg>
            <seg id="p358">358 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT CONCLUSIONS From the record in this case we are unable to find any reason why the Tnininnnin weights on shipments of ice cream in tubs, should not be increased, and the amount of the increase asked for by the applicant appears reasonable.

The company proposes to amend its ar - ticles of incorporation, so as to reduce the dividend rate on preferred stock from eight per cent to seven per cent. It has sent an explana - tion of its proposal to preferred stockholders and representatives of the company have personally solicited such stockholders, and have se - cured consent from practically all. At the time of the last authorization of stock under our Applica - tion No. 4747, the company had expended a total of $378,000 in the construction of its property. The plant is now complete and has been operating since 1923. In support of the application, a statement is submitted showing that the total expenditures for construction aggre - gate $424,420. The expenditures made since the last order consist principally of two items, one of $33,387 for overflow damages, and the other of $16,000 for excavation below the dam. The Commission's accountant has made a check of the bills pay - able and reports that they represent actual expenditures for construc - tion purposes. An item of $8,000 covering the cost of a farm purchas - ed in connection with construction, is not included in the payables, as it is the purpose of the company to sell this farm when opportunity offers. Included in the total expenditures is an item of $36,372 for interest during construction. This represents interest on money bor - rowed at banks and devoted to construction purposes, and dividends paid or credited to stockholders who advanced funds during the period of construction. According to the accountant's investigation, divi - dends or interest on capital are not included in this figure subsequent to the date of the plant was placed in operation. While the amount is rather liberal, it needs to be borne in mind that a considerable amount of the capital had to be secured during the period of money stringency, when interest rates were high. The total outstanding securities, if this application is granted, will amount to $400,000, $150,000 being in common stock, preferred stock and $150,000 in bonds. The effect of the refinancing will be to reduce the interest rate on the indebtedness, and the divi - dend rate on the preferred stock, with a substitution of six per cent bonds for $50,000 of eight per cent preferred stock. This will afford a larger net income to be applied to dividends on common stock. Hereto - fore the common stockholders have realized but 5 Yt, per cent on their in - vestment for the period since the plant has been in operation. On operat - ing statement for 1925 shows that the total gross earnings for the year aggregated $48,290. The total expenses were $25,570, but this in - cludes an item of $7,915 for interest. On the showing for this year, therefore, there would be available for interest and dividends $'30,635. Interest on the bonds and dividends on the preferred stock would thus appear to be well protected. </seg>
            <seg id="p360">360 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The retirement of the preferred stock and the issuance of $150, - 000 of six percent bonds, appears to be either necessary or reasonably proper for the purposes of the corporation.

FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: In its main aspects, this is a renewal of a request made by the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company in Appli - cation No. 5741. In substance, the present application proposes to eliminate trains Nos. 50 and 51, operating between Bloomfield and Wayne, and trains Nos. 40 and 41 operating between Crofton and Wakefield, and to change the schedule of train No. 32, providing for its departure from Wynot at 8:45 p. m. instead of 12 noon. Certain time changes are proposed at Wayne, Wakefield, Emerson and Coburn Junction, to fit in with the readjustments on the branches. The same reason for the proposed curtailment of service is given in support of this application, as was presented in behalf of the other, namely, that passenger and freight traffic continues to decrease, owing to the com - petition of the truck, bus and private automobile. At the hearing held in Wayne, a large number of citizens resid - ing in the towns served by the various branches, were present and entered protest. Since the proposals are so similar, as they relate to the Crofton and Bloomfield branches, protestants asked that the record made by them in the previous case be made a part of the record in this case, and it was so ordered. With respect to the proposed change on the Wynot branch, rather extended testimony was presented by protestants. Supporting its request for authority to curtail service, applicant submitted a traffic study covering passenger, freight, express, mail and baggage, for trains Nos. 50 and 51, and 40 and 41, this study being for the months of November, 1925, and January and February, 1926. This study shows that train No. 51 carried an average of 11.8 passengers daily during the month of November, 17 during January and 19 during February. Train No. 50 carried an average of 20 pas - sengers daily during the month of November, 23 during January and 25 during February. Train No. 40 handled an average of 11.7 pas - sengers daily during November, 18.5 during January and 15 during February. Train No. 41 handled a daily average of 10 during Novem - ber, 15.6 during January and 16 during February. This is a slight increase in the number of passengers carried over the number carried during the period June to October, 1924, inclusive, covered by the showing in the previous case. Without doubt, this is due to the fact that the three months covered in the present instance were winter </seg>
            <seg id="p362">362 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT months when passenger traffic is heavier than daring the summer. Protestants objected to the three-months period as not being represen - tative of a year's traffic, voicing particular protest over the omission of December. Applicant admits that the inclusion of December would have improved the showing, but justifies the omission on the ground that it is an abnormal month. It is significant, however, that pro - testants in the former case just as vigorously objected to the five months there selected. Passenger traffic fluctuates, of course, but as a general rule is heavier during the winter months when the weather is inclement and busses and automobiles cannot be operated. Taking into account this seasonal fluctuation, the three-months' record indi - cates that passenger traffic is declining. In its opinion in the previous case the Commission criticised ap - plicant for not submitting evidence as to revenue derived from express and freight, since the trains involved carried both. This criticism is met in the present case and full disclosure made as to revenue from all sources. A summary of revenues and expenses for the three months period is submitted, showing that train No. 40 for the full period, had gross revenue of $1,354.25 and out-of-pocket expenses amounting to $'2,227.95. Train No. 41 during the same period had a gross revenue of $3,375.12 and operating expenses of $2,227.95. Train No. 50 for the three months period earned a gross revenue of $1,668.63 and had an operating expense of $2,054.31. Train No. 51 earned $6,243.01 and had operating expense of $'2,054.31. These figures disclose that trains No. 40 and 50 have gross revenues less than their operating expenses, whereas trains Nos. 41 and 51 have earnings in excess of operating expenses. Consolidated earnings and expenses for trains 40 and 41, and 50 and 51 indicate that the revenues exceed the expenses. Protestants insist that this justifies the operation of the trains. Such a showing is by no means conclusive. As indi - cated, the period taken is favorable and probably not representative of an entire year's operation. Moreover, if the business carried by re trains can be handled by the other trains on the branches with - unreasonable impairment of the service to the public, the com - pany would be justified in their discontinuance. As stated in the previous opinion, applicant operates three trains each way on each of these branches. The elimination of the trains in question would leave mixed train service twice each way daily ex - cept Sunday. Protestants complain more particularly of the inter - ference with mail service, that would be caused by the proposed schedules. It is manifest that mail service would not be as frequent as at present, and it is not unlikely that arrival of trains at the towns on each of the branches, might be delayed somewhat by the added work to be performed, but applicant has shortened the running time of the consolidated trains and will so distribute the traffic as to reduce </seg>
            <seg id="p363">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 363 delay to the minimum. The total revenue from mail on trains Nos. 40 and 41 amounts to only $1400 per annum. The revenue from the same source on trains 50 and 51, amounts to only $1278 per annum. Obviously the earnings from this source are entirely inadequate, in and of themselves, to justify the operation of trains. Under the proposed schedule on the Crofton line, No. 45 would leave Wakefield at 11 a. m. and reach Crofton at 2:15, carrying pas - sengers, mail, express and freight. No. 44, the present way freight, will continue to leave Crofton at 1:30 p. m. and arrive at Wakefield at 5:30 p. m. No. 43, freight and passenger, will leave Wakefield at 5:45 p. m., arrive at Crofton at 7:55 p. m. No. 42, freight and pas - senger, will leave Crofton at 11:30 a. m. and arrive at Wakefield at 2:05 p. m. On the Bloomfield line, train No. 57 would be scheduled to leave Wayne at 11:10 a. m. and arrive at Bloomfield at 2:35 p. m. No. 56 would leave Bloomfield at 1:15 and arrive at Wayne at 5:10. No. 53 would leave Wayne at 6:15 p. m. and arrive at Bloomfield at 6:25 p. m. No. 52 would leave Bloomfield at 11 a. m. and arrive at Wayne at 1:20 p. m. All of these trains would carry passengers, freight, express and mail. The departure of these trains from Wake - field and Wayne is determined by the arrival of trains on the line Norfolk to Emerson and Sioux City, with which connections are made to outside points. It was suggested that the schedules might be changed so as to make the service more convenient for local travel, but applicant pointed out that this would involve the sacrifice of im - portant connections at the junction points. These schedules contem - plate no service on Sunday, which continues the present status. In the previous opinion in this case, the Commission said: "That there has been a substantial falling off in passenger revenue is obvious. That this falling off is due to the increased use of automobiles is equally manifest. It is not unlikely that if the traffic continues to fall off, applicant will be justified in cur - tailing its passenger service. Patrons of the railroad should realize that they cannot withdraw traffic from passenger trains through the use of automobiles, and expect a continuance of passenger train service." The Commission found that the abandonment of the trains as proposed was not justified "at least for the present". The question is now presented as to whether or not traffic conditions have reached a point where a curtailment of service is justified. The statistics al - ready referred to indicate a decline in passenger traffic. This is sup - ported by the records in the office of the Commission, showing gross revenues from passenger traffic from the principal stations on the branches involved in this case. The following table shows the gross revenue from state and interstate traffic, for 6 years: </seg>

            <seg id="p365">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 365 We have taken the year 1917 as being typical of the pre-war period, omitting 1918, 1919 and 1920 as being abnormal. The figures reflect a steady decline. The intrastate traffic for 1925 is a little less than 32 per cent less than in 1917, and the interstate traffic is slightly less than 50 per cent less than 1917. The intrastate traffic in 1925 is 11 per cent less than in 1924, and the interstate traffic is 10.57 per cent less than in 1924. An examination of the figures covering freight traffic show that there has been no increase in that business for the same years. In some instances there has been a decrease. Applicant submitted figures in this record to show that a large amount of live stock is now being transported into Sioux City by truck, indicating a loss of this business to the railroad. The transportation of live stock by truck has been increasing. All of the figures considered, therefore, point unmistakably to a downward trend in traffic on these branch lines. The public, despite the admittedly good service furnished by the carrier, has been turning more and more to the use of private automobiles, trucks and to a smaller extent, to busses. This tendency has not diminished since the issuance of our order over a year ago. It is estimated by applicant, that the annual saving through the curtailment of service proposed, would amount to $17,927 for the three branches. This covers the wages to crew and round house employes only. Other savings would be realized, but have not been taken into the calculation. If the figures relating to the Wynot branch are eliminated, this saving of course, would be less. Comparison of branch line service on other railroads in the state, is not available in this record. But the Commission takes cognizence of the fact that the records on file in its office disclose that with but two or three exceptions, branch line service elsewhere in the state and on other railroads, is limited to two trains each way. In most cases no service is furnished on Sunday. Patrons of the Bloomfield and Crofton branches have grown accustomed to three trains each way daily, and anticipate more inconvenience than will be actually realized. A cur - tailment of service would necessitate readjustments along each branch by the traveling public and business interests, but it would produce a situation no different than exists on branch lines in other sections of the state. It is significant that on the Wynot line there is now and has been for several years, only two trains daily. The people on this branch are adjusted to this service and indicate in this record that it is satisfactory. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the time has ar - rived when applicant is justified, because of the continued falling off in traffic, in attempting to economize by reducing the amount of service which it is rendering, at least during the summer and fall months when weather conditions are conducive to motor vehicle travel. The applica - tion, in so far as it applies to the Crofton and Bloomfield branches, will therefore, be approved, subject to the condition that applicant shall </seg>
            <seg id="p366">366 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT make showing by not later than November 1, 1926, as to revenues and Eenses of the remaining trains. The order will be made effective to ember 1, 1926, any extension or modification of the same to be de - dent upon the showing thus made. The success of this trial will depend to a considerable extent upon the regularity of the service maintained by the trains that will serve as the principal passenger, mail and express carriers. Protestants are fearful that the additional work put upon the consolidated trains will cause further delays and make their arrival uncertain. Applicant meets this with the assurance that the schedules will be maintained. As a part of the showing to be made, therefore, applicant will be required to submit at the end of the trial period a record of the performance of the trains. WYNOT BRANCH The situation with respect to the Wynot branch requires separate consideration. It is proposed by applicant to change the time of train No. 32, which now leaves Wynot at 1 :00 p. m., and schedule its depar - ture at 8:45 p. m. This means that the train starting from Coburn Junction at 5:30 will run to Wynot, arriving there at 8 p. m. and im - mediately return. Applicant justifies this change on two grounds. First, that it will result in a saving of about $1400 per year through the elimination of one employee at Wynot, and a shortening of the running time and the consequent reduction in wages to the crew. And second, that stock at the present time leaves Wynot at 5:30 in the morning and reaches Sioux City at 8 a. m., but is delivered to the stock yards too late in many cases, to be marketed the same day. Under the proposed schedule, live stock would be loaded in the evening at Wynot or other stations on the branch, and be delivered at Sioux City at 11:55 p. m., so as to be available for the opening of the market on the follow - ing morning. It is the contention of applicant that this would prove desirable to stock shippers. At the hearing, however, vigorous objec - tion was lodged against the change. Voluminous petitions were present - ed from towns along the line, signed by farmers and stock shippers, protesting against any change. Two live stock shippers testified that the Esent schedule is very satisfactory, in that it permits loading in the ly morning, delivery at Sioux City during the forenoon, sale of the stock on that day, and an opportunity for the shipper to return in the afternoon. It is pointed out that if the schedule is changed, it will be necessary for the caretaker to stay all night in Sioux City and that live stock will be longer on the way or in the pens before marketed, and shrinkage will be greater. Witnesses made no complaint about &lt;le~ layed arrival in Sioux City. It is pointed out also that the change would involve a layover in Coburn Junction of an hour and 15 min - utes for passengers desiring to go to Sioux City. At present passengers </seg>
            <seg id="p367">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 367 can leave points on the line, go to Sioux City, arriving at 8 a. m., and remain until 4:30 in the afternoon. Under the proposed plan this would be impossible and those desiring to transact business in Sioux City would have to remain over night. It is also contended that service from the branch to Omaha and intermediate points would be very ma - terially impaired. The saving to be realized by the proposed change is inconsiderable and the record hardly sustains the contention of appli - cant that the service would be more satisfactory to live stock shippers. We are of the opinion, therefore, that this portion of the application has not been justified and should be denied. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Chicago, St. Paul, Min - neapolis &amp; Omaha Railway company be, and the same hereby is author - ized, to change its train schedules on its Bloomfield and Crofton branches by the discontinuance of trains Nos. 50 and 51 and 40 and 41 and, with the exception of the change proposed on the Wynot branch, to make the other readjustments in its schedule as are shown on the tentative time-card filed with the application herein. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant shall, by not later than November 1, 1926, make full showing to this Commission of rev - enues from all sources accruing on its Bloomfield and Crofton branches, for the period June 1, 1926, to November 1, 1926, inclusive, together with expenses incurred in the operation of all trains on said branches for the same period. This order, in so far as it affects the discontinu - ance of trains Nos. 50, 51, 40 and 41, shall remain in effect until De - cember 1, 1926.

It de - velops that the figures for October were not available and could not be compiled until November 15. Since it is desired that the showing thus made be submitted to the patrons of the branches before any further Ktion is taken by the Commission, it appears advisable to extend the ective date of the original order from Decmber 1, to January 1, 1927.

Counsel for some of the other towns has expressed the opinion informally that another hearing will probably not be desir - ed, although he has not received definite instructions and desires further time. As the effective date of the last order expires January 1, 1927, it is necessary to make some disposition of the matter at this time, either temporary or permanent. In view of the divided opinion as to whether or not a hearing should be had, we have concluded to extend the effec - tive date of the original order five months, with the condition that if a majority of the communities agree in their request for a hearing, and so indicate so that a hearing could be had in January, the five months' extension shall be without prejudice to any conclusions that might be reached as a result of the hearing.

            <seg id="p370">370 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT TAYLOR, Commissioner: Section I, of Chapter 144, Nebraska Laws of 1923, reads as fol - lows: "Maintenance and Retention of Existing Telephone Ex - change. — A telephone exchange, central office and switchboard shall be maintained where there is an existing exchange by one or more telephone companies operating more than ten exchanges, in every incorporated city or village in the State of Nebraska, and no exist - ing exchange, or central office shall be abandoned or discontinued by any company or removed to another city or village except by the written consent of at least sixty per cent of the subscribers or patrons who had rental or exchange service contracts with said company at a date six months before the circulation of any such petition, and until said petition has been presented to the State Railway Commission with the proper number of signers and upon a hearing the said Railway Commission issues a report, finding, decision or order permitting such discontinuance or abandonment." Alleging that it has complied with the requirements of this statute, applicant requests this Commission to authorize it to discontinue its central office at Cornlea. It states, among other things, that the num - ber of patrons of the Cornlea exchange are insufficient to support the operation of an independent office; that it has canvassed said patrons and secured the signatures of sixty per cent of same to a petition con - senting to the abandonment of the exchange; that said subscribers in the event of such abandonment will be served by lines running from the neighboring exchange of Humphrey. As directed by the statute, the Commission held a hearing on this application at Cornlea. A number of the subscribers and citizens ap - peared to protest against the proposed discontinuance of the exchange. The office of the Commission under the terms of the statute above quoted is somewhat uncertain. Presumably, however, if the telephone company secures the consent of at least sixty per cent of the subscrib - ers, being served six months previous to the application, it can apply to the Commission for permission to discontinue an exchange, where - upon the Commission can consider all relevant facts and exercise its discretion in the premises. We will act upon such construction in this case Cornlea is a small village in the northern part of Platte county. At the present time and for several years past the Northwestern Bell Tele - phone company has operated an exchange at that point. It now serves twenty-eight subscribers. The largest number ever served from the exchange directly was thirty-two. Cornlea is only four and one-half miles from Humphrey. Farm lines radiating from Humphrey extend into the country both north and south of Cornlea and come up to the </seg>
            <seg id="p371">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 371 eastern boundary of the village. Farm lines of the Lindsay and St. Bernard companies also come into Cornlea territory so that the zone of service from that exchange is greatly circumscribed and it is im - probable that the number of subscribers can ever be increased. Applicant submits a financial statement covering four years' opera - tions. These disclose that the exchange has been operated at a sub - stantial loss for all of these years. For example, in 1925 the operating revenues from exchange subscribers service was $793.65. The com - pany pays $70 per month to an operator, who furnishes rent, light, heat and does the operating. It will be seen, therefore, that this ex - penditure alone exceeds the gross income from exchange service. Ex - penditures for taxes, maintenance of the central office and interest on the investment would increase the deficit to substantial proportions. The company proposes to serve the twenty-eight subscribers at Cornlea with three metallic lines extending from Humphrey. At the present time, there are nine town phones, six of which are business and three residence, and nineteen farm subscribers. These would be divided so that the nine town phones would be served by one line, with ten farmers on one and nine on the other of the remaining circuits. So far as the farm service is concerned, the change would in no wise affect the quality of service rendered. The nine town subscribers Would be grouped on one line and the party service thus provided would not be as satisfactory as is at present enjoyed. It is proposed to serve the twenty-eight subscribers from Humphrey at the rates now in effect on that exchange. At the present time the rate for rural service at Corn - lea is $1.75 per month with fifty cents per month additional for connec - tion with Humphrey, St. Bernard and Lindsay. The Humphrey rate for farm line service is the same or $1.75 per month. The business rate at Cornlea is now $3.25 per month with seventy-five cents addi - tional for connection with Humphrey, Lindsay and St. Bernard. These subscribers will be charged $2.75 per month for Humphrey and Cornlea and upon the payment of seventy-five cents additional can secure Lind - say and St. Bernard. Two residence subscribers at Cornlea pay $2.50 per month and receive service at Cornlea, Humphrey, St. Bernard and Lindsay. One residence subscriber pays $2.00 per month for Cornlea service only. Under the proposed schedule, residence subscribers will pay $2.25 per month for Cornlea and Humphrey service. It will thus be seen that the rates as proposed will be less than are now paid by Cornlea subscribers. The gross revenue from Cornlea subscribers will be reduced from $765 to $681 per year, assuming that all subscribers continue in service. Applicant contemplates the installation of a booth in one of the business houses at Cornlea so that toll service can be rendered there - from to non-subscribers or to those subscribers who prefer a private toll </seg>
            <seg id="p372">372 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT line. Those subscribers who do not avail themselves of the flat rate for added exchange service can use the toll lines to neighboring towns. It is stated by applicant that there is ample switchboard capacity at Humphrey to accommodate the twenty-eight subscribers at Cornlea, and that at the present time no additional operator will be required. At the time of the hearing 346 subscribers were served from the Kphrey exchange. This will be increased to 374 with the addition le Cornlea subscribers. The citizens of Cornlea have a pardonable pride in their community and would like to see the telephone exchange continued as one of the business enterprises of the town. They object also to the party line service which will be furnished from Humphrey. As the result of sug - gestions dropped during the hearing, applicant at the close renewed an offer, which it had previously made, to sell the exchange to a group of local citizens. At the request of the latter, therefore, action on this application was delayed pending the outcome of negotiations for the transfer of the exchange to local parties. The sale, however, was not consummated. It is manifest that an exchange at Cornlea cannot be operated un - der present conditions so that it will pay expenses. The proximity of the village to Humphrey, with lines from that town extending on three sides of the village make it improbable that any greater number of sub- Kibers can be secured. The village itself cannot furnish sufficient pa - nage to justify the existence of an exchange. The servic- proposed to be furnished from Humphrey will in many respects be superior to that now received by subscribers at Cornlea. The rates in practically every instance will be less. It would appear, therefore, that the ap - riation of the company is well justified and we are of the opinion and find that the exchange at Cornlea should be abandoned and the sub - scribers thereof served by applicant from its exchange at Humphrey. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Northwestern Bell Tele - phone company be, and the same hereby is, authorized to abandon its central office or exchange at the village of Cornlea and to discontinue service therefrom, and to furnish service to the subscribers thereof from its exchange at Humphrey at the rates for the various classifica - tions of service applicable at the Humphrey exchange; such abandon- </seg>

The population of Goodwin is about fifteen. It is situated 6.3 miles north west of Jackson, which, is a joint agency between the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad and the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. Railroad com - pany and 5.3 miles northeast of Waterbury and approximately 2 miles south of Vista on the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. so that the territory tributary to the station of Goodwin is not very large. The country tributary, however, is very fertile and a well settled community. Goodwin has a bank, a store, a blacksmith shop, grain elevator and a repair garage. It is about 19 or 20 miles from Sioux City, Iowa. There is no pro - duce house and the cream and other produce is shipped by the individual producers. The telegraph business at the station amounts to practical - ly nothing as the testimony shows that it does not exceed $1.00 per month at that station.

L. revenue freight forwarded and received 3,923.75 Making a total revenue of $5,026.53 rre was six pieces of baggage received and 23 pieces for - warded during the year 1925 and the total expense of running the station was $1,688.06 which is 33 1-3% of the entire business realized by the com- pany at that station; of this amount $1,399.12 was paid to the agent as salary so that the actual salary of the agent at that point is over 35% of the entire revenue of the company, which amounts to $1,688.06 Revenue received at the station in 1925 averaged $ 418.87 per month. For the five months of 1926 as shown by the ex- hibit the revenue for the company was only $ 280.08 per month. The salary of the agent was $ 116.69 per month. The expense of tne company in maintaining the station including the agent's salary was $140 per month or half of the entire revenue received by the company, per month, at that station, for the five months of 1926. As the major portion of the business of the company at Goodwin is carload shipments it could be billed from Jack- son without any added expense to the company in case the station was tdled by a custodian and the expense to the company of continuing station at Goodwin could be reduced at least $1,000 per year, with- out material inconvenience to the patrons of the road at Goodwin. The Commission is of the opinion that the application should be granted in accordance with conditions of the following order. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company be permitted to substitute a custodian for the agent and telegraph operator at Goodwin, under the following rules: 1. The depot to be kept open and well lighted during the hours when light is necessary and heated during the time of the year when heat is necessary, at least half an hour before the arrival and depar- ture of scheduled trains at the station. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6301 In the Matter of the Application of Continental Gas and Electric Cor - poration and Nebraska Gas and Electric Company to Consolidate the Stock, Properties, Franchises and Earnings of Blue River Power Company and Nebraska Gas and Electric Company. Appearances : For applicants — George A. Lee, attorney; C. N. Chubb, vice pres- ident, United Light and Power company, Frank H. Brooks, general manager Nebraska Gas and Electric company. For respondents: — L. E. Laflin, Crab Orchard; Fred Carsten, Dal- las. For the Commission — B. E. Forbes, chief engineer. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman: Continental Gas &amp; Electric corporation, a foreign corporation, is the owner, through recent purchase, of all the capital stock of the. Blue River Power company, a Nebraska corporation engaged in the generation, transmission and distribution of electric light and power to approximately thirty towns and communities of east central Nebraska. Nebraska Gas &amp; Electric company, a foreign corporation, is the owner The application here presented is made under the provisions of Section three, article ten of the constitution of the state of Nebraska, which provides that, </seg>
            <seg id="p378">378 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT "No public utility, corporation or common carrier shall con - solidate its stock, property, franchises or earnings, in whole or in part, with any other public corporation or common carrier owning While challenging the applicability of this constitutional provision to the present situation, applicant companies resolved the doubt against themselves, and submitted their consolidation proposal for considera - tion of the Commission. While there are some elements of doubt as to whether this is a consolidation of competing properties, the weight of the evidence war - rants the conclusion of the Commission in the affirmative. Blue River Power company serves largely at wholesale, on contracts of limited duration, a territory extending from Bellwood and Linwood on the north, to Lewiston and Virginia on the south, and from Fairmont and Utica on the west to Davey and Valparaiso on the east. The proper - ties of Nebraska Gas &amp; Electric company almost surround the proper - ties of Blue River Power company. In general the former serves com - munities at retail. In the common territory around the edges of the territory served by Blue River Power company, there has been in the past competition as to contracts with municipalities and it is reason - able to assume that were the two corporations to be operated, owned, and managed, without a common source of management, this competi - tion might continue. If this sort of competition is within the contem - plation of the constitution, jurisdiction obtains. Continental Gas ft Electric corporation owns the stock of Ne - braska Gas and Electric company, and through the purchase of the stock of the Blue River Power company, consolidates the control of both corporations into the same hands. If the two corporations are competitors within the meaning of the constitution, the centralization of control, through stock ownership, is likewise subject to the scru - tiny of the Commission. We so held at the time of the purchase, by Continental Gas &amp; Electric corporation of the stock of Lincoln Trac - tion company. i Blue River Power company secures approximately its total out - put of electric current from a series of hydroelectric generating sta - tions on the Blue River and its branches. It has a very considerable investment in those generating stations. It is alleged by applicants, that Blue River Power company has an outlet for only 3,291,000 k. w. h. per annum and that it has sufficient capacity, if all of it could be used, to produce 5,430,000 k. w. h. This means that during a portion of each day, unless the rivers a"re very low, power is being wasted over the dams. Applicants say that by connecting the two properties </seg>
            <seg id="p379">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 379 together, this power can be utilized. It is cheaper power than produc - tion by steam in ordinary plants, where the full capacity of the water can be used. Without question consolidation, at least of operation of the two properties, will be more economical than their operation separately. Under proper regulation, much of this economy would be passed on to the consuming public. This advantage would not be immediately available except by mutual agreement, to most of the towns now serv - ed by Blue River Power company, because there exist bilateral con - tracts for a term of years between municipalities and company. Com - munities not under contract restrictions, are potential beneficiaries of cheaper production. All the benefits set forth by applicant, can be secured through common operation, rather than by consolidation into one corporation, except certain savings in the matter of bookkeeping and management. Common operation could only be secured through long time lease or common ownership. In either event, municipalities renewing their contracts with applicants would, in the absence of proper regulatory supervision, find themselves lacking the influence of competitive bid - ding at those points where competition for contracts would be feasible. But once having been serving communities in public utility service, public utilities can not capriciously or arbitrarily withdraw. They are entitled to fair compensation for their services, and no more. It must be assumed that through the courts or elsewhere, proper supervision of contract rates, or rates without contract, will exist. If it may be said that common operation, with its increased fa - cility for finding market for the power generated by hydro-electric plants, is an advantageous situation which should not be denied un - less out-weighed by its disadvantages, it is hard to say why approval should be withheld to consolidation of ownership of properties in one corporation. Mere size of a public utility corporation, is not a reason for condemnation. Unified operation is generally advantageous, and in the case of electric public utilities, the opportunities for production of current in large quantities in one place with an attendant oppor - tunity to sell that current, is distinctly beneficial. Whether the bene - fits are corporate only, or both corporate and public, depends upon the spirit of the corporation and the efficiency of regulation. Mere pos - sibility that those factors will be lacking is not, in our opinion, suffi - cient reason to deny the application. Notices of the application were sent to all the towns having a Eact relationship with Blue River Power company. Representa - of two of the towns appeared but offered no objection to the lidation. </seg>
            <seg id="p380">380 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT It is the opinion of the Commission, and it so finds, that the ap - plication should be approved, subject to certain minor restrictions, as set forth in the order below.

            <seg id="p381">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 381 APPLICATION 6305. In the Matter of the Application of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company to Discontinue Agency Service at Spring Ranch and Substitute Therefor a Custodian. Appearances : For the applicant. F. R. Mullen, division superintendent. Lincoln. J. A. Spere, Lincoln. For the respondents, C. H. Epperson, attorney, Fairfield. OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL, Commissioner: The applicant in this case is the Chicago, Burlington ft Quincy Railroad company asking for permission to discontinue the employment of an agent and telegraph operator at the town of Spring Ranch and substitute therefor a custodian to serve thp people of Spring Ranch and vicinity. The population of Spring Ranch as shown by the testi - mony is approximately 100. It is situated 6.3 miles southwest of Alma junction and 8.3 miles southwest of Fairfield and 5.8 miles east of Pau - line, on the Alma-Stromsburg branch of the Chicago, Burlington ft Quincy Railroad. The town of Deweese on the Holdrege branch of the Burlington Railroad is about seven miles southeast of Spring Ranch and the town of Little Blue is about six miles southwest of Spring Ranch on the Prosser branch of the Missouri Pacific, so that the territory tri - butary to the town of Spring Ranch is quite limited. The country tri - butary, however, is a very fertile and well settled community. Spring Ranch has one store, a bank, a barber shop, a hotel, an elevator and lumber yard. Owing to the graveled roads and the close proximity of larger towns there will undoubtedly be no increase in the population of the town or the number of business houses located there. Exhibit No. 1 of the applicant company shows that there were 144 carloads of grain and live stock shipped and 14 carloads of freight received. The revenue from carload shipments is $7,500.16 and from less than carload shipments 1,562.63 and from passenger revenue 309.27 from express earnings 444.40 making a total revenue collected at the station of $9,816.46 The telegraph revenue is so small that it was not taken into considera - tion in determining the volume of business done at the station. The sal- ary of the agent at the station amounts to $1,366.41 and with other station expenses, brings the total station expenses up to $1,582.06 which is 16% of the entire earnings of the station. If the application </seg>
            <seg id="p382">382 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT of the company is granted and custodian service is substituted for «ncy service the expense of conducting the business of the station not exceed six per cent of the revenue received at the station for shipments. That would be a saving to the company of at least ten per cent, which in the aggregate would amount to about $1,000, with very little inconvenience to the public as the business at Spring Ranch is largely carload shipments, which could be billed from Pauline or Fairfield and the local work at the station could be handled by a cus - todian. The Commission is of the opinion that the application of the com - pany should be granted in accordance with the conditions of the fol - lowing order. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad com - ty be permitted to substitute a custodian for the agent and telegraph rator at Spring Ranch under the following rules. 1. The depot to be kept open and well lighted during the hours when light is necessary and heated during the time of the year when heat is necessary, at least half an hour before the arrival and depar - ture of scheduled trains at the station. 2.

When live stock is shipped the custodian shall report all ne- Eary information to the agent at Fairfield when the car is to go east Pauline when the car is to go west, so the agent at either station tioned, may have the bill made out and in case a caretaker ac - panies the stock, the conductor of the train taking out the car shall carry the caretaker free of charge to the station where the billing is fde out. The caretaker shall then sign the contract and that contract ill be good for the passage of the caretaker to the destination and case there are two or more cars, the caretaker shall have return pas - sage to Spring Ranch.

In the Matter of the Application of all Nebraska Railroad Carriers, I for Authority to Publish Amendment to W. T. L. Circular 17-F, Covering Butter, Eggs, Cheese, Dressed Poultry and Dead Rabbits, Straight or Mixed carloads, also Live Poultry in Transit. </seg>
            <seg id="p385">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 385 OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This application came on for formal hearing on a petition signed by Mr. F. Montmorency on behalf of all Nebraska lines to amend Wes - tern Trunk Line Rules Circular 17-F so that cars of butter, eggs, cheese, dressed poultry and dead rabbits in straight or mixed carloads and live poultry in straight carloads, may be stopped in transit not to exceed three times at a charge of $6.30 per car per stop. The charge in effect at the present time is £3.60 for this service. Applicants also ask to have the rule provide that the charge will be assessed whether or not cars are set out of the train. In support of this application, witness for the Burlington offered a number of hypothetical shipments of butter and eggs originating at a Nebraska station stopped in transit twice to finish loading. This exhibit was set up on carload and Iess-than-carload rates in a compara - tive manner. Superintendent Mullen of the Burlington testified that almost invariably where cars were billed to stop in transit to finish loading, the car was set out of the train. Only on occasions where special arrangements had been made had cars been stopped to finish loading while they were in the train and in such cases it generally ap - plied to live poultry and where only a few number of coops were loaded into the train. The Lincoln Chamber of Commerce, through its representative, questioned the witness for the Burlington as to the rate that would ap - ply in the hypothetical cases submitted for the consideration of the Com - mission, it being the contention of the witness for the carrier that the Iess-than-carload rate would act as a maximum in charges assessed where the cars were stopped in transit to finish loading. This point is not important and we do not think it necessary to discuss the matter further. was shown in the record that on all commodities where stop - in transit to finish loading or to partly unload is allowed under rules now in effect the charge is $6.30 per car per stop and the Fs clearly provide that the charge is for the stopping of the car in transit and will be applied regardless of whether the car is set out of the train or not. There is nothing in this record to lead us to the conclusion that butter, eggs, poultry and dead rabbits should have this service performed at a less charge than is made against other commodi - ties of materially less value. We, therefore, find that the application should be allowed. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6322 In the Matter of the Application of the Cortland Telephone Company to Increase its Schedule of Rates. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This applicant, the Cortland Telephone Company, seeks authority to increase net monthly rates for exchange service as follows: Increase per number Present Proposed Each Total 26 Business Stations $1.50 $2.25 .75 $19.50 72 Residence " 1.25 1.50 .25 18.00 136 Farm " 1.25 1.35 .10 13.60 it 234 Total substations Proposed increase per month city 51.10 12 Proposed increase per year city $613.20 </seg>
            <seg id="p387">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 387 It was also proposed to increase rates for switching service on 52 stations from $5.00 to $6.00 per year net. The total proposed not increase would therefore be $«65.20 per annum. Hearing was held on this matter at Cortland, June 26, 1926. In support of its application the company offered in evidence at the hear - ing the .following statement intended to show future profits on the basis of the proposed rate schedule: — 27 Business stations at $2.25 (net) per month $ 729.00 66 Residence " " 1.50 (net) per month 1188.00 141 Rural stations at 1.35 (net) per month 1 2284.00 52 Service stations at 6.00 (net) per year 312.00 Total expenses $3963.00 Total revenues 4701.50 Total expenses 3963.90 Net earnings $ 737.60 The above statement, insofar as traffic and commercial expenses are concerned, are identical with the company's experience for the year 1925 as disclosed by its annual report to the Commission. The only increase contemplated in expense is in the maintenance and de - preciation allowance which applicant estimates should be $2360.09, and which is set out as the principal reason for requiring additional revenue. In the Commission's supplemental order in application No. 3811 dated January 29, 1920, it was found that $1900 should be set aside annually for purposes of maintenance and depreciation, the find - ing being based upon the testimony of the company that a linesman could not be secured for less than $1,500 per year. It has developed that applicant has set aside for purposes of maintenance and deprecia - tion, $1431.60 instead of the amount required by the Commission. Ap - plicant's conclusion as to the maintenance and depreciation require - ments is based upon the experience of the company for the jfears 1922 to 1925, inclusive, which are found to contain unusually high ex - penditures due to sleet storms, rerouting &lt; of lines, etc., which are probably not representative annual expenditures. The actual amount of money expended by the company for maintenance for the past four years as shown by its reports is as follows: Pole attachments 12.00 Toll commissions 86.00 Total operating revenues 4611.50 Rental of rooms 90.00 Total revenues 4701.50 Traffic expense 1254.85 Commercial expense 302.16 Maintenance and depreciation 2360.09 Taxes 46.60 </seg>
            <seg id="p388">388 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Average for four years.. $2,360.09 Inquiry of applicant's witnesses, with respect to maintenance ex - penditures, developed that in the year 1924 it was necessary to rebuild a large portion of the plant because of sleet storm damages, and also that the item contained expense of rerouting twelve miles of rural lines on account of electric transmission line interference. In the year 1925, the rebuilding program was completed. It is obvious that the foui year period selected by applicant is not indicative of future requirements. At present a lineman is employed by the company at 40c per hour and the company pays for the gas and oil for the opera - tion of the lineman's automobile. The general manager of the com - pany testified that the average salary paid to the lineman including the gas and oil for the automobile is $100 per month. There remains to be provided for, the costs of materials used in maintenance and a reasonable reserve to provide for replacements and unrealized- de- E nation. We are of the opinion that $1,800 per annum is a liberal wance for maintenance and depreciation. Testimony as to operator's wages and commercial expenses fully justify the item in applicant's statement of future requirements. No salaries are paid the officers of the company and the acting secretary receives $100 per year for keeping the books. Following the above conclusions future expenses of applicant would probably be as follows: Maintenance and depreciation $1,800.00 Applicant's revenues for 1925 from all sources were $4,025.98 which, applied to the above expenses, would leave available for interest and dividends $622.17 under present rates. The company has at present $7,400 par value capital stock out - standing and $2,600 of short-term notes. Its book cost of fixed prop - erty is $17,334.90 undepreciated. We find that present rates are insufficient to yield a reasonable return.

            <seg id="p389">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 389 is excessive. A rate structure will be authorized which will yield ap - proximately $300 additional revenue. The net income available for dividends would, therefore, be approximately $900 which is found to be not in excess of a fair return.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6323 rthe Matter of the Application of the Omaha &amp; Lincoln Railway &amp; Light Company, for Authority to Amend its Schedules and Aban - don Certain Tracks. FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: Applicant operates an interurban electric railway between 26th &amp; N streets, Omaha, and the village of Papillion, Sarpy county. It leases certain tracks of the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway </seg>
            <seg id="p390">890 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT company between 26th &amp; N streets, and 44th and Q streets, and haB rights of transfer with the Omaha &amp; Council Bluffs Street Railway company between 26th &amp; N streets to and including 16th street and Capital avenue in Omaha. The interurban line touches and serves the suburban villages of Homestead and Ralston. Originally the service over this line was entirely by electrically operated cars. About a year ago. buses were substituted for a portion of the electric service between 26% &amp; N streets, Omaha, and Ralston. It is proposed by the present application, to substitute buses for the electric cars between Omaha and Papillion, with the exception that two cars will be operated as far as Ralston for the purpose cf pre - serving franchise rights. It is proposed to operate with the same fre - quency of service as at present, except that trips made by an extra car between 6:50 and 9 o'clock in the morning, and 5:15 and 7 o'clock in the evening, will be eliminated. In connection with the application for authority to substitute buses for the electric cars, the Commission is asked to authorize the abandonment of that portion of the interurban railway between Ralston and Papillion. Notices of the filing of the application were served upon the city of Omaha, the village of Ralston, village of Papillion, and citizens in Homestead and South Omaha. Hearing on the application was held in the court house in Omaha on June 3, 1926. No protestants appear - ed either in person or by communication. H. A. Collins, county at - torney of Sarpy County, filed a consent on behalf of that county, in the form of an answer to the application, as follows: "Comes now H. A. Collins, duly elected, qualified and acting County Attorney in and for Sarpy County, Nebraska, and for answer to the application herein filed for and in behalf of said county, consents to the removal of the railway tracks between Ralston and Papillion and the substitution of bus line service for the railway service now used for freight and passenger carriage between Omaha and Papillion, by said applicant, and for tempor - ary service over the Sarpy Mills and Sixtieth St. graveled and pav - ed highway until the highway now used by the railway company can be graded and graveled, for the reason that adequate appropria - tions have been made and money available for the grading and graveling of the highway between Ralston and Papillion, but that such permanent improvement cannot be made until the railway track is removed from the county highway. "Said county further says that said substitution is conducive to the best interests, convenience and comfort of the traveling public." Dana B. VanDusen, city attorney for the city of Omaha, entered an appearance, but took no part in the proceedings. </seg>
            <seg id="p391">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 391 J. T. Harnett, mayor of Ralston, and O. J. Milius, president of the Ralston State Bank, were present, and upon being questioned, stated that they had been advised of the application and the purposes of the company, and that there is no objection to the proposal on the pert of the citizens of Ralston, provided the present route of service as between Ralston and Papillion, is maintained. It was explained that while the highway is being graveled, it will be necessary for the buses to follow a detour known as the Sarpy Mills road, but that this is only a temporary arrangement. On such assurance, the Ralston representatives renewed their approval of the change. Ralph Nickerson, city attorney of Papillion, did not enter appear - ance, but was present, and in a statement said the city authorities of Papillion are favorable to the proposed substitution of bus service, as is evidenced by a resolution adopted at a meeting of the city council on June 1, 1926, the resolution in substance being as follows: "It being the understanding of the village board that no change of schedule is desired or included in the application of the Omaha &amp; Lincoln Railway &amp; Light Company, for authority to abandon their tracks, and no member of the board having heard any complaint from any person, no complaint having been filed with the village board, or objection to the application, "IT IS THEREFORE RESOLVED that the village board of Papillion, informally, join in the request of the Omaha &amp; Lincoln Railway &amp; Light Company for authority to abandon said tracks, and the village attorney is instructed to be presert at said meet - ing." Mr. Nickerson, when questioned, stated that the village board had not been informed of the proposed elimination of tripper cars in the morning and evening, but expressed the personal opinion that that should not of itself be made a bar to the granting of the application, provided the officers of the company would give assurance that ade - quate service would be supplied. A. E. Langdon, attorney and citizen of Papillion, supplemented Mr. Nickerson's statement by saying there is general^ public approval of the proposed change, provided service is adequately maintained. Applicant submits a number of exhibits in support of its proposal. A revenue and expense statement, covering the operation of the rail - way department alone, exclusive of buses, shows that for the year 1925, this department operated at a net loss of $3,458.09, without any consideration being given to return on investment. For the four Enths ending April 30, 1926, the net loss, exclusive of return, was 260.42. In another exhibit, the combined revenues from railway 1 buses are presented, but the combined expenses are not given. </seg>
            <seg id="p392">392 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Traffic is decreasing, as is shown by a comparison of the number of passengers carried for the first four months of 1926, as compared to the first four months of 1925, 136,823 having been carried during this period in 1925, and 122,468 for the same period this year. Total traffic in 1925, however, was greater than for the years immediately previous, and preceding the installation of bus service. In the opinion of the officers of the company, installation of buses produced an in - crease in traffic. A tabulation is submitted, purporting to cover the original cost of the property to be abandoned. This study was made from the records of the company, and such other data as was available, and the figure aggregates $67,512.56. The abandoned plant will be sal - vaged, and as much realized therefrom as is possible, although no esti - mate of the amount is made. The immediate cause for the present application arises from the desire of the authorities of Sarpy county to gravel the, highway from Papillion to the county line. The tracks of applicant occupy the public highway for most of the distance. If they are not removed, the coun - ty will be put to the expense of widening the highway before it is improved. With the tracks removed, it will not be necessary to widen the highway, and but little work will be necessary aside from gravel - ing, to put it in good condition. It is desired to proceed with this improvement at an early date. The highway in Douglas county is all paved, with the exception of about a mile. While no formal action has - been taken, Sarpy county authorities and the railway company have been assured that this section of the highway will either be paved or graveled, when the road in Sarpy county is improved. It will be necessary, if the railway is abandoned and buses sub - stituted, to operate the latter from a point east of Ralston to Papillion, over a route known as the Sarpy Mills road, during the work of grad - ing and graveling the highway between Ralston and Papillion. Applicant now owns six White buses, with a seating capacity of twenty-five. This number will be sufficient to maintain the present schedule, and upon the completion of the highway, two buses can be held in reserve as a support for continuous service. At the present time the electric cars stop in the north part of the town of Papillion. If the new service is substituted, the buses will go through to the south side of Papillion, thus affording a more satisfactory service to the resi - dents of that town. As stated, the proposed bus scnedule is to be the same as the present combined bus and electric car schedule, with the exception that two morning and evening trips will be eliminated. Applicant has made a study of the traffic on these extra cars, and finds that it is </seg>
            <seg id="p393">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 393 very light. A showing for the month of May, presented at the request of the Commission, shows that 68 passengers were carried on the morning trip during the month of May, and 131 passengers on the evening trip during the same period. This is an average of only three passengers per run. During eight days in May, the morning trip was made without any passengers, and this was true of six evening trips during the month. It was stated by a representative of the com - pany, that quite often recently, the buses are turned back at Ralston because there are no passengers for Papillion. The traffic will be watched closely, however, and should there appear to be a sufficient demand for a reinstatement of this service, it will be promptly sup - plied. Upon the showing made, there would appear to be no reason for continuing it at the present time. While bus service is being operated via the Sarpy Mills road, more demand will be made upon the equipment than after service is installed on the regular route. This is an added reason for eliminating the special trips. It appears from this record, that the service as proposed under the new arrangement, will be as good, if not better, than has been provided by the electric cars. The company feels that the buses can be operated at less expense than is involved in the maintenance of the track and overhead equipment. In common with all other pas - senger carriers, applicant feels the effect of motor vehicle competition, and its traffic has been steadily declining. Without some such alterna - tive as is proposed by this application, it is not unlikely that ultimately service to Papillion would have to be abandoned. This may offer a solution of the problem. At any rate, it is one which appears satis - factory to the public, and in the absence of objection, should be ap - proved by the Commission. The desire of the authorities to commence work at once upon the graveling of the highway, so as to insure its completion during the summer months, makes quick action necessary. The matter, therefore, will be treated as an emergency, and the usual thirty-day period waived. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Omaha &amp; Lincoln Rail - way &amp; Light company be, and the same hereby is authorized and di - rected, to adopt and promulgate the schedules of motor bus and inter - urban railway service over the routes as shown in Exhibit A of the application herein, and set forth in Exhibit B and the explanations thereto, such authorization to cover the substitution of motor bus service for all interurban railway service, except such as is operated to comply with franchises granted by Douglas county.

NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION, H. G. Taylor, Vice-Chairman. Attest: John E. Curtiss, Secretary. (SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6326 fthe Matter of the Application of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company for Authority to Change Certain of its Train Schedules FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner Pressed by competition of other lines between St. Louis and Den- P, the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company has worked a new passenger schedule on its line between these two terminals, in No. 15 is the principal factor in the change, and it is proposed shorten its running time between the two cities by approximately three hours. This necessitates speeding up the schedule to an average of approximately 40 miles per hour, and calls for the elimination of a number of regular stops. The train in the reverse direction, No. 14, is also to be speeded up and will be relieved of a number of stops. </seg>
            <seg id="p395">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 395 The jurisdiction of this Commission applies only to local service within the state of Nebraska. As a part of the new service, two new trains, Nos. 7 and 8, will be installed to operate between Red Cloud, Nebraska, and Akron, Colorado. No. 7 west-bound, will leave Red Cloud immediately after the departure of No. 15 and will do all local work between its terminals. Returning, this train will be known as No. 8 and will leave Akron ahead of No. 14, and handle traffic hither - to carried by No. 14. It is apparant, therefore, that from Red Cloud west through Nebraska, the public will be as well or better served than at present. From Red Cloud east, certain stops are to be elimin - ated, with no substitute train to supply the deficiency. At the present time, either regular or flag stops are made at Falls City, Table Rock, Pawnee City, Liberty, Wymore, Diller, Endicott, Chester, Hardy, Superior and Guide Rock. Under the proposed schedule, regular stops will be made at Falls City, Table Rock, Wymore and Superior, with a flag stop at Pawnee City. For operating reasons, applicant has modi - fied the above schedule somewhat to provide additional stops at Chester and Endicott. At Endicott it is necessary to stop for a mail transfer, and at Chester for taking on coal. At the latter point, arrangements will be made for receiving passengers, while coal is being loaded. As to train No. 14, no change in stops east of Red Cloud will be made. That train is not to be scheduled quite so fast as No. 15, and with the time which it is able to pick up west of Red Cloud, it can make its present stops east of that point. An on-and-off study of the traffic be - tween Table Rock and Red Cloud, on trains Nos. 14 and 15, shows considerable use of these trains at Pawnee City, Endicott, Chester and Superior. The traffic on No. 14 is quite well distributed over most of the stations. Both trains will pass through this territory at a very early hour in the morning under the proposed schedule, however, and this very likely will reduce the traffic to local points. The provisions made f or accommodating local traffic Red Cloud and west, are ample and will result in even better service than is now be - ing rendered. Some inconvenience will be produced by the changes made east of Red Cloud, but they will not be of an unreasonable nature. We are of the opinion, therefore, that the application should be ap - proved. It is the desire of applicant to make the new schedule effec - tive June 6, 1926. ORDER EIT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Chicago, Burlington A incy Railroad company be, and the same hereby is, authorized to dify the schedules of trains Nos. 14 and 15 operating on the Re - publican Valley Line through Nebraska, in accordance with the schedules filed with this Commission, and made a part of the applica - tion herein, subject to conditions as to stops outlined in the opinion, </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6327 In the Matter of the Application of the Chicago &amp; North Western Bail - way Company, to Amend Passenger Train Service Intrastate in Nebraska. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman: In an effort to improve its passenger train service on its lines north of the Platte river and between Omaha and Oakdale, applicant proposes certain changes which it desires to make effective May 23, 1926. At the present time three passenger trains operate eastward from Norfolk, two of them in the early morning, and one at noon. There is no east-bound service proffered in the late afternoon, although there is a persistent and consistent demand for such service between Polk and Fremont. To remedy the situation, which the carrier its is improper, numerous conferences have been informally held een operating officials of applicant railroad, and the Commission, the application here considered has been presented. It embodies following changes: Train No. 12, originating at Oakdale, to leave that point at 4.05 p. m. instead of 7 a. m. and arriving at Omaha at 10:30 p. m. instead of 1:20 p. m. The extension of passenger train service of numbers 512 and 511, so-called Scribner branch trains, from Scribner to Omaha, making no change in the departing time of No. 512 from Oakdale but extending it to arrive in Omaha at 1:30 p. m. where heretofore connection was Ei with No. 12 at Scribner and arrival of the equipment at Omaha scheduled for 1:20 p. m. Train No. 511 has been for some time luled out of Scribner at 11:05 a. m. after making connection with </seg>
            <seg id="p397">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 397 No. 11 at Scribner, which latter train left Omaha at 7:55 a. m. It is now proposed to schedule No. 511 out of Omaha at 12:20 p. m., out of Fremont at 2 :05 p. m., out of Scribner at 3 :05 p. m. and into Oak - dale at 7:45 p. m., where the present arrival time is 3:45 p. m. It is proposed also to schedule No. Ill from Fremont to Lincoln to leave Fremont at 8:35 a. m. in place of 9:30 a. m. and to schedule No. 122 between Lincoln and Fremont to leave Lincoln at 4 p. m. in place of 2:10 p. m. It is also proposed to restore the passenger train service of No. Ill and No. 122, between Fremont and Missouri Valley, the former to leave Missouri Valley at 7 a. m. and the latter to arrive at Missouri Valley at 7:05 p. m. It is proposed also that No. 14 between Deadwood and Omaha, shall be retarded so as to leave Norfolk at 6 a. m. in place of 5:05 a. m., and to arrive at Omaha at 10:25 a. m. in place of 9:50 a. m. The proposed changes will add considerable passenger train mile - age which had, by the preceding orders of this Commission, as experi - ments, been reduced in an effort to economize in passenger train ser - vice. The experiments have not been successful, and it is now deter - mined to restore the mileage of trains numbers 512 and 511 between Scribner and Omaha, and the mileage of trains numbers 111 and 122 between Fremont and Missouri Valley. Other changes in running time are all, in the opinion of the Commission, of benefit to the traveling public, and will meet persistent complaints which have been informally lodged relative to the present situation. There appears to be no reason for a public hearing as each change proposed is in the interest of improved service to those who would ride applicant's passenger trains. An emergency exists warranting ap - proval of an effective date less than thirty days from date of this order. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway company, be and it hereby is authorized to make the following changes in its pas - senger train service within the state of Nebraska: Train No. 12 to leave Oakdale at approximately 4 p. m. in place of 7 a. m., to arrive at Omaha at correspondingly different hours. Train No. 512 to extend its. run as No. 510 from Scribner to Omaha, arriving at Omaha at approximately 1:30 p. m. </seg>
            <seg id="p398">398 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Train No. 511 to leave Omaha as No. 509 not earlier than 12:20 p. m. and Scribner at 3:05 p. m. in place of leaving Scribner as origin point at 11:05 a. m. with corresponding difference in hour of arrival at Oakdale. Train No. Ill to leave Missouri Valley at 7 a. m. and Fremont at 8:35 in place of leaving Fremont at 9:30 a. m. Train No. 122 to leave Lincoln at 4 p. m. in place of 2:10 p. m. and to extend its run to Missouri Valley, arriving at that destination at approximately 7:05 p. m. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the changes herein authorized, shall be effective not earlier than Sunday, May 23, 1926, and upon proper and sufficient notice to the public.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6332 In the Matter of the Application of the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company, for Authority to Amend Toll Rate Schedules within Nebraska. Appearances : For Applicant: W. R. Johnson, division manager. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman After certain informal conferences relative to the toll rate sched - ules of the Northwestern Bell Telephone company within Nebraska, and in conformity with understandings there arrived at, this applica - tion has been filed. It purposes making rather important reductions on certain portions of its toll business, and a few increases. The increases affect only approximately two per cent of the calls, while the decreases proposed affect possibly half of the total calls. In brief, the proposals for changes, are as follows. </seg>
            <seg id="p399">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 399 STATION TO STATION CALLS Day Rates — On all calls for distances up to 120 miles, no change. On all calls for distances more than 120 miles, 5 cents per call reduction. Evening and Night Rates — The special night rate apply - ing between mid-night and 4:30 a. m. to be cancelled. On calls for distances up to 28 miles, no change in existing even - ing rates. On calls for distances 28 to 34 miles, 5 cents per message increase. On evening calls from 34 to 64 miles dis - tance, 10 cents per message increase. On evening calls 64 to 80 miles, 5 cents increase. On evening calls for distance above 80 miles and under 200 miles, 5 cents decrease. On evening calls 200 miles and more, no change. PERSON TO PERSON CALLS On all calls up to 72 miles in distance, no change. On calls above 80 miles, reductions ranging from 5 cents at 80 miles to 55 cents at 400 miles, and correspondingly larger re - ductions for still longer distances. Appointment and Messenger Calls. No change on messages up to 80 miles in distance. Reductions for distances above 80 miles, ranging from 6 cents on the call for 80 miles to 55 cents at 400 miles, and correspondingly larger reductions for still longer calls. Report Charges. No change where the present report charge is 10 cents'. On all existing report charge rates higher than 10 cents, re- ductions approximating one-third of the existing rates. Calls enjoying the special rate after mid-night are being little used within the territory under the jurisdiction of this Commission. It is estimated that the elimination of that special rate will, if the same number of calls used the evening rate, increase the company's: revenue about $500 per annum. This indicates the little use of that rate. The increases proposed on evening calls for the definite dis - tances set out in the explanation above, will affect approximately two per cent of the daily total messages of this applicant within Nebraska, and will, if the same number of messages are filed in the future as in the past, increase the revenue in gross amount $4,000 per year. The large number of reductions explained above will, if the same number of messages are filed for the next twelve months as have been experi - enced in the past twelve months, reduce the company's revenue about </seg>
            <seg id="p400">400 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT $46,000. Therefore, unless the readjustments stimulate telephone toll business for the longer distances, the proposed rates will cause a re - duction in toll revenue of about $'42,000 per year. It is obvious that except for those who may suffer disadvantages in the small number of evening messages which will experience some increased rates, there is no necessity for submitting this application to the general public as all other changes are in their interest. In the sum total the applicant proposes very definite advantages to the patrons of the telephone company. With the application also were filed certain other miscellaneous data to be binding upon the company in the matter of the initial period of time for which the initial rate is charged, the over-time rate, the number of minutes allowed in the initial time, certain special five-cent rates heretofore approved by this Commission and now in effect, and rules and definitions relating to classification of calls and their appli - cation. These have been carefully checked and are found to correspond with existing rates and rules on files. It is the Commission's conclusion that matters contained in this application need not be submitted for a hearing but can be approved at this time without an opportunity for patrons to discuss the proposals. This conclusion is based upon the reasons already set forth. The Commission finds that the application should be approved, to be effective on and after June 12, 1926. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that the Northwestern Bell Telephone company, be and it is hereby authorized, effective June 12, 1926, to publish and collect toll rates on intrastate messages within Nebraska, within the territory served by applicant in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in exhibit 8, pages 1 to 8, inclusive, appended to the application here under consideration.

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This applicant seeks the approval of the Commission for the issue of $48,700 of its first preferred capital stock issued in 1924. Subse - quent to the issue of the above first preferred capital stock the Com - mission authorized the issue of substantial amounts of securities at which time the finances of the company were thoroughly investigated.

A contract existed between the two corporations for the payment of these and similar obligations in preferred stock. Neither party desires to exercise that contract right. The notes are to be paid in cash and applicant desires to secure that cash through sale of com - mon stock. In a hearing in January, 1924, the Commission went carefully into the question of contract relations between applicant and an en - gineering company at Abilene, Kansas, with inter-corporate relations with the United Securities company, and expressed dissatisfaction with the terms of that contract. It was later abrogated. The demand notes here concerned are legal obligations which ap - plicant must meet. It is proper and desirable financing that these ob - ligations be transferred to common stock. They bear 7% interest and constitute fixed charges against the property. As common stock, the obligations will share pro rata with other common stock in the remain - ing earnings after senior obligations have been met. It appears to be a proper corporate purpose to issue and sell the common stock prayed for, and we so find. This finding, however, shall not be construed as indicating a conclusion on the part of the Commission that in a rate case, the property constructed with the proceeds of the borrowings here concerned, are worth or not worth the amount of the obligation in - curred. Consideration of that question would include the desirability and necessity of such a contract. Applicant is now on so sound a financial footing that it can dis - pose of this proposed issue of stock among the present stockholders. </seg>

It may be that based on earnings, the market for the stock would be above par, but that market will be affected by an additional issue reducing the earnings per share from what they are now shown to be.

            <seg id="p404">404 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT BY THE COMMISSION: Applicant herein is F. R. Beyschau who owns and operates the Wy - not Telephone exchange at Wynot, under the name of the Wynot Tele - phone company, which is not incorporated. Petitioner proposes to bay the physical property of the Bloomfield Telephone company. He has applied to this Commission for a permit to issue and sell his six per cent first mortgage ten year bonds, in the par amount of $60,000. A hear - ing was held in the office of the Commission, June twenty-fifth, 1926. Applicant proposes to mortgage the fixed property of the Wy - not Telephone exchange, the Bloomfield exchange, a farm near Wynot and certain lots in Sioux City, Iowa, as described in the application. The telephone properties were appraised by the engineering de - partment of the Commission in the year 1920 and the books of the companies were set up on the appraisal figures. The accounts have been kept under the rules prescribed by the Commission and the last an - nual reports of the companies including additions and betterments, to date, were used in arriving at the value of the utility poperty, which will be subject to the mortgage. Applicant's undisputed testimony as to the present value of the real estate will be used in the computation. In the above, mortgages on the farm of $7,000 and $5,000 on city property, have been deducted. These will not be paid at this time and the new mortgage would be second as to the real estate. The loan is to run ten years at six per cent. The interest is pay - able annually. After the first five years, $5,000 annually will be due on tiie principal. Applicant will be obliged to find $3,600 annually for interest the first five years and thereafter, $3,600 for interest and $5,000 due on the principal, or $8,600 annually during the succeeding five years. Earnings of the property after all charges, except dividends, are as follows: Wynot exchange $ Bloomfield exchange Stores and supplies Farm City property 5 5,290.00 50,416.00 1,483.00 13,000.00 11,000.00 Total properties $ I 81,189.00 81,189.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p405">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 405 In the above estimate taxes and interest on the mortgages on the real estate have been deducted. It follows that applicant will have to find new money in the approximate sum of $3,547.00 to meet the charges after the first five years if operating expenses and revenues, remain constant. Applicant expects to pay $55,000 for the Bloomfield property, five percent for one year on $60,000 or $3,000 as a commission on the loan. The remaining $2,000 he expects to use as working capital and to rehabilitate the property. The new money will cost approximately six and one-half per cent, while the real estate is not earning to exceed five per cent. This points to greater economy in the operating expen - ses of the utility or increased earnings. A careful inspection of opera - ting expenses of both exchanges shows that they are extremely low at this time. Applicant was unable to point out definitely where further reductions could be made. The ratio of the mortgage to the fixed property approaches the danger point. Operating results fail to show net earnings sufficient to meet the terms of the mortgage. The Commission believes and so finds that the application should be denied. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the application of F. R. Beyschau to issue and sell his first mortgage bonds in the sum of $60,000 par value be and the same is hereby denied. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this twenty-third day of July, 1926.

In the Matter of the Application of the Missouri Pacific Railroad Cor - poration in Nebraska, to establish motor car service. FINDING AND ORDER BROWNE, Chairman: Applicant desires our approval of the substitution of motor car service for passenger trains numbers 637 and 638, operating daily between Auburn and Omaha, Nebraska, via Talmage and Weeping A gasoline motor car with trailer attached, was substituted for the steam trains above mentioned, in the spring of 1926, this change having been made without the authorization of the Commission. Attention hav - ing been called to this fact, applicant makes application for our appro - val of the substitution. On May 18, 1922, applicant asked authority to withdraw these steam passenger trains here involved, and to substitute mixed train service therefor. After hearing, the Commission entered a temporary order on June 13, 1922, requiring a change of schedule so as to meet the objection of patrons as to operating conditions, which it was al - leged resulted in reduced patronage. It was hoped that the change of schedules would improve the earnings. This hope was in vain. Pas - senger service on the line did not pay out-of-pocket cost. The Commission hesitated to approve the substitution of mixed train service, because it amounted to the elimination, for practical purposes, of passenger train service. In this conclusion, local officers of the railway company joined. Finally the Commission approved shortening the run of the train at the southern end, the distance be - twen Auburn and Falls City, and dismissed the remainder of the ap - plication without prejudice. (See Application 4798 17 N. S. R. C. 252-254.) In so disposing of the case, it was said, "We urged upon the carrier informally, that in lieu of abandonment it should substitute for a trial period, a cheaper method of transportation, such as a single car, gasoline driven, conveyance. By agreement between applicant and Commission, the case was held open pending the endeavor to work it out on some other method than abandonment of passenger service." In the light of the conclusion reached following the previous hear - ing, and all the data there presented, it does not appear essential that a hearing be held at this time. The substitution will be approved. </seg>

Appearances : For the applicant, George A. Lee, attorney. For the city of Lincoln, Charles R. Wilke, deputy city attorney. RANDALL, Commissioner: The Lincoln Traction company of Lincoln, made application to remove one of its tracks from 10th street on New Hampshire street to 14th street, owing to the fact that the city of Lincoln is about to cause said New Hampshire street to be paved and that the said New Hampshire street is a narrow street and when paved will only be thirty - five feet between curbs. This would not permit the passing of street cars by automobiles when automobiles are parked parallel with the curb on said street and also this street car line on New Hampshire street is only used extensively during the five days when the state fair is being he'd and the cost of paving for a doable track street carline would practically be confiscatory and that a single track will give ade - quate service to the public. Hearing was held in the office of the Commission on the 11th day of June at 10 o'clock a. m., the Traction company being represented 6! George A. Lee, their attorney, and the City of Lincoln was rcpresent - [ by Charles K. WilVe, deputy city attorney. The facts as shown by the testimony of the general manager of the street railway company, </seg>
            <seg id="p408">408 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT E. R. Heiny, are that a single track will furnish adequate service to the public; that the gross revenues from the North 10th and North 16th street lines for 1925 were $8,081.81 and that the actual operating ex - pense without any return on investment was $6,411.78; that there was a net loss on these two lines of $3,329.97, this was for the period of the entire year, except the five days of the state fair period, which amounts to $5,606,25. The expense of operating during the state fair period was $1,665.63. The total revenue for the year, including state fair week exceeds the operating expenses for the year, including state fair week, by only $610.66. This net return does not include any taxes, depreciation or interest on equipment or tracks. It was shown by the testimony that the expense that would be charged to the street railway company for paving for a single track in place of a double track, would make a saving to the company of ap - proximately $6,000 and that there would be no delay in the movement of traffic during any time of the year, except possibly during the state fair period, when in the congested period of the day it might slow up traffic on the entire distance between the up-town district and the fair grounds by from two to three minutes. There is no objection from the city of Lincoln or from the resi - dents owning property on New Hampshire street, and the Commission ie of the opinion that the application of the Traction company to re - move one track from their line on New Hampshire street between 10th street and 14th street and place the track that is to be used by the company in the center of the street, should be granted. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Lincoln Traction company be permitted to remove f double track on New Hampshire street between 10th street and 14th set and substitute therefor a single track to be placed in the center the street.

FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: Applicant requests authority to substitute for its present schedule of rates for toll service in Nebraska a new schedule, the general effect of which will be to reduce somewhat the revenue received by the com - pany from toll service. On May 16, 1926 this Commission authorized a new schedule of toll rates for the Northwestern Bell Telephone company, and the sys - tem applied for by the Lincoln company corresponds in all particulars to the rates approved for the Bell. As the new schedule was quite throughly analyzed in our opinion in Application No.. 6332, it will be unnecessary to discuss it further here. Applicant estimates that its gross toll revenue will be reduced ap - proximately $20,000 per year, unless the reduced rate* result in in - creased traffic. The reductions are largely in the longer distances. The complete schedule of rates applied for, is attached to the application and marked exhibit B. Since the proposed schedule is to a large extent a reduction, the public is not adversely affected. In the opinion of the Commission, therefore, the rates should be approved. Since considerable confusion will result from the application of different schedules by the Lincoln and Bell companies because of the large interchange of business between the two, and since the new Bell rates are to become effective June 12, the application herein will be approved to go into effect on the same date. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Lincoln Telephone &amp; Telegraph company be, and the same hereby is, authorized to publish and collect toll rates on intrastate messages within Nebraska as contain - ed in exhibit B attached to the application herein, such rates to serve as substitutes for the rates shown on exhibit A, also attached to the application, where the latter are now in effect. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, an emergency exisiting, this ordef shall become effective on and after June 12, 1926. </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6371 In the Matter of the Application of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company to Discontinue Agency Service at Harbine and Substitute Therefor Custodian Service. Appearances For the applicant, E. P. Holmes, attorney, Lincoln. For the protestants, Otto Placek, attorney, Wilber. OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL, Commissioner: The applicant in this case is the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company, asking for permission to discontinue the employ - ment of an agent and telegraph operator at the town of Harbine and substitute therefor a custodian to serve the people of Harbine and vi - cinity. The population of Harbine as shown by the testimony is 107. It is situated six miles east of Jansen; 5.6 miles west of Ellis on the Fairbury-Horton branch of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway. Jansen is the junction point of the branch line with the main line of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway and has twenty-four hour hour agency and telegraph service and Ellis on the branch line has eight hour agency service. Harbine has two general stores, a hardware store, lumber yard, garage, oil tanks, restaurant, a bank, two cream stations, a telephone central office, a barber shop and a harness shop. The town lays adjacent to a state highway that is now being graveled. The towns of Shea and Diller lie south of Harbine about seven miles on the Burlington Railroad. The town of Plymouth is about nine or ten miles north of Harbine, so that the trade territory surrounding the town of Harbine is quite limited. Harbine, however, is located in a very fertile and well improved farming community, but owing to trucks and automobiles the local business has fallen off to such an extent that the L. C. L. shipments have been greatly reduced and with the increas - ed facilities for driving to larger towns will undoubtedly still further decrease and there seems to be no prospects of a future growth of the </seg>
            <seg id="p411">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 411 Exhibit No. 1, of the applicant company, shows that there were thirty-four cars of wheat, twenty cars of corn, forty-eight cars of cat - tle and fifty-seven cars of hogs. This shows a total of one hundred and fifty-nine cars of freight forwarded and there was forty-six cars of freight received, making a total revenue to the company of $■ 16,564.89 for carload shipments. The L. C. L. revenue on freight forwarded The entire earnings of the company for the items just above mentioned was entirely absorbed by the agent's salary, to say nothing of the ex - pense for fuel, light and other station expenses. As the business at Harbine is largely carload shipments, which could be billed from Jan - sen or Ellis without inconvenience to the shippers and a substantial saving in overhead expense to the company should be experienced by the substitution of a custodian for an agent. The Commission is of the opinion that the application of the company should be granted in accordance with the conditions of the following order. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company be permitted to substitute a custodian for the agent and telegraph operator at Harbine under the following rules: 1. The depot to be kept open and well-lighted during the hours when light is necessary and heated during the time of the year when heat is necessary, at least half an hour before the arrival and departure of scheduled trains at the station. 2.

The custodian shall be given authority by the railroad company to receive and deliver any and all express that may be sent to that station and receive pay therefor from the consignee and that in all respects he shall perform the duties of an express agent. 4. Parties desiring to send a telegram from Harbine shall reduce the same to writing on telegram blanks, to be furnished by the cus - todian. The custodian shall telephone the message to the agent at Jansen or Ellis, to be forwarded by the operator at Jansen or Ellis, to the party to whom addressed. If the telegram is to be prepaid the custodian is to inquire from the operator at Jansen or Ellis, the amount necessary to pay the charges and the custodian shall have authority to collect the same and forward it to the operator at Jansen or Ellis. In case a telegram is sent to parties at Harbine, the operator at Jan - sen or Ellis shall telephone the telegram to the custodian at Harbine, he shall reduce it to writing and deliver it to the party to whom sent, if living in Harbine. If the party to whom the telegram is sent does noflive in Harbine^but has a telephone, the custodian shall notify the person to whom the telegram is addressed, by telephone, that there is a telegram there for him and inquire if he desires the telegram to be telephoned, if he does he shall telephone it to him, if he does not desire to have it telephoned the custodian shall enclose the telegram in an envelope and deposit it in the United States post office or retain the same until the party to whom it is sent calls for it. 5. The Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company must provide a private telephone line from Harbine to Jansen and Ellis, over which all company business shall be transacted so that it will be absolutely private and parties at Harbine desiring to obtain in - formation pertaining to shipments from the agent at Ellis or Jansen shall be permitted to use the telephone without any expense whatever. The railroad company must provide a telephone that is connected with the telephone exchange at Harbine so that patrons of the road can -communicate with the custodian in regard to shipments or other business that they may have with the railroad company. 6. The railroad company must also provide a blackboard which shall be located in a conspicuous place in the depot on which the time of the arrival and departure of scheduled trains Is to be plainly placed. The custodian must inquire from the operator at Ellis or Jansen as to the time of the arrival of trains. When they are late he will plainly print upon the blackboard the reported arrival of the train that he gets from the agent at Ellis or Jansen, so that the public may know when to expect the train to arrive. 7.

The shippers of grain shall instruct the custodian from which station they desire their cars to be billed, whether from Ellis or Jansen, and the custodian shall telephone the billing to the agency designated by the shipper and the agent at Ellis or ' Jansen shall make out the billing and return the billing by the conductor on the first train from Ellis or Jansen to Harbine to be delivered by the conductor to the custodian and by him to be delivered to the consignor. 11. When live stock is shipped the custodian shall report all neces - sary information to the agent at Ellis when the car is going east ant ■Jansen when the car is to go west, so the agent at either station men tioned, may have the bill made out and in case a caretaker accompanies the stock, the conductor of the train taking out the car shall carry the caretaker free of charge to the station where the billing is made out The caretaker shall then sign the contract and that contract shall be good for the passage of the caretaker to the destination and in ease there are two or more cars the caretaker shall have return passage to Harbine.

For the protestants, F. M. Deutsch, attorney. OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL, Commissioner: The applicant in this case is the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway Eipany asking for permission to discontinue the employment of an nt and telegraph operator at the town of Hadar and substitute •efor a custodian to serve the people of Hadar and vicinity. The ulation of Hadar is about 200. It is an incorporated town and has three stores, one elevator, two pool halls, two garages, two oil stations and a barber shop. The town formerly had a bank which at the pre - sent is closed, but has good prospects of being reopened. There is also a church and two schools, one public school and one parochial school with two teachers. The country surrounding Hadar is a rich, agricultural farming, stock raising and dairy country, and is populated by a very thrifty class of farmers. The town is located 5.5 miles north of Nor - folk, 7.5 miles south of Pierce, about 7 miles west of Hoskins and 12 or 13 miles northeast of Battle Creek. The farmers tributary to the town of Hadar are large producers of cream, poultry, eggs, hogs and cattle as the records of shipments of these products from this station show. In 1925 there were 173 cars of live stock, 13 cars of corn, 2 miscellaneous carloads shipped out, making a total of 187 cars shipped out from that station. During this period there were received at the station 8 cars of live stock, 12 cars of coal, 9 cars of grain and grain products, 4 cars of lumber, 87 cars of lime, cement and sand and 16 cars of miscellaneous freight, making a total of 325 cars shipped into that station for the year 1925 The revenue from L. C. L. shipments for 1925 was $ 6,108.55 the revenue from carload shipments was..: 13,565.35 the revenue from express was 618.84 there were 1,839 cans of cream shipped, with a revenue of 788.98 ticket sales amounted to 441.00 making a total of revenues received at the station of $21,522.72 </seg>
            <seg id="p415">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 415 It developed that one of the reasons that so large an amount of carload shipments were received of sand and gravel was that the road project between Norfolk and Pierce was being gravelled during the season of 1925, when there were 86 cars shipped in, which is undoubted - ly 80 cars more than the normal, but the revenue from this class of business is not very large as there is a low rate on this class of com - modity, so that would not increase the revenue at that station very greatly. A comparison of the business done at the station for the years 1919 to 1925 does not vary much, only as crop conditions affect the shippers of grain and live stock. The passenger business and the L. G. L. freight has fallen off from year to year since 1921 in about the same proportion as it has in other localities over the state, owing to the improved condition of the roads and the prevalent use of the privately owned automobile, the bus and the trucks. There has been an increase in the L. C. L. freight received since 1921 and express ship - ments have also increased materially since 1921. Cream shipments have been gradually increasing so that the only perceptible falling off in business at the station as compared with the last four years is from ticket sales and L. C. L. freight forwarded and this loss is more than off-set by the increase in L. C. L. freight received, express and cream earnings. For the four months of 1926 the business done as shown by the exhibits is as follows: Revenue from L. C. L. shipments for four months, 1926 $ 629.64 Revenue from C. L. shipments 5,120.33 Passenger receipts 142.04 Making a total of $5,892.01 These earnings for the first four months do not include cream and express. If the express earnings were as much as they were for the first four months of 1925, it would add $178.81 to the revenue. The cream shipments amount to $178,18, which makes additional revenue of $356.99. This added to the other earnings of the station shows the revenue of the station for the first four months of 1926 to be $6,249. If this ratio should be maintained for the year it would show an annual revenue of $18,747 for the year 1926. The salary of the agent at Hadar is $1,580.50, approximately SM% of the revenue received, and with the other station expenses added to the salary of the agent the expense of the station is about 10% of the revenue received, which in the opinion of the Commission is not excessive. While it is true that shipments could be billed at Norfolk as contemplated by the railroad company, it is also true that the amount of L. C. L. freight, express and cream shipments and passenger business would indicate that the business of the company at Hadar is of sufficient volume to E".re the services of an agent. The Commission is of the opinion the agency service should be continued and the application of the igo &amp; North Western Railway company be denied. </seg>

The Bell company has ai - rs been willing to sell, but difficulties were encountered in agreeing a price, and in the fact that the organization of the Blair company le expansion somewhat difficult. A year or so ago, Mr. E. C. Hunt, &gt; operates several exchanges at other points in the state, began to uire the stock of the Blair Telephone company, and several months , secured a controlling interest in the same. He was encouraged in effort by a number of citizens at Blair, who saw in the movement, </seg>
            <seg id="p417">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 417 An opportunity to effect the consolidation so long desired. The long con- C plated union of the two properties, has had its effect on their main - mce and the service they were able to render. Neither property has been properly kept up. This fact, as well as the inconvenience duo to a duplication of service, kept the demand for a merger alive. If the negotiations for the purchase of the Bell property by the rr company mature on the present plan, the latter will pay $12,000 the portion of the plant which it agrees to buy. This includes only the distribution system, including city and farm property. The Bell will retain its switchboard, other central office equipment and subscribers' instruments. A hearing on this application was held at Blair on July 27, 1926. Only eight patrons appeared, four of these to enter protest. Notices of the hearing were published in the newspapers in Blair, and in the other towns affected, and were sent to the city and village authorities. Newspaper accounts of the pending negotiations and the probable pur - chase, together with the plan for service and rates following consolida - tion, have been published recently so that the public has been fully ad - vised of what is proposed. At the hearing, Mr. Hunt, general manager of the company, testified that in the event of consolidation, the city plant of Blair would be completely reconstructed. It is the plan to install new cen - tral office equipment of common battery type, and to place all of the city lines underground. A little later a new central office building will f erected. The present city plant of the Blair company is loaded to ca - nty, so that it is impossible to supply service to all who apply. This particularly true of private line service, which is not now available, e new plant will, of course, have increased capacity, sufficient to take care of present needs, and with advance construction for reason - able growth. The farm lines of both properties are in a badly run down condition, this being particularly true of the Blair company. These lines will be completely overhauled and reconstructed. The plants at Kennard and Ft. Calhoun, will also be reconstructed. It is proposed by applicant to expend $61,600 for new property. This will displace property in the estimated amount of $23,542.00, leaving net additions of approximately $38,000.00. Using a previous valuation of the Blair company property made by the Commission on an original cost basis, applicant has prepared an esti - mate of the cost of reproduction value of the consolidated property, both before and after contemplated reconstruction. On this basis, the cost of reproduction new of the consolidated property before re - construction, is $141,691.70. Depreciated on the same basis as was used by the Commission's engineers, applicant arrives at a present value of this property, of $90,533.86. After adding net additions, ap- </seg>
            <seg id="p418">418 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT plicant finds a reproduction cost new of $164,534.35. The unit costs used in arriving at the cost of reproduction valuation, are submitted in the record and have been checked by the Commission's engineers. Aside from the figure for the switchboard at Blair, which the engineers regard as excessive, they find the unit costs reasonable. In addition to the physical valuation estimate thus determined, applicant has en - deavered to build up a book figure of the consolidated property after additions and betterments have been constructed. This book figure aggregates $129,881.00 plus five per cent for working capital, which produced a figure of $136,381.00. It should be stated that the proper - ty of the Bell company included in these figures, is taken in at the purchase price of $12,000.00. It is understood that this is considerably less than the actual value of the physical property acquired. Assum - ing all additions and betterments will be made as contemplated and the reconstruction program is carried out, the condition of the property should be raised from 60 to 65 per cent to 80 or 85 per cent. This would result in a present value of approximately $125,000. Such a figure is supported by the estimated book figure. Sufficient informa - tion is not at hand to justify us in finding a fair value of the property The figures given, however, provide a guide and can be used to that extent. t The rates asked for in the present application, which are to be made effective upon the consolidation of the properties, are as follows: BLAIR EXCHANGE Individual business Two party business Individual residence Party residence $4.25 per month 3.50 per month 2.25 per month 1.75 per month 2.00 per month 1.75 per month Rural metallic Rural grounded KENNARD EXCHANGE Individual business Individual residence Party residence $3.00 per month 1.75 per month 1.50 per month 2.00 per month 1.75 per month Rural metallic Rural grounded FORT CALHOUN EXCHANGE Individual business Individual residence Party residence $3.00 per month 1.75 per month 1.50 per month 2.00 per month Rural metallic </seg>
            <seg id="p419">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 419 The present rates as published by the Blair company, are as follows : Individual business Two party business Individual residence Two party residence Four party residence $2.50 per month 2.00 per month 1.50 per month 1.25 per month 1.00 per month 1.65 per month Farm, both grounded and metallic The Bell rates now in effect are as follows Individual business Two party business Four party business One party residence Two party residence Four party residence Rural metallic $3.30 per month 2.75 per month 2.20 per month 2.20 per month 1.65 per month 1.10 per month 1.65 per month There are about 145 duplicate telephones in service at present, 43 being individual business, 57 party business, 13 individual residence, and 30 party residence. Under the rates proposed, there would be a saving to the business man now required to maintain two telephones, of $1.55 per month on individual service, $1.25 per month on two-party business, $1.45 per month on individual residence, and 35 cents per month on party residence. This would result in a net saving to those now taking duplicate service, of approximately $1,700.00 per year. It is estimated that there will be 1,533 telephones in service on the three exchanges following the consolidation. At the present time the service zone of the Blair company includes all three of its exchanges. Sub - scribers of the Bell company receive service only to the other sub - scribers on that exchange. If consolidation is effected, these subscribers of the Bell company will secure the additional service furnished to the Blair company's subscribers, and the latter in turn will secure con - nection with the subscribers of the Bell company. Applicant submits an estimate of revenue, based on the number of subscribers after consolidation, and applying the rates as asked for. This shows a gross exchange revenue from all sources of $38,532.00 per year. Toll revenue of $3,100.00 is added, making the total esti - mated revenue under the new rates after consolidation $41,632.00. At the present time there is a toll charge on messages between Bell subscribers and subscribers at Kennard and Ft. Galhoun, and vice versa. Following consolidation, this toll charge will be eliminated and the reve - nue from that source will be lost. No account of this has been made in arriving at the toll revenue. </seg>
            <seg id="p420">420 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT An estimate of expenses is submitted by applicant, using the ex - perience of the Blair company as a basis. In other words, the annual expenses of the Blair company, where they were considered applicable to the consolidated service, were used. Estimates anticipating the changed conditions to be brought about by consolidation, have had to be made, of course. The statement submitted by the company is as follows: Total estimated expense $34,646.00 At the hearing it developed that applicant had made an error in calculating the item of expenses for stationery and printing. It was admitted that this should be reduced by $168. It will be noted that $6,000 is set up for salaries to officers and clerks. In the opinion of the Commission, this is somewhat excessive, and above the average allowed for similar purposes by companies having the same or a larger number of subscribers. Three thousand dollars of this amount is to be paid to the general manager. Mr. Hunt is general manager of four other companies, operating eight or nine exchanges. He receives salary from these companies. It seems manifest, therefore, that he will not be able to devote his full time to the affairs of the Blair company and this is further indicated by the fact that he is retaining the manager of the Blair company at a salary of* $2,160 per year. It would appear that not to exceed $4,000 would be a reasonable allowance for general officers' and clerks' salaries. Applicant has fixed the al - lowance for maintenance and depreciation at $13,000. This appears to be conservative. As stated above, both properties will need ex - tensive rehabilitation. While a considerable portion of this will be Summary * Operators wages 99,480.00 Power expense 697.50 Other traffic expense 10.00 Total Traffic expense $10,187.50 Salaries of officers $3,540.00 Salaries of clerks 2,460.00 Rents 431.50 Stationery &amp; printing 570.00 Office supplies &amp; expenses 717.00 Other general expense 815.00 Total $ 8,533.50 Taxes $2,675.00 Misc. charges to income 250.00 Total Maintenance &amp; depreciation-10% of $130,000.00 2,925.00 13,000.00 </seg>
            <seg id="p421">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 421 -charged to the depreciation reserve, the situation will call for more thai the normal expenditure for maintenance while the reconstruction is in progress. The figure of $13,000 as set up, therefore, is reasonable. tOn the basis of applicant's showing there would be a net income $6,987. To this should be added $168, due to the error heretofore erred to, making the figure $7,155. This would be equivalent to 5.7% on $125,000. Deducting from expenses the $2,000 in allowance for salaries, the net income would be increased to $9,155, or 7.32% on $125,000. In the rates proposed applicant, whether by design or inad - vertance, provides only for party line residence service without speci - fying how many subscribers should be included on a line. The rate suggested should cover two-party service only. If it is desired to add more to a line a four party rate should be provided. The rate asked for is sufficiently high to insure two-party service. tThe business rates of $4.25 for individual and $3.50 for two-party vice, while not as high as rates for similar service charged by the rthwestern Bell, exceed to some extent rates for the same class of vice charged by other independent companies in the state. If they i reduced 25c per month there will still remain a substantial differen - [ between the business and residence rates and the rate structure uld be more equitable. This change would result in a reduction $426 per year on the basis of the estimated number of business iscribers that will remain following consolidation. We are of the nion that such a modification in the schedule should be made. With the exceptions just noted, we are of the opinion and so find that the schedule of rates as applied for is reasonable and should be approved. The elimination of duplication and the complete recon - struction of the physical plant will result in a superior grade of tele - phone service in the communities affected. The expenses, with the Adjustments we have suggested, are conservative and necessary for the operation of a system of the kind proposed. Approval of the new rates will be subject to the condition that they will not be made effec - tive until the consolidation is completed and the reconstruction of the property brought to a stage where adequate and satisfactory ser - vice can be rendered. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Blair Telephone company be, and the same hereby is, authorized to purchase certain of the property of the Northwestern Bell Telephone company in Blair and vicinity and to merge the same with its own plant so as to thereafter render a unified and consolidated telephone service. </seg>

SUPPLEMENTAL FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: In the original finding we said: "In the rates proposed applicant, whether by design or in - advertence, provides only for party line residence service without specifying how many subscribers should be included on ' a line. The rate suggested should cover two-party service only. If it is desired to add more to a line, a four-party rate should be pro- IeJvfce/' The ratC f ° r " SUfBciently Wgh *° iMUre tw °-P art y Applicant now files an application for modification of the order ring authority to add to its residence classification a four-party rate $1.65 per month. In addition thereto it asks that the two-party rate be changed from $1.75 to 92.00. If the two-party rate were to be left at $1.75, the spread between that and the proposed four-party rate would be insufficient and probably discriminatory. The suggest- t increase in the two-party rate therefore, appears to be justified. The lition of the four-party service at $1.65 per month will undoubtedly result in less gross revenue, as by far the greater majority of resi - dence subscribers will take the four-party service. Applicant failed in the original application to ask for a differen - tial on desk telephones. It now proposes a rate of twenty-five cents for such instruments. This rate prevails almost universally through - out the state and is recognized by the Commission as a reasonable and proper charge for this class of service. It will be approved in this instance. In the original order, we provided that the rates authorized should not become effective until the consolidation had been effected and the reconstruction completed to a point where, in the opinion of our en - gineering department, reasonable and adequate service could be ren - dered. Applicant now asks that the order be modified so as to per - mit the rates to go into effect on the first of the month after the two services are operating from one switchboard. As explained at length in our findings it is proposed to install a new common battery switch - board as a part of the plan of consolidation. It is not planned or ex - pected to attempt to give a unified service until this central office in - stallation is completed. While this installation is going on, moreover, </seg>
            <seg id="p424">424 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT a great deal of the work of reconstructing lines will be completed. It will be four or five months before the new central office equipment can be installed. The complete rehabilitation of the two properties will cover a period of possibly two or three years. Undoubtedly the service will be greatly improved as soon as the new common battery switchboard is in working order and that, together with the great con - venience which follows unified service, justifies the application of the rates after these two improvements have been completed. The order will be modified accordingly. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the original order in this case be, and the same hereby is, modified so as to authorize the Blair Telephone company to charge $2.00 per month for two-party residence service instead of $1.75 per month and to add a four-party residence classification, and to change therefor, $1.65 per month. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that applicant be, and the same hereby is, authorized to charge and collect a rate of twenty-five cents per month for desk telephones in addition to the regular rates author- telephones in ized.

            <seg id="p425">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 425 PRELIMINARY OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman: Applicant street railway company has filed its request for the authority of this Commission to abandon certain electric service and certain track and roadway within and adjacent to the city of Lincoln. Hearing was had on this application on July 9, 1926. f Among other portions of the application was request for authority abandon service on the so-called North 18th street line between 11th and O street and 16th and Vine streets and to abandon trackage be - tween 11th and R streets and 16th and Vine streets. Because of an emergency this preliminary order deals only with this portion of the application. The emergency consists of the immediate widening of pavement on R street and the necessity of moving trolley poles and the early re-paving of that street. The other portions of the application will be dealt with in a final order soon to be issued. This line operating for the most part parallel to the business dis - trict of the city and at no place more than half a mile from that busi - ness district has for many years been a problem. Its traffic has been light and has been growing lighter with the increased use of auto - mobiles. Testimony was that for the past five months the average num - ber of passengers, cash, ticket and transfer, has been eight in each twenty-four hours. It is obvious that such service cannot be con - tinued and that it is of little use to the territory. The city attorney favors this portion of the application and through the chancellor of the university the board of regents expresses approval. No citizens in the territory affected appeared to oppose the abandonment. fThe light traffic does not indicate that it is advisable at this time direct a substitute service by motor bus for this particular line. If the experience with the motor buses proves satisfactory, there will probably be buses operating over a portion or all of the same streets at a not distant time serving directly the city portion of the University of Nebraska and the College of Agriculture of the university. tWe are of the opinion and so find that the application relative to donment of service and trackage on the so-called North 16th street line of the Lincoln Traction Company should be approved with no present requirement for substitute service.

FINAL OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman: t Applicant company filed its petition asking authority of this Com - ision to abandon electric service and substitute gasoline motor bus - within the city of Lincoln and adjacent thereto, as follows: 1. On the Lancaster line to remove the electric cars which oper - ate at frequencies of 40 minutes during part of the day, and at frequencies of 20 minutes during peak demand periods between 9th and P streets and the end of the line, and to substitute therefor auto - mobile buses operating at the same frequencies. L2. On the State Hospital line, to remove the electric cars operat - at frequencies of 40 minutes during part of the day and at fre - quencies of 20 minutes during peak demand periods between 9th and P streets and the State Haspital loop, and to substitute there - for automobile buses operating at the same frequencies. 3. To abandon all service on the north 16th street line operating between 11th and O streets, and 16th and Vine streets. </seg>
            <seg id="p427">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 427 4. To change the Lancaster line from 10th street to 13th street, operating same around the loop bounded by N street, O street, 12th street and 13th street, thence south to High street, east to 14th, and south to the terminal. 5. To change the Hospital line from 10th street to 13th street, r rating around the same loop as the Lancaster line, thence south South street, west on South street and on the paved boulevard to the terminal at the State Hospital. 6. To remove the physical property between 14th and Marion streets and the terminal southward, and to remove or abandon the physical property between 11th and R streets and 16th and Vine streets. tWe have already disposed of that portion of the application re - ling the abandonment of service and property on north 16th street line. The purposes of the application are, first, to reduce cost of opera - tion, second, to avoid investment in paving on south 14th street, and, third, for experimental purposes. tThe average experienced cost of operating electric street railway dee of this applicant, is 23 cents per car mile. Basing its conciu - 18 upon the experience of several months in Topeka, Kansas, ap - ant believes it can operate partial gasoline motor bus service for an out-of pocket cost of 11.6 per car mile, and 15 cents per car mile total operating cost. If this can be done, it will mean that without additional cost to the car riders, the company will make substantial savings on this supplemental service. The earnings at this time on the Lancaster line are 24.09 cents per car mile, and on the Hospital line 22.28 cents per car mile. Two-thirds of this revenue per car mile is earned north of South street, hence the earnings on the outer ends of the lines are quite light. The proposed changes would give 20 minute service down 13th street by buses in the middle of the day, and 10 minute service during the heavy traffic periods, where now the electric cars which it is pro - posed to retire, give only half that amount of service. This statement applies only to that portion north of South street. In no place would the quantity of service be less than now being given by electric lines. The proposed change of route of the Hospital line to operate on the paved boulevard, would interfere with service now being given south and west of 10th and South streets. To prevent such inter - ference, the company proposes in its application, to operate all 10th street can to 10th and Harrison. In our opinion, such can should be operated to 8th and Harrison unless it is found that it is detrimental to the remainder of the 10th street service. </seg>
            <seg id="p428">428 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT • Two can would be removed from 10th street by the proposal, and the company would add another car on the 10th street run which, because of the extension of the run, would completely fill the gap the two car lines left. This proposed 10th street service will give a 10 - minute frequency south of South street by electric lines, where now the service is 40 minutes and 20 minutes in frequency. No selection has been made of types of buses. It is assumed by applicant that adequate buses will cost $7,000 each and that for this experimental purpose, six can will be needed. The situation for street railway transportation in Lincoln is not ncouraging. We have often discussed this matter in orders and it is ot necessary to repeat that discussion here. Continuing slump in olume of traffic without corresponding reductions in operating expenses 8 the cause of the difficulty. There has been no improvement in this respect, although the rapidity of the decline has been relieved. There is probably a limit beyond which this co-ordinated bus and electric car service cannot go. Only experiments can tell where that point is. Before the company can operate buses, it must secure the appro - val of the city authorities for the operation of passenger buses over the streets of the city. This matter has already been taken up with the city council and the attitude has been favorable. The purpose of all parties to this procedure is to insure the highest possible service at the lowest possible cost to the public. Fears of the interested public that all service may soon be abandoned on the lines over which buses are proposed, are ungrounded. The company's obligation to continue ser - vice is not changed by reason of the type of vehicles used. We will approve the application, subject to certain provisions. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that Lincoln Traction company, be and it hereby is au - thorized, effective whenever the appended conditions are complied with, b(a) Substitute motor busses for electric cars on the Hospital and caster lines, operating at the frequency and over the route set h in the finding above, which is hereby made a part of this order.

OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This case came on for hearing before the Commission on an ap - plication of Mr. Montmorency, chairman of the Nebraska lines, dated July 19, 1926, in which the Commission is asked to cancel the present rule which provides 4th class rate for egg cases empty, when not sup - plied with egg case fillers and in lieu of the cancellation of this item, to apply the 1st class rate as provided in the current Western Classifi - cation. Mr. F. Montmorency testified on behalf of Nebraska Lines. He justified the application by saying that the Nebraska application does not apply on interstate traffic ; that the Kansas Commission authorized the carriers to publish first class rate instead of fourth class that now applies in Nebraska; that in his opinion the space occupied by empty egg cases not containing egg case fillers, justified the first class rates; that the following quoted rule applies from Omaha to points in Iowa under the Iowa classification; "Return rating will apply, provided egg dealer is returning the cases shown on the bill of lading or shipping receipt, covering the original inbound movement of eggs, return movement to be made within thirty days." Such shipments move on fourth class rate, otherwise egg cases new, without fillers, would be forwarded at first class rate but that he was to advise the Commission the quantity of movement of empty :s without fillers; that the main reason why this application was made to the Commission, was because of a complaint being filed with the Burlington railroad by Sioux City shippers, complaining that they had to pay first class rates on their empty egg cases forwarded to Ne - braska points, while shipments from Omaha and other Nebraska sta - tions were made at the fourth class rate; that the difference in the rates between Sioux City and Omaha constituted discrimination against the Sioux City shippers in accordance with the I.

Omaha, is 21 cents per case; that there is very little difference in ap - pearance between a new egg case and one that had made a single trip into the country and been returned loaded with eggs; that it is the policy of his firm to discourage the shipment of empty egg cases set up; that they were recommending to their customers that they would rather ship the cases knocked down and gave as a reason that they did not have the room in their factory to set up the cases; that his firm were not manufacturers of empty egg cases, but were merely jobbers operating out of Omaha and Sioux City. Mr. Bergen of the Omaha Chamber of Commerce testified on be - half of protestants in substance as follows: That in his opinion, there would be considerable controversy between the shippers and the repre - sentatives of the railroad company as to whether an empty egg case without fillers, was new or old; that there is no designation in the tariff as to what constitutes an old egg case; that the adoption of first class rating on new cases while maintaining a fourth class rating on old cases, would do much to encourage the use of old cases by all classes of shippers, and would result in damage to eggs, and consequent loss and damage claims to the railroads; that the alWing of the ap - plication would tend to increase the movement of knocked down cases, and in that way would be detrimental to the shipper who deals in shooks and would tend to throw the trade to dealers in knocked down cases. CONCLUSIONS Western Classification No. 59 provides that wooden egg case, new, set up, containing not to exceed its equipment of fillers, will be for - warded at first class rate. The same item provides that wood egg cases, old, empty or containing not to exceed its equipment of fillers, fourth class. We are unable to find from this record, why the trans - portation charge should be higher on empty egg cases new, than ap - plies on shipments of old cases. The item in question specifically pro - vides that it will apply on shipments of empty egg cases, not includ- </seg>

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6413 rthe Matter of the Application of the St. Joseph and Grand Island Railway Company to Discontinue Agency Service at Hansen, Ne - braska, and Substitute Therefor a Custodian. Appearances For the applicant — R. L. Douglas, attorney; C. E. Hedrix, super - intendent; S. E. Stohr, general freight and passenger agent; L. R. Wood, auditor. For the respondents — H. L. Sanderson, banker; F. W. Lanfear, merchant. OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL, Commissioner: The applicant in this case is the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Rail - way company asking for permission to discontinue the employment of an agent and telegraph operator at the town of Hansen and to substi - tute therefor a custodian to serve the people of Hansen and vicinity. The town of Hansen is situated about eight miles north of Hastings, a city of over 15,000 inhabitants, on the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island and the main line of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad and fifteen miles south of Grand Island, a city of about 18,000, both with exten - sive stores and business houses and nearly every line of business is represented in a wholesale way. The main public highway from Hast - ings to Grand Island is gravelled and runs in close proximity to the town of Hansen. </seg>
            <seg id="p435">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 435 There is a line of busses running from Hastings to Grand Island and intermediate points, every two hours. This service has taken most of the passenger business between Grand Island and Hastings. There is also an extensive trucking business carried on between these towns and several of the merchants have trucks and do their own trucking, so that the L. C. L. freight and passenger business has fallen off ma- terially. The condition at Hansen is not different than attains at other small towns tributary to the larger town, since the advent of the gravelled roads, the automobiles, busses and trucks. Both L. C. L. freight and passenger revenues have fallen off materially at towns similiarly situated. The business transacted at the station for the year 1925, is aa follows : Carload shipments $11,974.40 L. C. L. shipments - - 206.33 Ticket sales and fares on train 183.87 Cream shipments 10.33 Telegrams 7.63 Express (6 months 1925 and 6 months 1926) 133.77 Making a total of ..$12,516.33 The expense of maintaining an agent and operator at the station for 1925 was: Agent's salary $ 1,425.98 Telephone, stationery and supplies 142.83 Making a total of $ 1,568.81 The business transacted at the station for six months of 1926, January 1 to July 1, is as follows: Carload shipments $ 2,985.66 L. C. L. shipments 216.87 Passenger revenue 82.26 Cream shipments .92 Telegrams 3.63 Making a total of $ 3,289.34 The expense of the station for six months of 1926 was as follows: Agent's salary $ 711.80 Telephone, stationery and supplies 86.19 Total expense for the six months $ 797.99 It will be noted that the large volume of business done at the sta- tion is carload shipments that could be billed by the agent at Doniphan without any extra expense to the company and that the amount re- </seg>
            <seg id="p436">_1 NINETEENTH 436 ANNUAL REPORT ceived by the company for L. C. L. shipments, passenger fares, cream,. express and telegrams does not amount to much more than the inciden - tal expenses in running the station, so that nearly all of the agent's salary has to be absorbed from the income from carload shipments. The village of Hansen is not incorporated. There are probably about one hundred people living in and closely tributary to the village. There is a bank, one general store with a limited stock, two elevators, one of which has its headquarters at Hastings, and one at Omaha, a blacksmith shop and an eighth grade district school is maintained. There are no prospects of the business of the village increasing, ow - ing to its close proximity to the town of Hastings, with a main high - way extending between the two towns. The railroad company produced testimony to show that if they were permitted to substitute a custodian for an agent that they could effect a saving of approximately $1,000 a year and give equally as good service in the way of billing shipments by their agent at Doniphan as they are giving at the present time, with the agent located at Hansen; that the only difference there would be in the service, would be that the passengers would be required to pay their fares on the train and freight shipments into Hansen, would have to be prepaid. After duly considering all of the testimony and facts in the case the Commission is of the opinion, and so finds, that the railroad com - pany should be permitted to make the substitution of a custodian for an agent at Hansen, under the conditions of the following order. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island Railway company be permitted to substitute a custodian for the agent and telegraph opera - tor at Hansen, under the following rules: 1. The depot to be kept open and well lighted during the hours when light is necessary and heated during the time of the year when heat is necessary, at least half an hour before the arrival and depar - ture of scheduled trains at the station. 2. The custodian shall be accessible during the hours from 7 a. m. to 6 p. m. for the receiving of L. C. L. freight and express and shall be authorized to receipt for express and shall order all cars for shippers and shall telephone all bills of L. C. L. freight and C. L. freight and shall have authority to seal the cars, both live stock and dead freight. 8. The custodian shall be given authority by the railroad com- </seg>

Parties desiring to send a telegram from Hansen shall reduce the same to writing on telegram blanks, to be furnished by the cus - todian. The custodian shall telephone the message to the agent at Doniphan to be forwarded by the operator at Doniphan, to the party to whom addressed. If the telegram is to be prepaid the custodian is to inquire from the operator at Doniphan, the amount necessary to pay the charges and the custodian shall have authority to collect the same and forward it to the operator at Doniphan. In case a telegram is sent to parties at Hansen, the operator at Doniphan shall telephone the telegram to the custodian at Hansen, he shall reduce it to writing and deliver it to the party to whom sent, if living in Hansen. If the party to whom the telegram is sent does not live in Hansen, but has a telephone, the custodian shall notify the person to whom the tele - gram is addressed, by telephone, that there is a telegram there for him and inquire if he desires the telegram to be telephoned, if he does he shall telephone it to him, if he does not desire to have it telephoned the custodian shall enclose the telegram in an envelope and deposit it in the United States Post Office or retain the same until the party to whom it is sent calls for it. 5. The St. Joseph &amp; Grand Island must provide a private tele - phone line from Hansen to Doniphan, over which all company business shall be transacted so that it will be absolutely private and parties at Hansen desiring to obtain information pertaining to shipments from the agent at Doniphan, shall be permitted to use the telephone without any expense whatever. The railrad company must provide a telephone that is connected with the telephone exchange that serves the people of Hansen and vicinity, so that patrons of the road can communicate with the custodian in regard to shipments or other business that they have with the railroad company. 6. The railroad company must also provide a blackboard which shall be located in a conspicuous place in the depot on which the time of the arrival and departure of scheduled trains is to be plainly placed. The custodian must inquire from the operator at Doniphan as to the time of the arrival of trains. When they are late he will plainly print upon the blackboard the reported arrival of the train that he gets from the agent at Doniphan, so that the public may know when to expect the train to arrive. J 7. The custodian shall be authorized to receipt for all express and all L. C. L. freight delivered to him by consigners and his receipt shall be binding upon the company. </seg>
            <seg id="p438">438 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 8. The custodian shall place all baggage delivered to him by pas - sengers in the baggage car and all baggage received at the station shall be delivered by him to the parties presenting checks and in case the baggage is received and the parties are not there to receive it, he shall place it in the baggage-room until it is called for by the passenger and the company shall be liable to the passenger for the lawful value of the baggage until;it is delivered to the owner. L. C. L. freight that is unloaded for consignees at Hansen, unless delivered to the consignee on arrival, shall be placed in the freight house by the custodian and held until called for by the consignee and the company shall be re - sponsible to the consignee for the value of such freight until the same is delivered by the custodian to the consignee. 9. Passengers shall be required to pay their fare to the conductor on the train, without any extra charge for so doing. If the passenger has baggage to be checked, he shall report this fact to the conductor and the conductor shall obtain a check from the baggage-man in the baggage car or at the first station the train stops, and shall check the baggage and deliver the duplicate check to the passenger paying the fare to the station designated by the passenger. 10. The shippers of grain shall instruct the custodian as to the billing of their cars, and the custodian shall telephone the billing to the agent at Doniphan and he shall make out the billing and return the billing by the conductor on the first train from Doniphan to be deliver - ed by the conductor to the custodian, and by him to be delivered to the const jrnor. 11. When live stock is shipped the custodian shall report all necessary information to the agent at Doniphan, so that the agent may have the bill made out, and in case a caretaker accompanies the stock the conductor of the train taking out the car shall carry the caretaker free of charge to the station where the billing is made out. The care - taker shall then sign the contract and that contract shall be good for the passage of the caretaker to the destination and in case there are two or more cars the caretaker shall have return passage to Hansen. This order can be put into effect by the railroad company on and after the first day of January, 1927. Made and entered at Lincoln, Nebraska, this twenty-eighth day of December, 1926.

Appearances Fred C. Foster, attorney, and J. M. Bramlette, general manager. for applicant. John J. Ledwith, attorney, for the Eppley Hotels company. A. Gaylord, for the city of University Place. C. R. Wilke, deputy city attorney, for the city of Lincoln. s. OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman Applicant, Omaha, Lincoln A Beatrice Railway company, operates rn and interurban service between 14th and O streets in Lincoln Bethany, with a branch or spur line leading from Holdrege street north to a point on Warren Avenue slightly more than half a mile from the junction point. The operation of this utility has been through the use of one man electric cars. Applicant has now filed request for authorization to: (1) Install motor busses to operate between University Place and the down town section of Lincoln. (2) Abandon service on the stub line to the junction point at the terminus in University Place. (3) To charge 10 cents each fare, or three tokens for 25 cents, for rides on the bus. It is proposed to run these motor busses from a point somewhat north of the present terminus of the car line in University Place, down Warren avenue to Holdrege street, thence went on Holdrege street to Idylwild Drive, thence south to Orchard street, thence west on Orchard street to 27th street, thence south to Y street, thence west to 21st street, thence south on 21st street to Vine street, thence west on Vine street to 14th street, thence south on 14th street to P street, thence west on P street to 13th street, thence south on 13th street to N street, thence west to 12th street, thence north to R street, thence east to 14th street. The original application provided that the loop above described in the city of Lincoln, should mark its south limits by P street, but upon petition of business interests, it was amended to be extended to N </seg>
            <seg id="p440">440 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The company proposes to buy three modern busses and to operate with two in service on thirty minute schedules. UThe Eppley Hotels company intervened to ask that the route be nated with the loop on 11th street in place of 12th street. Under the settled practice of the Commission in considering this -application it is less interested in the proposed additional service to be proffered by the busses in the city of Lincoln, than in the abandon - ment of electric service in University Place. It is not proposed to cur - tail the electric service now being offered by applicant, except as it re - lates to the town of University Place, nor is it proposed by applicant to change the fares now being charged on the electric cars. At the present time applicant's lines do not extend into the part of the business section, nor does it serve the state farm nearer than three blocks. The proposed application to extend the bus service south of O street and to operate on Holdrege street, constitutes keener competitive service between the so-called loop district in Lincoln and the University campus. tThis will add to the extent of the service to the public, but it is ;o be seen whether it is financially advantageous to either of the portation companies. Representatives of the city of Lincoln and of University Place, appeared at the hearing and each expressed himself as satisfied with the proposed rate structure. At the present time University Place Irons can ride the electric cars of the competitor for 91 cents. They ride the electric cars of applicant for 7 cents to Lincoln. The er opportunity will be removed if the rate structure is approved, ill other places, the patron has remaining the option of riding elec - cars at the present charges without reduced service. Since out - ! of University Place, this service at a higher charge is optionally red, and since University Place has no protest to make, it will be roved for a trial period. Conditions however, will be imposed upon licant so that the Commission may at all times ascertain whether proposed additional service is compensatory within itself, and not additional burden upon the electric transportation service. kThe condition precedent to applicant's proposal, is that the two es involved, shall authorize the use of certain streets for operation transportation busses, inasmuch as they do not fall under the fran - 3es now existing. Applicant desires to route its busses west on R street from 14th street to 12th street, thence south to N, thence east to 13th, thence north to P, thence east to 14th, thence north to R. It was suggested at the time of the hearing that this would make four long turns, three </seg>
            <seg id="p441">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 441 of them on busy intersections, whereas reverse routing on the loop would congest traffic at intersections somewhat less. Applicant ex - pressed itself as indifferent upon this point. The recommendations of the Commission are that the routing be south on 14th street and north on 12th street, but no order will be entered interfering with the judg - ment of the applicant, unless in operation it appears essential for the public service. Intervenor desired that cars be routed on 11th street in place of 12th street. No substantial reason appears to exist for requiring such change over the opposition of applicant. We will approve the application, subject to several provisions similar to those imposed upon the Lincoln Traction company in a re - cent application. \^ ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, that the Omaha, Lincoln, and Beatrice Railway company be and it hereby is authorized to abandon electric railway service be - tween the junction point on Holdrege street and the terminus on War - ren Avenue, and to substitute therefor motor bus service; to operate motor busses between University Place and the loop in the business section of Lincoln. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the above approval be condi - tioned as follows: (a) Before applicant shall purchase its bus equipment it shall submit and receive approval from the Commission of the type of busses to be used. (b) Electric service by applicant in University Place and Lincoln is conditioned upon the necessary permit for use of the streets by Etor busses, and equipment is on hand to begin immediate motor bos ■vice. (c) The beginning of the proposed motor bus service shall be preceded by at least five days notice to the Commission and reasonable notice to the public.

Many of the larger rooming houses now pay the business rate, but the sororities and fraternities have, up to this time, paid a residence rate. The telephone company desires to change the classification by specific finding which would put those subscribers into the business classification. In support of the application, certain studies have been made and presented. These studies show that the average number of originating calls from residence telephones in Lincoln is 8.3 per day, from business telephones 32 calls per day and from sorority and fraternity houses 35.1 calls per day. The classification of telephones is largely bottomed upon the extent of use where such a rule can be practicably applied. The cost of service is also an element, and in a large way the handling of service complaints makes that cost. Over the period studied, the number of service complaints for one hundred residence telephones was 97.2, on business instruments 85.8 service complaints per month, and 173 service complaints per month on telephones serv - ing sororities and fraternities. These factors appear to justify the change of classification asked for by the company. We so find. It is, under the new classification, possible for each of these affected subscribers, under order in Applica - tion No. 5245, dated November 20, 1925, 18 N. S. R. C. 233-236, to install a semi-public pay station so that those who use the phone will pay for the service in proportion to their use. The school year is </seg>

Craft, attorney. For the Commission — B. E. Forbes, chief engineer. BY THE COMMISSION: Applicant herein is a corporation organized and existing under and by virtue of the laws of the state of Delaware, duly domesticated in the state of Nebraska. It has an authorized capital stock in the par amount of $150,000 divided into 150 shares of the par value of $100 each. It has applied to this Commission to issue and sell its common stock in the par amount of $50,744 or 507.44 shares, which are to be sold for cash at par. It also asks to issue and sell its six percent, twen - ty-year bonds in the sum of $75,000 to net the company not less than 93 percentum of par. The matter was heard by the Commission in its offices at Lincoln, Saturday, October 2, 1926.

A competitive situation will be created by the new construction as the city is now served by another company. Applicant has been granted a franchise to operate in Hartington for a period of twenty-five years. Further conditions of the franchise provide that the city may acquire the property if it so elects and it shall have the right to fix all rates and charges by the applicant, sub- ject to the right of appeal to the district court of Cedar County. A schedule of rates for service were made a condition of the franchise. Applicant offered expert testimony to show the cost of the entire property in place will be $125,744. The city engaged an engineer who reviewed the plans, specifications and estimates of cost before they were presented to the Commission and approved the application for the securities described above. The contract was let after com- petitive bids were received. A detailed statement of the units used in computing the cost of the property was made a part of the record for th* information of the Commission. The discount on the bonds in the runt of seven percent was included in the price bid. An operating statement was made a part of the record, as follows: ENGINEER'S ESTIMATE RELATIVE TO EARNINGS OF HARTINGTON ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY Population served 2,000 Total annual KWH consumption in Hartington on basis of f300 KWH per capita annually 600,000 basis of 90% of business to this company, its annual KWH sale in Hartington would be 540,000 rl KWH generated for Hartington on basis of 10% dis - tribution loss 594,000 Average return per KWH under Hartington rates 6.5 cents Total Hartington gross annual income $36,100.00 Total Hartington annual expense: Maintenance and repairs 1,000.00 $14,840.00 Interest at 6% on $125,744 7,544.64 7,544.64 $22,384.64 Fuel oil $4,200.00 Lubricating oil 840.00 Engineers 2,700.00 Lineman and common labor 1,500.00 Office and management 2,400.00 Taxes ___ 1,500.00 Insurance 700.00 </seg>

The new com - pany will have the street lighting contract and supply current for pumping the city water within a year after construction is completed. It will require approximately this length of time also to develop and establish the service connections anticipated. It is expected that the r company will have 90% of the business in town and supply 540, - of the total 600,000 kilowatts which the city may consume. This points to a gross revenue of $35,100. Earnings after direct operating expenses and interest have been estimated to be $22,384.16. The cost of maintenance and repairs has been included in expenses at $1,000. This is less than 1% of the depreciable property. While the property is new it is possible that this item may not exceed the sum allowed, but the purpose here is to estimate the expense which may be experienced as an average over a period of years. The information of the Commission presented in connection with the expenses of other companies of this character indicates that as much as $2,600 may be required for this purpose. The Commission will use this figure and consider the estimate of operating expenses increased accordingly. Five per cent computed on the entire property has been deducted from revenues and credited to a depreciation reserve to pay the cost of plant retired from service. This agrees with the testimony of other companies of this character and will be required in the order to fol - low. The ordinance provides that net earnings, whatever the sum may be, shall be set up separately in the books of the company and will be a credit price on the purchase price of the property in the event the city exercises its option to buy, subject to the further condition that the company is entitled to 6% interest on the unreturned portion of the principal until repaid. A separate company will build a transmission line from Harting - ton to Crofton and in addition to the latter town will serve two small settlements, also approximately fifty farm homes. It is estimated that this line will require 348,000 kilowatt hours, measured at the switch. Applicant will receive three cents per kilowatt for this ser - vice and the operating expenses mentioned above will be increased about $3,000. This business will add substantially to net earnings after all expenses. </seg>
            <seg id="p450">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 450 The Commission finds that the issue and sale of the stock and bonds as described in the application is reasonably required for the purpose of the corporation and the Commission will require that not less than five percent computed on the cost of the depreciable property shall be set aside annually from revenues and credited to a deprecia - tion reserve to pay the cost of plant retired from service, as conditions may require. The Commission will also provide that the discount on the bonds sold in the amount of $5,250 shall appear as a separate item in the books and statements of the company and shall be amortized from earnings in equal amounts annually throughout the life of the bonds before net earnings are declared. - ( The Commission will also require that applicant shall report on tnuary 1, 1927, and each three months thereafter until the property completed, the amount and kind of securities sold and the receipts d disbursements thereof.

Taylor, Vice-Chairman. Attest: Leonard D. Densmore, Secretary. (SEAL). APPLICATION NO. 6473 In the Matter of the Application of Lincoln Traction Company for Authority to Abandon Certain of its Tracks and Service on 10th and South Streets, also to Epworth Park and State Hospital. Appearances: For applicant — George A. Lee, attorney. For city of Lincoln — -C. R. Wilke, deputy city attorney. OPINION AND FINDING TAYLOR, Commissioner: This application amounts in effect to a prayer for a modification the order issued by this Commission in Application No. 6389. In that order we authorized Lincoln Traction company, among other things, to substitute motor busses for electric cars on its State Hos - pital line, with a continuation of electric service over 10th street to Harrison and thence west to 8th street. While trackage south and west of 8th and Harrison was not to be used, the order provided that it should not be removed without further showing to the Commission. Confronted with a notice from the city of Lincoln that the crea - tion of the paving district, including a considerable part of the streets between 10th and South, South to Harrison and thence west to 8th, is Ktemplated, the company now asks permission to be relieved of the ration of that portion of its line from 10th and South to 8th and Harrison and in connection therewith to remove its tracks from 10th and South to the State Hospital and the spur leading therefrom to Epworth Assembly Park. Hearing on the application was held in the offices of the Commis - sion on September 27. No patrons appeared at the hearing to oppose the application. In support of its request applicant submitted a resolution adopted by the Lincoln city council on September 20, 1926, reciting that a </seg>
            <seg id="p452">452 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT been created and requesting Lincoln Traction company to decide whether service will be continued over this street and, if so, what pro - vision for the payment of its portion of the paving will be made, and asking whether the company contemplates application to this Commis - sion for permission to abandon service on this line. A petition by cer - tain of the property owners on South 10th was also submitted, this petition being headed with the statement that the undersigned citizens and property owners "hereby agree that the said Lincoln Traction company may remove all street railway tracks from South street to Harrison avenue." Figures taken from the company's records were submitted to show that passenger traffic on the system continues to show a steady decline. For the first eight months of 1924, 4,323,190 passengers were carried, for 1925, 3,990,036, and for the same eight months in 1926, 3,761, - 449. Notwithstanding a record breaking attendance at the state fair, the traffic handled by the street railway company was less this year than for any year during the past four years. At the time of the con - solidation of the properties of The Lincoln Traction company and Lin - coln Gas &amp; Electric company an estimate of the probable revenues and expenses of Lincoln Traction company were submitted to the Commis - sion. They predicted a monthly revenue from transportation of $41, - 986. The experience of five months actual operation since consolida - tion tends to show that the estimate was too high. In none of these months has the revenue from transportation reached the amount pre - dicted. Allowance should be made, however, for the fact that those were summer months when traffic is usually somewhat lighter. The State Hospital and Epworth Assembly lines reflect a corres - ponding decrease in traffic. The revenues for the last three months on the State Hospital line are not equal to the expenses, while the rev - enues only slightly exceed the expenses on the Assembly Park line. A study of the traffic made on the State Hospital line for three days last week shows that from 10th and South, 254 passengers were handled on September 22, 320 on September 23, and 241 on Septem - ber 24. Of this number 133 were on the car at 8th and Harrison oa the 22nd, 203 on the 23rd, and 137 on the 24th. This indicates that the larger portion of the traffic served from 10th anjrSouth beyond 8th and Harrison Streets. A study of the probable cost to applicant of the proposed paving indicates that such an expenditure will amount to $16,000. The com - pany contends that it has no funds immediately available with which </seg>
            <seg id="p453">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 453 The city of Lincoln's position was stated by Deputy City Attorney Wilke. While not appearing to urge a discontinuance of the service and the removal of the tracks, the city is not opposing such action and recognizes that the removal of the tracks would simplify its paving problem in that section. £. E. Graves, a citizen of South Lincoln who circulated the peti - tion referred to above, said that as between paving or street railway service the property owners whom he interviewed prefer paving. They are not desirous of surrendering street railway service but as between that and the improvement which follows paving they are willing that the street car service be abandoned. The substitution of bus service for electric service by the com - pany was discussed at considerable length in order No. 6389. The prospects for street railway service in Lincoln were regarded as du - bious at that time and they do not seem to be improving. In the pre - vious order we authorized a change to bus operation, on the State Hos - pital line, withholding approval of track removal pending the outcome of the experiment with busses. The desire of the city and property owners to pave on 10th Street raises a new question. If the company is to escape the heavy expenditure now threatening, the tracks will have to be removed, between 10th and South and 8th and Harrison, a distance of six blocks or almost one-half mile. The abandonment of service in this neighborhood will result in patrons of the street car company having to walk an average of about five blocks to reach the lines. The general situation confronting the company, accentuated now by the prospect of having to pay out a substantial sum of money for non-revenue producing improvements, supports the conclusion that the service from 10th and South to 8th and Harrison should be dis - continued and the tracks removed. Lack of public interest constitutes substantial evidence, moreover, that the existing service contributes but little to public convenience and necessity. If this section of track is permitted to be taken up, it would seem unwise to insist that the re - mainder of the State Hospital line and Epworth Assembly spur be re - tained. If part of the line is taken up, all of it should be removed. tis our opinion, therefore, and we so find that the previous order uld be modified so as to permit the company to remove these tracks. All of these changes should be made contingent, of course, upon the installation of bus service already planned and provided for. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that paragraphs (e) and (f) of the order in Application No. 6389 be and the same are hereby amend - ed to read as follows: </seg>

            <seg id="p455">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 455 OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This matter came on for hearing before the Commission on an application of the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company made October 6, 1926, in which authority of the Commission is asked to establish a rate of three cents per cwt. on carload shipments of sand and/ or gravel from Fairbury to Lincoln. This matter has been before the Commission on three separate oc - casions. In Formal Complaint No. 521 the Rock Island asked the au - thority of the Commission to establish a rate of three cents per cwt. on carload shipments of sand and gravel from Fairbury to Lincoln. In our order in the case here mentioned dated February 20, and the supplement entered March 2, 1925, the application of the Rock Island was granted and Formal Complaint No. 521 dismissed. tOn November 2, 1925, the Rock Island asked the . authority of the imission in Application No. 6076, to cancel the three cent rate and blish in lieu thereof, four cents per 100 pounds. The following is ted from the order entered in the application just mentioned. "Complaint has been made by your Formal Complaint 548 against the rate in question and we hereby request au - thority from you to be allowed to re-establish the old rate of four cents per 100 lbs. on short notice. We anticipate your favorable action in which event it would also have the effect of disposing of formal complaint No. 548." The following is also quoted from said findings. "The carrier is asking for a rate of four cents per cwt. from the pits adjacent to Fairbury to Lincoln. This rate is bottomed upon assumptions which we condemned in Formal Complaints 508 and 513. The rule there laid down would warrant a rate of 3-M: cents from the three pits adjacent to Fairbury, to Lincoln. It follows that we must deny the appli - cation. The carrier may at its option file another application in conformity with the findings here stated." On December 22, 1925, F. J. Shubert, general freight agent of the Rock Island, made application to establish the 3i cent rate men - tioned in the order above quoted. This application was granted by the Commission in our order entered August 19, 1926. In our order entered in Application No. 6076 we used the follow - ing language: "There may be a distinct difference between approval Commission of a rate proffered by a carrier and the orcement of the same rate over the protest of the carrier." </seg>
            <seg id="p456">456 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT tOn September 30, 1926, F. J. Shubert on behalf of the Rock Is - made the present application. The following is quoted from his I "While the rate pf three cents per 100 lbs. was in effect, parties in Fairbury district shipped four cars of sand, and one car of gravel to Lincoln, Nebr., and did have prospect of con - tinuing shipments at the three cent- rate. However, with the effectiveness of the 3i cent rate, shipments ceased and we are definitely told that 31 cent rate actually will debar further movement, and we have been requested by interested shipper to restore the three cent rate Fairbury to Lincoln on sand and gravel. Carload, usual minimum weight as that is the only figure on which the traffic will move and do not feel that they should be debarred." In the hearing before the Commission representative of the Rock Island appeared and showed the number of shipments that had been made while the three cent rate was in effect and gave some general testimony as to the operating conditions under which the traffic waa handled between Fairbury and Lincoln. Representatives for the Burlington, Northwestern and Union Pacific appeared and protested against the Commission allowing the applica - tion as made. Representatives for the Western Sand &amp; Gravel com - pany and the Western Brick &amp; Supply company of Lincoln also pro - tested against the authorization of the application. A general sum - mary of the testimony of the protestants is to the effect that if the Commission authorizes the application, the same may tend to break down the zone of special commodity rates that was established in 1921. These rates were established by agreement of the Nebraska lines, Interstate Commerce Commission, interested shippers and this Commission. In our findings entered in Application No. 6076 we denied the application of the Rock Island to re-establish the four cent rate between Fairbury and Lincoln and stated as a reason that the tcent rate was suggested on account of orders entered in formal plaints involving the rates on carload shipments of sand and gravel a Morse Bluff and Schuyler to Omaha and Lincoln. Miners of sand at Fairbury offered testimony in the hearing to the effect that they had invested large sums of money in increasing the capacity output of their mines in order to take care of the business that they expected to receive by rason of being able to ship sand and/ or gravel from Fairbury to Lincoln at a rate of three cents per cwt. Mr. Steele, representing the Blue Valley Sand company, testified that his company had invested between ten and twelve thousand dollars in increasing the capacity of their plant to take care of the business that they expected to receive by reason of three cent rate and their ability to compete in the Lincoln market. </seg>
            <seg id="p457">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 457 It has been the general policy of this Commission where carriers have asked to reduce their rate, to allow the same without the neces - sity of a formal hearing. In this case, however, we thought that the general rate adjustment on sand and gravel was so closely related with the rates carried by other lines, that it would be necessary to hold a hearing. The testimony introduced in this case by the carriers and other protestants relates entirely to a commercial situation that would be brought about in the city of Lincoln if this application was allowed. In former cases we have thoroughly discussed the question of in - creasing the zone rate of three cents to Lincoln and Omaha. In both the cases that came before the Commission on formal complaint, the Commission was asked to order the railroad company to establish the three cent rate. In this case the carrier is asking the Commission to put in a three cent rate from a pit on its line to Lincoln. From the testimony introduced in this case we are unable to find any sufficient reason why the application of the carrier should not be allowed. It, therefore, follows that the Rock Island should be authorized to estab - lish the three cent rate as asked for. In the application the Commission is asked to establish the rate on less than statutory notice. This will be done. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway company be, and the same is hereby authorized and directed to establish, effec - tive October 25, 1926, a rate of three cents per cwt. on carload ship - ments of sand and/ or gravel from Fairbury to Lincoln, usual carload minimum weights to apply.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6482 In the Matter of the Application of the Omaha ft Lincoln Railway k&amp; Light Company for Authority to Suspend Operation of, and Abandon Railway Trackage. Appearances </seg>
            <seg id="p458">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 458 FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: In Application No. 6323 this Commission authorized the Omaha ft Lincoln Railway &amp; Light company to abandon service and remove tracks on its interurban electric line between Ralston and Papillion, and to substitute motor bus service therefor. The motor bus service was to be operated from Omaha to Papillion, but the portion of the electric railway between Omaha and Ralston was not authorized to be removed, as applicant desired to operate a minimum service in order to retain a franchise granted by Douglas County. It now appears, however, ana prays for authority to abandon the remaining track and its facilities, and to discontinue all electric rail - way service. The instant application is brought more particularly be - cause the city commissioners of Omaha, and county commissioners of Douglas County, in the construction of what is known as the Q street viaduct at 44th &amp; Q streets in the city of Omaha, would require the expenditure by applicant of the sum of approximately $5,000 if street cars continue to operate over said viaduct. In the showing made at the hearing, it is disclosed that the morn - ing and evening trips which are made by the electric car between South Omaha and Ralston, produce practically no revenue. For ex - ample, a total of 57 cents was collected during the month of Septem - ber. The operating expense exclusive of taxes for the same month, was $288. The testimony of all the witnesses is that the public pre - fers to use the busses and the electric cars have been completely aban - doned for that reason. The auditor of the company has made a careful estimate of the value of the remaining property, using the same basis of estimate as was employed in the previous case. The property between Ralston and South Omaha, under this estimate, amounts to $96,914.53. In addi - tion thereto, the cars, land, tools, and a pole line between South Omaha and Ralston aggregate $59,732.28. As much as possible of this prop - erty will be sold for salvage. Some of it can be used by the electrical department In addition to the showing by the company, which is quite com - plete, testimony was offered by_the mayor and city clerk of Ralston, and by a citizen of Homestead, an intermediate station served by the line, in support of the application. These witnesses stated the bus service is satisfactory and is preferred by the public, to that provided by the electric cars. They are concerned of course, in a continuation of the bus service, and do not desire their support of this application to be construed as favorinsr the abandonment of all transDortation R#»r- </seg>

No protests were received by the Commission following the notices that were sent oat, and no persons appeared to object at the time of the hearing. The bus service to Ralston will be somewhat improved when the highway from Ralston to Papillion is completed, and the Papillion bos - ses can be brought into Ralston. There appears to be no good reason for requiring the continuance of operation of this line with the attendant heavy expense. No public interest is being served. Empty cars making two trips each day, per - form no service of value, and the tracks interfere with the mainten- Ee and improvement of the highway between Omaha and Ralston, are of the opinion, therefore, and so find, that the application uld be granted. It is desired to proceed at once with the work of ing up the line. Considerable expense can be saved if the dismantling can be started from the Ralston end and the electrical facilities made use of. For that reason, the matter will be treated as an emergency. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Omaha A Lincoln Rail - way &amp; Light company be and the same is hereby authorized and direct - ed, to suspend all interurban electric railway service between South Omaha and Ralston and remove its tracks and other interurban railway equipment between said points. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that in making the necessary entries on its books to cover the changes in the accounts made necessary by the abandonment of the property by this order, applicant shall follow the rules prescribed by the Interstate Commerce Commission with reference to the treatment of abandoned property, provided that the charge to the depreciation reserve shall be in the same ratio as the abandoned property is to the property as a whole. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that an emergency existing, this order shall be in full force and effect on and after the date hereof.

The company proposes to enlarge its power house at a cost of approximately $15,200 and provide additional generating equipment including general expenditures in the sum of $49,400. The money re - ceived from the sale of the new stock will be applied on the construc - tion cost as set forth in the application and the remainder will be pro - vided for with current liabilities in the form of notes. Applicant owns and operates two hydro-electric generating plants on the Blue river and additional stand-by generating equipment is necessary to pull the peak-load and supply a dependable source of power at time of seasonal changes in the flow of the river and also to provide for a growing demand for service. The record shows a detailed statement of the cost of the additions to the power house and the new generating equipment. It appears that approximately $8,600 has been included to cover general expendi - tures in the way of engineering, supervision, interest during construc - tion, contingencies and the like. This is over 15% computed on the direct cost of the physical property. The principal item in the cost </seg>
            <seg id="p461">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 461 of the new equipment is a 600 h. p. internal combustion engine and generator at a cost of $37,900. This price includes the delivery of the engine on the company's foundation. The cooling system installed will cost The sum of these figures or approximately $40,000 of the total of $64,600 covers all expenses ready to operate. Fifteen per cent is excessive for general expenses when applied under these conditions. The Commission will use the percent which agrees with the testimony before the Commission in similar cases. This results in a total figure for the new construction of approximately $61,600. Summarizing we have the following amount subject to capitaliza- tion: This stock will be sold to net the company not less than $43,850 which will be applied on the cost as set forth above. The sum to be represented by notes is approximately $23,000. These would take precedence over the stock outstanding in the event of liquidation, otherwise the Commission would not be vitally concerned about the total amount to be expended. The Commission believes and so finds that applicant should be allowed to issue the stock described in the application. The Commis- also provide that the provisions in the original order No. 6085, reference to a depreciation reserve account shall be applied to the new property. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the Gage County Electric company of Beatrice, Ne- braska, be and the same is hereby permitted to issue and sell 154 shares of its common stock and 285 shares of its preferred stock, to net the company not less than par. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the company shall charge oper- ating expenses and credit the depreciation reserve account with not less than three per cent of the book cost of the depreciable property to pay the cost of plant retired from service.

For the Omaha Chamber of Commerce — H. D. Bergen, assistant traffic manager. For the Commission — U. G. Powell, rate expert. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This application came on for hearing before the Commission on Monday, December 13. Mr. Godt, assistant general freight agent of the applicant appeared in support of same. The Omaha Live Stock exchange, Grain Exchange and Chamber of Commerce, had representa - tives at the hearing and offered testimony in opposition to the allow - ing of the application. tin this application the Missouri Pacific asks to increase its switch - ; rates on all traffic moving intra- and inter-terminal between Omaha :eived from or delivered to the C. St. P. M'. &amp; 0. Railway company i the Illinois Central Railroad company, consigned to or originating industries located on the Union Stock Yards company tracks at uth Omaha. The only testimony offered in support of the application is the statement of Mr. Godt that it was the intention of the Missouri Pacific to apply the same rates via its lines as are in effect via the Union Pacific Railroad. No effort was made to show the conditions under which the traffic is handled by the two lines of road. The switching rates in effect on the Union Pacific between Omaha and industries located on the Union Stock Yards company's tracks at South Omaha have never been under investigation by this Commis - sion. The rates now in effect by the Union Pacific are the rates that were in effect on May 22, 1922, when the Nebraska lines were return - ed to the jurisdiction of this Commission after federal operation, sub - ject to the changes that have been authorized by this Commission. From the record it appears that this application is prompted by the </seg>
            <seg id="p463">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 463 Fip'aint of the Illinois Central that they were being required by the licant to pay greater switching rates than those in effect via the St. P. M. &amp; O. Railway. The Commission has not sufficient evidence before it in this record to determine whether or not the rates sought to be established are reasonable. The mere fact that the Missouri Pacific wants to establish the same rates as are in effect on the Union Pacific is not sufficient in - formation, in itself, to warrant a finding that increases ranging from 50% to 100% are reasonable. After due consideration of the record in this application we are of the opinion and so find that the application has not been justified. It, therefore, follows, that the same should be denied. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED by the Nebraska State Railway Commission that the application of the Missouri Pacific Railroad cor - poration in Nebraska to cancel items in its switching tariff No. 7-B as specifically mentioned in the application, should be and the same is hereby denied.

            <seg id="p464">464 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The business transacted at the station by the C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. company for the year 1925 amounted to $12,632.36; $9,367.17 of this amount was carload shipments which could have been billed from Ox - ford without any added expense to the company in case the station had been presided over by a custodian instead of an agent. The busi - nes transacted at the station for six months of 1926 amounted to $4, - 790.41. Of this amount $3,452.23 was for carload shipments which could have been billed from Oxford without any added expense to the company in case that a custodian had been employed. The testimony shows that the salary of the agent is $165. per month and that other expenses at the station amount to $10.22 per month which would make a total expense of conducting the business of the station $2,102.64. This, in the opinion of the Commission, is an excessive amount for the company to be required to spend to transact so limited an amount of business. If the application of the company is granted and the business of the station is transacted by a custodian this amount could undoubtedly be reduced from $1200 to $1500 per kThe testimony taken in the case did not show that there was much :tion from the citizens of Mascot to the substitution of a cus - n in place of an agent. C. B. Grace who, in conjunction with his father are handling the principal business of the town, testified that he could see no objection to the change if the company provided a telephone in their office at Mascot directly connected with Oxford where telegrams could be com - municated to the agent at Oxford over the 'phone in a private manner and also from the agent at Oxford to the custodian at Mascot over private wire. The manner of the way business would be conducted in case the substitution was permitted was submitted to Mr. Grace and also to his father, Senator J. M. Grace and both J. M. Grace and C. B.

Appearances : For applicant — J. L. Bauer, Scribner; E. M. Harris, Scribner; C. G. Johnson, engineer, Chicago; J. H. Agee, attorney, Lincoln. For respondents — None. For the Commission- — B. E. Forbes, engineer. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: The applicant company is a Delaware corporation, owning and operating an electric light and power plant and artificial ice plant in the city of Scribner. It asks for approval of an issue of $40,000 of first mortgage, six percent bonds, due and payable in 1946, and to be secured by a first mortgage on the property of the corporation. The proceeds of the sale of said bonds will be used to retire outstanding debts of the corporation for which no other securities have heretofore been issued. It appears from the evidence submitted at the hearing that th« Elkhorn Valley Power company was organized about the first of Octo - ber, 1926, under the laws of the state of Delaware, by the stockholders and directors of the Scribner Artificial Ice company. The principal purpose of organizing the Delaware company seems to have been to take over the capital stock of the Scribner Artificial Ice company and provide a more convenient corporation vehicle under which the ipany might grow and develop its business. The actual issue of stock in the applicant company was accom - plished on the 15 of October, 1926, and was exchanged for the common stock in the Scribner company by issuing to the stockholders in the Scribner company two shares of seven percent preferred stock and one share of non-par common stock in the Elkhorn Valley Power com - riy. The basis of the exchange was a valuation made in the summer 1926 by C. G. Johnson, electrical and valuation engineer for public utilities, of Chicago, Elinoia. Mr. C. G. Johnson testified at the hearing in regard to valuations which supported a total reproduction cost new of the physical proper - ty, sometimes called the bare bones valuation, of $177,190, to which he added overheads and intangibles, and going concern value amount- </seg>
            <seg id="p470">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 470 En and arrived at a depreciated present day value of $244,808. Elkhorn Valley Power company has written up its books on prac - ly this basis. tAn audit as of October 30, 1926, prepared by Ernst and Ernst, olic Accountants, was offered in evidence in which the total assets the Elkhorn Valley Power company appear as $237,867.16, the dif - ence between the figures of the auditors and the engineer being ex - ined by a rejection on the part of the auditors of an item of the a of $13,000 contained in Mr. Johnson's appraisal under the head - of "Cost of Financing". tA discussion of the soundness and accuracy of the figures submit - by the auditors and engineer does not seem to be relative' to the ap - ral of the bond issue in this application. It does appear, however, ; for purposes of future accounting some attention should be given item heretofore carried by the Scribner Artificial Ice company in its reciation reserve account and now appearing on the books of the horn Valley Power company under the heading of "Surplus". The effect of placing the property on the books of the Elkhorn Valley Power as set up by Ernst and Ernst is to apparently do away with the depreciation reserve of the Scribner company and to actually increase the book value to the extent of $55,088. Some differences in the items are accounted for by the fact that the engineer's appraisal was made in June, 1926, while the audit was made as of October 30, At the suggestion of the Commission, the applicant consented that the item of $55,088 be taken from the surplus account and carried on the balance sheet under the heading of "Reserve for appreciation due to re-valuation." The balance sheet of the Elkhorn Valley Power company shows outstanding as of October 30, 1926, preferred stock known as seven percentum non-voting stock, with a par value of $100 per share, $126, - 600 and 633 shares of non-par common stock. The company owes, for borrowed money $35,300 and has other liabilities consisting of un - paid accounts and certain items set up for accrued taxes, a total of 96,727.55. On the asset side are current assets of $12,135, of which amount $628 is in cash. tThe bonds which the company proposes to issue and sell will net per $100 of value, netting the company the sum of $37,200, which be sufficient to pay its obligations and leave it a small amount of :ing capital. Earnings of the corporation are unusually good. The audit dis - closes that after setting aside seven percent of its physical value in 1925, </seg>
            <seg id="p471">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 471 there was a net operating profit of $16,365.60. Figured in the usual manner of banking houses, the corporation, for the year ended Decem - ber 31, 1925, had available for depreciation, interest and dividends, after payment of taxes, the sum of $28,633.87, the annual gross being $58,675.77. The net earnings available for annual interest on the pro - posed bond issue, therefore, appears to be over eleven times the inter - est requirements. The Commission is, therefore, convinced that so far as this pro - posed issue of bonds is concerned, there is ample physical value be - hind them and unusually attractive earnings. The only point at which criticism might be directed is the price at which they are being sold. Making full allowance for the small size of the company, it would appear that the bonds might have been disposed of at a better figure. Indeed, it is not unlikely that the entire issue could have been placed locally at par. The amount of the issue is comparatively small, how - ever, so that the discount will be of little moment, and at the price realized the interest rate will be 6.35%. The Commission is of the opinion, therefore, and so finds, that the fc posed issue of bonds falls within the corporate requirement of the ipany as defined by statute and should be approved. ORDER IT IS THEREFORE ORDERED that the Elkhorn Valley Power Company be and hereby is authorized to issue and sell $'40,000 par amount of first mortgage, six percent, gold bonds, due and payable November 1, 1946, under the following conditions: A. The sale price shall be such as to net applicant not less than 93 percentum of par. B. The proceeds secured from the sale of these bonds shall be used to retire the outstanding notes of the corporation amounting to $35,300, and for the payment of such other obligations of the corpora - tion as its Board of Directors may deem best. C. As of June 30, 1927, and semi-annually thereafter, the ap - plicant company shall make a written report to the Nebraska State Railway Commission concerning the expenditures of the proceeds de - rived from said bond issue and shall file with the Commission state - ments covering the operations of the corporations, showing revenues and expenditures, and assets and liabilities of the applicant company. IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the difference between the net Eount received by the applicant company from the sa^e. of these bonds 1 the face value thereof shall be amortized in equal annual install - nts throughout the life of the bonds. </seg>

(SEAL) &gt;&gt;r APPLICATION NO. 6S4S rthe Matter of the Application of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway Company to Discontinue Agency Service at Inland, Ne - braska, and Substitute Therefor a Custodian. Appearances For the applicant — R. W. McGinnis, general agent, Lincoln, For the respondents — C. H. Worley, banker, Inland. OPINION AND ORDER RANDALL, Commissioner: kThe applicant in this case is the Chicago &amp; North Western Rail - company asking for permission to discontinue the employment of agent and telegraph operator at the town of Inland and to sub - ite therefor a custodian to serve the people of Inland and vicinity. An application of the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway com - pany and the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company to sub - stitute custodian service for agency service was made in Application Nos. 6081 and 6099 on November 12, 1925, and December 3,^25, and hearing was held at Inland on both applications on December 23, 1925. At that hearing it was shown that the business of the Chicago A North Western Railway company amounted to $9,523.52 for the year and that the business of the Chicago, Burlington k, Quincy Rail - road company amounted to $21,582.67, making a total of $31,106.19 for the combined business of the two stations and as the stations were in close proximity to each other, the Commission found that the total amount of business done at those stations would seem to require the services of an agent and telegraph operator and an order was written permitting the companies to combine their stations and transact the business with one agent, which would reduce the overhead expense and at the same time give agency service to the town of Inland. The rail - road companies have been unable to get together on - terms for the handling of this business jointly and from a showing made by the ap - plication of the Chicago * North Western Railway company to renew </seg>
            <seg id="p473">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 473 this request for a custodian in place of an agent, the figures show that there has been a material falling off in the business, to that road since the hearing was held and that the business does not warrant the overhead expense of maintaining an agent at that point. The salary of the agent is $1,458.24 and other necessary expenses amount to 225.23 making a total expense at the station of 1,783.47 This shows expense of $148.62 per month. The exhibit filed with the Commission shows that the total receipts of the station for six months from January 1 to July 1, 1926, was $2,628.48 and the expense of the station for the six months was $889. - 72 or approximately 33% of the gross receipts of the station. This is, in the opinion of the Commission, an unreasonable overhead expense for the carrying on of the business at that station, and could be very materially reduced by the substitution of a custodian for an agent, and as the town of Inland has agency service at the Burlington station no one would be discommoded. From the reports made to the Railway Commission from the rail - roads it is shown that the business of the Burlington Railroad has in - creased during the last six months. This is undoubtedly due to the location of the station in the business part of town and also the ma - jority of industries are located on that road; also to greater train ser - vice and the fact that the Burlington is a main line road to Lincoln, Omaha and the east, as well as Hastings and the west, while the North Western is a branch road from Fremont to Hastings and only has one passenger and one freight train each way per day. Immediately upon the filing of the application by the Chicago St. ri Western Railway company for substitution of custodian ser - for agency service at Inland, the Commission notified Mr. Worley at Inland, who had represented the people in the previous hearing, that application had been made for the substitution of a custodian in place of an agent at Inland. Mr. Worley appeared in the office of t Commission and stated that there was no objection from the pa - s at Inland for this substitution at the North Western Railway After duly considering all of the testimony taken in the hearing on Application No. 6081 and the exhibit attached to Application No. 6545 and the records in the office of the Commission, showing the busi - ness transacted at Inland by the applicant company, the Commission is of the opinion that the finding made in Application No. 6081 should be amended in so far as the Chicago &amp; North Western Railway com- </seg>

No complaints or objections to said application were received by the Commission and no fomal hearing was had. From the evidence produced by applicant, the Commission finds: — That applicant has operated its office and station at Columbus, for about twenty-five years. The last census shows Columbus to have a population of 5,104. During the year 1925, the average daily number of messages transmitted and received in applicant's office in Columbus, was eight. For the year 1926 (January to November in - clusive) the average was seven. In 1925 the total receipts of said office were $706.35; total ex - tditures, exclusive of line repair expenses, $997.59, leaving a de - of $291.24. In 1926 the total receipts of said office were $448.84 (January to November, inclusive); total expenditures, exclusive of line repair ex - penses, $1011.44, leaving a deficit of $562.60. I In 1925, the receipts for messages paid at other stations destined Columbus were $954.09, in 1926 (January to November, inclusive) 40 70 In addition to the office maintained by applicant, the people of Columbus are served and have available, facilities for the rapid com - munication of messages to other points, both within and without the state, furnished by the Western Union Telegraph company, which is fully adequate to the requirements of that community. The Western Union Telegraph company maintains twenty-four hour service and its office, as regards to location, is as convenient and accessible to the public as is the office of applicant. kThe law is well settled, that a public utility cannot be compelled nst its own will, to continue to render public service which can be furnished at a financial loss.

(SEAL) APPLICATION NO. 6SS7 rthe Matter of the Application of the Water and Light Company at Nebraska City, for authority to Issue and Sell Additional Common Stock. Appearances For the applicant — W. H. Pitzer, attorney; C. L. Paulin, vice - president. For the Commission — I. J. Devoe, accountant; B. E. Forbes, chief engineer. BY THE COMMISSION: The petitioner herein, the Water and Light company of Nebraska City, has applied to this Commission to issue additional common stock in the par amount of approximately $150,000 on account of additions to plant and payables retired in a like amount. Hearing was held in the offices of the Commission and testimony taken on December 23, 1926. . Applicant showed to the Commission that the net earnings of the company have been used to pay for additions and betterments in the Cn of approximately $121,333 and credits to the holding company the sum of $39,500. Retirements from plant leave net additions to •perty of $114,785. The transaction was this. The Nebraska City Utilities company, which in this case is the holding company has paid interest on bonds and taken credit for interest on open accounts, in addition to other expense items, some of which may be chargeable to capital, in the sum of $179,851. Applicant has paid and received credit on this amount for $39,500 up to November 1, 1926- </seg>
            <seg id="p479">MrDP A CV A GTATF PAIT WAV f nUUlQCinV 479 The securities authorized in the order of the Commission as of December 31, 1924, were not issued until May, 1926. Interest on inter - company accounts represented by payables to the Nebraska City Utili - ties company and other obligations of the water company assumed by the holding company, have been included in the total indebtedness of $179,851. In the first order of the Commission, wherein new capital was authorized in the par value of $756,700 a balance sheet appears which shows that approximately $54,000 of payables were outstanding, which may or may not be, represented by additions to plant. Appli - cant was unable to make proof to this effect. The probabilities are that a part of this amount was used for operating expenses and the remainder for additions. Therefore, the $'140,351 remaining after the credit of $39,500 cannot be taken as a measure of the amount subject to capitalization, as interest on unpaid operating expenses and the expenses themselves are not a proper subject for fixed capital unless they have been earned and invested in property by the operating coin- Petitioners net earnings for the years 1924, 1925 and 1926 show that there was no credit to the depreciation reserve for the first two years, the only credit to the reserve having been made in the year 1926. Net earnings before depreciation for the first two years, were not equal to the charge for depreciation as fixed by the Commission. In other words, company earnings for the first two years have not been sufficient to pay fixed charges and all expenses. This may be explained by the fact that applicant has been passing through a period of consolidation and reorganization of operating forces, which involved increased operating expenses. The operating statement for the year 1926 shows an improvement over previous years. It is clear that applicant has made net additions to plant in the sum of $114,785 and the application to retire payables to the holding company in a like amount is fully justified by the testimony in the case. This would involve a substitution of common stock in this amount for payables, which are interest bearing and should improve the financial situation of the company. The Commission believes and so finds that a new issue of common stock in the par amount of $114,800 to retire payables in the same amount is reasonably required for the purpose of the corporation.

The hearings were continued from time to time throughout the year 1920, developing much difference of opinion between the different public utility corporations as to the methods of handling such reserve accounts.

            <seg id="p481">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 481 The case was taken under advisement after hearing in October of 1920. Among other things involved, was a provision in an order enter - ed by this Commission on October 28, 1918, directed to the then Ne - braska Telephone company, predecessor to the Northwestern Bell Tele - phone company in Nebraska, which provision required charges to the reserve account to be upon the basis of replacement cost. The rule of this company was that the charges should be upon the basis of invest - ment cost. Order to show cause was involved as to why the original order was not observed. Before this matter came on for final adjudication, various state commissions and the Interstate Commerce Commission, jointly begun consideration of the same general matters, and the Nebraska investiga - tion was allowed to lag. No conclusions have yet been reached in the joint investigation, because of the many diverse and conflicting situa - tns involved in one method to be applied to various classes of pub - utilities. &gt;^ It appears advisable, under the circumstances, that these Nebraska proceedings be discontinued and dismissed in order that upon conclu - sion of the joint investigation they may be renewed in the light of the wider experience of recent years.

            <seg id="p484">484 NINETEENTH AVNUAL REPORT RESOLUTION NO. 93 rthe Matter of the Investigation of the Rule of the Stanton Inde - pendent Telephone Company of Stanton, Which Requires Farmer Subscribers to Own and Maintain their Own Stub Lines. Appearances For protestants — M. C. Wimer, et al. For defendant — A. W. Forbes. FINDING AND ORDER TAYLOR, Commissioner: The Stanton Independent Telephone company operates a telephone system consisting of an exchange at Stanton, and farm lines tributary thereto. It owns all of the property through which service is rendered, with the exception of the branch or stub lines which lead from the main farm lines to the farmers' houses. These stub lines were built ori - ginally by the farmers themselves. While there is some misunderstanding as to tne original arrangement, it is the company's position that thesp stub lines were to be subsequently maintained by the farmers them - selves. In event of failure on the part of the farmers to maintain the lines, the company was to make such repairs as were necessary, and charge the cost thereof to the owner of the line. This joint ownership of the lines necessary to serve the farmers on the Stanton exchange, has given rise to more or less dissatisfaction, and several complaints have been filed with this Commission. An ef - fort was made by the Commission to adjust matters informally, and its assistant engineer was sent to make an inspection of some of tne fines involved. It was found impossible, however, to effect an adjust - ment that promised to be permanently satisfactory. On April 10, 1925, the Commission issued an order citing the Stanton Independent Telephone company to appear and show cause why an order should not issue requiring it to purchase the stub lines from farmer subscribers; and thereafter maintain them, or as an alternative, to construct and maintain new lines. Hearing on this order to show cause was had in the office of the Commission on May 19, 1925. At that time none of the complaining farmers appeared. Mr. A. W. Forbes, president and half owner of the company, appeared and testified with reference to the practice of the company, vigorously defending the plan. He main - tains that having ownership of a part of the facilities through which he receives service, the farmer is more tolerant and more inclined to cooperate with the company in seeing that the lines are kept up. It is Mr. Forbes' contention that minor repairs which can readily be made by the farmer on the ground, thus rendering unnecessary long trips by a </seg>
            <seg id="p485">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 485 lineman from town, materially reduces the expense of maintenance. He explained that the failure of the company to take care of service complaints promptly last year was due to the fact that they were re - quired to move their poles and cables from the main streets to the al - leys in Stanton, and to make other readjustments of their plant in anticipation of a paving program later instituted by the city. Because of the failure or inability of complainants to attend the hearing and in response to requests for a further hearing, such hear - ing was held at Stanton on November 3, 1925. A large number of farm patrons of the company attended. Seventeen of these farmers testified. At least eleven farm lines were represented by the witness - es. Two or three witnesses did not indicate the number of the line by which they were served. It should be stated in this connection that during the interim between the two hearings, the Commission directed its assistant engineer to again make an investigation of lines served by Cnplainants. This he did and his report was made a part of the ord. He visited the territory on June 30, 1925, and gave particular attention to lines Nos. 19 and 44, serving M. C. Wimer and neighbors. In his report he stated that he found these lines "to be in exceptional - ly poor physical condition and with a number of physical conditions existing that would tend to greatly impair service". He further stated that the conditions "consisted of broken poles, wires off insulators, broken brackets, very slack line wire, and a great many trees inter - fering with line wires". These conditions applied not only to the stub lines, but to the main leads as well. He stated also that there were a number of poles broken, slack wires and line poles pulled out of line by spur lines pulling on them, without anchors to hold them. After investigating Mr. Wimer's complaint to the effect that the company nad without permission, trimmed a valuable tree in the front yard of his home and later assessed a charge of $2.00, the engineer, Mr. Mc- Lain said: "Would say M. C. Wimer undoubtedly had just cause for his complaint as to service and the unreasonableness of trimming his trees". He further stated that upon talking to Mr. Forbes, the latter stated these were his poorest farm lines, and were to be rebuilt this summer, this rebuilding having been delayed on account of the paving program in Stanton. In testimony in explanation of his report, Mr. McLain stated that service on the day he tested it, was satisfactory, but that conditions were such as to make him believe it would not con - tinue so, particularly under unfavorable weather conditions. Wet weather would cause leakage from the lines and wind would blow the slack wires together. He reported that he found a number of farm lines in good condition. It would be somewhat profitless and largely repetition, to discuss the testimony submitted by farmer witnesses. Some of it apparently was actuated by ill-feeling toward Mr. Forbes, and to that extent may </seg>
            <seg id="p486">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 486 have been somewhat overdrawn. Its general import, however, tends to contradict the contention of the company that ownership by the farmers of the stub lines, is a good thing. There is considerable tes - timony to show that service is quite frequently interrupted because of the condition of the lines, and that often there is a doubt and some - times disagreement as to whether the trouble is caused by defects in the stub lines or in the main lead. The farmers readily concede that they are not telephone experts and that quite frequently they are un - able to locate trouble even though it may be on the stub line for which they are responsible. That a very considerable portion of the trouble originates on the stub lines, is borne out by the declaration of the company itself, published in its directory under the heading "Tele - phone Rules". These rules are as follows: "All troubles on farmers' private lines Must Be Taken Care of By Owners or Subscribers on Such Farm, or if chared by our trouble men, must be paid expense incurred by the company. "Keep your line in good order, trees trimmed and corners and ends well braced or anchored. The best part of a telephone line is no better than the poorest. Our records show about 80 per cent of farm trouble on farmers branch lines. If your wire breaks always make a tight connection. Never make a "barbed wire or button hook" splice or connection. A loose connection makes your telephone 'cut out'. Farmers are welcome to fasten finer wires to poles if they reset the pole when it breaks. "No rebate in charges will be allowed any subscriber on account of line or telephone trouble unless the company receives a written notice from subscriber and trouble is not fixed within three days thereafter." Frequent reference to these rules was made by Mr. Forbes, dur - ing the progress of the hearing. He appeared to assume that farmers were familiar with them, and should comply with them to the letter. If, as stated in the second rule quoted, 80 per cent of farm line troubles originate on farmers' branch lines, then something is radically wrong with the system. These stub lines range in length from 54 or~ 60 feet, to not over a mile and a half. A large number of them are not over 40 rods in length. That 80 per cent of farm trouble should oc - cur on this, very small portion of the system's equipment, 'is evidence that the arrangement does not result in proper maintenance. The rules caution farmers never to make a "barbed wire or button hook" splice or connection. Engineer McLain discussed at some length, the importance of correct splicing of broken wires. Such rough connec - tions tend to induce high resistance and impede transmission. It is difficult, if not impossible, to make a workmanlike splice without proper tools. Farmers can hardly be expected to supply themselves with such tools* </seg>
            <seg id="p487">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 487 Not only is the individual fanner's service affected when his stub line is in trouble, but as stated by Mr. Forbes, the trouble may extend to the entire farm line and interfere with or render impossible, service to ten or twelve other farm subscribers. An instance of this kind is illustrated by the experience of a subscriber, Mr. Thomas Kar - man. In June, 1925, according to his testimony, his telephone went out of service. A few weeks later he discovered that his stub line had been disconnected, where it joined the main lead. He reconnected it and again secured telephone service. Two weeks later the company lineman came out and disconnected it, again putting Mr. Karman's telephone out of service. The latter promptly re-established the con - nection, and two or three days later the lineman again came out and informed Mr. Karman that his line was in bad order and because of its condition, it was impossible to permit him to maintain the connec - tion. He was advised that his stub line would have to be moved to a new location. Notwithstanding the fact that he was out of service for the greater portion of the time from June to September, no allow - ance was made in his rental, and it was several weeks after his line was disconnected, before he received any information from the com - pany as to the reason for its action. The company's explanation for its neglect in this instance, is that the full time of the plant force was occupied with the work in Stanton, and that farm line repairs had to be neglected. This explanation does not justify the company's failure however, to advise Mr. Karman as to why he was not receiving service, nor does it justify the company in its failure to make proper allow - ance for rental. The incident emphasizes the lack of coordination be - tween the company and its farm subscribers. Without doubt this is due to the divided responsibility growing out of joint ownership of the lines. If the company owned all of the farm lines, it would have full control over their maintenance and operation. The record in this case amply justifies the conclusion that the present arrangement prevents such control, and results in a lower standard of service and consequent dissatisfaction of farm subscribers. Ownership of stub lines by far - mers, is a hangover from former days, when many plans were resorted to by farmers to secure telephone service. The practice is out of line with modern methods. In our opinion, satisfactory service cannot and will not be furnished to the farmers of this company, until the latter acquires all of the property with which it endeavors to render service. The condition of certain of the lines, particularly Nos. 19 and 44, is such as to make good service impossible. The company should promptly make repairs to these lines in accordance with the suggestions contained in the report of our engineer. </seg>

            <seg id="p490">490 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT &gt; TAYLOR, Commissioner In the original resolution in this case, the Commission cited the Stanton Independent Telephone company to show cause why switching rates, if switching service was performed by the company, had not been filed with the Commission. The matter was set down for hear - ing on Tuesday, Hay 19, 1925. At that time A. W. Forbes, president of the Stanton Independent Telephone company appeared, and ex - plained that the lines in question were owned by the company known as the Cedar Creek Telephone company, of which five-sevenths of the stock was owned by the Stanton company, and two-sevenths by the six farmers who were served by the lines. These farmers paid to the Stanton company, 75 cents per month for switching service, this rate having been in effect for several years. The revenue thus derived has always been reported by the Stanton company as a part of its general receipts. Since the hearing, the Stanton company has purchased the other two-sevenths interest, and is now sole owner of all the proper - ties. The regular farm line rate is being charged to the six farmers. Under the circumstances, therefore, no further action by the Commis - sion would appear to be necessary and no order will be entered.

(SEAL) RESOLUTION NO. 95 In re Substitution of Western Classification No. 58 for Nebraska Classification No. 1. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This matter came on for hearing before the Commission on its own motion to finally determine reasonable rules which should be pub - lished by the carriers as to a number of items that were not passed upon by the Commission in the order entered in Application No. 4934 being the Classification investigation and exceptions to Western Trunk Line Rules Circular 17-E. The several items considered herein will be stated and discussed separately. FIRST. In application 5343 the carriers asked to establish the fol lowing rule on Nebraska intrastate traffic. </seg>
            <seg id="p491">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 491 "When it is necessary to clean and disinfect all, or any part, of a railroad owned or operated stockyards, stock pens or chutes, by reason of the movement in or through such stock yards, of live stock infected with contagious disease, the owner of such infected live stock will be required to pay the actual cost of the labor and materials used in cleaning and disinfecting such premises, and in addition, a charge equal to 15 per cent of the actual cost of such labor and materials for supervision." In the hearing it developed that the carriers had modified their original application as set out above, so as to provide that the charge should represent the cost of disinfecting the yards only. The question of cleaning the yards was eliminated from the application. The car - riers submitted numerous instances where yards had been disinfected. Most of these illustrations, however, failed to separate the cost to the carrier as between cleaning the yards and disinfecting the same. The carriers contend that the live stock rates as established do not contemplate extra services in the way of disinfecting stockyards on account of contamination from stock suffering from contagious disease by reason of a shipper loading diseased stock through the carriers' yards. From the testimony it appears that contagious disease is almost uniformly detected at the terminal yards. As soon as the government or state inspectors have determined that a particular shipment of live stock is diseased it is immediately placed in quarantine yards at the rminal market and the carrier bringing the live stock into the market notified of the point of origin, date of shipment, and consignee as shown by the way-bill. The carrier affected immediately notifies its agent at point of origin, the stock yards at that point are placed under quarantine and no live stock is allowed to be placed in the yards or forwarded from same, until the yards have been inspected and pro - nounced properly disinfected. The general practice of disinfecting yards, as outlined by car - riers' testimony, is to notify the superintendent of the district in which the point of origin is located, and provision is made for immediate shipment of the proper equipment and disinfecting materials to the af - fected station, and the section men are directed to disinfect the yards. As soon as the same has been accomplished the agent notifies the superintendent who in turn notifies the state or federal departments and the quarantine against the yards is cancelled. This cancellation of quarantine is usually accomplished after the government officials have inspected the infected yards. This is not always true, however. The cost to the carriers of performing the service of disinfecting yards varies materially, as to the disease, and as to the size of the yards in which the affected live stock have been placed. As to the cost of disinfecting yards the Union Pacific gave testimony that from </seg>
            <seg id="p492">492 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT investigation it had been found that for "disinfecting the standard two pen yards, labor two hours at 40c or 80c for the total charge. That charge would include, as I understand it, the cleaning and disinfect- The testimony offered on behalf of the North Western Railway company showed that the average cost of sufficient disinfectant for an average yard was $2.08, lime 35c, labor, exclusive of cleaning of the yard $3.16 with 15% added for supervision, making, a total of $8.02. The unit upon which the cost just named was found appears to be bas - ed on the average country stock yard. The testimony as to the dis - infecting of yards, is so involved with the question of cleaning the yards, and cleaning and disinfecting cars, that it is impossible to learn from the record with any degree of definiteness, the actual cost to the carrier of disinfecting stock yards. A witness for the Burlington testified as to the cost of disinfect - ing the stock yards, as follows: "Q. Will you proceed in your own way to state the result of your investigation ? A. Last week I ordered a test case of disinfecting the average stock yards. This test was conducted at Hampton, Nebraska, the yard consisting of seven pens, and the average cost for disinfecting this yard was $1.92 per pen, divided as follows: Labor, $8.26; material including the disinfectant and lime less freight charges and handling $4.50; freight and handling 68c; the total $13.44. Q. Were those standard size pens? A. They are practically so. They are the 48 by 48 'pens with one partition making two 24 by 24 pens. Q. That included the chute and alley? A. Yes, this labor was performed by our regular track gang-sec - tion men." The same witness testified that the total cost of disinfecting a four Eyard at Rosalie, Nebraska in August, (year not given) was $14.22. witness stated that the same consisted of about a four pen yard ing the cost "over $3.00 a pen." kThe tabulation introduced by Mr. Lyman, general superintendent le Burlington, shows that the cost of disinfecting stock yards on Lincoln division during the year 1924 for small stations, was as ws: Station Labor Cost of Total Number Average Cost Disin- Cost Pens Cost per fectant in yard pen Ericson $ 1.23 $ 8.00 $ 9.23 4 $ 2.31 </seg>
            <seg id="p493">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 493 Mapps 3.59 .50 4.09 2 Hord Siding 14.82 4.00 18.82 2 9.41 Arcadia 7.41 5.00 12.41 8 1.55 Hampton 8.26 Total for above 5.18 13.44 9 mentioned points $38.67 $23.68 $62.35 28 $2.23 The cost for disinfecting the yards at larger stations was as fol - lows: From the above tabulation it will be noted that there is a material variation in the cost per pen ranging from $1.11 at Aurora to $9.41 at Hord Siding. The above costs are expended for the purpose of dis - infecting the yard but do not include the cost of cleaning preparatory to disinfecting. Mr. Lyman testified that the cost as found by him included the disinfecting of alley ways and chutes. Live stock rates do not include the expense of disinfecting yards where they have been contaminated on account of contagious disease. It seems clear to us that the cost of disinfecting such yards should be borne by the shipper causing the expense. Representatives of the Farm Bureau Federation and the Live - stock exchange of South Omaha protested vigorously to the present "cost plus plan" and it appears to us that their protest has merit. The question of adding to the charge for material and labor, an amount to represent overhead expenses such as transportation of disinfecting Kerial, superintendence, accounting, and similar charges is too in - nite. The charge should be uniform and based on a method of assessing the charge that leaves no chance for discrimination between shippers that have to have this service performed. On the next preceding page the tabulation shows that the cost per pen at Hord Siding and at Hastings is, for some reason unexplain - ed in the record, abnormal. If the experience of the Burlington as shown by the tabulation is totaled, excluding Hord Siding and Hastings, the average cost per pen is $1.45. The testimony of the Burlington's Eiess appears to be the most , reliable and will be accepted by us as ly representative of the experience of other carriers operating in state. LFrom the record, we find that the unit for assessing the charge lisinf ecting yards . should be on a per pen. basis, and that where tation .urora tastings lurnham o. of pens 32 27 53 lost per pei $1.11 3.12 1.53 Total 112 $1.79 </seg>
            <seg id="p494">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 494 only one pen has to be disinfected the charge will cover the disinfect - ing of alleys and chutes. We further find from the record that a reasonable charge for the services of disinfecting stock yards in this state is $1.50 per pen, same to be assessed against the shipper of the stock that causes the quarantine to be placed on the yard. SECOND, in Application 5597 the Union Pacific asked for author - ity to add the following paragraph to its tariff 3000-D. This applica - tion was consolidated with the Classification investigation. The para - graph mentioned in the application here discussed reads as follows: "Articles subject to ratings in Current Classification ex- ceptions, different from those in the Current Classification proper, will be subject to the minimum rate as shown above for the class in which the article is classified in the current Classification proper." k Other carriers operating in the state have published tariff provi - s substantially the same as that quoted above. These publications : mentioned have not been authorized by the Commission. Since the hearing in this case, the Nebraska lines have made ap - plication to the Commission to give further consideration to the ques - tion considered in this section of these findings. This application will be granted and the matter will not be disposed of at this time. THIRD AND FOURTH. Item 3 of the resolution has to do with the question of bedding charges to be assessed on carload shipments of live stock. The rules in effect on Nebraska intrastate traffic are not uniform as to all carriers and the rule governing shipments made to primary markets is different from that made to stations other than market points. Rule No. 2350 of Western Trunk Line Rules Circular 17-E, which applies on the North Western between points other than to markets, reads as follows: "Bedding Cnarges for Live Stock. (See Exception) Bed - ding for cars to be loaded with Live Stock will be furnished and placed in the cars without charge. When furnished by the snipper at his own expense an allowance of 25 cents per car, either single or double deck, will be made from the freight charges way-bills to bear notation in each case certi - fied to by the forwarding agent: '25 cents deducted from freight charges account bedding furnished by shipper." Note — No allowance will be made for bedding furnished by the shipper at feeding point for Live Stock moving under feeding in transit rates. Exception — The provisions of this rule are applicable only on Kansas, Nebraska (except as provided in Rule No. 120) or South Dakota intrastate traffic and only on traffic handled in connection with lines shown in Rule No. 31. For rules to apply in connection with other lines, parties hereto, see Rule No. 2355." </seg>
            <seg id="p495">495 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The rule in effect on the Burlington from stations on its lines to Omaha as provided in Item 335, C. B. &amp; Q. G. F. O. 3652-L reads as follows: (a) Cars to be loaded with Live Stock, in carloads, must be provided with suitable bedding. (b) When the shipper furnishes the material and performs the service, no charge will be made. (c) When the material is furnished and the service is per - formed by the carrier, the charge shall be $1.00 per single deck car, or $1.50 per double deck car. (d) When Live Stock is transferred en route for carrier's convenience, bedding will be furnished by carrier without charge. (e) When Live Stock is stopped for feed, water and rest and cars rebedded, and the Live Stock moves out in same cars in which received, the cost of such rebedding shall be borne by the shipper. (f) When Live Stock is reconsigned or given market privi - lege and a newly-bedded car is furnished by carrier, charges will be in accordance with paragraph "c". (g) Charges for bedding when not paid by shipper must be entered on Live Stock contract and way-billed as "Beddine Charges." (h) When the shipper performs the service he must also furnish the material. (i) The material will not be furnished by the carrier unless the carrier performs the service." The above quoted rule is substantially the same on all Nebraska lines on shipments to markets. The rules specifically provide that all carload shipments of live stock "must be provided with suitable bedding". The general practice of the carriers operating in this state is to remove the old bedding from the cars at the primary markets, when it has been determined by the inspector, that the car is in such a condition that the old bed - ding should be removed and new bedding placed in the car. Under some conditions and at certain periods in the year live stock cars will make a number of trips to the market without any change in the bed - ding. Other times in the year the removal of the old bedding becomes, more frequent. It is manifestly unfair to charge a shipper for the bedding of &amp; live stock car, when that car has not been rebedded. The car may be offered to the shipper after it has carried live stock to the market </seg>
            <seg id="p496">496 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT hand, it appears clear to us that if a shipper is not satisfied with the bedding furnished by the carrier in a car offered for shipment, and the carrier is required to furnish material and have its section men plare the same in the car, there should be a charge for that service. At most country stations, the carriers maintain a pile of sand, which is used for bedding live stock cars where the same is required at the country station. The present rules provide that when the ship - per furnishes the material and performs the service of bedding cars, no charge will be made, and further, when the shipper performs the service and does not furnish the material the charge will be made the same as if performed by the carrier. This part of the rule does not appear to us to be fair. After careful consideration of the record in this case we are of the opinion and so find that the tariffs of the carriers should be amend - ed to read that when the material is furnished and the labor of rebed - ding the car is actually performed by the carrier the charge should be $1.00 per single deck car and $1.50 per double deck car. Where die shipper performs the service and the carrier furnishes the material no charge should be made for rebedding. FIFTH. This item in the resolution has to do with the charges as - sessed by the carrier for cleaning and disinfecting live stock cars on account of the cars having become contaminated by stock found to be diseased by government inspectors. Rule 2425-A of Western Tr.ink Line Rules Circular 17-E applies on shipments to the so-called thirteen jobbing cities, this rule provides in substance that when cars have to be cleaned and disinfected on account of orders of federal, state, county or municipal regulations, the charges for performing the service will be us f ollo^vp * Each single deck per car $2.50 Each double deck per car $4.00 The rule also provides that where cleaning and disinfecting is perform - ed by others than the carrier, the charges will be $2.50 per single deck car and $4.00 per double deck car the amount to be paid to the person or persons performing the service. The transportation charges remain the same in all instances. Considerable testimony was offered by the carriers on the ques - tion here discussed but most of it is quite indefinite as to the actual cost of the carriers of performing the service of cleaning and disin - fecting cars upon which an embargo has been placed by reason of be - ing exposed to a contagious disease. • </seg>
            <seg id="p497">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 497 Representatives on behalf of the North Western showed how livj stock cars were hauled some distance from their South Omaha' yards to be cleaned, and stated that in some cases the cars had to be returned empty to South Omaha for disinfecting purposes after they had been sent to the country for loading on account of their not being notified that the car had to be disinfected before it left South Omaha for the country. A witness for the Burlington gave the following testimony as to the question of cleaning and disinfecting of cars: Q. Have you any data regarding the cleaning and disinfecting of cars that you would like to put in this record? A. At South Omaha in the month of April we had a total of 2,238 cars into the South Omaha market and of this total 21 of the cars we were required to clean, wash and disinfect on orders from the government inspector at the yards. Q. Clean, wash and disinfect? A. Clean, wash and disinfect, yes sir. These cars as they are, unloaded are tagged by the inspector. In addition to tagging the car he calls the yard office advising them of the number of the car or certain cars that bear this tag and are to be handled. These cars go to our cleaning track known as the "upper yard track" in the South Omaha yard and are cleaned along with the other cars which require cleaning. This work is handled by contract but this particular car bear - ing the tag is given a more thorough cleaning than the aver - age car receives. It is necessary to wash the car after it is cleaned and we call for the inspector The inspector is pres - ent during this operation of spraying and disinfecting the cars.. The car then moves out in the regular channel. BY COMMISSIONER TAYLOR: Q. I understood you to say that the inspector tagged the car at the time it was unloaded. A. Shortly after. He must tag it sometime because it is tagged before it gets back to us on the transfer. Q. Then there is no delay so far as you are concerned in the in - spection of that car? A. No there is not. We are rather fortunately situated at South Omaha. Our cleaning track and train yard is less than one mile from the transfer leading to the Union Stock Yards." tThe same witness gave testimony that the contract price for ing and disinfecting in the summer months is $1.40 for a single $1.90 for a single deck in the winter months, and that the ccn - price for cleaning alone is 75 cents per car. The record shows </seg>
            <seg id="p498">498 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT that where a car gets away from the South Omaha yards before it is disinfected and has to be hauled back to points where the disinfecting process may be applied, the cost to the carrier is greater than that named by the witness for the Burlington at South Omaha. The charge for disinfecting cars in interstate traffic, and between Nebraska stations and the thirteen jobbing points is now $2.50 and $4-00 for single and double deck cars respectively. We can find no good reason from this record why there should not be a charge for dis - infecting live stock cars that are moved between stations in Nebraska other than to the jobbing cities. It, therefore, follows that from this record we find that the charges as provided in Item 2425-A should be applied on all Nebraska intrastate traffic.

OPINION AND FINDING BROWNE, Chairman This matter came on for consideration on motion of the Commis - sion because of a statutory provision carried in Chapter 166, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1923. The statute of 1913 provided that for intrastate shipments of live stock, the minimum transportation for drovers in charge of such stock should be one round trip free pass for one carload, which same pro - vision extended to not more than six carloads. During the period of federal control, in appropriate proceedings brought by the Live Stock Exchange of St. Joseph, Missouri, this statutory provision was rendered invalid. The legislature in 1923 corrected the situation by amending Sec - tion 5417 of the statutes of Nebraska for 1922, providing the follow- </seg>
            <seg id="p502">502 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT "Charge f«r transporting one car of live stock shall include transportation from point of origin to destination of one care - taker or attendant accompanying such live stock; for trans- two to five cars in the same train, shall include trans- portation for one caretaker or attendant accompanying such live stock from point of origin to destination and return trans - portation within a reasonable time; for transporting more than five cars in one train, such additional attendants as may be required by the State Railway Commission." Hence, the legislation has fixed the rule governing the transpor - tation of caretakers for not more than five cars in the same train. When the former legislative rule was rendered invalid, there was sub - stituted for that rule the interstate rule which remained in effect until the legislature passed chapter 166 of the session laws of 1923. As to the transportation of more cars than five, pending action by this Com - mission, the interstate rule put into effect at the time of the decision on the complaint of the St. Joseph Live Stock Exchange, continued effec - tive. As to more than five cars from one shipper in one train, the inter - state rule now being used in Nebraska on intrastate shipments, reads as I U HOWS ■ "When from two to ten cars of live stock are shipped to the same destination by the same owner at one time, trans - portation to destination and return will be granted to the •wner of the stock or his bona fide employee, who shall ac - company said stock as attendant or caretaker. On a shipment of more than ten cars of stock at one time by the same owner, to the same destination, transpor - tation to destination and return will be granted as specified below; with eleven to twenty cars, two attendants; with twen - ty-one to thirty cars, three attendants; with thirty-one to for - ty cars, four attendants; with forty-one to fifty cars, five at - tendants." tNo complaint has ever been filed with the Commission relative the adequacy of this rule as it pertains to shipments of more than ! cars from one owner to one destination in one train. At the time of the hearing shippers were represented by C. B. Steward, secretary of the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation. He was the only one who rd speak directly for shippers. Mr. Steward was of the opinion that rule last quoted might well be kept in effect as supplementing the statutory provision. In the absence of any evidence before us that this rule provides for transportation of an inadequate number of attendants, the Com - mission will approve the interstate rule as applicable to Nebraska with - out prejudice to the question being raised at any time by those whose direct experience in caring for stock in transit and who may find that </seg>

H. Wilson and A; L. Tidd, attorneys. For the Commission — B. E. Forbes, chief engineer; I. J. Devoe, accountant. OPINION AND FINDING BY THE COMMISSION: This is an application for an appraisal of a highway bridge con- structed over the Platte River, which is the dividing line between Sarpy and Cass Counties, located about three miles northwest of Plattsmouth, Nebraska. The bridge will be purchased by Sarpy and Cass Counties, with state aid. A hearing was held in the offices of the Commission March 2, 1926. The King of Trails Bridge company constructed the bridge in the year 1925. The plans and preliminary estimates were supplied by the state. It was constructed under contract after competitive bids had been received. The contract price was less than the estimate. The plan called for a concrete-steel structure over the main chan- nel of the river which consisted of twelve — one hundred foot spans with graveled roadway approaches at the ends. By agreement the plan was changed to twenty-four fifty foot spans. This reduced the bid price. Four additional spans were placed during construction.

The ac - countant used 6 per cent from the time the funds were received in Plattsmouth, to the beginning of operation, with the result that he found only $1,580.36 for this expense. The Commission does not take issue with the rate used ; n the statement but the time extends End the construction -period. The construction period used by the untant is likewise too short as construction continued after the rture was open to traffic. The Commission will use $3,000. The cost of right of way and borrow-pits was challenged in the testimony. The bridge stands on a north and south line. The high - way approaches the south end of the structure from the east and along the bank of the river. The approach makes a sharp turn to the north to connect with the bridge. The natural ground level here is some eight or ten feet below the bridge floor and a long easy approach was necessary. It was necessary to find the dirt for the embank - ment and keep a safe distance from the river. About 12 acres was purchased for this purpose. The Commission finds that the land is reasonably required in connection with the project. State Engineer Cochran and the Commission's engineer approved the costs as set forth. The Commission believes and so finds that the value of the bridge that the King of Trails Bridge company proposes to sell and the Coun - ties of Sarpy and Case propose to buy with state aid, which is located on the Platte River about three miles northwest of Plattsmouth, is $120,974.30.

Agreeable, likewise, to your request, we submit herewith our con - clusions and recommendations. These will be stated in more or less general terms, with only such references to the record as appears necessary for clarity. STATEMENT The so-called Chalco- Yutan cut-off is the base of a railroad tri - angle, the apex of which is at Ashland on the south, the westward side being formed by a portion of the Burlington line from Ashland to Fremont, and the southeastern side by a portion of the line from Ashland to Omaha. The line was constructed for the purpose of short - ening the distance from Sioux City to Omaha, and was the result of a promise made by the Burlington management to the Omaha business interests. The expectation that the cut-off would stimulate a consider - able amount of through traffic between Omaha and the northeastern part of Nebraska, was never realized. The cut-off traverses a rather sparsely settled section. It crosses the Platte and the Elkhorn rivers in the first four miles east of Yutan, and this land is broken and sandy. The remainder of the land runs </seg>
            <seg id="p510">510 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT Iough a rolling country, only a portion of which is suitable for "icultural purposes. Besides the two lines of railroad on either side the triangle, the main line of the Union Pacific runs along the north 1 constitutes the base of a still larger triangle, so that no point in entire area is a greater distance from a railroad station than five es. The line, although completed in 1917, has been operated for y eight months — May, 1923 to January, 1924. Miners of sand and ivel operate pits at the western end of the line, and these are served trains operating between Fremont and Ashland. A siding called Allis miles east of Yutan, is the only station. The application asked for authority to abandon 8.08 miles of the line extending west from Chalco Junction. At the time of hearing, permission was asked to amend the application so as to cover aban - donment of only seven miles. Thus an additional 1.08 miles would remain, leaving track from Yutan to a point just east of Allis. Amendment of the petition practically satisfied the objections of one of the protestants, Herbert B. Waldron, individually, and as presi - dent of the Independent Sand &amp; Gravel Company. The additional mile of track will permit service to his sand pits. He still contends for a continuance of the present rate status. The record is conclusive to the effect that the only traffic of consequence that has been developed, is the movement of sand and gravel originating at the western end of the line. Protestants contend that if the line had been operated continuously since its completion, and facilities for loading and billing had been provided, a substantial tonnage of agricultural products would have been handled. It is signi - ficant, however, that during the eight months' period when service was furnished, the movement of these commodities was negligible. Only twelve tons of L. C. L. freight have been handled during the years 1921 up to and including six months of the year 1926. Better station P might have encouraged further shipments, although the close of other railroads makes that improbable. Farmers living ;ly adjacent to Allis object to the abandonment of any of the the other hand, the farmers in the territory adjacent to the nd of the line, are favorable to abandonment. The territory n is traversed by several excellent highways, two or three of graveled and partly paved, so that the bulk of farm produce to Omaha by truck. This further limits the possibilities of ic development. In the absence of through traffic for which ras primarily built, the circumstances are such that applicant y hope that the line would ever be self sustaining, nor does </seg>
            <seg id="p511">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 511 The Omaha Chamber of Commerce has consented to the proposed abandonment upon the assurance from the management of the com - pany that there will be no "increase in freight rates or passenger fares by reason of lengthening the distance between Omaha and points north". This understanding is concurred in by the Omaha Grain Ex - change and the Omaha Live Stock Exchange. Applicant has made plain that in so far as it can control the situation, there will be no change in the method of making rates by reason of the abandonment. It is recognized that such an arrangement is subject at all times to ac - tion by regulatory authority and can amount to nothing more than a gentleman's agreement. This phase of the case was discussed at length by witnesses, but General Manager Flynn for applicant, and General Freight Agent Montmorency, stated definitely and emphatically that it is the purpose of the company to carry out such an agreement. Mr. Montmorency testified that in his opinion it could be accomplished by a continuation of the publication of the present table of distances, so that any subsequent change of rates affecting the territory from Omaha and points north and northwest, would be figured as though the cut-off were still in existence. This assumption is further fortified by the fact that in the table of distances promulgated by the Nebraska Enmission in General Order No. 19, and applicable to class rates, the off is used to determine the shortest route. This table of distances not be changed without action by this Commission. The rates to and from the majority of the points in the territory in northeast Ne - braska, are controlled by competition of other lines having the short haul. The distance from Omaha of the sand pits on the cut-off, is less than thirty miles. Under the present sand rate adjustment, these pits are in a so-called 50-mile zone, within which the rate to Omaha and Lincoln is 3 cents. Hence the proposed abandonment will not affect this situation. In event the zone is ever abandoned and the rates changed to a distance basis, the plan proposed by Mr. Montmor - ency would insure to the existing pits on the cut-off, the advantage of their present geographical location. Protestants urge that if abandonment is permitted, joint inter - state sand rates into western Iowa will be made only on the basis of actual railroad mileage, and that the result will be to greatly increase the distance from the pits on the cut-off. However, if as above indi - cated, the present table of distances is maintained, the existing situ - ation would be automatically continued and the apprehension thus expressed would not be realized. Passenger fares are made by applicant over the route of actual service. It follows, therefore, that none of the passenger fares from Omaha north, are computed by way of the cut-off, since no passenger </seg>
            <seg id="p512">512 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT The original cost of the entire line, Chalco Junction to Yutan, was $951,663.00. It is estimated by applicant's engineer, that a net salvage of $48,310.00 would be realized if abandonment is permitted. The construction at the western end of the line, due to an expensive bridge across the Platte River, constituted a major portion of the cost of the line, and the proposed retention of this section of the road explains in a measure the small amount of salvage that will be realized. It is contended by applicant, however, that it would sustain a substantial annual loss if it were required to operate the line con - tinuously, and that the existing traffic can be handled practically as well under the plan proposed. Protestants dispute this claim and in - sist that adequate service cannot be maintained via Ashland. Our conclusion on this point is that sand and gravel are commodities that do not require expeditious handling, but that even if prompt move - ment is necessary, deliveries received in the afternoon at Allis could be delivered the following day in Omaha. Such service should be adequate for the needs of sand shippers. Because of heavy grades between Ashland and Omaha via the Chalco main line, applicant does not attempt to handle its heavy freight trains over this line, but routes them via Oreapolis, which, while somewhat roundabout provides a water grade. This is given as an added reason by applicant for not desiring to route the heavy sand tonnage eastbound from the cut-oT. CONCLUSIONS The line in controversy was originally constructed at a cost of close to $1,000,000.00. Applicant admits, and it is not denied in the record, that it was built to discharge a promise made at one time to Omaha business interests. It is now admitted by applicant that the construction of .the line was injudicious and unwise. If the line could have been operated at a profit from any standpoint, either as a utility for handling local traffic, as a bridge for a' substantial volume of through traffic, or as a feeder to the system as a whole, the judgment of the management would have prompted its operation. The record shows, however, that the management preferred to let an investment of approximately $1,000,000.00 stand idle for a period of over eight years. The judgment of a carrier as to whether any particular piece of railroad property should be operated, is not necessarily controlling, where the public interest is involved, but with as much at stake as applicant has had in this instance, the presumption of wisdom must be with the decision of the carrier. The general situation as it is presented by this record, supports the conclusion of applicant that there is not now, nor is there promise of being in the future, traffic sufficient to warrant the operation of the line. The only tonnasre of any consequence is provided by the sand </seg>
            <seg id="p513">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 513 and gravel industries at the western end of the line. These are as - sured of service in the future as it is now being rendered. The re - mainder of the territory is so well provided with railroad facilities that no portion of the public will be seriously inconvenienced or dis - advantaged if the rails are taken up. It follows, therefore, that it is our opinion that no public necessity or convenience require the further maintenance of this railroad, and we therefore respectfully recommend that the application for abandonment, as amended, be approved.

Attorney General's Opinions Lincoln, January 19, 1926. Mr. John E. Curtiss Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Office. Dear Sir: The State Railway Commission has submitted the following matter and asked my opinion thereon: An application, treated as formal, was filed with the Commission asking for a connection between the track of the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company and the track of the Chicago and North </seg>
            <seg id="p517">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 517 Western Railway company at a point southeast of Schuyler, near Ed - holm in Butler county, Nebraska. A hearing was held and the appli - cation was denied by the Commission upon the grounds that the pro - posed connection was not reasonably necessary, that the expense of such connection would not be warranted by the business that would move over it and that it would be of small public benefit. The applicants now desire to proceed under Chapter 161 Laws 1923 (pages 389-90) and ask that they be directed as to the proper steps to take. Section 1 of that chapter reads as follows: "All railroad companies in this state at all points of connec - nection, intersection, or crossing at grade of different railroads where it is practicable, shall provide reasonable, ample and equal facilities by track connection, passenger platforms and otherwise, for transferring cars, passengers and property between their re - spective roads without unreasonable delay; and at any place where the tracks of the two railroad companies are within five hundred feet apart, whether on the same grade or not, where it is practi - cable and deemed reasonably necessary, the State Railway Com - mission, upon the application of any interested person, may re - quire such track connection. All such railroad companies shall not discriminate in their rates or charges between such connect - ing lines or on freight coming over them; but no such company shall be required to furnish, to another railroad company its tracks, equipment, or terminal facilities without reasonable com - pensation. Each of the connecting lines shall pay its proportion - ate share for the building and maintenance of such track and switches as may be necessary to furnish the transfer facilities re - quired by this and the next following section, and in case they cannot agree on the amount which each line shall pay then said amount shall upon application by either party, be determined and adjusted by the State Railway Commission. Provided, how - ever, that in all cases where the Railway Commission has refused to require track connection as required by the applicant in such case where the applicant agrees in writing to pay the cost of mak - ing such track connection, and costs of maintenance of same, and offers adequate security therefor, then in that case said Railway Commission shall order such track connection to be made by said railroad companies whether said Railway Commission deems such track connection practicable or reasonably necessary, or not, and provided further that said railroad tracks, at the point where such connection is to be made, run within one mile of the corporate limits of any city or village." Two objections appear to further action by the applicants: t First — The Commission found that Nimburg, a "blind" station le Burlington railroad, is .85 of a mile from the railroad crossing, Edholm is 4.75 miles distant and that each of the other towns ioned is more than two miles from the proposed track connection. </seg>
            <seg id="p518">518 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT It is not found by the Commission whether or not Nimburg is incor - porated. The 1920 census shows it then had a population of twenty - three. It is probable that it has not yet sufficient population to be in - corporated as required by Compiled Statutes 1922, Section 4228. A population of one hundred is necessary for incorporation. Even if it has the population it does not appear that the necessary legal steps have been taken for incorporation. Unless the proposed track connec - tion is within one mile of the corporate limits of a city or village Hie applicants cannot secure it in the absence of approval by the Com - mission. Second — The Commission has found, and the evidence seems ample to sustain the finding, that the proposed track connection is un - necessary. Where the evidence clearly shows that there is no need of the proposed connecting track, it is beyond the power of the legislature to require the companies to construct it simply because someone wishes it and is willing to pay for it. It is well-known that switches located so that they cannot be watched are sources of danger in the operation of railroads. Disastrous accidents often result from their being tam - pered with by unauthorized persons. A railroad company thus may have substantial ground for refusing to install such a connection. It may not be subjected unnecessarily to added liability and loss. tit is realized that ordinarily the Commission will not question the titutionality of a statute. That is a safe rule to follow and de - on from it should not occur except under extraordinary circum - es. The present instance falls under such exception. The Com - mission should not order a track connection where to do so would de - prive the companies of their property without compensation and with - out due process of law. Unless it be shown that Nimburg is incorporated and that there is some real need of the proposed construction so that the companies will not be deprived arbitrarily of their property, the Commission should take no further action.

            <seg id="p519">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 519 Lincoln, February 8, 1926. Mr. John Alfs, Secretary, Atkinson and Saratoga Telephone Company, Atkinson, Nebraska. Dear Sir: The State Railway Commission has always regarded the arrange - ment between a switching company and the company switched as one between the two companies and not as one between the subscribers of switched company and the switching company. The quesction that raise has come up many times and the Commission has uniformly held that the company doing the switching may look to the switched fnpany as a whole for its pay. Inasmuch as the subscribers of the tched company are not subscribers of the switching company, it lid be impossible for the switching company to enforce collection case a subscriber should refuse to pay without cutting off others. Section 7091, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amend - ed in 1923, chapter 163, Laws 1923, page 392 provides: "All long distance telephone rates in this state shall be based on air line mileage between points. Of any toll charge at least fifteen per cent shall go to the company where call originated and ten per cent to the company where message terminated, and the balance of such charge shall be divided between the different com - panies over whose lines and through whose stations it passed, pro rata, according to the number of units involved in delivering the message, after taking out a sufficient amount for clearing such message through the office of the State Railway Commission, in case the commission is called upon to make such clearing. Each circuit mile of trunk or toll line shall be taken and considered as a unit, and each switching station where a message is switched through to another company shall be considered as having five units in making the division of toll charges for any message passing through its station. Telephone companies may by mutual consent clear their toll business or have the same done by a clear - ing house agreed upon; but in case of a failure to agree, the company where the messages originate and the company where the messages designate shall report to the Railway Commission each message, stating the origination, destination and exact num - ber of miles of line of each company over which such message was transmitted; and then it shall be the duty of the Commission to divide the amount of the charges for the different messages ac - cording to the provisions herein made and collect and deliver to each company its just share, after taking out a sufficient amount for the actual expense of making such a clearing as herein stated."

            <seg id="p520">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 520 Lincoln, March 19, 1926. Mr. John E. Curtiss, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Office. Dear Sir Mr. J. F. Moredick of the Brotherhood of Railway Trainmen has submitted to Commissioner Randall the following statement: The Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company is oper - ating a train from Ravenna to Seneca in the following manner: The train runs from Ravenna to Merna where it changes crews and usually cabooses. Sometimes the caboose runs clear through. The second crew takes the train from Merna to Seneca. On the return trip the same crew brings the train back from Seneca to Merna where the crew is again changed and the first crew takes it from Merna to Ravenna. The run from Ravenna to Seneca is made on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, from Seneca to Ra - venna, Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday. The distance from Ra - venna to Merna is 57 miles, from Merna to Seneca 73 miles. Neither crew runs as much as 100 miles in one day. The train is operated as a "local extra". The mileage is made on the main line and the train carries passengers and local merchandise and does station switching. The question is whether under the statute two or three brakemen are required. '■ Section 5337, Compiled Statutes, 1922, is as follows: "Freight crew — what necessary. It shall be unlawful for any railroad doing business in Nebraska, to operate or run over its road, or any part thereof, or to suffer or permit to be operated or run over its road, or any part thereof, outside of yard limits any freight train which is not manned with a crew consisting of one engineer, one fireman, one conductor and two brakemen: Pro - vided: main line local freight trains running one hundred miles or more and carrying passengers, local merchandise and doing station switching shall be provided with a crew consisting of one conductor, one engineer, one fireman, and three brakemen." The purpose of the statute as indicated by its title, Laws 1909, page 406, is to provide for the safety of the traveling public and the employees of the railroads. The object of full crew laws generally is to secure train operation by men who are not overworked, and, there - fore, incapacitated for the careful and efficient performance of their duties.

            <seg id="p521">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 521 My opinion is that the safety of the traveling public and of the employees of the railroad is not endangered in any way by the opera - tion of the trains as detailed above and that the company cannot be compelled to put three brakemen on the trains, that two are all the statute requires. Very truly yours, O. S. Spillman, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMasfer, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, March 19, 1926. Mr. C. J. Mach, Ashby, Nebraska. Dear Sir: LYour favor of the 13th addressed to the State Railway Commission been handed to the writer for attention. kThe conditions, as I understand them, are as follows: The Bor - on railroad owns three acres of land on which its stockyards are ed and you have land adjoining the railroad property. Your in - quiry is whether or not the railroad is required to pay all of the coat of the fence on the division line between the three acre tract and your land or only one-half the cost thereof. It is understood that your land does not touch the right of way. Section No. 5396, Compiled Statutes, 1922, relating to fencing by railroads, is as follows: "Every railroad corporation whose lines of road or any part thereof are open for use, and every railroad company formed or to be formed, but whose lines are not now open for use, shall, within six months after the lines of such railroad or any part thereof are open, erect and thereafter maintain fences on the sides of their railroad, or the part thereof so open for use, suit - able and amply sufficient to prevent cattle, horses, sheep and hogs from getting on such railroad, except at the crossings of public roads and highways, and within the limits of towns, cities and villages, with opens, gates or bars at all the farm crossings of such railroads for the use of the proprietors of the land ad - joining such railroad. They shall also construct, where the same has not already been done, and hereafter maintain, at all road crossings now existing or hereafter established, cattle guards suit - able and sufficient to prevent cattle, horses, sheep and hogs from getting onto such railroad. So long as such fences and cattle guards shall not be made after the time hereinbefore prescribed for making the same shall have elapsed, and when such fences and guards, or any part thereof, are not in sufficiently good re- </seg>
            <seg id="p522">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 522 pair to accomplish the objects for which the same as herein prescribed are intended, such railroad corporation and its agents shall be liable for any and all damages which shall be done by the agents, engines or trains of any such corporation, or by the locomotives, engines, or trains of any other corporations permitted and running over or upon their said railroad, to any cattle, horses, sheep or hogs thereon. When such fences and guards have been fully and duly made, and shall be kept in good and sufficient repair, such railroad corporation shall not be liable for any such damages, unless negligently or wilfully done: Provided, however, any person, company, or corporation, owning land ad - joining the right of way of any railroad company in this state, and not within the limits of any town, village or city, and intend - ing to enclose his or their land, or any part thereof that adjoins such right of way or railroad, with a fence, or the secretary of such company or corporation, by direction thereof, may notify in writing such railroad company of such intention and request such railroad company to build a lawful fence as described in this sec - tion on the line between their railroad and the land intended to be enclosed. Such notice shall definitely specify two points on such line between which points such fence is requested to be erected, and describe the field intended to be enclosed. The railroad com - pany shall, within six months after receiving such notice, cause to be erected the fence required by such notice, and in case of a failure so to do, the party so giving notice as aforesaid may cause such fence to be erected at a reasonable cost, and collect the amount thereof from the railroad company so neglecting to erect the fence." The section has been before the supreme court a number of times for consideration but not on the question that you raise. You do not say whether the village of Ashby is incorporated or not. As the last census gave the population as 130, it may not be. If it be an incorporated village and the property lies within the corporate limits, the railroad company is not required to fence. Even though the village may be incorporated if the yards extend outside they are not required to be fenced. This was held in C. B. &amp; Q. v. Hogan, 27 Neb. 801, and G. B. ft Q. v. Hogan, 30 Neb. 686. It has also been held where the railroad has a flag station with platform etc., for public use outside the limits of the city, town or village, it is not bound under the provisions of the statute requiring railroads to be fenced, to fence its road in such a manner as to prevent While these cases do not decide the question exactly, they bear upon it by analogy. The court would probably not construe the statute strictly but would probably hold that so far as the side ad - joining your land is concerned it would be treated as property owned Dy any private land owner. </seg>
            <seg id="p523">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 523 My conclusion is that you cannot compel the railway company to pay more than one-half the cost of the fence. Very truly yours, O. S.

Gentlemen : Your favor of March 31 addressed to the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission has been passed to this department for attention. Your inquiry is whether or not the assessor may legally demand r names of all parties storing grain with you and the amount stored each. The matter is regulated by section 5935, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which reads as follows: "Every owner, keeper or person in actual charge of any and every storage house, warehouse or any place where goods, wares, or merchandise of any and all kinds and description are stored or kept by him, either for himself or for others and whether for a profit or not, shall assist the county assessor or deputy detailed by him to list all such goods, wares and merchandise held, stored or kept by him, either for himself or for others either as own - er, agents consignee or bailee on the first day of April in each year for which the property is required to be listed. He shall give the name and address of every person, firm or corporation from whom the goods were received and of the person or persons, to whom the goods are to be delivered, and if any of such persons, firms or corporations be non-residents of the county, he shall give the names and addresses of the local agents of such non-residents, if there by (be) any. In listing and reporting such goods, wares and merchandise, as above provided, the name, kind, quality and approximate value of each and every kind and grade, so far as can be ascertained, shall be stated opposite the various items.

            <seg id="p525">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 525 Lincoln, April 5, 1926. Son. Thome A. Browne, Chairman, Nebraska State Railway Commission. Dear Sir: The following statement of facts was recently submitted by you: Certain shipments of sand were made over the line of the C. St. P. M. &amp; O. into Omaha in October, 1922, by the National Construction Company. On November 6, 1922, a formal complaint was filed with the State Railway Commission by the Construction company alleging that although the company was in the Omaha switching district, ow - ing to lack of proper tariff provisions, it was not accorded as favor - able treatment as other companies receiving as great service. The Ciyer was for the fixing of a reasonable switching charge with suit - e tariff provisions and for general relief. There was in substance a general denial of this by the carrier. tOn January 15, 1923, the complainant dismissed its complaint, the same time stating that a satisfactory arrangement had been le with the carrier. No hearing was had. On January 16, 1923, the carrier made application to put in force the tariff provisions that had been applied for by the company, which application was approved on January 27, 1923. On January 19, 1926, the Construction company filed a petition asking for reparation on the October 1922, shipments. The carrier objects on the ground that such petition was filed too late. The following question was propounded: Is the claim for reparation barred? My opinion is that the. claim is barred. Section 5500 Compiled Statutes, 1922, is as follows: "Hearing on complaint — order. That if, after hearing on a com - plaint under Sections 6126, 6127, 6128, 6129 or sections 6137, 6138, 6139, 6140, revised statutes of Nebraska for 1913 (5485 - 5488, 5496-5499), the Nebraska State Railway Commission shall determine that any party complainant has on and after the taking effect of this Act and within two years next preceding the filing of the said complaint paid unjust or unreasonable rates or charges to any defendant railroad or express company in this state on intra - state traffic or has on and after the taking effect of this act and within two years next preceding the filing of the said complaint suffered damages by reason of the maintaining, publishing, de - manding, charging, receiving or retaining by such carrier of any rate or rates, charges, rules, regulations, services or practices on </seg>
            <seg id="p526">526 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT intrastate traffic which are found by the Commission to be un - just, unreasonable, unjustly discriminatory, unduly preferential or otherwise unlawful, the Commission shall make an order di - recting the railroad or express company to pay to the complain - ant the sum to which he is entitled on or before a day named." kThe original complaint was filed November 6, 1922, and dismissed uary 15, 1923. The matter was apparently adjusted between the ties and no hearing was ever had on the complaint. There seems, therefore, to be no foundation for an order of reparation. The charges were all paid more than two years, in fact more than three years, before the filing of the complaint. For more than three years, viz., from January 15, 1923, to January 19, 1926, there was nothing pending before the Commission in reference to the claim. Because the present petition lacks foundation and because it was filed too late, the claim being barred, it should be dismissed. Very truly yours, O. S. Spillman, Attorney General. By Hugh T,a Master, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, July 20, 1926. Hon. H. G. Taylor, State Railway Commission, Office. Dear Sir: I have examined the matter submitted by you verbally with re - gard to the proposed modification of the order in Formal Complaint No. 540. kAs I gather it from the pleadings and proceedings, the essential are as follows: The complainant, the County of Douglas, asked ration from the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company and the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway company. The reparation was allowed against the latter company amounting to £83.52. The order was entered by the Commission on January 6, 26. On February 15, 1926, the defendant, the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway company paid the amount of said claim in full. Interest was not prayed for in the original formal com- On March 17, 1926, the complainant filed a petition asking the Commission to grant a modification of the order entered on January 6, 1926, to the extent of awarding interest on the amount of repara- </seg>
            <seg id="p527">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 527 tion allowed. No showing was made of any facts or circumstances in excuse of the failure to pray for interest in the original pleading. The defendant company has answered stating that it fully paid and satis - fled the amount allowed by the Commission for reparation on the un - derstanding and belief that it was the final order and finally disposed of the matter. The Commission should not grant modification of the reparation order. I Under the provision of section 92 of the code where the plaintiff an action does not pray for interest none can be recovered. Higgins Case Threshing Machine Co. 95 Neb. 3, City of So. Omaha v. Ruth - i 71 Neb. 545. While under the Nebraska statute the right of amendment of pleadings is very broad, no case has been found permitting amendment after satisfaction of judgment. In O'Brien company v. Omaha Water company, 83 Neb. 71 the court said: (79) "The plaintiff did not in its petition demand interest upon the amount of the value of the damaged goods from the date of such damage to the time of the trial; but, after the coming in of the verdict, the plaintiff filed an application for leave to amend its petition to demand the same, and for an order of the court adding to the verdict interest from the date of the loss to the date of the verdict This application was denied. There is nothing in the record to show what, if any, excuse was given to the court for the plaintiff's delay in making this amendment, and, in the absence of such showing, we cannot say that the court abused its discretion in refusing the plaintiff permission to make such amendment. If the amendment had been permitted, the right of the court to add interest to the amount of the verdict would have been doubtful. The only case in point we have been able to find is that of Hallum v. Dickinson, 47 Ark. 120, 14 S. W. 477, which holds that a court cannot add interest to a verdict." If it is not permissible for a plaintiff to amend after verdict but Pore final judgment, it certainly would be improper to allow an sndment after final determination and full satisfaction. It would effect be a splitting of a cause of action. In Formal Complaint No. 543 Sunderland Bros. Co., complainant, v. C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. and C. ft N. W. Ry. Co., defendants, the con - siderations above stated apply. In the last mentioned case more than two years have elapsed since the claim accrued. It is now too late to take further action.

            <seg id="p528">NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT 528 Lincoln, September 7, 1926. Mr. Geo. M. Kloidy, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir »I have taken time to examine carefully the questions asked by i sometime since, the answers to which were delayed by the work the railroad tax cases. tThe first question does not appear to have been before the courts, d no direct reference to our statute or to any similar statute in other state. The questions will now be taken up in their order. "1. What portion of a rural highway may a telephone company occupy with its poles and fixtures under Section 7097 of the Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska, for 1922?" tThe statute gives only the minimum distance from the margin of road; it says "at least six feet within the boundary line" of the . Poles must not be set so as to interfere with the working of road as provided by Section 3639, Compiled Statutes, 1922. There is inconsistency between Section 7097 and Section '2780 which authorizes land owners whose lands adjoin highways to plant shade trees "one-tenth of the legal width of the road from its margin". When a road has the usual width of sixty-six feet, the land owner may thus occupy 6.6 feet thereof. It does not appear that Section 3639, the later act, was intended to repeal Section 2780 so that where the land owner has actually occupied the ground it seems that the poles should be set far enough within the boundary line not to interfere with his occupancy. "'.■••• The only direct answer that can be given to the question seems to be that the poles should be set outside of the portion of the highway actually used for travel and at least six feet within the boundary line. "2. In case a telephone company has properly occupied a high - way under the above mentioned statute, may the Department of Public Works or any governmental sub-division of the state com - pel it to move its structures to a new location upon the highway without reimbursing it for the expense incurred in so doing?" The proper governmental authorities have the right, when public necessity or convenience so demands, to require a telephone company to move its line. City of Plattsmouth v. Nebraska Telephone Company, 80 Neb. 460; Owensboro v Cumberland Tel. &amp; Teleg. Co., 230 U. S. 581, 57 L. ed. 1889. </seg>
            <seg id="p529">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 529 In such an instance, being an exercise of the police power, there is no reimbursement of the company for the expense incurred. C. B. ft Q. Ry. v. 111., 200 U. S. 561, 50 L. ed. 596. A telephone company having constructed a line on a highway by virtue of Section 7097 is more than a mere licensee, there is a con - tractual relation between the public and the company which cannot be arbitrarily disregarded. There must be reasonable ground for re - quiring the line to be moved. City of Plattsmouth vs. Nebraska Tel. Co. supra, Owensboro v. Cumberland, supra. The company is entitled to reasonable notice to move its line. »Of course there is a presumption of law in favor of the exercise the police power by public authorities and ordinarily a court would not interfere unless the arbitrary character of the action of the public officers clearly appeared. "3. Can the Department of Public Works or any governmental sub-division of the state compel a telephone company to so place its structures upon a rural highway as to create a trespass upon the property of abutting owners by way of cross-arm overhand or otherwise?" A telephone company cannot be compelled to place a line so that it will trespass upon the land of adjoining owners, but that restriction does not prevent the public authorities from using the whole road if necessary for public travel. Very truly yours, O. S. Spillman, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, September 8, 1926. Nye &amp; Jenks Grain Company, 320 Grain Exchange Buildin" Omaha, Nebraska. Gentlemen: Your favor of August 27 was handed to the writer for attention. The first question is: At whose option is grain stored in a pub - lic warehouse deliverable at a terminal market? kThe form of receipt is somewhat ambiguous. The matter is, of le, governed by the terms of the statute. Section 7229, Compiled ites of Nebraska for 1922, provides in part as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p530">530 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT "In case terminal delivery of grain is demanded, the ware- houseman shall forthwith issue and deliver to the owner or his order a surrender receipt, which shall conform to the receipt is - sued for the grain under section 5 of this act (7229) making such grain deliverable in its net amount at any terminal market in the state designated by the owner of said receipt on the same line of railroad." rer the section quoted, the owner of the grain has the option and the warehouseman. The second question is: Would the modification of the receipt be legal if it be stamped or written upon the receipt that the grain will be delivered either at the warehouse to which the grain was hauled or at, say, Omaha or Kansas City, at the option of the elevator operator who was storing the grain for the owner? It is the opinion of this department that such an attempted modi - fication would be without legal effect. The statute provides for the delivery of the grain and an agreement contrary thereto would not be valid. Very truly yours, O. S. Spillman, Attorney General By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, October 1, 1926. Mr. Leonard D. Densmore, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Office. Dear Sir I have examined the file, submitted by you, with reference to the handling of grain by the Farmers Cooperative Grain company of David It appears that the company received grain on August 25-28, which was loaded into can on August 26-28 and shipped in the name of the Farmers Cooperative Grain company to the Omaha Elevator Company which stored the grain in its elevator at Council Bluffs, Iowa. The Farmers Cooperative Grain company is a cooperative concern and the grain in question belongs to non-members. When the grain ar - rived at Council Bluffs, it was credited to the Farmers Cooperative Grain company and a negotiable warehouse receipt, in the form of a letter, was issued therefor to the Farmers Cooperative Grain company. Certificates were given by the Farmers Cooperative Grain company to the owners of the grain stating that the grain was stored in the Omaha </seg>
            <seg id="p531">531 NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION Elevator company's warehouse at Council Bluffs and reciting that the grain was the property of the persons, respectively, who had delivered it, that it was shipped through the Farmers Cooperative Grain com - pany for storage by the Omaha Elevator Company. As the Farmers Cooperative Grain company received the grain not later than August 28 and the receipt issued by the Omaha Elevator company was dated September 10, the grain was under the control of the Farmers Cooperative Grain company for a longer period than ten days. Further, the receipt issued by the Omaha Elevator company requires that such receipt shall be returned when the grain is demanded. As several persons appear to be interested in the grain and only one warehouse receipt issued and such receipt does not appear to have been delivered to any of the owners of the grain, the grain is yet under the control of the Farmers Cooperative Grain company. Under the circumstances detailed above, I am of the opinion that the transaction is contrary to the grain warehouse law and that if the Farmers Cooperative Grain company desires to pursue this practice it will have to give bond. If the company wishes to ship grain for non-members, the cars should be billed in the name of the respective owners of the grain and a separate warehouse receipt should be issued directly by the Omaha Elevator company to each owner of grain. Very truly yours, O. S. Spillman, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, October 30, 1926. Mr. Leonard D. Densmore, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Office. Dear Sir: Your letter of the 28th relating to a flashlight signal installed upon a highway near Jansen at hand. It appears that a flashlight signal has been installed about eight feet from the track of the Chicago, Rock Island ft Pacific Railway company and near the center of United States highway No. 3, crossing the railroad track a mile east of Jansen, that when the highway pro - ject was approved by the U. S. government engineers it was provided in the contract that this signal should be removed. A number of pe- </seg>
            <seg id="p532">532 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT titions have been presented to the State Railway Commission asking that the signal be allowed to remain where it is and stating that it is a great protection to those using the highway and protesting against its removal. The question propounded by you is whether or not the State Railway Commission has jurisdiction over the signal. The Commission has such jurisdiction. Section 5526, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, is as follows: "Wherever any railroad track shall cross any such way in a cut, or on a curve, or side hill, or in timber lands, or near buildings, or near any obstruction of the view from the way, the commission shall direct such precautions to be taken as it shall deem necessary for the safety of the traveling public, the facts having been developed either on the motion of the commission or upon complaint of interested parties. Each and every railroad company shall also provide and maintain such gates, crossings, signs, alarm bells, and flag men, as the commission shall direct The commission may adopt some uniform crossing sign, which shall be placed at any crossing and at such other places as the commission may direct. The commission may direct the place - ment of special signs where the physical conditions of any cross - ing warrant such action." The fact that this is a federal highway does not alter the power of the Commission with regard to it. It also appears that the highway has been completed and that the federal government is withholding fifteen thousand dollars because the signal has not been removed. It is obvious that the state authorities cannot compel the federal authorities to pay the money now withheld. Section 2 of the federal highway act (Act Nov. 9, 1921, Ch. 119, U. S. Comp. Stat. — 7477Ka — 7477Ky 1923 Supplement provides in part as follows: "The term 'highway' includes rights of way, bridges, drain- age structures, signs, guard rails, and protective structures in connection with highways". Section 12 of the same act provides as follows: "The construction and reconstruction of the highways or parts of highways under the provisions of this Act, and all contracts, plans, specifications, and estimates relating thereto, shall be un - dertaken by the State highway departments subject to the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture. The construction and recon - struction work and labor in each State shall be done in accord - ance with its laws and under the direct supervision of the State highway department, subject to the inspection and approval of the Secretary of Agriculture and in accordance with the rules and regulations pursuant to this Act." </seg>
            <seg id="p533">NEBRASKA STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION 533 Section 13 of the same act provides, in part, as follows: "When the Secretary of Agriculture shall find that any proj- ect approved by him has been constructed or reconstructed in compliance with said plans and specifications, he shall cause to be paid to the proper authorities of said State the amount set aside for said project." Any question as to payment for the building of the highway will be determined by federal authorities. Very truly yours, O. S. Spillman, Attorney General. By Hugh LaMaster, Assistant Attorney General. Lincoln, November 20, 1926. Mr. I. J. Devoe, Chief Accountant, State Railway Commission. Dear Sir: Your favor of October 29, before answering which I asked for further information, and your favor of November 19, giving such in - formation, duly received. In your letter of October 29, 1926, at the suggestion of Commis - sioner Taylor, you submitted the following: "Recently the Antelope County Telephone company at Ne - ligh has sold two of its exchanges, namely, Orchard and Ewing, to individuals who are operating the exchanges as separate units. The two exchanges are operating under the names of Orchard Telephone Company and Ewing Telephone Company respectively. "The question has arisen as to whether or not the Commis - sion has jurisdiction over long term debt issued by each of those companies in payment of the purchase price." The question, therefore, is whether an individual operating as a common carrier must apply to the State Railway Commission for per - mission to issue securities representing long term indebtedness. Under Section 676, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amended by Section 1, Chapter 168, Laws of Nebraska for 1923 and by Section 1, Chapter 141, Laws of Nebraska for 1925, a common carrier or public service corporation is required to secure the permission of the State Railway Commission for the issuance of securities. Under Section 5483, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, a common carrier is defined as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p534">534 NINETEENTH ANNUAL REPORT "The term 'common carriers' as used herein shall be taken to include all corporations, companies, individuals and association of individuals, their lessees or receivers, appointed by any court whatsoever, that may now or hereafter own, operate, manage or control any railroad, interurban or street railway line, operated either by steam or electricity or any other motive power, or part thereof, or any express company, car company, sleeping car com - pany, freight and freight line company, telegraph and telephone companies and any other carrier engaged in the transmission of messages or transportation of passengers or freight for hire." t Under the contract, copy of which is enclosed with your letter of rember 19, it appears that the Northern Antelope Telephone Com - iy, which it is understood is incorporated, sells certain common car - ■ property to A. L. Dawson. The payment for the property is to made over a long period. The contract provides that the purchaser 11 take possession of the property on July 1, 1926 and thereafter e control of it as though the full owner thereof and shall be under gations to maintain the property. It also provides that the pur - se price includes four miles of line to be built by the party of the t part, the Northern Antelope Company, for the price of $600, and t if such line is not constructed the party of the second part will eive credit for that amount on the purchase price. The net result of these provisions appears to be that the telephone company divests itself of certain property, payment to be made over a long term and in the same agreement agrees to build certain proper - ty which will have the effect of reducing the purchase price. b Under these conditions there is an obligation both ways and it e judgment of this department that permission of the Railway nission must be secured. The statute applies to individuals as well as to corporations where the obligation directly affects the property. Very truly yours, O. S. Spillman, Attorney General.
