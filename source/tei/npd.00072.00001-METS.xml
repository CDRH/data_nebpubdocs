My Dear Governor: Conforming to the statutes of the Commonwealth, I have the honor to present herewith my report as Secretary . of State, for the State of Nebraska, for. the twenty-four months ending June 30, 1932. This report contains an exhibit of the affairs of the office and the method of conducting same during the term now closing. It also sets forth the amount of moneys expended by this depart - ment, a classified statement of all moneys received by the office as fees. It further sets forth a statement of the number of corporations incorporating, qualifying, withdrawing or dissolving, the registration of trade marks and trade names; the registration and renewal of stock brands, the granting of charters to chattel loan organizations under the provisions of Sections 45-112 to 45-323, inclusive, of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1929, and a report of the Board of Pardons. In the interests of economy, we have abridged the report as much as possible, eliminating several features that heretofore have been em - bodied, which would increase the cost of publication, and are m them - selves not of vital interest. • . Respectfully submitted, FRANK MARSH. .: :' , Secretary of State. </seg>
