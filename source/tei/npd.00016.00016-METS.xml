[f we would lay aside the spiritual, moral and physical eleva - tion which these girls receive within this domain, and look only at the financial problem, surely the maintenance of this home would solve one of the important questions in political economy. If these innocent babes were allowed to grow up amidst the same environments as their parents, thereby increasing various crimes, more money would be spent to support them as criminals or imbeciles in our jails and penitentiaries, feeble minded institu - i and asylums, than is spent in the support of this home; which improves these conditions and elevates both mother and child. A girl is committed here for a year and in many e both mother and child go out and become useful citizens ; can yon ask more? We do not admit a second term. The home is open only for first offense.
