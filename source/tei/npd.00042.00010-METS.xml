            <seg id="p005">BIENNIAL REPORT OF BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF STATE INSTITUTIONS TO THE GOVERNOR AND TO THE LEGISLATURE OF THE STATE OF NEBRASKA The Board of Commissioners of State Institutions begs herewith to transmit and submit for consideration its third biennial report for the period beginning December 1, 1916, and ending November 30, 1918. Ordinarily in a report of this character, and relating as it does to the management of the several institutions of the state maintained by it for the purpose of ameliorating the condition of the unfortunate citizens of the state who, for one reason or another, require the custodial care, help, and assistance of the state in order to improve wherever possi - ble the unfortunate condition in which they are found, the subject of first importance would naturally and logically be, what has been accomplished in the way of making comfort - able, caring for, restoring to health and normal conditions insofar as possible, and returning to society all or a portion of the population thus maintained, in an improved and better condition than when they entered upon institutional life. Have the purposes and objects of the law providing for the maintenance of these institutions and the caring for those looked after therein been reasonably well subserved and satisfactory progress made in looking after the welfare and interests of those thus cared for? The question of what it costs to carry on, in a satisfactory manner, the work neces - sary for the accomplishment of the results striven for is of secondary importance. At the present time, however, and for the period covered by this report there has been constantly a growing pressure crowding on the mind for most serious consideration, the query of how can this stupendous work be carried on satis - factorily and efficiently without the expenditure of va.st sums as compared with the expenditures in former times. In other words, although it is becoming somewhat of a thread- </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 PRELIMINARY THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF bare subject which has occupied our time and attention in innumerable ways, what can be done in the way of limiting actual and necessary expenditures of the public funds in view of the "war prices" prevailing and which affect as they do every transaction relating to the maintenance of these institutions, and how can expenditures be reduced by en - forcing a policy of rigid economy and substituting and changing wherever possible, where such change or substi - tution will result in a lessened expenditure? These are matters which have constantly received the most earnest and serious consideration of the Board in the exercise of its best judgment and having in mind the necessity of main - taining these institutions and supporting and caring for those therein provided for, as contemplated by law and de - manded by the public conscience of the people of the state. The changed conditions confronting us and which we have had to contend with have rendered valueless esti - mates of probable expenditures in order to properly support these institutions, as made and presented to the previous legislature. Estimates that were based upon the prior ex - perience of the Board in the management of these institu - tions and of probable requirements under fairly normal con - ditions were found to be far from correct when measured and tried by actual experience and the unusual conditions with respect to the prices of everything purchased as found by actual experience and demonstrated facts. To vividly illustrate the greatly increased cost of run - ning the fifteen state institutions with their six thousand and more population, for the last two years, as compared with any preceding biennium, we cite but a few instances: For the year 1916 the Board expended for coal, for fuel, lighting and heating purposes, of which there was con - sumed a tonnage during the year of approximately 37000 tons, at an average cost of $3.70 per ton, the total sum of $136,881, and during this year coal prices showed an up - ward tendency. For the year 1918, ending November 30th, notwithstanding careful and efficient management, the Board was able to reduce the tonnage consumed some 3000 tons, yet the average cost per ton being $5.72, there was re- </seg>
            <seg id="p007">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS quired an increased expenditure for coal alone of approx - imately $57,000. A comparison of expenditures for the pre - ceding biennium as compared with the one just closed will show that for coal alone the Board was compelled to expend over $100,000 more, during the last biennium, than during the former one. The three hospitals for the insane, each of which is quite well organized and efficiently managed and where prices and costs of maintenance are as stabilized, or more so than in other institutions, and which combined support an average inmate population of something over 2500, being about one half of the entire inmate population of all state institutions, were maintained during the years 1913 and 1914 at a per capita cost of $16.10 per month, and during the years 1915 and 1916 the per capita cost was slightly re - duced, being $15.44 per month, while for the years 1917 and 1918 the per capita cost for maintaining the inmates of these three institutions was greatly increased to the sum of $20.65 per month which, it will be observed, is over 25 per cent greater than at any previous period. In this connection it is proper to say that by a persist - ent and continued development of the work the products of the farm, garden, orchard, live stock and dairy, of these sev - eral institutions, have been greatly increased, resulting in a noticeable reduction in the per capita cost of maintaining the inmates from legislative appropriations from what it other - wise would have been. We pass from this subject with the remark that it is the feeling upon the part of the Board that on the whole it has during these trying times acted with a reasonable degree of wisdom and good judgment with a view of sub - serving as best it could the interests of the state and of its taxpayers and of providing for the proper care and support of the state's wards and thus effectuating the object and spirit of the laws under which it is carrying on its work. PERSONNEL Since our last biennial report, Judge Howard Kennedy, a former member of the Board from the time it was organized </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 PRELIMINARY THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF until March 1, 1917, has retired and was succeeded by E. O. Mayfield. who has since that time been serving as one of the three members. Otherwise the personnel of the Board has remained the same as at first organized. In the institutions there have been numerous changes in the different official staffs, most of which have grown out of war conditions and been occasioned by resignations to enter the service of the United States. The superintendency of the Girls' Industrial School at Geneva, the Nebraska Hos - pital for the Insane and the Orthopedic Hospital at Lincoln, the Hospital for Tuberculous at Kearney, the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home at Milford, and the Nebraska Home for De - pendent Children at Lincoln, has during this period changed. At the other institutions the chief executive officers are the same as at the beginning of the biennial period. INMATE POPULATION The total daily average inmate population for the bien - nium just closed is 4907. This number does not include those absent on parole, nor officers and employees, but only the present inmate population. The daily average inmate popula - tion present for the biennium ending November 30, 1916, was 4526, thus showing an increase of approximately 10 per cent during the biennium. It has been our constant endeavor to properly care for and promote the welfare and interests of those committed to the custody of the state, to carry out the purposes and objects of the law to the utmost extent, and in a humane manner, and to prevent harshness, cruelty, or improper treatment by those having the inmates under their charge and in their custody. But few complaints have come to our notice and these have been of a minor character, investigated promptly, and all irregularities or improper management or control eradicated and the recurrence avoided wherever possible. In our efforts in this direction we have had, in the main, the active and wholehearted aid and assistance of the superin - tendents and others in authority. General health of a satisfactory character has been maintained throughout the period, with the exception of very few outbreaks of epidemics or other form of illness af- </seg>
            <seg id="p009">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 9 fecting the population generally. The result of the preval - ent epidemic of influenza has not been so marked nor so fatal in the state institutions as it seems to have been with the public generally, the most serious condition with respect to this epidemic being at the State Penitentiary. On the whole, we think the comfort and welfare of the inmates of all the institutions have been properly looked after. The war has occasioned additional demands upon our different institutions and this demand will probably increase as time passes on. We have in the past, and are at present caring for returned soldiers afflicted with tuberculosis and also those who have developed mental aberrations. The government is at the present time inquiring as to facilities of the state in providing for the custody, care, and treat - ment of returned • soldiers whose mentality has been im - paired while in the government service. The total number thus affected, a large number of which will require institu - tional treatment, is roughly estimated to be, in the entire service, about 50,000, and 1 to 2 per cent of which would probably be the proportion of those who entered the serv - ice from Nebraska. Discharged soldiers unfortunately af - flicted in the manner referred to, as we understand it, would be treated and cared for, if at all, in our state institutions, at the expense of the United States Government, and the cost would be met under the contracts existing in favor of the soldiers and entered into with the United States War Risk Insurance Bureau. The main question for determina - tion by us is the capacity and space available for the treat - ment of these returned soldiers, enlisting from Nebraska, by our own institutions rather than to have them cared for by the government at some central hospital perhaps not so well equipped and arranged for the care and treatment of such patients. The normal growth in population of the state and the ever increasing demand for the admittance of those who are mentally diseased call for and require a continuation of the policy of expansion and enlargement of the capacity of the different hospitals, and with this idea and condition in view the Board will present, with this report and with its </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 PRELIMINARY THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF budget of appropriations needful for the coming biennium, a request for further appropriations for new buildings to accommodate the mentally unsound, as well as to increase the capacity of other institutions maintained for other pur - poses. In this connection it may be said that it has been the policy of this Board heretofore and now to request of each recurring legislature a reasonable sum to be appropri - ated for the purpose of constructing new buildings and otherwise permanently improving the different institutions under the control of the Board. NEW BUILDINGS AND PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS By an act of the last legislature House Roll 717, pro - visions were made for the construction of new buildings and other improvements, including the purchase of land, machinery, equipment, etc., by providing a special levy of forty-eight hundredths mills on the dollar valuation of tax - able property of the state, to be distributed for the purposes mentioned to the several institutions under the control of the Board, the total appropriation thus made and provided for being somewhat above $450,000. Because of the man - ner in which the funds appropriated were thus to be pro - vided for and paid into the state treasury it was apparent that until the levy for the first year had been made and the taxes thereunder began to be paid the drawing of expendi - tures under this appropriation, immediately after the law went into effect, or after the levy was made, would have to be in anticipation of the payment of taxes therein provided for, later on. Such being the case it was thought wise and prudent by the Board to defer as long as reasonably could be done the work of making the improvements contem - plated, and for this reason the making of contracts and the beginning of the actual work of providing for these improve - ments was, with a few exceptions, not begun until the fall of the year 1917, and much is yet to be done if all of the improvements thus contemplated and provided for are fin - ally made. The unusual conditions in the way of the cost of material and labor have also, in some instances, com - pelled some changes and readjustments of the plans as orig- </seg>
            <seg id="p011">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 11 inally provided for. Some of the improvements thus pro - vided for have been completed and in other cases buildings and new structures are now under way for which contracts have been made and which will be completed in the early summer of the present year. At the Nebraska Institution for Feeble-Minded Youth. Beatrice, there is now under construction a new building to be used as a girls' cottage which, when completed, will ma - terially increase the capacity of that institution for the car - ing of inmates, which is much needed as it is now in a very crowded condition. Improvements of a substantial character in the way of providing for a sufficient supply of water, and new machinery for the power house, water mains, etc., have been made at this institution. There has, up to this time, been expended for permanent improvements only the sum of $21,400, leaving at this time $41,500 unexpended. At the Girls' Industrial School, Geneva, two new boilers have been provided for and other permanent improvements made, which have required an expenditure of $7,100 out of the $7,500 appropriated. At the Nebraska Soldiers' and Sailors' Home, Burkett, the power plant has been remodeled and new machinery installed so that at the present time there is at this place a very complete and efficient power plant and also, in connec - tion with the remodeling of the power house, there has been constructed a refrigerating plant, a storage house, and a new bakery, all of which has required the expenditure of $13,400 out of the $16,800 appropriated. An appropriation was made for the construction of a spur track from the railroad switch to the power house, in order to facilitate the unloading of coal which would thus require but one handling, but as yet this improvement has not been made. At the Ingleside Hospital for the Insane, Ingleside, there was appropriated $25,000 for the construction of a sanitary sewer and septic tank system, a new smoke stack, and an addition to the power house, and for boilers, pump, and other machinery, out of which has been expended for these purposes $19,000. In this connection, we are pleased to re - port that at the Ingleside hospital we have been able to </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 PRELIMINARY THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF construct a general kitchen, dining room, and dormitory building at an approximate cost of $50,000, all of which was paid for out of the institution cash fund and no appropria - tion by the legislature requested therefor. The old build - ing used for the purpose of a kitchen and dining room was poorly constructed, many years ago, unsanitary and danger - ous, and was condemned as unsafe to be used for such pur - poses. It was built some thirty years ago and constructed out of soft brick. Competent architects advised that the building could never be made safe and sanitary for the pur - pose intended. The new building is modern in every re - spect, built with the view of utility and convenience, and is a credit to the state. In it the cooking is done for a popula - tion of more than 1200 people, where meals are prepared three times a day, and also dining room facilities are found for feeding the army of employees required at that institu - tion as well as to afford, on the third story, dormitory con - veniences for a large number of employees. The old kitchen building has been remodeled by removing the third story, taking off the wings and projections, rearranging the in - terior, and converting it into an industrial building in which have been installed shoemaking shops, weaving rooms, etc. for the useful employment of a portion of the population ; and also there has been installed in this building a library and reading room. These changes and improvements have greatly added to the convenience and facilities for carrying on the work at this, the largest of our state institutions, and have materially contributed to its efficient management. At the State Industrial School, Kearney, no appropria - tion was made for new buildings, except for a cattle and hog barn. With reference to permanent improvements at this institution, as at the Ingleside hospital, we have been able to construct a hospital building, which was greatly needed, at an expense of some $25,000, which was wholly paid for out of moneys received from the industries carried on at that institution. The building may therefore be said to be, in strictness and truth, a State Industrial School Hospital. It is a building substantially constructed, fireproof and well arranged, and will be of valuable service to the state for </seg>

Although the building is but 41 feet in width by 49 feet in length and two stories high, it is regarded as one of the neatest and best arranged little hospital buildings in the state. In times of epidemic and when the inmates of this institution require hospital treatment they are now provided with the facilities of being cared for in the best possible manner and with the least possible danger of the spread of contagious and infectious diseases. None of the appropria - tion made for the construction of barns at this institution has as yet been used. At the Hospital for Tuberculous, Kearney, from the ap - propriation of $20,500, made by the legislature, there have been steam mains laid, running to the different buildings belonging to the state, a new well dug and a water system installed, including the erection of a water tank of ample capacity to afford not only a water supply for domestic purposes but to be used as a protection against fire, the old heating and water systems have been made complete and dependable, the sewer system has been remodeled and a septic tank installed on land purchased for that purpose, and the old pavilion building has been thoroughly renovated and remodeled and made comfortable and pleasant for those who are sheltered therein. Much work in the way of remodeling and improving has also been done in the ad - ministration building. There has been expended from the appropriation to date the sum of $17,000. At the Nebraska Hospital for the Insane, Lincoln, we have under construction a new building for men which, when completed, is designed to accommodate 180 patients. This building will probably be ready for use some time dur - ing the coming summer. This institution is and has been crowded for room for the reception and care of patients, and relief to some extent has been afforded by the transfer of some of the patients committed to this institution, to the hospitals at Ingleside and Norfolk. The institution is the parent hospital for the insane in the state and the sec - ond largest, and situated as it is in the center of the more </seg>

The appropriation for new buildings at this institution was $143,000, most of which will be used in the construction, completion, and furnishing of the structure now under way. At the present time there has been expended the sum of $90,500. At the Orthopedic Hospital, Lincoln, only repairs and improvements in the way of painting, plastering, and re - modeling, have been made, for which there has been ex - pended $4,000, leaving as yet an unexpended balance of $5,000. Much in the way of improvement has been done to the power house and a new boiler has been installed, for the purpose of providing heat and hot water for the Ne - braska Home for Dependent Children which is adjacent to the Orthopedic Hospital and is supplied with heat and hot water and laundry facilities from that institution. At the State Penitentiary, Lincoln, there was appro - propriated for the purchase of land $20,100, which has been expended for that purpose. There has also been expended, out of the total appropriation of $41,000, something over $9,000 for repairing and remodeling the different shop build - ings so as to better fit them as suitable places for carrying on the industries in which the state is engaged, with a view of finding suitable employment for the inmates, and also for the establishment and equipment of a laundry building, and the installation of new machinery therein. There remains unexpended of the appropriation, about $12,000. At the Nebraska Industrial Home, Milford, there was appropriated for permanent improvements $10,000, out of which there has to this time been expended $5,000. The improvements made have been the construction and build - ing of a modern dairy barn, something that had been needed for years. While the inmate population at this institution is composed of young women with their infant children, yet the keeping of a number of cows and the work of dairying has been carried on quite successfully, is practically all done by these young women inmates, and affords a supply of milk and butter which is absolutely necessary for the proper </seg>
            <seg id="p015">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 15 maintenance of the inmate population and especially the young children. There have also been installed two large high pressure boilers in place of one low pressure and one small high pressure. A new well with an electric pump has been constructed and installed, which supplies the in - stitution with an abundance of good water, there being prior thereto a manifest shortage of the water supply and frequently the complete exhaustion of the capacity of the well as then existing; also a new store-room and coal-house have been built, new roofs and ceilings put on the porches of the main building, and other outside work of a general character in the way of repairs done in order to keep the buildings from deterioration. At the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home, Milford, an appro - priation of $3,000 was made for the construction of a new barn and hog house, all of which as yet remains unused since these improvements have not yet been undertaken. Considerable, however, in the way of general repairs of a permanent character has been accomplished, there having been laid some 400 feet of water mains to take the place of the old, defective mains that have been installed for over twenty years, and thus affording a better supply of water, bet - ter fire protection, and greater economy. Eight hundred forty square feet of cement walk and flooring have been con - structed, and approximately 1200 feet of cinder walk extend - ing from the entrance of the Home grounds to the city limits of Milford; also the pump house has been repaired and new roofing placed on the same, and an additional boiler installed in the boiler room, thus adding to the ca - pacity of the heating plant to suitably provide heat for the different buildings and especially the new hospital building recently constructed. At the Nebraska School for the Blind, Nebraska City, no appropriation for permanent improvements was made by the legislature. Out of the general funds, however, appro - priated for the maintenance and support of this institution, considerable in the way of permanent improvements has been done, the most noticeable of which is in connection with the heating plant, the pit and boiler room having been </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 PRELIMINARY THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF enlarged, leveled, and equipped with scales and a small coal wagon, for the proper recording of data relative to the ef - ficiency of the plant. Also there has been erected a steam ash ejector that throws out the accumulated ashes of half a day, in approximately five minutes, even in the coldest weather, the distance elevated being approximately 30 feet and up a 12 foot incline. This method of removing ashes from lower levels seems to be quite successful and the most economical method of handling this refuse at the institu - tion. New roofs have also been placed on the east wing of the main building, on the barn, and on several of the smaller buildings. The other repairs have been of a general nature, relating to plumbing, plastering, painting, fencing, etc. The physical condition at this institution on the whole is in a very satisfactory condition. At the Hospital for the Insane of Nebraska, Norfolk, a new building for female patients has been completed and is now occupied for the housing of a portion of the female population committed to this institution. The building is a modern hospital building and meets with all the require - ments for which it was intended. There is also under con - struction a new male cottage provided for by House Roll 717 which, when completed, will be modern in all respects, attractive, and convenient for the needs of that institution in housing male patients. The two buildings greatly in - crease the capacity of this institution for the care of the in - sane of the state, and make it of more importance as well as adding to the economy of management, because of the larger number which can be accommodated at this one in - stitution. One section of the new power plant, provided for by the appropriation bill referred to, is n earing completion, new boilers and much new machinery being installed there - in, which when completed will make the power and heating plant of this institution complete, modern, and efficient in all respects. A new warehouse and bake shop building is also nearing completion and will soon be ready for use and occupancy. There has been 22050 feet of sewer pipe laid, ranging in size from 12 inches to 6 inches, carrying the greater part of the sewage of the institution for quite a </seg>

Three thousand cement blocks, 10x16 inches, were made at the institution and used in the con - struction of the bake shop and warehouse. Six hundred square feet of cement have been laid on the floor of a new tun - nel constructed and leading to the new women's cottage, and for walks and gutters and for a floor for the coal shed. Of the appropriation of $117,000, there has been expended to date $37,000. At the Nebaska School for the Deaf, Omaha, for perma - nent improvements there was appropriated $6,000, for a new barn and garage and for grading grounds and laying walks. Because of the greatly increased cost of building material and labor, the amount thus appropriated is found to be inadequate for the purposes intended and as a consequence the appropriation remains unexpended. The reappropriation of the amount thus unused, with an additional sum, for the purpose of making these needed improvements, will be asked of the present legislature. Repairs of a general nature have been carried on, so that the buildings are being kept in good condition and free from causes that would lead to unneces - sary deterioration. At the Nebraska Home for Dependent Children, Lincoln, there was appropriated $2,500 for the construction of walks, fences, and improvement of the grounds, there being ex - pended from this appropriation to date only $500, leaving $2,000 as an unexpended balance at this time. It is recommended that the unexpended balances of the special appropriations thus made under the provisions of House Roll 717, by the last legislature, and remaining in the treasury after the biennial period and the time within which such appropriations are available for expenses incurred dur - ing the biennium, be reappropriated by the present legis - lature for the benefit of the same institutions for which </seg>

The last legislature made special provisions for the pur - chase of land at different institutions and there has been purchased by the Board, as contemplated by the appropria - tions, lands as follows: At the Hospital for Tuberculous, Kearney, there was ap - propriated $12,500 for the purchase of land adjacent to the holdings of the state, and out of which we have purchased a block of land adjoining the hospital grounds on the east and consisting of about 3 acres on which was a fairly com - modious residence building and a good barn, paying therefor $7,500. The residence building was by us remodeled and made convenient for the residence of employees of the in - stitution, and the barn improved so that it would better sub - serve its purpose in that location than did the barn near the main buildings of the institution, which had formerly been used. There was also purchased additional ground, at the rate of something over $200 an acre, which had been laid out into town lots, and which when obtained made more uniform and regular the boundaries of the state's land at this institution as well as enlarging the area of land suitable for domestic use in the way of gardening, etc. The total amount expended for both purposes was $7,850, leaving an unexpended balance of $4,550. At the State Penitentiary, the special forty-eight hun - dreths mills levy, House Roll 717, provided for the purchase of 120 acres of land at the purchase price of $20,100. This land was immediately purchased and has been included in the farming operations carried on at that institution since that time. At the Hospital for the Insane of Nebraska, Norfolk, there was specially appropriated the sum of $12,000, of which $10, - 900 was expended for 54.85 acres of valley land lying conven - ient to the hospital and well suited for agricultural purposes, This land is of much better quality than the institution land generally, belonging to the state, at that place. </seg>
            <seg id="p019">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 19 MAINTENANCE For the general maintenance and upkeep of the fifteen institutions which includes expenditures of every kind, save those of a character pertaining to permanent improvements, there was expended during the biennial period ending No - vember 30th, 1918, the total sum of $2,855,992.08. Based on the inmate population only, which averaged 4907, the per capita expenditure, per month, per inmate, in all of the in - stitutions would be $24.25. Of the total maintenance ex - penditures, as above stated, $2,746,290.78 was drawn under legislative appropriations from the general fund in the state treasury, and the sum of $109,701.30 from the institution cash fund, which represents proceeds accruing to the several institutions from the sale of property, the collection of main - tenance charges, etc. and from sources other than moneys belonging to the state general fund. Based on the per capita expenditure of $24.25 per month, as above stated, $23.32 was drawn from legislative appropriation $ .93 per capita, per month, from the institution cash fund. A very complete analysis of these expenditures, not only with ref - erence to each institution but the different purposes for which such expenditures were made, and which are fully itemized, will be found among the tables and statistical data presented with and made a part of this report. It will be observed tha' in these tables, denominated "distribution statements," ..here appear some fifty-seven headings and subheadings, itemizing the particular purposes for such ex - penditures and the total amount expended for each of such purposes, as well as the aggregate for all purposes, such as salaries and wages, transportation, telegraph, articles of food, clothing, dry goods, hospital supplies, hardware, furni - ture, stationery, fuel, machinery, general repairs, etc., most of which are again subdivided showing the several different varieties in the same general class. By a comparison of these expenditures, one institution with another, a very in - telligent understanding can be had as to the character of all expenditures, the reasonableness of the same, the neces - sity therefor, and whether or not a fair degree of economy has been exercised by the superintendents and those in </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 PRELIMINARY THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF charge of the particular institution under consideration with reference to the expenditures thus made. We submit these, with other tables, for the consideration of those interested, as a complete and thorough itemization and report of all and every financial transaction had by the Board involving the work as it is carried on day by day and month by month, through the entire period covered by the report. It is proper to state here that every dollar received from all sources goes into the state treasury and is drawn therefrom only on veri - fied claims and vouchers by the claimant, approved by the superintendent and audited and examined by this Board and by it approved, and then presented to the Auditor of Public Accounts where a warrant is drawn in favor of the claimant whose claim has been thus allowed. Aside from the general earnings of the several institu - tions, representing receipts principally from the sale of prod - ucts and live stock, which are deposited to the credit of the institution cash fund, there are realized also, at several of the institutions, funds of a considerable amount from other sources, to which we briefly call attention: At the Nebraska Institution for Feeble-Minded Youth, Beatrice, the law provides for payment, either by relatives or by the counties in which those committed to that insti - tution have their legal residence, of a charge for the pur - chase of clothing, etc., of not exceeding $40 per year, for each inmate, and which is denominated in our records as a "Clothing Fund Account." This source of revenue pertains only to the one institution above named. During the period from April 29, 1916, to December 1, 1918, there was received for the benefit of that institution and going into the clothing fund account the sum of $43,298.62, and there has been ex - pended for this purpose the sum of $46,798.15. At the State Penitentiary, Lincoln, two important indus - tries are being carried on, one of which is the manufacture and sale of reed and fiber furniture, and the other the manu - facture and sale of brooms. These two industries, in each of which has been invested approximately $50,000, furnish employment of a healthy and wholesome character to all of the available labor by prisoners at that institution, and were </seg>
            <seg id="p021">THE BOARD OP COMMISSIONERS 21 it possible to obtain a greater number than we now have, who can be thus employed, a much larger number could be given profitable employment and a ready market found for the output of each of these two industries. In developing the business connected with each it has taken some little time to place them on a thorough, business-going basis, op - erating in the most efficient manner so as to bring about the best returns, and yet we have been successful to a degree, that warrants us in saying that if we are not hampered by adverse legislation by Congress, in finding a market in the different states, which is at times threatened, the future of these industries is very encouraging and will in a large measure, if not altogether, successfully solve the problem of utilizing, to the best advantage to the state and of most benefit to the prisoners, all surplus prison labor. We have found ourselves enabled to credit to the earnings of the State Penitentiary generally a wage for the labor of prison - ers thus employed, at a rate of seventy-two cents per day for each prisoner, including a portion thereof which is paid direct to the prisoner earning such wage for the benefit of himself when he retires from the Penitentiary, or for his family and those dependent on him while confined therein. The average rate per day thus paid to such prisoners so engaged in this work is approximately twenty-three cents. While the institution cash fund and the earnings of these two industries placed therein aggregate a large sum, we are to bear in mind that a great deal of these receipts from the sale of the output of the two industries must be immediately reinvested in raw material and supplies of different kinds, to be manufactured into the finished article and sold in the markets. We should also note that, while the wages paid per day, per man, may seem somewhat inadequate, yet it is to be borne in mind that when the prisoners begin work of this kind they are compelled to serve a period of ap - prenticeship and training before they are qualified to en - gage in portions of the work connected with the manufac - ture of the desired article; that after serving such appren - ticeship and becoming familiar and reasonably efficient in the kind of work assigned and in which they are engaged. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 PRELIMINARY THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF but a short time elapses before a large percentage of them are discharged and leave the Penitentiary, having served the minimum sentence and been recommended for parole by the board having that matter in its charge and control. The mini - mum sentence for a large number of offenses for which prisoners are committed is only one year, for some offenses two or three years, and for a few, a greater period of time is fixed by law. The law also provides, by the "Good Time Act," for the allowance of two months of good time for commendable conduct the first year of a sentence, three months for the second, and four months for each year thereafter. It will thus be seen that the operation of the law permits the discharge of a very large number within ten months after commitment. MAINTENANCE CHARGE FOR SUPPORT OF PATIENTS IN HOSPITALS FOR THE INSANE During the 1915 session of the legislature, certain sections of the law relating to the maintenance of patients in the hospitals for the insane were amended so as to pro - vide for the payment of a maintenance charge for ex - penses for the care, support, and treatment of those com - mitted to these hospitals, by patients possessing a sufficient estate and by certain of the next of kin and near relatives of patients possessing no estate in their own right, who are of sufficient ability to do so. (Chapter 134, page 299, Ses - sion Laws of 1915). In substance the law as amended provides that if the husband, parent, etc., or any person legally liable for the maintenance of a patient, is possessed of an estate or income sufficient to meet the expenses of the care and maintenance of such patient, then such per - son should be required to pay quarterly a sum to be fixed by the Board of Commissioners of State Institutions in an amount as nearly as may be equal to the per capita cost of maintaining such hospital, and authorizing the superin - tendent to bring suit therefor; also that if any patient be possessed of an estate or income sufficient to pay the ex - pense of his care and maintenace without depriving of </seg>
            <seg id="p023">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 23 necessary support those, if any, dependent upon such pa - tient, then a like sum should be collected as a mainte - nance charge from such patient's estate, and that such sums should constitute a claim against the estate and be collectible therefrom. By amendment, the legislature at its 1917 session provided, in substance, that those made liable for the support of such patients should not be required to pay the cost of maintaining any such patient in either of the hospitals, when such person should by affi - davit or other satisfactory evidence make a showing to the Board of Commissioners of State Institutions to the effect that such person is not possessed of an estate or income sufficient to pay for such maintenance without de - priving himself or others dependent upon him of the means of support and maintenance reasonably required for such purposes. The law went into effect July 1, 1915. The payment of a maintenance charge for the sup - port of insane patients as thus provided for has resulted in adding to the institution cash fund a large amount which has materially contributed to the support of the inmates of these institutions, thereby to that extent relieving the taxpayers generally of the burden of supporting those who are able to support themselves or where those legally liable are able to contribute for such support. After the law had been in force and operation for a year or more, it became apparent that in order that the law should operate uniformly, evenly, and equitably upon all coming within its provisions, a thorough and systematic effort should be made in order to require payment of all who were legally obligated to make the same and were financially able to do so, and to relieve all others less for - tunately situated and who were unable to discharge such obligation, being of insufficient financial ability to do so; and especially to fairly and justly draw the line between those who should be classed as "paying patients," who should be held liable, and those who should be discharged from such obligation by reason of their inability to meet the same. With a view of clearing up and adjusting all these charges that were in arrears and requiring payment </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 PRELIMINARY THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF where it appeared the same should be made, and warrant - ing cancellation in all other cases, the Board felt that it was incumbent upon it, in the exercise of its authority under the law, and in the discharge of its duty, to take charge of all maintenance claims and charges past due and unpaid and to inform itself of the facts and circum - stances as to each individual claim or case, and thus se - cure a final adjustment of the account. It was obvious that, if the working of the law was to be uniform and enforced alike as to all, the work should be centered in one place and like rules and policies and action taken as to all cases where the circumstances were similar, rather than that it be divided among three different institutions to be disposed of under the judgment and discretion of each of the three superintendents. The Board also con - strued the purpose of the amendment of the law above referred to, by the last legislature, to place the responsibil - ity on the Board rather than on the superintendents of the three hospitals for relieving from obligation to pay all those who might make the proper showing and bring themselves within the purview of the proviso of the law with reference to being released from such payments. Having thus entered upon the discharge of the duty of deciding where payments should be required and where not, the Board has undertaken, by a thorough and syste - matic method of securing information and other data neces - sary to intelligently pass upon the question, to ascertain regarding each individual case whether payment should be made by the parties liable therefor, or whether they should be relieved and the charge cancelled on the ground of inability to pay the same. From the information early received after engaging in the work, it was estimated by the member of the Board having this work directly in charge that the receipts from these charges, which were in arrears, would amount to $20,000 or $25,000. As the work progressed and devel - oped from time to time it was disclosed that a much larger sum than originally estimated would be realized from this source. While the volume of the work and the innumer- </seg>
            <seg id="p025">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 25 able details connected therewith have been greater than anticipated, yet the results have fully justified the labor and the time required. We have to this time been instrumental in collecting some $50,000 of these maintenance charges which were in arrears, as well as securing information and necessary data justifying the prediction that some $15,000 or more from the same sources, will be collected and turned into the state treasury within a reasonable time in the near future, but which is now for different reasons delayed, principally on the ground of time required in settling estates, appointing guardians, administrators, etc., and procuring court orders and directions in compliance with formalities of law in the payment of obligations of those who are incompetent and of estates where the parties liable are deceased. It is a source of gratification for us to report that in making these collections those liable have generally shown a disposition to pay promptly and willingly these charges for the support of their relatives who were dependent on them, many of whom we are disposed to believe were quite ready and willing to meet the charge, even though it required something of a financial sacrifice, and when in strictness, were the proper showing made, they possibly would be held to be exempt because of their possessing an insufficient estate or income, after providing for them - selves and others dependent upon them for support and maintenance. In a few instances, and these cases were rather exceptional than otherwise, we found those who were liable and who, from information received, were amply able to meet such a charge, and who in some in - stances possessed estates of $20,000 to $40,000 or $50,000, and incomes accordingly, evincing a disposition and making an effort to escape the payment of such charges and re - quire the state out of its general revenues to support their dependent relatives, who in all fairness and good conscience should have been supported by themselves. In a number of cases, patients were found to possess ample estates to pay for their own support, who had no others dependent upon them, such estates being in control of relatives and guardians who were receiving the income but making no </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 PRELIMINARY THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF effort or provisions for the payment of the maintenance charge for the support of such patients thus possessing an estate amply sufficient to meet the same. In some rare instances, payment has been refused on the ground of al - leged invalidity of the law on different grounds advanced as reasons for disclaiming a legal obligation to pay. Possibly a half dozen different cases would be the extent of those thus refusing payment. While some of these claims are pending in the county courts where guardianship proceed - ings have been instituted, there has been as yet no judicial decision under a litigated case, or in guardianship or admin - istrative proceedings, passing upon the validity of any por - tion or feature of the law. All that has been accomplished thus far in the enforcement of this law has been done with - out litigation or controversy of a serious character, of any kind. Upon the whole, we think it may be said that the working of this law and its enforcement have generally been satisfactory and without general complaint or cause therefor upon the part of those who come within its provisions. We find upon an investigation of the subject and the information obtained that many of the states of the Union have laws of a similar character in providing for the payment of expenses of maintenance of the insane of such states in public institutions maintained and pro - vided therefor, such laws being varied in their character and providing, by different methods, for the accomplish - ment of the same general object, to-wit: The payment of these charges and expenses from estates of patients and by relatives held liable therefor. Our experience and knowledge gained from the prac - tical operation of the law leads us to the belief that the law should be in some respects amended so as to render specific and certain some portions thereof that appear now to be in - volved in some obscurity and uncertainty, giving rise to grounds for contention and controversy as to the proper construction of the law and of its scope with respect to those who come within its provisions. This uncertainty as to the proper construction of the law has in a measure been contributed to by inconsistent opinions from the office of </seg>
            <seg id="p027">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 27 the Attorney-General, giving a construction of the law a~ to its scope and effect. We are, for these reasons and after collecting a great deal of data and information as to similar laws from other states, some twenty to twenty-five in num - ber, and as to the light in which the law is regarded by those having its enforcement in charge, recommending certain amendments and venturing to submit to the legis - lature and the Governor, as the law-making body, some changes in the present law which we are confident will materially improve the same and obviate controversy and litigation over its enforcement. The amendments proposed are few and simple, and easily understood, and yet import - ant in clearing up certain features of the law regarding which doubt and uncertainty may now be said to exist. Taking the experience of the past as a guide, it may be fairly estimated that the receipts from this source for the support of patients in the three hospitals will amount from $130,000 to $140,000 during the biennial period, or at the rate of about $70,000 annually. There has been col - lected and paid into the state treasury moneys derived from the payment of maintenance charges from April 1, 1917, to the end of the biennial period, November 30, 1918, the total amount of $127,288.79, there remaining on hand still unexpended, at the close of the biennial period, of the total amount so collected, the sum of $120,374.20. INCOME FROM INDUSTRIES AT THE STATE PENITENTIARY We have briefly adverted heretofore to the two indus - tries which have been carried on at the State Penitentiary with prison labor, wherein a number of the prisoners are given employment in the manufacture of reed and fiber fur - niture and of brooms, and which have proven a source of considerable income; and we should also note that at this institution there has been installed a very complete and modern power, light, and heat plant, which is utilized for the purpose of furnishing electricity for light and power purposes at the state capitol, the governor's residence, the Orthopedic hospital, the Nebraska Hospital for the Insane, the Nebraska Home for Dependent Children, at Lincoln, as </seg>
            <seg id="p028">28 PRELIMINARY THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF well as that which is needed and required at the State Penitentiary, including the heating of that institution. The revenues derived from these three sources may be sum - marized as follows: From the sale of manufactured articles by the Hand - craft Furniture Company, and all other sources, $176,778.15; from the sale of manufactured articles by the Handcraft Broom Company, and all other sources, $150,393.79; and for electricity for power and light furnished other institu - tions from the State Penitentiary, approximately $21,011.51. The expenditures from the institution cash fund received from the Handcraft Furniture Company, which include ex - penses of all kinds in conducting the business, such as sal - aries and wages, machinery appliances, and raw material for the same period, amount to the sum of $130,904.88; and like expenditures from receipts by the Handcraft Broom Company amount to the sum of $138,382.51. The receipts from the sale of electric light and power are turned into the receipts generally and from all other sources paid in and belonging to the cash fund of that institution. For a more extensive and itemized statement of all of these receipts from all sources, and expenditures, we invite at - tention to the table prepared by the accountant, headed, "Statement of cash receipts credited to the institution cash funds, disbursements therefrom, and balances therein, De - cember 1, 1916, to December 1, 1918." THE STATE'S HOLDINGS AT THE DIFFERENT INSTITUTIONS, AND THE VALUE THEREOF We call your attention to a very carefully prepared and tabulated statement in the report of the accountant with reference to the property owned by the state and used for the purpose of carrying out the objects of the law in the support and maintenance of these several institutions. This statement will be found under the heading "Estimated value of lands, buildings, furniture, equipment, etc., owned or rented by the institutions under the jurisdiction of the Board of Commissioners of State Institutions, November 30, 1918." The statement has been carefully prepared from the </seg>

It will be noticed that the total acreage owned by the state at these fifteen different institutions amounts to 3,897.61 acres, of an esti - mated value of $661,852.50. The value of the buildings as thus estimated amounts to the sum of $3,649,486. To these sums should be added the value of furniture, equip - ment of all kinds, and other improvements of a permanent character, making a total estimated value of land, buildings, furniture, equipment, and improvements, of $5,784,180.95. There is also exhibited on this table all rented land under lease by the state November 30, 1918. PRODUCTION OF FARM, GARDEN, ORCHARD, AND LIVE STOCK A very full and complete statement of the amount, value, and use, whether sold or consumed, of the products of the farm, garden, orchard, dariy products, live stock, etc., produced at the different institutions, as prepared by the accountant, is presented herewith. It is with a degree of pride that we call attention to the same which, when studied, will show the marked development of this feature of the work done and business carried on at these several institutions, as well as the very large volume and enor - mous value of the annual production, and the very sub - stantial contribution made thereby to the support of the institutions where produced.

            <seg id="p042">PRELIMINARY THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF 42 REPORT OF EFFICIENCY ENGINEER TO THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS OF STATE INSTITUTIOXS UXCOLN, NEBRASKA. Gektlemkn I herewith submit a report of power plant operation of the plants under my supervision from January 1, 1917, to November 30, 1918. Since the engineering department of the Board was created, January 1, 1917. we have experienced abnormal conditions in all things con - nected with plant operation, due to the war. But even so, the methods adopted by this department have proven very successful and have shown a saving in operating costs amounting to from $10,000 to $15,000 per year. The coal consumed during the period from January 1, 1916, to January 1, 1917, was 36995.8 tons. Using this as a basis of judging the former plant operation, the saving in fuel during the last two years is readily shown. I earnestly recommend that in the next biennium, assistants be given this department so that an accurate topographical survey may be made of all institution properties and that maps be made showing locations of buildings, improvements, contours, etc. And I further recommend that when conditions become normal, an engineering laboratory be equipped for testing fuels and oils and that coal be purchased on the B. t. u. basis. This method of purchasing fuel has been used for many years by the Government and is being recognized by all large consumers as the only fair way for both the consumer and the dealer. I wish to thank each of you for your splendid support and co-opera - tion. Respectfully submitted C. O. MARTZ, Efficiency Engineer. Lincoln, Nebraska, November 30, 1918. </seg>

            <seg id="p058">58 PRELIMINARY THIRD BIENNIAL REPORT OF REPORT OF ACCOUNTANT TO THE BOARD OF COMMISSIOXERS OF STATE IXSTITUTIOXS, LIXCOLX, XEBRASKA: Gentlemen- : The Report of the Accounting Department herewith transmitted to you shows certain useful information not heretofore shown in the two preceding biennial reports of this department. Following plans previously made, the report gives you a moet thor - ough and comprehensive statement with reference to the nature of all expenditures made by the Board for all activities under its jurisdiction. Wherever possible it has been the intent to bring under suitable headings the various expenditures made. This department has followed two dis - tinct methods of accounting for all expenditures, — one being in conformity to the appropriations made and the other having more particularly in mind the more detailed purpose of the expenditures in questions. Both are in balance. The notable departures made in the report of the accounting de - partment are the following: 1. Complete and comprehensive inventory of all land owned or rented by the several institutions under the Jurisdiction of the Board and also a complete inventory of all buildings, furniture, equip - ment, and improvements and the estimated value of all as found at the several institutions under the jurisdiction of the Board. 2. A complete record of what has been done in the way of poultry and dairy products; garden, farm, and orchard products; and live stock and poultry. 3. The budget report shows a comprehensive and comparative state - ment which will prove valuable in determining the amounts re - quired in the way of appropriations for the operation of all activities under the Jurisdiction of the Board. It is confidently believed that the present report will answer prac - tically any inquiry which is material relating to accounts and statistics under the immediate supervision of the accounting department. Very respectfully submitted. GEORGE WEIDENFELD, Accountant. Lincoln, Nebraska, November 30, 1918. </seg>
