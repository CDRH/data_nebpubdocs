Department of Public Works. Lincoln. Nebraska. Dear Sir: 1 have the honor of submitting a report covering the work of the past ;wo years in the Bureau of Irrigation, Power and Drainage. This report covers all matters that formerly were conducted by the State Board of Irrigation. It was the intention to show in this report the status of all irrigation projects in Nebraska, the possibilities of the water supply of the state for some beneficial use, gome of the experiences 'met by the officials, and suggestions for bettering the good work, but the result of our efforts fell short of our original intentions for the reason that the co-operation of the water users in many projects was lacking. However, the fault is not altogether with the water users and project managers, as the twelfth Biennial Report should have been in the hands of the water users early in the year 1919. instead of late in the year 1920, in order to give a better idea of what the department is doing in the interests of the water users. It was intended to interest the appropriator to the point where he would co-operate with the state to protect his water rights. The work necessary to develop this interest should never be abandoned, although at times it is quite discouraging to the officials' of the bureau to meet with so much indifference and lack of interest. Many of the appropriators cannot see the need of making acreage reports, gage height reports, etc., continually, season after season. To administer the duties of the Bureau of Irrigation. Power and Drainage to give the greatest service to the water users, can best be done through co-operative methods. The officials of the bureau have endeavored to remove every obstacle to give an applicant a permit to use, beniflcially. the public waters within the state, rather than seeking reasons for not doing so. It is not the desire of the officers of the department to deprive any sincere water user of the use of water in times of scarcity. It has been the practice to give the senior appropriator the water he Is entitled to, the amount of which is based on the acreage actually farmed and irrigated, which method is only fair to and due the junior appropriator. To carry out this policy the department must have acreage reports. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">DEPARTMENT OV PUBLIC WORKS 9 prompt gage height reports, suitable rating flumes, effective control gates and liberal assistance on the part of the project managers. The scheme as planned in 1917 was continued through the years 1919 and 1920 with some minor changes. The installation of automatic gage height recorders in many ditches for the season of 1920 furnished more satisfactory reports than were received in previous years. Greater co-operation was attained in 1919 than in 1920. due to the scarcity of water in 1919. When there is plenty of water, project managers become very indifferent to state regulations When there is a scarcity the managers are very keen to interview the state officials, and show great willingness to co-operate with them. Attempt was again made in the season 1919 to exercise jurisdiction by the department over the Mitchell Irrigation District during a period of scarcity. This canal diverted from the North Platte River a maximum of 300 second feet. This district has approximately ten or twelve thousand acres of irrigable land, all in Nebraska. The diversion poin is about 200 feet in Wyoming beyond the Nebraska-Wyoming line — no an acre is irrigated in Wyoming. There are seven legal appropriations senior in right to the Mitchell District, on the North 1'latte River aggregating 1.869 second feet. The Mitchell Irrigation District, which was formed in 1S97. claims a priority date of June 20, 1890, which is conceded as correct by old settlers. The appropriation has never been adjudicated in Nebraska, although the officers of the district have been solicited repeatedly by the department to co-operate. The laws of Nebraska require all projects to file acreage reports and gage heights, which this district has declined to do. In order to show the extent of co-operation and for comparative purpose?, a tabulated statement is given below, as it is desired to know whether the efforts put forth by the department are bearing results. Co-operation of irrigation project managers with the Bureau of Irrigation will give the department a greater leverage to maintain a supply of water to a gTeater area for crops when needed. For the department to give to the water user the greatest service possible it is necessary to know daily the amount of water available, the amount diverted and the area to be supplied. This information must be given promptly. It is then necessary for every ditch to have well installed rating flumes, report acreage to be irrigated, install automatic gage height recorders, report gage heights, maintain good gaging stations and have the rating flume measured by the state hydrographers at regular periods during the irrigating season. </seg>

            <seg id="p013">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 13 HYDROGRAPHY. Two hydrographers were employed during the irrigation seasons of 1919 and 1920. One through the winter of 1919-1920 to measure seep streams and return flow of the North Platte River. The hydrographers, as a part of their duties, measure the flow of all canals. In this work, where co-operation is practiced, good results are inevitable. To reduce to a minimum the errors, and to expedite the operation of gaging, a rating flume, properly installed, is necessary Rating flumes should be located as near the wastegate as possible am far enough below to eliminate cross currents and eddies, but not so far below as to be affected by back water caused by checking. The flume should be slightly less in width than the bed width of canal and floor about one-tenth of a foot above canal grade, so it will scour. Weir measurement of canal flow is all right, but the department has adopte* the rating flume method as the most practicable. Both methods have their faults, but we believe the rating flume has the least. The following is an extract from Experiment Station Bulletin 86, t\ S. Department of Agriculture: Relative Merits of Weirs and Flumes in the Measurement of Water. Reference has already been made to the fact that some of the weirs put in did not prove satisfactory. This wag due to the deposit of silt above them. Sediment investigations made during the season showed that certain southern streams carry, during floods, as high as 5 per cent of solid matter in suspension, and that canals and laterals taking water from these streams have to be cleaned from two to three times each year. Even where the percentage was much less than this, the deposit of sediment was so rapid in some cases as to fill the lateral or ditch above the weir to a level with Its crest in twenty-four hours. Where this happened, the velocity of approach became a disturbing factor, the influence of which could not be determined, owing to the constant change of conditions. Some canal companies which employ weirs operate In connection therewith a sluicing device which removes the accumulated sediment once each day, but the objection to this Is that the conditions are never stable and It Is Impossible to tell tor what length of time weir table used agreed with the actual discharge, The recent tntestlfaUoos The following number of gagings were made: Season , River Canals Tributaries 919 190 629 357 .920 150 576 .,66 Stream measurements are tabulated and shown elsewhere in this ■eport. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 in the flow of water over dams and over weirs, other than those with sharp edges, may aid in securing the adoption of a form of weir better suited to the sediment-laden waters of the Southwest than that employed but so far as knife-edged weirs are concerned, there are few ditches in that section where it is not possible to secure rating tables for flumes which will give much more reliable and accurate results. It was also found that in a number of canals the grades are too small and the banks too low to secure the requisite fall below the weir, and in such cases flumes would not only be preferable, but an inevitable substitute. The most serious objection to the use of flumes is the labor of perparing accurate rating tables, and the fact that a current meter is required for doing this. The recent improvements in these instruments, by which their convenience and accuracy have both been increased, have made it a simple matter to prepare a discharge table for flumes in which the flow is reasonably uniform. With ordinary care this discharge can be determined within the limits of accuracy permitted by the meter employed, and in the best instruments this error is as low as 1 per cent. This margin of error is below what is permissible in the delivery of water, or attainable in this investigation. DISTRIBUTION. Afttr the middle of July. 1919, there was a scarcity of water in the North Platte Valley, which required a restriction of water supply to all canals. There were a few canals having junior rights closed for a short period. The problem of water distribution has become more complicated since storage water and return flow have become large factors in the flow of the North Platte river. With no storage water in the river, the distribution is a simple matter providing the return flow is taken to be a part of the natural flow. Receiving just enough storage water at state line to supply storage contracts does not complicate the distribution to any extent, but too much storage water must be considered as natural flow and distributed to appropriators in the order of their priority, notwithstanding protests by those projects who have purchased storage water. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 15 Based on acreage reports filed, the following irrigable areas were provided (or in the water delivery schedules for the seasons of 1919 During the period of scarcity in August, 1919, orders were issued to the water commissioner of the 1-A watershed to close ditches having appropriations dating later than October 17, 1S89. leaving only seven ditches cpen to divert the natural flow from the North Platte River. Two of these ditches purchased and were taking storage water. The amount of water flowing in the river crossing the Nebraska- Wyoming line during this period fluctuated from 50 second feet to 400 second feet. Four of the canals not closed were demanding 300 second feet of natural flow not including the North Platte and Kearney Canals, and six other canals were demanding 481 second feet of storage water. The Mitchell Canal was diverting as high as 300 second feet of water which belongs to prior appropriators during this period. The officers of the Mitchell Irrigation District were brought into the county court of Scotts Bluff County, charged with taking water without authority. The Judge found for the district on the ground that the state did not have jurisdiction. The water was intercepted in Wyoming, hence not public water in Nebraska. Bulletins were prepared twice a week during the 1919 and 1920 seasons, showing the indicated discharge of the North Platte, South Platte and Platte Rivers, and once a week showing discharge of those canals cooperating with the department. and and 1920: I I Water Division 1 A 1919 Acre* I I 1920 Acre* Dirrrtrd from Kirrr — East of Bridgeport West of Bridgeport 122.794 178.943 158.218 227.171 Dirrrlril frnm Ti ilititn, i, n— East of Bridgeport Wettt of Bridgeport ; 34.918 8.307 35.828 5.263 Total i 342.980 l_ 428.280 i I IVater Division IB Water Division 1-C IVater Division ID Water Division 1-E IVater Division 2-A Water Division 2-B Water Division 2-C iVater Division 2D Water Division 2-E 11.745 80 13.390 7.365 5.871 3.450 2.1113 Total in Nebraska.

The salary of water commissioners is too small to interest the class of men required for the duties of the office. The salary should be raised to six dollars per day and expenses. Section 34T.S, Rev. Stat. 1913 should be amended so as to require - county clerks to certify to the Department of Public Works the boundary and description of lands included in the irrigation district as finally determined by the county commissioners. A law should be placed in the statutes providing that plans and specifications for improvements contemplated in connection with appro - priations of public waters for any beneficial use shall be approved by the Department of Public Works before the state purchases the bonds issued therefor.

All of the canals whose priority was dated ufter the year 1889 were closed in order to supply prior appropriations. This condition was brought about twice during the season, and extended over a period of from two to three weeks. No serious difficulties arose over the closing of these canals. due to the better understanding of existing laws by the water users themselves. Also, lisht showers during this period had a tendency to improve growing conditions, and kept the crops from drying up until the shortage of water was relieved. Lack of proper diversion dams and rating flumes caused some dilficulty, but this Mi the most harmful to the water user himself, because the intake of the canals was left high and dry. causing the removal of a great deal of sediment before water could be diverted again. This, in turn, caust &lt;1 ■ serious delay in applying water to the already suffering crops when permission was finally granted to do so. The larger canals were and always are in much better condition than are the smaller ones. Most of the smaller appropriators are negligent relative to installing proper diversion works, rating flumes and automatic water gages. The latter condition is fast being remedied and the majority of the ditch owners have already installed or ordered their gages. However, to insure the most satisfactory results, the installing of these gages must be accompanied by proper diversion works and rating flumes. A thorough cleaning of the ditches at least once in a season would also benefit the user by insuring quicker delivery and easier control. The season of 1920 passed by with only one complaint. This complaint was, in my opinion, more of a misunderstanding of the law rather than the scarcity of water. The season itself passed by with abundant water for all. Another phase of the Water Commissioners "troubles" is the wasting of water onto the public highways. Very little was done to relieve this condition during the season of 1919, but the necessary steps to a good beginning were taken in 1920. and several careless water users were brought before a Justice and the customary fine for the first offense was imposed.

Johnson, Secretary, Department of Public Works, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: The following is a brief report of the general condition of Water Division No. 1-A, comprising the watersheds within the limits- of Scotts- Bluff County, from the 28th day of May, 1920, at which time I received appointment as Water Commissioner for this district: The flow of water in the Platte River and its tributaries has at all times been sufficient for irrigation and power purposes, and I have not been called upon to regulate its distribution to the several headgates. There was some difficulty between the users of Applications Nos. 407 and 983 on Horse Creek, but this matter was 1 purely one of ownership in the carrying canal, which naturally involved the distribution of water in the canal. The distribution, only, was adjusted. There also arose some difficulty in the distribution of water in lateral No. 2 of the Gering Canal. With the exception of a short period, there was no lateral rider on this canal, and while there was usually plenty of water in the lateral, the us«rs at the lower end of the lateral received little or none. Proper results were not obtained up to the close of the season. The above two cases were the only ones of any importance in this district, and very little complaint was received outside of these two. It seems to be rather difficult to handle cases such as the Gering Lateral No. 2. under the present laws, without entailing a hardship on those who use water in the proper manner, as well as on those who do not. From my observations on this and othev laterals, I conclude that no lateral having a number of users' can be successfully operated from a standpoint of the conservative, a most beneficial use of the water, without the employment of a rider and the installation of proper turnout boxes and checks; and I would think that all districts or private canals should be required to see that such boxes and checks are installed, and that where there are a number of users from one lateral, it should be the business of such district or canal to see that a rider was employed. Respectfully submitted O. M. FINLEY, Water Commissioner. </seg>

Johnson, Secretary, Department of Public Works, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: There is always an abundance of water in spring and fall for all the ditches that use water, and some to spare. The dry season starts from the middle of May to the middle of June, and continues to August and September. In the dry season I close from three to seven ditches on the Frenchman to supply water to prior water users. They are closed from ten days to two and three weeks 1 — sometimes as long as six and eight weeks. I have closed no ditches on the Republican for prior water users. In the dry season the Republican goes dry from Benkleman to the mouth of the Frenchman. The ditches in this division, with a few exceptions, have dirt dams, some that are rebuilt every season or after every big rain when water is needed. Others have permanent dirt dams with spill gates made of lumber or steel to control height of water in ditches, some that are easy to handle and others that take two or three men to operate There was one ditch that built a rating flume in 1919 that was very good; another ditch built one, it was all right in width but too short In 1920 they built on enough to make it all right. Five other ditches built rating flumes this summer. Six automatic gage height recorders were installed this season, three more on hand to be installed in the spring. There should be eight more automatic gage height recorders installed in this division, unless the ditches on Buffalo Creek do not intend to use water. There are six ditches on the Republican that have been used very little, if any, in the past two or three years that should be put in shape or cancelled, as there are parties that would make more use of the water if they knew that these ditches would not interfere. They are Campbell, Cannon, Delaware, Kurr &amp; Riverside, Cottonwood and Anderson ditches. The last two named are very small, and would not amount to much if they did use water. The rating flume in the McCook Ditch Co.'s ditch is too wide and low. All the ditches on the Republican and Red Willow east of McCook in Red Willow County have been abandoned from three to fifteen years. Respectfully submitted. FLOYD F. BAILEY, Water Commissioner. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 REPORT OF SECRETARY IRRIGATION LEGISLATION. The first l.-.w relative to irrigation was passed by the legislature of the state in 1S77. This law enabled corporations formed to construct anil operate canals for irrigation and other purposes to acquire rights of way. and declared fuch works internal improvements. The Saint Raynor law, the first general irrigation law, was- passed in 1889. It provided for the appropriation of running waters for useful or beneficial purposes by posting a notice at the point of diversion, a copy of the notice to be filed with the county clerk of the county in which the diversion was located, and construction to be begun within 60 days and prosecuted diligently and uninterruptedly to completion. The law provided that irrigation works should be exempt from taxation ;that the same land should not be covered by more than one ditch or lateral without the owner's consent; that irrigation works were internal improve - ments; that water from one stream should not be turned into another stream; that rights of way could be condemned for irrigation purposes; that excessive amounts of water should not be used, and that the waters appropriated should be distributed in certain ways. Under this law, there was no way of knowing the value of a right except by going into court, and a right was always open to attack. The people of the western portion of the state wished to have some rtato control over rights and in 1891 an irrigation convention was held at Lincoln, and drafted a bill. This bill was introduced in the Legislature that winter, but was defeated. Another bill, almost identical with the first, was introduced in the Legislature in 1893, but was defeated after a spirited fight, and the friends of irrigation had to be contented with an amendment to the Saint Raynor law, allowing water rights to be filed on streams 20 feet or over in width, and permitting water, under certain conditions, to be turned from one stream into another. The members of the Legislature from the eastern portion of the state feared that the passage of an irrigation code would be looked upon as an advertisement to the outside world that the rainfall in the state was not sufficient to produce crops, and that this would have a tendency to check settlement. The complete failure of all crops because of the drought in 1894, caused the question of adopting an irrigation code to be made a campaign issue that fall. The Legislature, in 1895, passed an Irrigation code modeled after the Wyoming code, and also an irrigation district law modeled after the Wright irrigation district law of California. The irrigation code created a State Board of Irrigation, consisting of the Governor, the Attorney General, and the Commissioner of Public Lands, the Governor being ex-omcio president of the board, and divided the state Into two water districts. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 21 The law provided that at the first meeting of the state board it should elect a secretary, who should be a hydraulic engineer of theoretical knowledge and practical skill and experience, and an under secretary for each of the water divisions, and that it could employ an assistant secretary and such other assistants as might be necessary. The board either directly or through its secretary or under secretaries, was charged with the measurement of all streams in the state, the determina - tion of priorities, and amounts of all claims initiated prior to the passage of the law. and the issuance of certificates of appropriation for claims found valid, the distribution of all waters appropriated, the receiving, recording and considering of ail future applications for permits to appropriate water, the granting of permits, if there was any unappro - priated water in the streams, and the appropriation asked for would not in any other way be detrimental to the public welfare, and the issuance of certificates of appropriation when satisfied that the applications had been perfected according to law. This law, besides granting the board certain police powers and fixing penalties, defined standards of measurement; dedicated the water of the state to public use; fixed the date of priority of applications and the order of preference in using water for different purposes; granted the right of eminent domain for irrigation works; exempted irrigation works from taxation, and provided for mutual irrigation companies. In 1895 to 1911 a number of minor changes were made in the irriga tion code, most of which were for the purpose of assisting the state board in its administrative work. At the sessions of the Legislature in 1911 and 1913. practically the entire code was revised and re-enacted with amendments. Among some of the more important changes made were the following: The "State Board of Irrigation" was changed to the "State Board of Irrigation, Highways, and Drainage"; the board was charged with the duty of examining into the condition of all water appropriations and of holding hearings and cancelling rights where the water had not been used for beneficial purposes for more than three years; the maximum amount of water that a tract could receive was limited to 3 acre-feet per acre per year; irrigation works were declared common carriers and the rates for water were to be determined by the State Railway Com - mission, and the list of all lands to be irrigated were required to be filed with the superintendent of each water division April 1 of each year. The Irrigation district law has been amended from time to time since its passage in 1895. The main provisions at present are at follows: A majority ot the elector*, who also own or hold by leasehold a majority of the lands in the district susceptible of irrigation from a common system of works, may petition the county commissioner* ot the county In which the land, or the greater portion ot It lies, aiklng that an </seg>

A copy of the plans, etc., submitted to the county commissioners, must be filed with the state engineer, who must examine them and submit a report to the board of county commissioners at the meeting set for the hearing of the petition. If the petition, either in its original form or in the amended form, is approved by the board of county commissioners, the board divides the proposed district into three divisions, and calls an election to vote upon the organization of an irrigation district, and to elect a director for each division, if the vote is favorable to organization. If, upon canvassing the vote the county commissioners find a majority favorable to organiza- Cn, the district it- declared organized, and the directors elected meet i organize. The board of directors has control of the affairs of the district in a general way and is authorized to make surveys, acquire rights of way, and to secure lands, water or other property by purchase or condemnation. All surveys, maps, plans and estimates must be made under the direciton of a competent engineer and sent to the state engineer, who shall file a report upon them with the board of directors. Having determined the amount of money required, the board of directors calls a special election to vote on the question of issuing bonds, and it a majority of the votes are in favor of issuing bonds, a special proceeding is begun in the district court to have the bonds examined, approved and confirmed. If the bonds are confirmed they are sent, together with a history of the district, to the auditor of public accounts for registration if he finds the law has been conformed with in all respects. When registered, the bonds may be sold at 95 per cent of their face value, or if not sold, can be used to pay lor property or for construction at their par value. The bonds and interest are paid from the revenues derived from an annual assessment upon the real estate in the district. They bear interest at 6 per cent, and unless otherwise provided by a majority vote at the time of issuance, a certain per cent is payable each year, beginning with the expiration of the eleventh year. This per cent cannot be less than 5 at the end of the eleventh year. After the eleventh year the minimum increases 1 per cent a year through the eighteenth year, and is 15 per cent in the nineteenth year. All the bonds must be paid upon the expiration of the twentieth year. The secretary of the board of directors certifies to the county clerk the amount of money needed each year for the payment of interest, bonds and for operation and main - tenance, and the taxes are collected by the county treasurer at the same time that other county taxes are collected. The Department of Public Works under the Civil Administrative Code form of government as adopted in 1919, succeeds the State Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage. Under the old law, it was necessary that all matter* be submitted to the State Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage, and the final hearing be held In Lincoln and passed on by the board before any case could be carried to the higher courts. In some cases, before a quorum </seg>
            <seg id="p023">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WOKKS 23 of the board could meet and consider the matter, crops were burned and destroyed. Under the code, the Chief of the Bureau of Irrigation, Power anc Drainage is located in the center of the irrigation district, and he has full authority to hold hearings and adjust all matters with reference to irrigation. The department has outlined definite policies and the chie is authorized to carry rut same, so that any difficulty arising can be adjusted immediately and during shortage of water the official on the ground has full authority to handle all matters to the best interest o the irrigators, and if at any time such matters can not be adjusted by the chief, the secretary of the department is in position to give immediate assistance. Information concerning water rights can be obtained by inspecting the records of the department and by consulting the secretary. The irrigation laws have been published in pamphlet form, and copies may be obtained by addressing the Department of Public Works at Lincoln. </seg>

Description of System Operated. The irrigation system operated extends from the headworks at Whalen, Wyoming, to within two miles ot Indian Creek, or about 10 miles northwest of Bridgeport, Nebraska. The first 46 miles of main canal extends from the headworks to the sand hills northeast of Torrington. and is known as the First Division Main Canal. Along this section of canal the only land watered is the Carey Act land, and for which land the government docs not own nor operate the lateral system, but simply delivers the water from the main canal to the head of their laterals. 2. The irrigated lands of the project extend southeasterly from the sand hills northeast of Torrington to the lower end of the canal system, and covers about 111,900 acres of irrigated land, or a strip of land approximately six miles wide and sixty miles long, which is divided into three lateral districts. The first lateral district extends from the sand hills to Dry Spottedtail Creek, and contains 39,300. acres of irrigable land; the second lateral district from Dry Spottedtail Creek to Winters Creek, and contains 33,400 acres of irrigable land, and the third lateral district from Winters Creek to the lower end, and contains 39,200 acres of irrigable land. 3. Weather. The climatic conditions were in general favorable. The season of 1919 was particularly free from damaging winds and storms, but so extremely dry from the 1st of April to the 11th of September that there was an exceptionally heavy demand on the irriga - tion system during that time On the 11th of September the drouth was broken by a heavy rain of from 4 to 5 inches, which was general over the entire valley. The season of 1920 has had the most favorable climatic conditions since the beginning of farming operations on this project.

On the 3d lateral district some of the first structures placed in 1910 on the 26 and 27 lateral systems were also made of untreated lumber, and these, too, have deteriorated so badly that it may be neces - sary to renew them in the next two or three years. All of the structures placed in this lateral district since 1910 have been made of lumber treated with carbolincum, or railroad oil. These treated structures, some of which have been in the ground for nine years, are still in such good condition that but very little decay in the lumber has been noticed on any of them. 17. Concrete Structures. The concrete structures are practically all in as good condition as when new. 18. Metal Flumes. The metal flumes are all more or less affected by rust. The flume on lateral 34 was in the spring of 1918 (ound to be in a very bad condition on account of the rust having penetrated through the metal so badly that the bottom part of the metal flume was full of little holes varying from the size of a plnhole to about % inch across. This was temporarily remedied by applying one coat of coal tar to the inside of the flume. The coal tar seemed to seal all the holes so well that no trooblo from leakage has been had since theu. In 11*16 and 1917 several flumes were painted with water gas and coal tar, and this paint has stuck very good, and seems to bo about as good now as when first put on. Prior to that time the experience had with a variety of paints tried on metal flumes was that the paint would peel off during its first water season. It. therefore, appears that water gas and coal tar is a very good paint for metal flumes, and it is also a cheap paint. 19. Gophers. The gopher trouble this year was about the same as in the past, although considerable trapping and poisoning wac done by some of the riders. Several boxes of poison were used by the riaers with a variable degree of success Some of the riders kept their rides very free from gophers, while others did net seem to have much success It appeared, however, that the success in poisoning the gophers depended large-y on the interest the individual took in the work.

In 1917 there was practically ing done towards combating this pest. In 1918 considerable poison - was done by a number of individuals, but no concerted effort was c for the eradication of the grasshoppers. During the winter of ■19 a new pest law, moie suitable for this country, was passed, and the valley was divided and organized in pest districts, and ploi.s e for an extensive grasshopper campaign. Five mixing plants were nged for — one at each of the following towns: Morriil, Mitchell, Scottsbluff, Minatare and Bayard. A little concrete mixer operated by a gas engine was used at each plant for mixing the ingredients used for grasshopper poison and which consisted of bran, arsenic, anise oil, sal soda, and molasses. This preparation was mixed and sacked Into 100 E&lt;i sacks and sold to the farmers at cost. A total of 8,227 sacks of poison was used on the project in 1919, and the results were in ral very gratifying. This same campaign was continued during the &gt;n of 1920, but with only two mixing plants Instead of five — one at tare and one at Bayard, and a total of 1,580 sacks of poison were used on the project lander. This work was under the supervision of Mr. Phil Sheldon, Project and County Agent. One inspector was used to ?ee that the poisoning was properly and consistently carried out. At the close of the 1920 season there were very few places where any noticeable damage was being done by the grasshoppers. 21. Operation and Maintenance Costs.

            <seg id="p031">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 31 22 Experiment Farm. The work at the expirement farm under the supervision of James A. Holden has been both experimental and demon strative The principal experiments have been for the purpose 01 testing out the adaptability of the various crops to these climatic and soil conditions, the importance of seed selection, rotation of crops under irrigation, cultural treatment, fertilizing tests, duty of water to various crops and .to a certain extent the feeding values of the various crops produced under local "conditions. Besides the above, there have bean for the past few years a series of feeding experiments carried on for the purpose of determining the lowest possible cost of the production of boef, pork and mutton from home grown feed. There is also a demonstration dairy, principally for the purpose of determining the value of the various pasture grasses for milk production. These experiments and demonstrations 1 are of vital interest to the farmers .and the farmers have also exhibited a great interest in this experiment farm work by their frequent visits, telephone calls and correspondence for advice and for a discussion on all kinds of farm am stock questions. The annual experiment farm picnic last summer tu well attended and enjoyed by people from all over the valley. 23. Settlement and Development. The general condition of th settlers on the project has continued to improve. This improved condi tion is due principally to the good crops, exceptionally good prices fo all produce, a general increase in the amount of stock raising, stock feeding and dairying, improved conditions of credit, increased confldenc in the agricultural possibilities of the country, and an increasingl co-operative attitude and mutual trust between the settlers and th reclamation service. 24. Commercial Development. There were no new enterprises In operation on the project in 1919, but in 1920 a new sugar factory was built at Mitchell, and sugar beet spurs were built out over the project lands from Mitchell, Scottsbluff and Bayard. As a result of these extensions by the Great Western Sugar Company, the acreage of sugar beets was increased from 11,000 acres in 1919 to 17,500 acres in 1920. Several other enterprises, such as creameries, pickle factories and other smaller concerns have also been built during the year. Another sugar factory has been commenced at Minatare which will be ready for the 1921 crop. 25. Land Transfers. During the year 1919 approximately 300 farms on the project changed hands and about 100 farms in 1920. at an average price of $110.00 per acre of irrigable land. The maximum price paid was about $325.00 per acre. There are no unentered lands on the project that are now subject to entry. 26. Northport Unit. A petition for the organization of an irrigation district was filed in the Department of Public Works, and same was approved August 18, 1917. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 RKPORT OF SECRETARY Construction work on this unit has proceeded slowly, due to scarcity of funds. A permanent construction camp, designed to serve ultimately for operation and maintenance purposes, has been established. Approxi - mately 3 miles of main canal have been completed. In addition, the lateral system has been built (or about 2,500 acres of land in Indian Creek Valley. The cross-drainage structures are nearing completion on the upper ten miles of the main canal. A contract has been executed between the United States and the Bridgeport Electric Light and Power Company for furnishing the necessary energy to operate one electric dragline excavator, to be used on the main canal. The transmission lines and sub-stations required for its operation are in place, and operation of this electric excavator began about October 1, 1920. For excavating the heavier portions of this canal a class 14 gasoline driven Bucyrus dragline excavator has been contracted for. the delivery of which will be made in the early spring of 1921. This machine will be equipped with an 80 foot boom to facilitate the deep cutting necessary in these portions. It is hoped that during the coming biennium progress will be accelerated materially by reason of increased allotments. By the close of the calendar year 1920 a total of about $270,000.00 will have been expended on the construction of the Northport unit. 27. Fort Laramie Unit. A petition was presented to the board of county commissioners, copy of which was filed in the Department of Public Works, praying for the organization of an irrigation district. This petition was approved September 26, 1918. On this unit construction Has continued slowly owing to restricted funds. Nearly all construction has so far been confined to the upper, or Wyoming portion. In Nebraska, the main body of the Horse Creek lateral has been excavated with one of the electric dragline excavators. Approximately $55,000.00 has been expended on this feature. Likewise, a portion of the main canal immediately east of the state line, involving an expenditure of about $30,000.00. To this is to be added a system of high tension (33,000 volt) transmission lines and sub-stations, involving a total outlay of about $30,000.00, and a permanent construction camp with well equipped repair shops for making the numerous incidental repairs 1 incident to this class of work. The future rate of progress of this work will be governed by the allotments which congress may make available for this feature. 28. Pathfinder Unit. During the year 1919 it was decided to increase the outlet capacity of the reservoir, as well as to increase the security of operation by the installation of two additional outlet valves. These are to be of the same capacity and similar, but of improved con - struction to those now used. They will be connected with the north tunnel outlet. Construction of this feature is now under way, but has only been fairly started. </seg>
            <seg id="p033">DKPART1IENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 29. Interstate Unit. Practically no new construction hag been undertaken aside from drainage, described in the following paragraph. Most of the construction has been in the nature of replacements of wooden structures elsewhere described. In addition, two dragline excavators of the Monighan walking type were employed In widening and strengthening the main canal during 1919, and one during 1920. These machines have moved the material at an average cost of about 15 cents per cubic yard, nearly all in wet ground. Drainage — Interstate Unit. Generally speaking, the water table has ripen over the project and seeped areas have spread. This is being combatted by continuous drainage construction of both open and closed drains. The soil structure is such that closed drains are built with great difficulty after the water rises above the grade of the drain. This is frequently later followed with maintenance difficulties. Owing to these facts and the heavy capacity demands, by far the greatest mileage is built of open construction. To date 14 miles of closed drains and 52 miles of open drains have been built and are in successful operation, principally in the first and second lateral districts. Two dragline excavators of the Monighan walking type are continuously employed in the extension of the open drainage system. Much of this work has, during the last biennium, been done on principal outlet drains connecting the Interstate unit lands with the river and extending through the Farmers Irrigation District land and other lower lying districts with whom co-operative contracts have been made covering these works. These latter are essentially flood water channels which serve the dual purpose of carrying flood waters from the catchment basin above and within the project lands and also the waste and seepage waters which are collected from the adjacent irrigated areas within and below the project to the river. The maintenance of these channels has so far been a problem of great difficulty, especially in those portions where heavy gradients prevail, and where large floods are frequently collects We have not gotten much beyond the experimental stage in this kind o work. Little difficulty is encountered in the construction and mainte ance of open collecting drains because the discharges are moderate in amount as compared vith the principal flood channels. During the pas biennium one or two dragline excavators have been continually at wor excavating on the main outlet channels in Wild Horse and Nine Ml valleys, which are being built co-operatively between the Farmers Irrigation District and other private districts together with the United States, the cost being distributed to these co-operating districts on th basis of the tributary irrigable areas. This method of cost apportio ment has become the usual and standard custom in this valley on these channels. </seg>

The Farmers Irrigation District canal and lateral system is located in Scotts Bluff and Morrill Counties, the main headgate being locate* within one mile of the Nebraska-Wyoming state line, near the town o Henry, Nebraska. The following towns are In the immediate vicinity of the lands irrigated by this district, the approximate population o each being: Morrill, 700; Mitchell, 2,000; Scottsbluff, 7.000; Minatare 500, and Bayard, 2,500. A sugar factory is located at Mitchell, Scotts - bluff and Bayard, and two factories are to be built at Minatare during the coming year. A needle dam, built of steel and concrete, is constructed entirely across the North Platte River, just below the headgate, and is reenforced with 400 carloads of iron ore rock. A rock apron, sixty feet wide on the lower side and twenty-five feet wide on the upper side, averaging four feet in thickness, makes the dam as substantial as possible. The headgate is made of concrete and steel, with steel shutter gates. There are three wasteways lined with concrete, built to the river for the purpose of regulating the flow of water in the cana'. and to take care of the water when flood conditions prevail, or when a break occurs in the canal. The water supply for the irrigation of lends of the district is ample and sure, a permanent water right having been purchased from the United States Reclamation Service in the Great Pathfinder Reservoir, located forty-eight miles northwest of Casper, Wyoming. This Insures a good supply of water for the irrigation season regardless of whether the river is high or low. The length of the main canal is 96 miles. There are two hundred and thirty-five miles of laterals and eight' miles of drainage canals to take care of seepage and flood waters. Two hundred and sixty-one structures are located on the main canal, being composed of the following: 12 steel bridges. 56 wooden tridgea, 9 concrete checks, 14 wooden checks, 100 steel and concrete haadgates, 26 wooden gates, 12 concrete culverts, 21 tiled pipe culverts, aid 11 timber and concrete head gates. On the canal system, there are 2,782 laterals and drainage structures. The entire system is valued at $2,500,000.00, and has a total o 65,000 acres in the district, of which 63,000 acres are irrigable and approximately 50,000 acres are under a high state of cultivation. The lands under the district are valued a) 113,500,000.00, and the canal haa been in successful operation for the tast six years*. The upper portion of the canal has been in operation for about ten years. The distric </seg>

The bonded debt of the district is $2,203,000.00. These bonds begin to fall due in 1923, and the present plan is that they will be paid off in ten years. The present organization of the district is as follows: the board of directors, consisting of three members, one of the members 1 being president of the board; secretary-treasurer, engineer and manager, attorney and district assessor. The district is divided into three divisions, and contains about tbe same acreage in each division. A director is elected from each division by the land owners each year. Each division has a foreman, who has charge of and is responsible for the work done by men under him and for the delivery of water to the land in his- division. There are 24 canal riders, or water masters. The value of the 1919 crop raised on lands under the district was approximately $4,500,000.00 Money for operating and maintaining the canal lateral system and building drainage canals is obtained by assess - ment on the lands under the district, made by the board of directors each year. The board of directors of the district meets as a board of equalization in June of each year and fits as such board for a period of ten days for the purpose of equalizhg the assessments which have been made by the district assessor. When the equalization is finished, the valuation of the lands as equalized by the board of equalization is ascertained, said board then proceeds to nake the levy for the current year — so many mills tor each dollar of valiatlon for general fund and so many mills for the interest coupon fund. As soon as the levy is made, warrants on the Farmers Irrigation District, signed by the president an* secretary, may be issued from time to tine as needed, and sold for cash to investors in securities. Warrants may be drawn up to ninety per cent of the total levy made. The irrigation tax is paid to the county treasurer, along with the state and county taxes. The land owner can not pay his 1 state and county tax without paying his irrigation tax at the same time. The Irrigation tax is then a lUn on the land. The warrants are issued and paid in consecutive order— that is to say all 1919 warrants must be paid before any 1920 warrants are paid. The warrants' run from eleven to eighteen months before bekig called for payment. The funds for the district are drawn from tbe county treasurer's office in the sums from $5,000 to $40,000.00 The alstrict treasurer then calls for payment for as many warrants as the money received from the county treasurer will allow to be paid. These war-ants may be termed a gilt-edge invest - ment for in some ways they are considered better than a first mortgage on the land. These warrants draw seven per cent interest from date until paid. </seg>

These two enterprises are so closely related that it will be best to consider them together. In July, 1893, Reuben Lisco posted a notice of appropriation for 32.86 second feet of water to be diverted on the north bank of the North Platte River, in section 14, township 18 north, range 47 west, and built the Lisco Canal, which was five miles long, for the purpose of irrigating his own lands. In 1896, the North River Irrigation Canal and Water Power Company was organized and made an application for a water right for 168.29 second feet of water. This company pro - posed to irrigate a stretch of territory east of that watered from the Lisco Ditch and desired to use the same right of way. A contract was entered into whereby the company enlarged the Lisco Canal, and in return agreed to carry free of charge the water to which Lisco was entitled. The company was composed entirely of farmers, who worked out the stock subscribed for upon the following basis: The entire yard - age to be removed was estimated, from which the number of yards to be moved for each 40 acre tract was determined. The farmers built 33 miles of canal in addition to enlarging the five miles of the Lisco Ditch during the year 1896-1898. According to the yardage estimates made, it would have cost $33,000 to build the canal by contract. The Lisco Canal formerly covered 1,500 acres, and the contemplated canal brought an additional 12,000 acres under the ditch. Water was used by the farmers in this larger area for several years; then dissen - sions over the use of the water arose and the ditch was allowed to deterioriate. It was not used after 1900, when a large break occurred In the Sand Draw which was never repaired. When the company failed to keep the canal in repair, in accordance with the contract, Lisco was forced to keep the upper end in running order to supply water to his lands. He immediately brought an action, and obtained a decree giving him his water right and the five miles of the canal on his former right of way. He then attached the canal of the company for the costs of the suit and took possession of the upper seven miles, thus making the Lisco Canal twelve miles long instead of five. In 1910 Lisco made an application for 3 second feet additional, in order to cover all the lands below the canal. He then listed his own lands for sale, attaching a water right to each tract sold. A mutual company, with a capital stock of $20,000, was organized and took over the management of the On May 1, 1918, a petition signed by 16 of the land owners was presented to the County Commissioners of Garden County, copy of which is on file in this department, same having been approved May 1, 1918.

A second foot ia water flowing continuously at such a rate that one cubic foot passes a given point in one second of time. An acre foot is water one foot deep upon one acre of land. 1 Acre foot equals 43,560 cubic feet equals 325,851 U. S. gallons. 1 Second-foot will supply one acre foot 12, 1 hours. 1 U. S. gallon = 231 cubic inches. 1 cubic foot = 7 . 48 U. S. gallons. 1 cubic foot of water weighs 1,000 ounces or 62.5 pounds avoirdupois. 1 U. S. gallon of water weighs 8.355 pounds avoirdupois. 1 horsepower is equivalent to raising 33,000 pounds one foot in one minute. 1 second-foot falling 8.8 feet is equivalent to one theoretical horse - power. 20 per cent of the theoretical horsepower is generally allowed for the friction of machinery, etc.. leaving 80 per cent for the net horse - power, therefore one second foot falling 11 feet = one available horse - power (9D per cent efficiency). About ten per cent of this is lost when converted into electrical energy. 1 volt ampere = .0013405 horsepower. The approximate rate of flow of water in open channels may be found by observing the velocity of a float on the surface of the stream. The velocity is greatest at the surface and least along the bottom and sides, being there retarded by friction. Careful experiments have shown that the mean velocity is about 84 per cent of the maximum central surface velocity. The mean rate of flow is at six-tenths of the depth measured from the surface. The most approved formula for determining the flow of water in canals is Kutter's: In this formula v = the mean velocity in feet per second. r = the hydraulic radius or mean depth in feet = the area of cross section in square feet divided by the wetted perimeter or width along the bottom and sides in feet. s ■ the slope; that is the fall of the surface in any distance divided by that distance. n = a co-efficient of roughness, varying in value from .010 for straight channels with smooth, glazed surfaces, to .035 for canals and rivers in bad order, having stones, detritus and aquatic plants in great quantities.

            <seg id="p059">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS TRAPEZOIDAL WEIRS. As a result of experiments made in Italy in 1886 by Cippoletti. he adopted a trapezoidal weir, the sides of which have an inclination of one - fourth horizontal to one vertical. This is based on the theory that the effective length / of a restangular weir being less than its true length owing to a contraction of the area if the weir be increased in propor - tion to its depth (since contraction increases in this ratio) and so as to balance the loss due in contraction, the flow through the weir will re - main the same as though the weir were rectangular without contraction. The conditions called for in placing a rectangular weir must be nearly fulfilled with a trapezoidal weir, but the distance of the sill of the weir from the bottom of the canal must be at least three times the depth of the weir, and its length must be at least three times the depah of the water flowing over it. This weir seems to possess some excellent qualities, the chief diffi - culty in connection with it being the same as arises in using the rectangu - lar weir, namely, that where silt laden water Is employed this may fill up above the front board of the weir. This weir may be used as a divisor, and for fairness of measurement is especially adapted to use on irrigation canals. Still water exerts a pressure of 62.5 pounds per square foot, or .434 pounds per square inch, for each foot of depth. It is equal in all direc - tions, downwards, upwards, or sideways, and is independent of the shape or size of the containing vessel. This pressure is due solely to the "head" or height of the level surface of the water above the point at which the pressure is considered, and, to be exact, is equal to .43302 pounds per square inch for every foot of head, or 62.335 pounds per square foot for every foot of head (at 62 degrees F). The pressure of water against a vertical surface, as a retaining wall, at any point is in direct ratio to the head above that point, increasing from O at the level to a maximum at the bottom. The total pressure against a vertical strip of a unit's breadth increases as the area of a right-angfed triangle whose perpendicular represents the height of the strip, and whose base represents the pressure on a unit of surface at the bottom; that is. it increases as the square of the depth. The sum of all the horizontal pressures is represented by the area of the triangle, and the resultant is equal to this sum exerted at a point one - third of the height from the bottom. (The center of gravity of the area of a triangle is one-third of its height.) The horizontal pressure upon a vertical section' of a dam, 1 foot in width, is 31.25 pounds multiplied by the square of the depth of water in feet. </seg>

            <seg id="p076">76 REPORT OF SECRETARY CLAIMS AND APPLICATIONS GRANTED, PENDING AND ABANDONED. The following tables give a complete list of all claims and applica - tions for water granted by the Department of Public Works and which have never been cancelled; also claims and applications pending. Following each division will show table of abandoned claims and applica - tions which our records show are subject to cancellation. In these tables, the claims and applications have been arranged in each water division by stream in alphabetical order, and the appropria - tions on each stream are arranged according to priority on that stream. Those having docket numbers are claims made covering rights acquired under the law prior to April 4, 1895, and those having application numbers are applications for permits to appropriate water made under the law of 1895. Appropriations marked "O. D." designate other than the original diversion and carry the priority date of the original appropriation. </seg>

            <seg id="p193">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS WATER POWER. Water Power in Nebraska. The first law relating to the use of water for irrigation or water power was passed by the Legislature of 1877. This law was very brief and merely gave to companies desiring to construct such work the right of eminent domain and declared them to be works of internal improve - ment. No mention whatever was made of any course of procedure whereby title or the right of property to the use of water could be ac - quired.* The next legislation covering the use of water was passed by the Legislature of 1889. This act provided the right to acquire the use by appropriation of running water flowing in any river or stream or down any canyon or ravine; provided that the same be used for beneficial or useful purposes, and that when any appropriator or successor in interest ceased to use the water so appropriated for such a purpose the right ceased ; that no land was to be burdened with more than one ditch, with - out the consent of the owner thereof; that all ditches were exempt from taxation; that the point of diversion might be changed if others were not injured; that the water so diverted must be returned to the stream from which it was taken; that as between appropriators the one first in time was first in right; that a notice be posted by flie party desiring to appropriate water at the point of intended diversion, stating the point of diversion, the amount of appropriation, the purpose for which claimed, the place of intended use, and the means by which it was intended to divert; that a copy of the notice be recorded in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the notice was posted; that excavation must commence within sixty days from the time of posting notice and continue to completion; that completion meant conducting the water to the place of intended use; that a permanent right was granted to the use of all water beneficially used through ditches which had previously been completed; that the owners of land bordering on streams were en - titled to use of water on adjoining lands; that the right was given for condemnation for right-of-way; sites for reservoirs, and to enlarge ditches; that ditch companies were authorized to borrow money and issue bonds; that canals constructed for irrigating or water power pur - poses were declared works of internal improvement; that ditches must be kept in proper repair; and provided a penalty for interfering with ditches or gates. The next law governing the use of water was enacted by the Legis - lature of 1895, which passed the first comprehensive law regarding and • 8«uion Uwi of Nebraska for 1877. pate 1«8. t Seuion Laws of Nelirmik. for 1899, chapter M. pa(« 50S </seg>
            <seg id="p194">194 relating to the use of water for irrigation and water power purposes. The most important features of this law as pertaining to water power were as follows: The dedication of the water of every natural stream to public use; the right to divert unappropriated water for beneficial use was never to be denied; stated the priority of the use of water gave preference to the use as follows: First, for domestic use; second, for irrigation, and, third, for power and manufacturing purposes; divided the state into two water divisions and these divisions into districts; pro - vided for the measurement of water in streams; created the State Board of Irrigation; required county clerks to send certified copies of notices of all water appropriations on their records to the State Board; provided for the adjudication of existing rights by the State Board; provided for the future applications for appropriations of water; the examination and approval or disallowance of said applications; appeals from decision of the Board; and a complete record of all water rights to be kept in the office of the State Board.* This law has been amended from time to time and improvement in it made thereby. The State Board of Irrigation organized itself on April 24. 1895. being composed of the Governor, as President of the Board; the Attor - ney General and the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings. The State Board appointed its Secretary, State Engineer and other assistants, and at once prepared claim blanks which were sent to water users of record in the offices of the different county clerks, which were filled out and returned to the office of the State Board. Hearings were had on those claims and the rights of the different claimants adjudicated for convenience of keeping a record of these claims, the hearings were numbered in order in which they were held, and wero railed "Dockets". Thus all claims for the right to the use of water prior to April, 189 r . are known as "Dockets". Special attention is called to this for the rea - son that it is necessary to know the docket number of a particular water right in order to look it up. After a hearing on one of these claims which were presided over by the Secretary, an opinion was rendered by the State Board upon the evi - dence submitted, which determined the amount of water, the use to which it was applied, the point of diversion, the locations of the project. and the date of priority. These opinions are bound in book form in the Department of Public Works and binding except where appealed from to the District Court. For all water rights since April, 1895, the Board upon its organiza - tion at once prepared blanks, known as "Application Blanks", which were * Swsion Laws for 1895. chapter 69. pace 244 t Copiea of the claim blank? ufted for water power purposes toeether with eomplite record of adjudication of the water right may be found in flie Department of Public Worka. </seg>
            <seg id="p195">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WOUKS 195 supplied to persons desiring to obtain a permit for the use of waters of the State of Nebraska. These were filed on the date and hour received at the office of the Board, given a numerical number and recorded. AH rights, acquired since 1895, are therefore known as "Applicatoin No. ". These blanks, among other things, set forth the name of the applicant, his address, the source of the appropriation, amount, and use to which applied. The date of priority to the right to use water under all applications, dates from the filing of the application in the Depart - ment of Public Works, which is considered the date of priority. These applications are taken up and investigated and acted upon through the Secretary, same being approved or dismissed. Under the Civil Administrative Code form of government, which was passed by ihe legislature in 1919, the Department of Public Works re - places the State Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage, said de - partment exercises the power and performs the duties which were as - signed to the State Board of Irrigation. Highways and Drainage. The secretary ot the department, who is also the state engUeer, has full authority to act upon such matters coming before the department, and an applicant feeling himself aggrieved by the action taken by the sec retary on his application for a permit to appropriate water, may ask for a hearing, at which hearing testimony may be submitted for and against any proposed appropriation, the department having the right to summon any witnesses and in all things act as a court rendering a final decision in the matter, from which decision an applicant may appeal directly to the Supreme Court of the state, the same as in cases before the State Railway Commission. Cases pertaining to irrigation and water coming before the Supreme Court are advanced on the docket, so as to receive prompt consideration. Upon the allowance of an application, the applicant shall begin the actual work of excavation and construction within six months from the date of approval of said application. The application being in fact simply a permit to the right of the water and no perfected rights are supposed to have been acquired until the project has been completed ant the water beneficially used and applied. The work of construction of r power plant must be vigorously, diligently and uninterruptedly prosr cuted to completion and one-tenth of the total work must be completed within one year from the date of approval. Also :he applicant must file by the tenth of each month a report under oath to the department giv ing the actual amount of money expended on such power development during the preceding calendar month. The time for completing the appropriation and applying the water to beneficial use is left to the discretion of the department and in most cases a year is allowed after the completion of the construction work for </seg>
            <seg id="p196">REPORT OP SECRETARY 196 the application of water to beneficial use. When the time for applying the water to beneficial use has expired the applicant is required to file a Proof of Appropriation on a blank furnished by the Department of Pub - lic Works. This Proof of Appropriation shows how much water has been applied to beneficial use and the purpose, and is made under oath and attested to by witnesses. Upon receipt of this, the department makes a personal investigation and verifies the proof. If everything is found to be according to law the certificate is issued, which certificate grants the applicant the right to the use of the water which has been applied to the beneBcial purpose and the right to the use of the same for as long as the applicant shall apply the same to beneficial use. Under the law of 1911, three years consecutive non-use of water under any water right constitutes an abandonment and a forfeiture to the state. Report of Several Water Power Projects on the Loup and Platte River*, Together With Approximate Cost of Each, Amount of Power, and Probable Revenue From Same. (Geo. E. Johnson, Secretary) Nearly a quarter of a century ago, Mr. L. D. Richards, et al., filed upon the waters of the Platte River, for power, one year later, Mr. H. E. Babcock of Columbus filed on the waters of the Loup for irriga - tion and power. Surveys made by them showed possibilities of large water power developments. Companies were organized, engineers em - ployed and reports made by some of the leading engineers of that day, nearly all favorable. The mistake these men made was in trying to build too large developments. They were ahead of the market There has been a flood of filings since that time, some of which have real merit. The market at the present time is controlled by the various public utility companies in Omaha and Lincoln. It has increased so rapidly in the past live years, that it is doubtful if any one large plant from the Loup or Platte River can supply the demand. There has been a large amount of litigation in the past over water rights, and each session of the Legislature discusses state ownership with a result that there has been very little development, as the con - stant changing of laws regarding water power has had the effect of mak - ing the development of our water power unattractive to financiers. It is unfortunate that so many sites were available. Had there been only one, it undoubtedly would have been constructed many years ago. We are spending millions for good roads and reclamation of our arid land and swamp lands, but true conservation demands that all of </seg>
            <seg id="p197">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 197 our natural resources should be developed. Millions of dollars worth of coal are being used in our cities and factories, not a pound of which is produced in this state. We pay for the coal and freight. Nearly all of this could be saved by the development of our water power. Today the waters of the Loup and Platte flow silently away to sea, unharnessed and unobstructed. In the making of this report I have endeavored to be conservative, at the same time put it in shape so that all may understand. I have had access to the surveys and the private records of Messrs. McEathron and Ross of Omaha; also the reports of L. D. Hougb of New York; Geo W. Sturtevant of Chicago, and Dean &amp; Main's report. These reports have been changed to suit the recent changes in plans in both the upper and lower projects. Projects Reported Are as Follows 1. The revised Columbus Plan of 1911-1912. 2. The Schuyler Plan of Chas. T. Bogg, et al. 3. The Platte River Hydro-Electric, or Ross Project 4. The original Fremont Canal. 5. A proposed canal line North of Ames, and other projects on the Loup. Water Records and Stream Flows. The flow of the Loup and Platte Rivers is given in the U. 8. Geological and State Engineer's reports. Mr. Houghs' report on the Loup in 1905 gives as water available for Columbus plans as follows: 2500 C. F. S 40% of the time 2000 C. F. S 587c of the time 1560 C. F. S - 2% of the time 100% Later investigations and later actual measurements exceed in volume the old records, which were recorded* in a crude way. Both the Loup and the Platte show more water in their channels, owing to more careful gauging than formerly. Recent investigations show for the Loup at Columbus lOO^c &gt;vw v^. r . o ..• 1500 C. F\ S 1000 C. F. S sno r p s for over 40% of the time 20% of the time 35% of the time 2 to 5% of the time .50u U. r. o. </seg>

The effect of the Pathfinder dam, in releasing waters for irrigation, in the western part of the state has been to increase the flow in the lower reaches of the stream, a large percentage of the irrigation waters returning to the. parent stream in form of seepage. In time we will not hear of the Platte going dry west of Columbus, as formerly. Seepage and Evaporation. In the Dean &amp; Mains' report, — seepage in the Columbus Project with its 3400 acres of reservoirs was placed at 30 cubic feet per second, and evaporation at 60 C. F. S.. a total of 90 C. P. S. — about the same as Beaver Creek water flow at Genoa. Measurements by O. V. P. Stout at Kearney in 1906 shows the following loss by months: Which in the Columbus Canal and Reservoirs as formerly projected would amount to 9 or 107 ( of the flow in the Canal. This is off-set by 27 inches rainfall, which to some extent would reduce the percentage to 4 or 5; and a still further reduction when only 1000 acres of reservoirs are contemplated, brings it down to 2 or 2V47c, or about the same as Mains' report.

The Columbu* Plan of 1911-1912. First: This canal formerly used for irrigation purposes was filed upon by Babcock of Columbus in 1896, and 72 miles of canal and laterals were in active use for a period of five years. Three miles of canal have been built for power purposes, a reinforced concrete penstock, frame power house, 460 H. P. wheels belted to 250 K.W. generator and one and one - half miles of pole line connected to the Genoa Plant which was operated for about one year. Contests over water rights, for a period of two years prevented the building of a larger plant and very little work has been done since that time. The present canal and power house are owned by Messrs. Bancroft and Doty, who obtained it on a lien for work performed on canal five years ago. Elevation of low water in Loup at the intake is 1558 sea level, and canal follows a depression for three miles to Beaver Creek. where scouring sluices and dam were contemplated. From this point the line follows the 1545 and 1540 contour for 14 miles to a reservoir site of 1000 acres or more, then through reservoir for four miles to top of bluff north of Columbus, where elevation of water is 1537. The level of Platte River southeast of Columbus at Buck Island is 1421. and allowing for six feet fall in tail race leaves 110 feet head for power purposes. </seg>
            <seg id="p201">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 201 The present plan is to build a canal with fall of about three-fourths foot per mile, cross section 800 square feet, which will carry 2400 cubic feet per second. Schuyler Project. Second : Filing for this development was made by Chas. T. Boggs of Lincoln, and approved March 23rd. 1912. Surveys were made, a small tract of land bought at the bead and a small amount of scraper work done, and no work has been done since on the construction. Canal proposed to head in the bend of the l»up, just west of Columbus in the northwest Quarter Section 23, Township 17, Range 1 West. Low water at this point is 1448 8/10 feet sea level. Line of canals run east to point two miles north of Schuyler, where a head of 66 feet is claimed, although SI feet can be had. Tail race runs south just east of Schuyler to Platte River in Section 25, Township 17, Range 3 East. Water supply is same as for Columbus, although no reservoirs are shown. Canal is located too low for practical purposes. The building of this canal would make the Columbus canal impractical, reducing the head some 30 feet, and as the parties were in litigation when filing was made, it is probable that it was made for that purpore. Estimates are made just as if it had a reservoir of sufficient size to hold up the flow for 12 hour period. Platte River Hydro-Electric Plant Third: This is the Ross project, the rights which were contested several years ago. Originally, canal started about two miles north of Douglas county line, running southeast crossing the Elkhorn River, thence south under the Burlington Railroad, south of the Melia Station, thence to a forebay formed by building a dam across Spring Creek, which is about one mile northwest of the State Fisheries. Considerable work has been done on this project and surveys have all been made. The building of the Chalco-Yutan Cut Off by the Burlington has necessitated a complete change of plans which calls for a first development above the Burlington crossing and a diversion from the Elkhorn below it, and plans have been made accordingly. This project has the advantage in location over any other on the two streams. Maximum head of first development is 27 feet. Computa - tions are for an average of 22 feet. Head of second development Is Cl with an average of 55 feet. Forebay contains 240 acres with additional storage at head of 810 acres, and some along Una of canal. </seg>
            <seg id="p202">202 REPORT OF SECRETARY Fremont Canal Fourth: The original canal was filed on June 21, 1895, by L. D. Richards et al., of Fremont. Canal started on south bank ot Platte River below Schuyler. thence o l.inwnod following steep bluffs for fourteen miles, four of which would equire paving, thence over the C. &amp; N. W. R. R., one-half mile north f Cedar Bluffs, thence to a reservoir located on a ravine across the Iver from Fremont. A 100 foot dam was contemplated and a 65 foot ut necessary to get into the reservoir which, taken in conjunction with be heavy bluff work, makes it too expensive to build as Mains stated n his report. The head was 120 feet, which would produce more power han Columbus, but according to a Union Pacific report the cost was bout twice as much. A New Project North of Ames and Other Power Site*. Fiftn A study of the contour maps and surveys made east of Rogers some ear* a^o, shows &lt;|-,«tt a canal line could be taken from the Platte River on the north side of the river near Rogers and taken to the top of the &gt;luff. north of Ames where a head from 90 to 100 feet could be obtained f a. tavorable location for a power house could be found. As no other on'iur maps are available on these bluffs, and no surveys made, except to a point three miles east of Rogers, a complete report can not be made t this time. There is also a canal line, spoken of for many years, running from near the fork of the Loup, east of St. Paul to the top of the bluff, or leap" at Fullertcn, where a 100 foot head is available; also beginning outh of Fullerton and carrying a canal to top of bluff, directly west of Genoa with 80 foot head. No surveys have been made on these projects, nd as they are both expensive but might prove more feasible than con - tour map shows. It is. therefore, true that beginning below St. Paul, at lease five large power developments could be used and not interfere with each other and that approximately 100,000-24 Hr. H. P. could be produced from such plants. </seg>

This company has a right to one hundred and forty second feet of water which is diverted from the Platter River about three miles southeast of Elm Oreek and returns the water near Kearney. This plant has been in operation for a long period of time for power, being used at one time to operate a cotton mill and has been furnishing current to the city of Kearney since about 1886. This canal is approximately twenty-four miles long and is operated throughout the entire year. Application No. 1577 was granted to the Central Power Company of Grand Island, March 5, 1920, with permit to appropriate 485 cubic feet per second of time, in addition to that already appropriated under Docket 1023. This project contemplates the enlargement of the existing power canal from its intake out of the Platte River near Elm Creek, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p212">212 REPORT OP SECRETARY to the fore-bay of the existing power station at Kearney, Nebraska. The water will be taken from the canal at Kearney just east of the now ex - isting spillway and will flow through trash racks having a depth of nine feet below spillway crest and width of 33 feet, realizing a net velocity through the trash rack opening of about two feet per second. Behind the trash rack will be a pair of timber gates operated by a chain block traveling on an overhead I-beam. The water, after passing the trash racks, will converge into a flume of 18 feet in width, and a depth of nine feet below elevation of spillway crest, with a total depth of 12 feet to provide for surges and wasting over the spillway. This flume will pass through the canai bank and have a total length of about 70 feet, with water velocity of 2.78 feet per second. This flume will discharge into a wheel pit and draft tube, consisting of a concrete lined circular shaft sunk into the indurated clay mateiial of which the ground is here composed. A short section of flume made flexible by expansion joints will connect the solid wheel pit to the flume. Below tailwater level the draft tube turns into horizontal direction through an elbow formed in the concrete shaft lining, and discharges into a tunnel, which, in turn, discharges into the tailrace on the east bank, just below the spillway discharge. The tunnel will be built in two rectangular compartments, each seven feet wide by eight feet high, and will be concrete lined with central division wall. The mean velocity in this tunnel will be four feet per second. The station will be equipped with one James Leffel vertical shaft open flume type of hydraulic turbine, guaranteed to deliver 2,350 horsepower at a head of 54 feet, running at a speed of 225 revolutions per minute. This will drive by direct connection a Westinghouse 1,750 K. V. A., 60 cycle, three phase, 2,300 volt. 225 R. P. M. electric generator with direct connected exciter.

            <seg id="p224">224 REPORT OP SECRETARY Burt-Wa*hington County Drainage District. The work of the district includes all of the former operations in both Burt and Washington counties. The natural drainage of the Missouri River valley extend* from Decatur, south along the west margin of the valley near the town of Tekamah in Burt county, and Herman in Washington county, with the outlet opposite the town of Blair. The district between the above mentioned terminal is about 32 miles. Manifestly, it becomes necessary to do work in each county in order to obtain a comprehensive system. About forty miles of new work was added to the system of ditches of about sixty miles, which were cleaned out and dredged. The most important problem which presents itself is the handling of the heavy burden of silt which was washed down from the hills into the branch and main ditches, entirely filling the ditch into which the muddy water was conducted. The grade of the main ditches was less than one and one-half feet per mile, some being about one foot per mile. The branch ditches began at a grade of 20 feet per mile and joined the main ditch at various lighter grades, all of which were equal to, and greater than, the grade of the main ditch at the Junction, with perhaps one exception. This resulted in the silt deposit being carried into the main ditches and filling them and, in turn, the silt carried down the main ditches was backed up in the branch ditches, thereby closing their outlets and making lagoons without drainage, of a greater part of the valley. This silt problem was met by the introduction of 18 settling basins where the branch ditches' were made by emptying their water onto a tract of land without a definite channel running through the tract. Levees enclosing the basins prevented the flooding of other lands, the outlet from the basins conducting the clear waters back into the channel of the branch ditch and thence into the main ditch. This is, briefly, the outline for the basins, some of which were as small as three or four acres, others forty acres and in one case, for York Creek, below the town of Herman, a watershed of thirty square miles. The basin was made by the consent of the land owners to consist of 360 acres. All basins were exempted from benefit taxes, and have been made valuable lands by the addition of silt to a depth of from one to three feet during the past five years. The waters of Tekamah Creek, SilverCreek and Mud Creek, east of the town of Tekamah, were gathered into a diversion ditch, which carried the silt burdened flood waters three miles east to a chute of the Missouri River. In order to maintain the north and south drainage ditches, the floodway above mentioned was carried over the drainage ditches. The water of the drainage ditch was conducted through culverts under the floodway, which were built of reenforced concrete. Three structures were required, two of which were single-barrel, eight feet wide by nine feet high, the third structure being three barrels of the same dimensions as above stated. </seg>

            <seg id="p226">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 225 This work was started in 1915 and practically completed In 1117. The results have been most satisfactory. The basins hare all been effective. Some have filled more rapidly than contemplated, but other - wise have done the work. The floodway has protected all the ditches, and excepting a few minor repairs, has demonstrated its capacity to be sufficient. It will be necessary in the future to provide new basins when the old ones are filled to an extent which will make it impossible to use them without excessive construction of levees around the basins, and upstream. This, we believe, will be done in about ten years from the beginning of the original work, and from the demonstration of the increase In the quality of land, we hope that other lands which are low and have a heavy soil will be available and ready to receive the fill, without charging a high rental. A rental fee of $3 per acre on a number of basins has been paid, and on one other $5 per year. There are 60,000 acres included in this district. Butler County Drainage District No. 2. Ditch No. 1 diverts the flood water entering the Drainage District from the southwest, gathering the same by means of a road ditch along the east side of the public road running north through the center of Section 30, and by means of the present ditch system, which will be cleaned out for a little more than one-fourth of a mile north of Section 30. The outlet ditch running north through the center of Sections 19-18-7 and 6 to the Platte River has a minimum fall of 7 feet per mile, which will produce a scouring velocity between 5 and 6 feet per second, and will cut back from the Platte River until the fall is equalized, which will produce a somewhat higher velocity and will insure against filling up the ditch with sediment washed down from the hills. The principal obstruction along the route of this ditch is a sand ridge along the north part of Section 19, through which the maximum cut is approximately 17 feet. At that point a boring was made to ascertain the character of the soil and found from 8 to 10 feet of compact sand at the surface, underlaid by a yellowish clay. The sand and clay were lifted on a 2 inch auger when damp. Ditch No. 1 is designed with a bottom width of 4 feet and with side slopes of 1 horizon - tal to 1 vertical. The capacity of the ditch is regulated by the depth. The minimum depth along the outlet being 8 feet and the maximum, excepting the sand ridge, about 13 feet. The lower section of this' ditch also intercepts and diverts certain flood waters coming from the west, which now find their outlet in Bone Creek. That part of the main ditch, from the junction of its branches, north to the sand ridge in Section 19, should be constructed with continuous waste banks, which also serve as levees to confine the flood waters and raise the flood plane to a sufficient elevation to overcome any filling which might temporarily obstruct the ditch in the vicinity of the sand ridge, thus insuring successful operation. </seg>
            <seg id="p227">226 I right-of-way required for Ditch No. 1 will be a strip two rods in th for the construction of the road ditch in Section 30, four rods in th through the south half of Section 19, and six rods in width for outlet, all as shown on the map filed in this department. The acreage right-of-way is marked upon each 40-acre tract, the distance is cated by the scale of the map. being 1,000 feet per inch. Bridges be required at the center and south line of Section 7-16-3, and at south line of Section 18 and 19, making four bridges in all. The il estimated cost is $18,500.00. If at any time it becomes desireable to supplement the plan of improvement above outlined to provide relief from flood waters from Bone Creek, the engineer recommends a diversion of Bone Creek in a northwesterly direction through Section 9, with outlet along the north and south center line of the west half of Section 4. I Elkhorn Valley Drainage District — Douglas and Sarpy Counties. The horn Valley Drainage District, comprising about 55,000 acres, was anized under Chapter 153 of the Laws of 1907. and amendments reto, by rote of the land owners, in the year 1909. The greater part this land is in Douglas County, taking in the Platte and Elkhorn leys, running from the north line of Douglas County to the mouth of Elkhorn River. The properties benefltted are the lands, tracts, town i in the villages of Waterloo and Valley, the U. P. Railroad, the C, &amp; Q. Railroad, public roads and easements of telephone, telegraph I power companies, elevators and oil distributing plants. I In the year 1910, according to plans, the district constructed ditches the purpose of straightening the Elkhorn River, a small part north Waterloo, and the greater part of the balance toward the lower part he district. The river was very crooked and the work reduced the th of the stream by nine miles through the district. A branch ditch, «rn as the "Creamery Slough Ditch", five miles long, was constructed ling from a point toward the town of Valley, and then emptying the Elkhorn River two miles south of Waterloo. Other ditches were rtructed in the northern part, a majority being projections of ditches he Elkhorn River Drainage District on the north, emptying into the lorn River. iMost of the assessments were paid in cash, and in 1910 on tracts not 1, a bond issue was made running twenty years, which was sold to state. tAs the improvements were chiefly to benefit the eastern portion of district, the lands in the western portion had been assessed lighter, in the year 1918 the district undertook a new improvement. The a was to construct a dyke fifteen miles in length. The smaller portion I built in that year and during 1919-20 it was completed. Owing to overflow of the Platte River in Dodge County, causing the waters flow southeasterly over the district, this dyke was made to tie to </seg>

R. at Fremont, and It was extended down the left bank of the Platte about 200 feet from the bank to a point near the chaico-Yutan cutoff of said c, B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. Other and smaller improvements were also constructed. Since new and different plans had been adopted, it became necessary to make new apportionment of the benefits'. This was done, and an assessment based thereon in 1919 was also made, which was a single assessment and no bonds issued. The cost of all improvement was 1330,000.00 It may be well to mention that in straightening the Elkhorn River, the flow of water was started through the ditches and by the process of erosion they were enlarged the full width of the river in a few years. The various properties within the district have been greatly benefit - ted and advanced in market value. Prior to the construction of the large dyke, the overflow from the Platte River overspread large areas of the district, and the remedy has been successful in preventing this overflow. This district is almost completed. Western Sarpy Drainage District. The western portion of Sarpy County, which is located in the Elkhorn and Platte valleys, consists of flat cr low lands, sloping eastward from the rivers toward the hills. In this unit there are 8,000 acres, which lands were menaced by flood waters from the hills and overflow waters from the Platte and Elkhorn rivers, and little of this land could be cultivated before drainage. In the year 1885 the county, under the old law, constructed a small ditch, which proved useless. In 1905 this ditch was enlarged, but still proved inadequate However, in 1909, by vote of the land owners, the Western Sarpy Drainage District was organized to improve this area. The main ditch was constructed by a large boat dredge, running from tbe north end to the extreme southern end of the district, emptying into the Platte River, and constructed lateral road ditches leading into the main ditch on the north edge of the public roads, and these roads were improved by the use of the waste banks. A few levees were built along the river to prevent overflow. The district lies well below all the important tributaries of both rivers', and is perhaps menaced by water more than any other district in the state. The original improvement, costing $75,000, redeems the rich land of this district for cultivation. The improvement of this project has caused but very little litigation until recently. In the year 1917, owing to the straightening of the Elkhorn River in the Elkhorn Valley Drainage District, shortening the distance of the flow therein nine miles, the force of the waters therefrom emptying into the Platte caused the left bank of the Platte to be eroded more in one flood than had occurred in the previous 1 twenty years, destroying the dyke and permit - ting the overflow to destroy many crops. The district in 1918 constructed </seg>
            <seg id="p229">228 KEPORT OF 8ECRETARY new dykes along the rivers and also reconstructed the dykes which were destroyed. The river water is now well under control By reason of these improvements, the property within the district has been much enhanced in value, as nearly all the land has been improved to a high state of cultivation. The last improvement was made at an expenditure of $60,000.00. Drainage District No. 1 — Otoe-Johnson Counties. This district corn - prises' 16,000 acres of land in the valleys of the Little Nemaha and South Branch Rivers. Prior to the construction of the ditch, much of this land was low and swampy, and all of it subject to the ravages of annual and sometimes more frequent overflows of those streams and their tributaries. The land had no staple value for farming purposes. Preliminary work and surveys were made in 1909. The organization was had under Peabody's Drainage District Law. From 1909 to 1913 the formation of the district was held in abeyance by proceedings in the district and supreme courts. The general plan of the work resulted in the construction of an independent ditch, with occasional tappings of the old bed. In this way use was made of the old river channel as well as the new. The old stream is gradually filling, and the new channel, on the other hand, has been gradually eroding until at the present time it is about sixty to seventy per cent larger than when originally constructed. The work comprises about twenty-five miles of main stem ditch, and about an equal number of lateral ditches. The main channel of the Little Nemaha River begins near Syracuse and discharges into another drain - age project south and east of Talmage, Nebraska. Another main stem runs from near Burr and Cook to Talmage. The »ize of those ditches varies as to the watershed to be accommodated, the bottom width varying from 28 to five feet, the latter dimension being for laterals having a very small watershed. The depth of the ditch varies from five to 25 feet, the average depth of the main channel being fifteen feet, and the average depth of the laterals is five feet. The slopes in all cases are one foot vertical and one foot horizontal. The grade of the main channel is slightly in excess of five feet per mile. The grade of the laterals depends upon local conditions, and varies greatly from five to ten feet per mile. The entire catchment basement to be accommodated is 640 square miles. The entire cost of this project was $225,000.00, which cost was defrayed in the following manner: </seg>
            <seg id="p230">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 229 The amount assessed to property owners benefltted was assignee according to the benefits of the particular tracts of land. The cost per acre ranged from a very (ew cents per acre to a maximum of $17.90 per acre. The average value of the land at the time of the construction ranged from $50.00 to $80.00 per acre. Since the completion of the improvement, lands have sold for as much as three to four hundred dollars per acre. The project as a whole is a complete success. Drainage District No. 5 — Richardson County. This district it til extension of Richardson County Drainage District No. 1 on Muddy Creek, which empties into Nemaha River. The outlet is on the south line of Section 6, Township 1 North, Range 17 East. The upper end is on the west line of Section 24, Township 2 North, Range 15 East, the fall between these two points being 37 feet. The length of the main ditch will be 8.2 miles, having an eight foot base with one to one side slopes. Little Muddy Creek between the above points is 14.45 miles, shortening the water course 6.25 feet per mile. The natural fall of the creek is 2.56 feet per mile. The creek at the upper end has a depth of 14.5 feet, while the ditch will average 17.5 feet in depth, varying from one to four feet deeper than the creek. All excavated material is being deposited in spoil banks on each side of the ditch, with a 15 foot berm. Laterals will have a four foot base with one to one side slopes and a 10 foot berm. There will be 1J laterals, totaling 35.300 feet in length. The area within this district is 4371 acres. Three thousand two hundred eighty-eight acres of this is overflow land which will be re - claimed for agricultural purposes, with the exception of the area within the ditch and spoil banks. The total drainage area within the watershed above the outlet, is 263 square miles', of which 194 square miles are above and outside the proposed district. There are 7.48 miles of public highway and 3.66 miles main lino of the Missouri Pacific Railroad within the district. Five bridges will be built to carry public highways over the main ditch These bridges will be 15 ton Nebraska standard trusses of 90 foot span, and have been estimated to cost $2,600.00 each. The county has assumed the cost of the bridges in lieu of the assessment of benefit* derived. To date no contract has been let for the construction of the bridges. •aid by property owners benefltted $ 'aid by Otoe County 'aid by Johnson County 1191.800.1 20,000.1 3.000.1 •aid by M. P. R. R.

This district is situated on the south fork of the Great N'emaha River, and is (our miles south of Humboldt. Nebraska. The area included within the boundary of the district is 3,564 acres of wet and overflow land. A watershed of 564 square miles of rolling agricultural land lies above the district. The soil within the district is classified as "Wabash silt loam and Wabash silt clay loam." The greater part of land within the district, if relieved of the flood damage of the overflows from the river, would have sufficient drainage to take care of the storm water falling upon the land itself, so the plan of drainage adopted was a large, open ditch to take care of the river water, and lateral ditches for the storm water coming down from adjacent table land. It was left to the individual owner to tile drain any wet and seepy land within the district. The main ditch was dug with an eight foot base, three-fourths to one side slope, with an average depth of twenty feet. The length of the main ditch is 6.77 miles, and the length of the old river bed is 11.55 miles, making a reduction of 4.77 miles. This gives an average fall of 4.02 feet per mile along the line of the new ditch. The work was completed in the spring of 1918 at a total cost of $76,204.00. This has been a very successful project, as most of the waste and wet land within the district has been put under cultivation. Lands within the district, which were selling for $40.00 per acre, now command a price of $250 to $300 per acre. Pender Drainage District — Thurston County. This district, which covers an area of 7,500 acres, was completed in 1918 at a cost of approxi - mately $85,000.00. It consists of a main ditch about eight miles in length, connecting with the Wakefleld project above, and the Bancroft project below. There is one lateral just above the town of Pender which diverts the waters of Rattlesnake Creek into the main ditch which carries the waters of the Logan. This work was of unusual depth for ditches in that locality, the average depth being about 17 feet, which was from four feet to six feet below the old stream. The bottom width was 16 feet, with side slopes of one-half horizontal to one vertical. This section produces considerable enlargement of the channel by rapid erosion. The fall of the ditch varies from three to five feet per mile. The results have been entirely satisfactory, and the town of Pender was protected from the flood of last summer, in fact, the water did not get out of the bank in the main ditch as the diversion ditch saved the town from any damage. </seg>

            <seg id="p262">NORTH PLATTE RIVER AT MORRILL, NEBRASKA, 1919-1920. Location. About two miles south of Morrill. Gages. One wooden staff nailed to a square staff about 15 feet up-stream from north end of old wooden highway bridge and under west side of north span of new state aid bridge. Also one wooden staff nailed to square pile about 75 feet up-streeam from new state aid bridge. Bench Mark. No bench mark data is at hand concerning these gases. However, they have been referred to bench marks and information concerning their location and datum will be on file in the Department of Public Works. Observer. Francis Corder, Myron Birdley, Sam Richards, 1919; Virgil Q. Corder, 1920. General. Because of the collapsible dam of the Enterprise Irrigation Ditch and relation between gage height and discharge has been found to be so Inconsistent that no records of data discharge are herewith published for 1919. Construction of new state aid bridge interfered with the gagings more or less in 1920. Elevation. 3980 feet. Distance from Pathfinder Reservoir. 298 miles'. </seg>

The diversion of water is controlled partially with a sand dam, check and wastegate. No headgate constructed. The check and wastegate is located about 2,000 feet below the diversion point. Rating flume of wood is located 200 feet below the check and wastegate. Gagings here have been very good. Gage heights were not reported for 1919, and no automatic gage has been installed as yet.

            <seg id="p349">348 ALLIANCE CANAL. L Alliance Canal diverts its original appropriation from the North te Riv&lt;r, and has an optional diversion from the Red Willow Creek. I The river diversion is controlled by an old frame headijate, which about reached its limit of usefulness. A small wooden sluice gate wing dam is used in connection with the headgate I This diversion was used for diverting only a small portion of the ■ used under the Alliance Canal during the last biennium. Gaging on is very poor. The optional diversion is made from the Red Willow Creek. This diversion i&amp; controlled by a concrete structure across the Red Willow Creek. Flood and waste waters from the Red Willow drainage area flows through this structure to the river, carrying a great deal of sediment, more or less of which is deposited in the Alliance canal. No rating flume has been installed, and gagings have been unsatisfactory. L Automatic gage is very much needed in Alliance Canal at Red ow to give the project a more favorable report. rUAL DISCHARGE , MEASUREMENTS. FOR ALLIANCE CANAL FROM RED WILLOW, FOR YEAR 1919.

            <seg id="p356">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 355 BELMONT CANAL. Relmont Canal is owned by the Bridgeport Irrigation District. The water used is diverted from the North Platte River and Cedar Creek. The diversion works have been under construction for the part biennium. The headgate sluice gates and diversion dam are constructed of con - crete and steel. The headgate opening is 50 (eet in the clear. The sluice gate has a clear opening of 100 feet. The overflow weir is 1,000 feet in length. The rating flume is of concrete. Gagiugs made here are very good. The Empire Canal Company draws its water through the Belmont diversion works, using about one mile of the Belmont Canal as a carrier, and then turns water into its own canal. Gage height reports of the river diversion from the Belmont Canal have been only fair for the 1920 season, and no reports from Cedar Creek. No rating flume installed in the Cedar Creek ditch. No auto - matic gages used. ACTUAL DISCHARGE MEASUREMENTS, I, OF BELMONT . 1919. CANAL AT RATING FLUME, FOR YEAR &lt;i« 1 DiKhsnet I XHcr Height I See. Ft.

A new headgate installation U planned for 1921. The Company reported in their acreage report 29,760 acres to be irrigated in 1920.

            <seg id="p397">396 REPORT OF SECRETARY ENTERPRISE DITCH. Owned by Enterprise Ditch Company. Water diverted from the North Platte River two miles south of Morrill. about 1,000 feet east of west line of Section 27, Township 23, Range 57. Diversion is made by collapsible steel dam set on concrete and piling through concrete bead - gate. Water is controlled by steel gates. A wooden rating flume 1.000 feet below the head provides a fair gaging station. Automatic gage reports were furnished during the season of 1919, and for only part of the season of 1920. Water is diverted from Stewart's Drain to the canal close to the north line of Section 24-23-57. No diversion structure used. Drain ditch empties into canal. No rating flume nor automatic gage height reports have ever been reported. ThiB canal also uses water from Dry Spotted Tail Creek. No diversion structure used. Water taken by same method as in use at Stewart's Drain. No automatic gage. No rating flume. No gage heights reported for 1919 and 1920. Tub Springs is also used by this canal as an auxiliary supply. Water is diverted from this stream through a short diversion ditch (about 100 feet long) and raised to the ditch by using a substantial gate at the upper end of a concrete syphon through which the Tub Springs water passes under the canal when not wanted. No rating flume is provided at this point. No automatic gage. Gagings were made in 1919 by gaging the canal above and below the diversion. In 1920 the ditch company placed a 30-inch circular culvert in the diversion ditch and gaging was done in the culvert. No gage heights were reported in 1919 or in 1920. </seg>

Wastegate of wood located about one mile below head is used to regulate the flow of water In canal. An automatic gage was installed in the canal on the down-stream aide of this structure and gage heights were reported in 1919, but none In 1920. No rating flume is provided. Gagingg were made on the down - stream side of check gates. Very poor gaging station. Water is carried by this canal to a storage reservoir Just north of the city of Gothenburg, a distance of about nine miles, where water is used for power purposes and returned to the river from an outlet at the southwest corner of the lake. At the northeast corner of the lake Is located the head of the irrigation canal. The latter canal is not provided with a rating flume An automatic gage is installed in this canal one-half mile down-stream from the lake in a concrete check. This is not a satisfactory gaging station. No gage heights reported for 1920. No rating flume nor automatic gage is provided for the power waste. Gaging is done two blocks below the power plant at wagon bridge. Gage heights were reported in 1919, but none in 1920.

Water used for irrigation and power purposes No rating flume provided. Gaging station at bridge located 25 feet below wasteway is not a satisfactory rating station. This canal has installed an automatic gage about one-half mile up-stream from gaging station in an old canal channel known as "Blue Hole." The water from Blue. Hole flows into the canal. As both the headgate and wasteway of this canal are between the rating station and the automatic gage, little if any value can be realized from the reporting of gage heights from the automatic gage.

            <seg id="p532">To His Excellency. . November 30, 1920. SAMUEL R. McKELVIE, Governor of Nebraska. Sir: Since, the present Motor Vehicle law requires the County Treas - urers to send to the State Treasurer three-fourths of the money collected, and it is necessary to rolurn ninety-five per cent to each County, 1 recommend that the Motor Vehicle law be so amended that all money collected for motor vehicle taxes remain in the County treasury, except five per cent, which should be sent to the State Treasurer for ad - ministration of the Motor Vehicle Division of this Department, for the supervision and maintenance of the State Highways, and for furnishing motor vehicle number plates and containers for certificates to the County Treasurer. I also recommend that the State Highway law be amended re - quiring a representative of this Department to meet with the County Board of, each County before March first cf each year and go over in detail with the County Board, the maintenance work to be done on the State Highways for the season. Within ten days after such meeting, we should be required to file a budget estimate covering the funds necessary for the maintenance work. Immediately upon the filing of this budget estimate, the balance of the money remaining in the County Treasury from the motor vehicle fees should be turned over to the County Road Dragging Fund. If these recommendations are followed, the County will be allowed to use immediately, all money in excess of that required to maintain the State Highways for the maintenance of their County roads. Such procedure would also lessen the demand for additional State Highways. There is great danger, under the law as it exists at the present time, of the demand for additional highways becoming so great, that the State Highway System will be extended to the point when it will be impossible to secure funds for proper maintenance. If this condition should ever exist, it would defeat entirely the purpose of a State Highway System, and the State would lose the greater part of the money it has invested in construction. After the 1919 Session of the Legislature had adjourned, we re - ceived one and one-half million dollars worth of equipment from the War Department, through the Agriculture Department. A large por - tion of this equipment had been used, and it was necessary to replace some of the parts of each piece of equipment before same could be placed in service. In most cases we were furnished these parts by the War Department. However, handling this equipment and placing same in service entailed considerable expense. About one-half of the equip - ment has been turned over to the County for the expense the Depart - ment has had in handling same. We have invested the remainder, $300,000 in equipment. I recommend that the greater part of this equipment be retained by the Department, and a fund Of $300,000 be get aside from the State Aid Road Fund which would act as a revolving fund, said fund covering the amount Invested in equipment and gravel </seg>
            <seg id="p533">532 REPORT OF SECRETARY lands, at this time, and the Department be required to place a value on each piece of equipment and promulgate a set ot rates, on a per diem basis for the use of this equipment, these rates to be sufficient to cover the cost of operation, depreciation and upkeep, and that the amount covered for depreciation remain in the fund to replace the equipment as same is used. If these recommendations are followed, the Department will always have the same value of equipment on hand, and will be in position to control prices on contract work. I also recommend that the law authorizing the Department to pur - chase gravel lands to produce gravel for road building materials, be extended, so that all surplus we may have may be used in the construction of the State Capitol building. Since it will take $2,700,000 to enable us to carry out our present Federal Aid Road program, and to meet Federal Aid appropriations, I recommend that this appropriation be made by the 1921 Legisla - ture. If the above recommendation is not carried out, we will lose our Federal money for the reason that the present Federal Aid must be met with State appropriations and this Department have contracts signed with the Federal Government for same, before June 30th, 1921. I also recommend that a law be enacted, requiring the Department of Public Works to advertise in the official County paper in the County, where construction projects are proposed before contracts are let or also before the State proceeds with the construction of a project where contracts are not let. before any money is expended on a project from the State Aid Road Fund. The present law does not require these pro - jects to be advertised in the County, and does not require any bid to be received before the State proceeds with the construction work which the Department desires to handle on an actual cost basis. If the Department is not required to advertise and receive bids on this work, eventually the Department may be forced to use incompetent labor, thereby increasing the cost considerable above the cost that would be necessary if the work was awarded to a contractor. This recommenda - tion is based upon experience of other States, and the experience I have had in handling municipal and County work. If the Department is required to advertise and receive bids, and then if they see fit to take over and handle the work, they are required to do the work below the lowest responsible bidder; then all work so handled will be done at a financial advantage to the State. Otherwise, the Department would be in a position to force certain classes of contractors out of business, and eventually pay salaries for labor and supervision that would be ceitain to bring disaster to the Department. I also recommend that the recommendation of the Chief of the Bureau ot Roads and Bridges, and the Chief of the Bureau of Irri - gation, Waterpower and Drainage be carried into effect. Respectfully submitted, (Signed) GBO. E. JOHNSON, </seg>
            <seg id="p534">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 533 REPORT CHIEF, BUREAU OF ROADS AND BRIDGES. Lincoln, Nebraska, November 30, 1920. George E. Johnson, Secretary, Department of Public Works, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: — I have the honor to submit the following report covering the work of the Bureau of Roads and Bridges for the past two years. It is the intention of this report to cover the construction work of State Highways during the past biennium. In order to do this, it has be - come necessary to limit the report to such matters of prime importance which are required in carrying out a program of this nature. Types of work have been divided, grouped and designated under certain division and sub-division headings; a brief summary follows, placing the various types of work administered by this bureau. In addition, reports are included of the Division of Tests and Testing Materials, the Conservation and Soil Survey Division of the State Uni - versity, also important laws which govern the administrative power and authority of the Bureau of Roads and Bridges, functioning as a unit of the Department of Public Works. The bureau has at all times endeavored to co-operate with the County and local officials, serving the public to the best of its ability at all times. Respectfully submitted, E. H. MOREY, Chief, Bureau of Roads and Bridges. </seg>

            <seg id="p536">535 In order that those reading the thirteenth biennial report of the Department of Public Works may familiarize themselves with the laws and rules under which the Department was organized, and is now functioning, the following summary of the Civil Administrative Code, together with a brief statement of the work of each of the sub-divisions of the department is given. The Thirty-seventh Session of the Nebraska Legislature of 1919 enacted a bill, the Civil Administrative Code Bill, which created a cabinet form of government for the State, putting into effect a financial and accounting system, whereby a vigorous and effective audit over the financial expenditures of the State was established, and provided tor the consolidation of boards, institutions, commissions and different departments and agencies of the government. Although the new bill contained over 500 pages, only 20 pages consisted of new legislation, providing for the present system of administration. The remainder of the bill consisted of legislation that had been previously enacted and was included in this bill in order to bring it under the Code. The Civil Administrative Code eliminated seven boards and com - missions' and ten other sub-divisions of the departments. It created the following six administrative departments: Agriculture Trade and Commerce Public Works Finance Public Welfare Labor These departments are administered by Secretaries appointed by the Governor with the consent of the Senate. The six departments are sub-divided into sub-divisions and bureaus, the head of each being designated as Chief. The six Secretaries are responsible to the Gover nor, the Chiefs of the bureaus and divisions are responsible to the Secretary, and the minor employees are responsible directly to thei Chiefs. Thus, responsibility is fixed, and the commonly recognized prmc tice of business administration established. The most important division of the Department of Public Works la the Bureau of Roads and Bridges. This Bureau, under the direction of the Chief, Mr. E. H. Morey, has charge of the construction of all State and Federal Aid roads and the building of all State bridges. It is again divided into three sub-divisions, namely: Maps and Plans, Road. Construction, and Road Equipment. The Division of Map* and Plans.— This subdivision is in charge of the Office Engineer. Mr. W. T. Hole, with the following assistants: assist - ant office engineer, four senior engineering draftsmen, senior engineering draftsmen, engineering draftsmen, draftsmen and junior draftsmen. The blue print operators and preliminary and location engineers, together with rodmen and chainmen are also In this division. This division has in general the making of preliminary field Investi - gations and surveys connected with the Ant work required In the </seg>
            <seg id="p537">536 planning for a State und Federal Aid roud. Plans and estimates are prepared for all road and bridge work, and in addition special designs are made for equipment, such as derricks, drags, ramp buildings ar.d wagons. The Division of Road Construction, — The Chief of the Bureau of Roads and Bridges has complete supervision of this division, and with the assistance of five Division Engineers directs and oversees the actual building and maintenance of all Federal and State Aid roads, and in addition all State Highways not constructed by Federal and State funds. The offices of the Division Engineers are located as follows: Division No. 1— Mr. A. S. Mirick Lincoln Division No. 2— Mr. M. F. Black Norfolk Division No. 3— Mr. C. E. Wright Hastings Division No. 4— Mr. R. L. Cochran North Platte Division No. 5 — Mr. J. C. McLean Scottsbluff Duties of a Division Engineer. — In general, each of the Five Division Engineers has entire charge of the work in his immediate division, each division including an average of twenty counties. Construction: First. It is the duty of the Division Engineer to assist in the original location of all roads, and supervise the con - struction of same from the time the road is first surveyed until it is finally accepted by the Federal Government. Thus, he makes recommendations for all improvements effected during construction and maintenance of the projects under his supervision. Second. The Division Engineer is responsible for the engineer- ing parties that are required in the construction prog- ress. These parties consist of a project engineer, ai. instrument man, rodman and chainman. The pruject engineer is responsible to the Division Engineer for the work under his supervision. • Third. The approval of all plans, estimates, payrolls, corre- spondence and field parties on the projects within the counties of the division is under the jurisdiction of the Division Engineer and his assistant Fourth. In the construction of drainage structures and paving the matter of testing the proper materials necessary is referred by the Division Engineer to the Testing Engineer. Fifth. The matter of issuing permits for the erection of signs on the State System is cared tor by the Division Engineer; also, the marking of the State Highways with tho nmiwr aim* la ArranffAd bv him and shlD- </seg>
            <seg id="p538">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 537 ments made upon bis recommendation to the County Highway Commissioner. Sixth. Frequent inspections are made by the Division Engineer, oftentimes in company with the Federal District Engineers, at which time the progress of the work is noted and recommendations with regard to methods, alignment, grades, and drainage structures made. Maintenance Seventh. The Division Engineer acts in cooperation with the Highway Commissioner of each County with regard to the maintenance of all roads located on the State Highway System. Changes in the method and result* of such maintenance matters are recommended by him. Eighth. All claims arising from the maintenance of such roads. and presented by the counties, are taken care of and checked by the Division Engineer. Ninth. Logging of the State Highway System is carried on under his supervision. Maps of sections patrolled, type of patrols, number of patrolmen and miles in each county are kept and checked, from the daily report forms sent in by the patrolmen. This data is used for cost keeping. Tenth. Arrangements are made through the Division Engineer for work on the State Highways by the heavy gang maintenance crews. All reports and payrolls in con - nection with same are checked and allowed by the Division Engineer. Reports' of the labor and costs of work in the various graveling camps are kept by him. NOTE — For a complete description of the work of each of the flre Divisions and the statistical summaries of the work accomplished, turn to the Section designated Division No. 1, 2, 3, 4. 5, respectively. Testing Engineer. — The testing engineer, Clark E. Mickey, has charge of the tests that are made for the materials used in the construction of State and Federal Aid roads: Mechanical analysis of all gravel; cement and brick tests; compression strength tests on concrete cylinders; concrete and corrugated pipe tests; steel for rein - forcement of headwalls and bridges. In addition, recommendations are made as to the advisability of using such materials; reports made to the Chief of the Bureau of Roads and Bridges, who in turn rejects or approves the result of the tests by a report to the Federal District office. No materials are used that do not meet the requirements of the Standard Specifications of the Federal Government. NOTE — For complete description of this work and results accom - plished to date, see the Section designated "TESTING". </seg>
            <seg id="p539">538 REPORT OF SECRETARY I Project Engineer. — The Project Engineer is in immediate charge of or more projects, and is responsible for the construction work to the Ision Engineer. His duties are many; briefly, he gives instructions he contractor, sets stakes for grades (with the aid of his party), and les the monthly and final estimates. He is rightly termed "the man the job". He is immediately responsible for everything that is carried while the project is under his direction. I Division of Road Equipment, Repair* and Maintenance. — The Super - ndent of the road equipment division. A. W. Moffitt, is in charge Jl equipment and repairs handled by the State in fitting out counties, iv gang crews, and gravelling camps with the equipment needed in king on state roads. State trucks, tractors, small equipment, repairs, , are shipped out under the direction of this divisron. Construction erintendents, tractor operators, mechanics, truck drivers, and store - pers assist in the work. In addition the Superintendent has charge 'our graveling camps, two claying camps, and one surfacing camp, duty being to see that these camps are adequately equipped. In addition to the three divisions' under the supervision of the Chief. Bureau of Roads and Bridges, a third sub-division. Clerical and Records Division, cares for such matters as correspondence, payrolls, expense vouchers, requisitions, warrants, financial reports', construction estimates and cost data. E3 Chief Clerk is in charge with sub-divisions: Accounting records, r clerk bookkeeper, stenographer, junior clerk, bookkeeper, junior , stenographer, junior clerk and typist. ■ A sub-division of the Motor Vehicle registration records is in charge a clerk and junior clerks. Payrolls. — Monthly payrolls are made from: (a) Daily report sheet signed by employees of the office (b) Daily report cards sent in by the preliminary engineers and helpers (c) Weekly report sheets of division engineers and assistants. (d) Weekly reports of division engineers and helpers. t Expense Vouchers. — Vouchers are carefully cheeked in this division entered for payment through the proper sources. This requires iderable time, especially during construction season, when there from 200 to 250 men in the field. Requisitions and Vouchers for Equipment and Supplies. — All requisi - tions for equipment and supplies are made through the division, checked and sent to the purchasing agent of the Finance Department; vouchers covering such supplies and expense connected therewith are made and checked by this division and entered for payment. Estimates of Construction Work. — State vouchers for construction work are made from the project engineer's monthly estimate after the </seg>
            <seg id="p540">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 539 estimate has been carefully checked. Some projects require as many a* live vouchers each month. Federal voucheis are made monthly and sent to the government for reimbursement. Attached to these vouchers are three copies of the expense sheet of each project engineer and helper, all of which involves considerable typing. Warrant*. — All warrants issued on such vouchers are mailed by this division. Entries. — Entries of all vouchers and warrants must be made on the voucher journal, distribution ledger, final ledger, monthly statement for office and state auditor. Financial Reports. — Financial reports' are required of the StaU&gt; Ai* 1 Road fund monthly, showing itemized statement of each voucher paid; amount apportioned to each county, previous and present expenditure* and balance; the same is required of each district's apportionment, expenditures, and balance. A similar financial report is made of the State Highway fund. (Motor Vehicle fees.) Projects. — Copies of project statements sent to the government are made by this division, also the necessary copies of preliminary estimates and detailed information necessary is' forwarded to the government on each particular project befoie approval. Contracts. — All contracts are checked by the division, also tabulation of bids, and necessary copies of each made for distribution. Ten copies are made of each contract that is let. Correspondence. — Stenographic work is taken care of by the division. Filing. — The filing of correspondence and records is done by the lii.ision Cost Data Work. — Cost records are kept on each project under con - struction. This, of course, involves detail work. Motor Vehicle Records. — In addition to this, records are kept of all Motor Vehicle Registrations. Two registration cards 1 for each registrant are received from the County Treasurer, with the name of the party, address, Treasurer's receipt number, registration number, make of car, engine number, weight and fee. These cards are given to the Jnntor Clerks, who check them for address, receipt number and registration number, which must correspond on both cards. The cards are divided, one for numerical file, the other for alpha - betical file. A junior clerk takes the cards from the numerical file and checks weight and fee, and if not found correct returns them to the Treasurer for correction. After these cards are checked for fee and weight and "O. K'd" they are given to junior clerks to run registration numerically and file. Cards upon which are printed the receipt numbers for every county and the registration is placed opposite the correspond - ing receipt number. The card in alphabetical file is cut in half, the </seg>
            <seg id="p541">540 REPOKT OF SKCRETARY |&gt;er part of card filed alphabetically, the lower half filed numerically engine number and alphabetically by cars. The mailing clerk mails plates and supplies to County Treasurers and keeps a record of all going and incoming freight and express. Another clerk in charge the cards gives information to County Treasurers and to the public h regard to the work of the office, also corrections on cards. The lor typist has charge of all mail for correction, and at the end of h month makes a typewritten list of each new registration made •ing the month. A stenographer answers all correspondence from inty Treasurers. Bridge Inspectors. — A Bridge Inspector is in charge during bridge construction, his duties being to locate elevations, center line, piers, keep Eds of pile driving, materials, make estimates and cost of the entire . Under his supervision the work is carried on according to sped - ons and plans, and he reports weekly the progress of the coi - tion. The Monthly Bulletin. — Approximately 4,000 Highway reports are Vt out monthly by the Department. This publication (required by R. 298, section 7) is sent to the County Clerk in each county, and contains a complete Financial Statement of the Federal and State funds apportioned under the Federal and State Aid Road Act, for the years 1917-18-19-20 and 21, inclusive. The counties of the State are divided Into districts, and figures showing the total appropriation, the amount expended previously, amount expended each month, total expended and balance given. In addition, the list of vouchers paid during the preceding month and chargeable to the counties are listed in itemized form. tThis report also gives general information to the public, such as anation of road laws, comparative reports, features of certain road ects, and interesting pictures. Maps and Plans The chief activities of the Division of Maps and Plans, have been the preparation of Federal Aid Road plans, State Standard Bridge plans, State Aid Bridge plans. State Institution Paving plans, Special Bridge and Culvert plans for Federal Aid Roads, and special bridge plans for the various counties. Federal Aid Road Plans. The preparation of the different stages of Federal Aid Road plans requires a vast amount of work, and these may be enumerated as follows: Federal \M Project Statements submitted and their subsequent approval by the Secretary of Agriculture; preliminary survey; reduction and check of survey notes; plotting alignment profile and cross-sections from the survey notes; laying tentative grade line; plan-in-hand field inspection by a Division Engineer in company with a Federal repre - sentative and local Highway officials; revision of tentative plans and completion of estimates covering all road construction items. </seg>
            <seg id="p542">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 541 The project statement includes a general statement of the existing conditions of the original road with respect to soil conditions, traffic and surface requirements; existing drainage structures, together with neces - sary new structures, and an estimated cost of the improvements. This statement is accompanied by a sketch map showing the location of the road with relation to towns, rural post routes, railroads, rivers and section lines, as well as other land division lines. The preliminary survey is made for the purpose of determining the existing alignment, profile, and drainage structures of the road which is to be improved, in order that this data may be used as a basts for constructing the new road. Accurate chaining, level and topographic* notes are necessary to assure a reliable estimate. Level rod readings show the true cross-section of the road at each 100-foot station, and at all necessary intermediate points. Bench marks are carefully established at convenient intervals for reference by the construction party. The reduction of survey notes from level rod readings as taken in the field to actual elevations with respect to standard or assumed datum, is handled in the office by the aid of a calculating machine. This eliminates errors which might occur if such reductions were made by the field party; such reductions are made before the plotting of notes. Plotting of alignment, profile and cross-section is carried on in the office, the first two being plotted on the same sheet, which is of standard size and design, as adopted by the U. S. Bureau of Public Roads, for use on all Federal Aid road work. These sheets show align - ment, profiile, bridges, culverts, fence and telephone lines, intersecting roads and driveways, railroad crossings, streams, trees, and buildings in the immediate vicinity of the road. Drainage notes are entered on the sheets, and are adopted or changed at the time of the plan-in-hand inspection. The cross sections are plotted on separate sheets, so designed that they may be used later in computing excavation quantities. Tentative grade lines are placed on the profile in such a manner as to make the excavation and adjacent embankment quantities balance approximately to avoid wasting of excavation or excess of embankment which would require borrow pits. This can be done quite readily in a rolling country, but in low, flat bottoms, and in level country, it is generally necessary that the grades be raised to such an extent that borrow pits are essential in order to obtain sufficient material. Maximum grades are established, and all existing grades in excess of the maximum are cut down to conform. Slightly rolling or short, choppy grades »r« eliminated when the extra cost is not excessive. All railroad crossings, road intersections, adequate permanent bridges and culverts are taken into consideration in the establishment of the tentative grade line. The grade line is shown in pencil only on the plans, so as to readily permit changes as recommended at the time of the plan-in-hand field inspection. Blue prints of the alignment and profile sheets are ziade in rolls and furnished to the Division Engineers, who arrange for the inspection. </seg>

S. Bureau of Public Ruads. The County Highway Commissioner and any or all members of the County Board are requested to be present at this inspection. Adjustments of alignment, grades, drainage structures, road surfacing or the type of the section of the road, as agreed upon by the members of the inspection party, are noted on the blue print plans, which furnish information to the office engineers for completing the plans for Federal approval. revision of the tentative plan is made immediately after the in-hand field inspection, and these plans are completed and submit - for Federal approval. The grade line is adjusted as recommended by the field inspection and the area of excavation and embankment is determined at each cross section, as taken on the preliminary survey from which the volume of excavation and embankment is computed between each cross-section, and totaled for the entire length of the project. Cuts and corresponding fills are divided into what is commonly known as balances, and are shown as such on the computation sheets. These are also placed on the profile for the guidance of the engineer and contractor at time of construction. The quantities are checked before plans are considered complete. All necessary borrow is indicated. Curves at road angles and turns are shown and additional right-of-way for such are indicated on plans. Pro - posed changes' in location of bridges and stream channel changes which will benefit the road location are properly indicated. When the plans are complete, all existing conditions are shown in black drawing ink, and all proposed changes, including the entire grade line, are shown in red ink. Recommended changes, extensions or repairs of present bridges and culverts are shown on the plans. If it is required that the county make such repairs, same are noted on the plans. State standard bridge and culvert plans governing the repairs, extensions and new work are referred to by number in the plan notations. All bridge and culvert work is noted on the plans, and if it is to be taken care of by the county, it is indicated. Complete computation sheets for excavation, embank - ment, borrow, overhaul and drainage structures, together with other miscellaneous structures, are made and checked, and are forwarded to the Federal District Engineer's office, along with an assembled estimate of all items entering into the construction of the project. Unit prices for estimates are based upon un analysis of the probable construction cost. This has been a difficult task under the general labor and financial conditions immediately following the war. An estimate is made by listing the quantities of the various items of construction at the unit prices estimated for each and totaling the estimate of the items; to this total is added an amount equal to 10 per cent of the estimate to cover engineering costs during construction, and for contingencies. The grand total is known as the estimated cost of the project, and is </seg>

The following information is submitted to the Federal District Engineers' office for their review and check: One copy of the detailed estimate, showing total estimated cost, the length in miles, average cost per mile, donations from county or other sources, and the amount of Federal Aid requested for the completion of the project. In addition, three complete blue print sets showing alignment and profile, and one complete blue print set of cross-section sheets, together with three prints of any special design, and the blue prints with notes thereon, which were made from the plan-in-hand field inspection, also accompany the detailed estimate. For further convenience of revision in the District office, the complete computation sheets are also forwarded, with the understanding that they be returned as soon as their review and check are completed. After submitting complete plans to the Federal District Engineers" office it is sometimes necessary that they be returned to this office for minor corrections, explanations, notations, etc., before the plans are finally approved. The advertising for bids and the awarding of contract!- follows immediately upon the approval of the plans by the Federal District Engineer. This completes the work of the Maps and Plans Division. on what is termed preliminary plans. It quite frequently occurs, due to unforreen conditions, such as soil. weather, drainage and in some cases financial and traffic conditions, that certain revision of plans are desirable during the progress of con - struction.

Explanation of Tabulated Sheets. In order that the various headings of the following sheets may be comprehensible, the following explanation is given: LThe headings under Project Statement are self-explanatory, as are e also under Surveys. Under the heading Preliminary Plans, the sub-head Tentative indi - cates that plans have been completed up to the plan-in-nand field inspec - tion. The sub-head Complete indicates that plans have been completed and approved by the Federal Government. The sub-head Construction indicates the type of construction, together with lengths, as is provided in the completed plans. The sub-head Estimated Cost indicates the estimated cost of the construction work as shown by original estimates, approved by the Federal government, and divided into the portions which are to be paid for by Federal Aid, by State Aid and by County, other funds such as donations, township or city appropriations', and special assessments. tThe heading Final Plan refers to the plan? after construction work ompleted, which are made and forwarded to the Federal District tneers' office, serving as a basis for final payment of Federal Aid. sub-head Partially Complete indicates those projects or portions of ects upon which construction work has recently been completed, and i which the final plans are in the course of completion in this e. The sub-liead Complete Indicates that the final plans for these ects or portions of projects have been completed and accepted by Federal Government, or are ready to be forwarded for Federal </seg>

The remark following the number indicates that this project, or portion of project, has been revised during construction and the data concerning such a revision is found on the numerical index line thus referred to. Lines No. 251 to 300, Inclusive of sheet No. 6, indicate the projects. or portions of projects, which have been revised after construction war started. The heading Re-Surveys indicates that the revised plans were based on re-survey notes for such a length as is indicated in this column. The sub-head Revised under Preliminary Plans indicates the length and year of the revision. Where no length is given, it means that only minor revisions of price or drainage structures were made, which did not require appreciable change in plans. The sub-head Length covers changes in length as affected by revision. The sub-head Construction indicates the type of construction affected by revision. The sub-head Estimated Increase indicates the amount of increase in estimated coat against Federal Aid, State Aid, County, etc., as affected by the revision. Sub-head Estimated Decrease covers the revision which resulted in a decrease of estimated cost. </seg>

            <seg id="p554">DEPARTMENT OK PUBLIC WORKS 553 State Standard Bridge Plans, The State laws require that the bridges in the various counties be built according to plans as provided by the State Department. This provision is made to insure that bridges of uniform and satisfactory design will be constructed in all counties. Previous to tbe passage Of this law the various bridge contractors submitted their own plans with their bids and it was, therefore, left to the County Boards to decide on the design to be used. The result of this practice was that the County Boards were unable to determine which were the best designs, and consequently many poor designs were accepted. As no two bridge contractors bid on the same plans, it was impossible to make an intelli - gent comparison of bids, and many poor designs were accepted at prices far too high. Several years ago. State Standard Plans' were prepared for the various types of bridges, from a four-foot span concrete arch culvert to 120 foot span rteel truss bridges. These were designed to carry as a live load a fifteen ton engine, which was designated as a twenty ton bridge. The maximum width of roadway was 16 reet. Plans were made for the two main types of Pratt truss steel bridges, with either wooden or concrete floors. This required four designs for each loading of any given length of span. For instance, if a twenty ton bridge with 60 foot span were desired, designs of the following are available: Pin Connected truss with wood floors 1 ; Rivet Connected truss with wood floors; Rivet Connected truss concrete floor. It has been considered advisable on account of the evolution of traffic to provide increased width of roadway on all new bridges on main roads. In accordance therewith this office did. during the year 1919, revise all twenty ton bridge designs to provide tor a roadway of 20 feet. The fifteen ton bridges were not revised, as they are to be used only on less important roads, where the 16 foot roaaway meets traffic conditions quite satisfactorily. This office also checks detailed shop drawings against State Standard plans for the various bridge companies before fabrication of the bridge is started This insures that the bridges, when fabricated and erected, will conform to the standard requirements To provide standard designs for practically all conditions, this office bas been re-designing ;he old standard plans to proviae for roadways of 16, is. and 20 feet. This will eliminate many extras on bridge contracts now required to cover roadways which are not shown on Standard Plan*. Improved practice in designs and details are being incorporated in our new plans. Provision Is also being made for the addition of bituminous wearing surface to a depth of two inches at any future date when It may be desired. This provision is as recommended by the Bridge Department of the U. 8. Bureau of Public Road, on Federal Aid Bridges. </seg>
            <seg id="p555">554 IIEPOKT OF SKCHKTARY Calculation of stresses and sizes of various members for the new Standard Plans is practically completed and some of the new plans have already been completed. State Aid Bridge Plant. The pl.ins for the various' State Aid Bridges are prepared in this office. These are each special designs, as our Standard Plans are not intended for these large river bridges. Plans were made during 1919 and 1920 for seven concrete urch bridges, four of these being across the North Platte River in Scotls Uluff County at Scottsbluffs, Morrill, Mina - tare and Henry. The remaining three were for bridges across tiie Platte River at Shelton. Grand Island, and Central City. Each of these bridges consisted of a series of concrete arches, each 50 feet in length, extending across the main portion or portions of the river channel. State Institution Paving Plans. Stiite Institution Paving Plans were prepared for 1.15 miles of brick paving connecting the State Institution for the Feeble Minded with the City of Beatrice, and for approximately 1 5 miles connecting the Peru State Normal with the railroad depot at that place. Special Bridge and Culvert Plant for Federal Aid Roads. It quite frequently develops that our Standard Bridge Plans and our Standard Culvert Plans for Federal Aid Roads will not meet special conditions which are encountered, and special designs are necessary to handle these conditions. Many special plans were made for headwalls, drop inlets, drop outlets, curved floors for culverts and for extensions and repairs to existing bridges and culverts. These must be approved individually by the Federal Bureau of Public Roads. Special Bridge Plans for Counties. When it is found that our Standard Bridge and Culvert Plans cannot be properly adjusted or modified to suit existing conditions in County Bridge work, it is quite frequent that the necessary information is furnished to this office and a special design prepared for each special condition. This is usually done at the request of the County Board or County Highway Commissioner. This cooperation between the Counties and the Department is of great benefit in getting the best results and in saving of County Funds. This Department encourages such coopera - tion from the Counties. Specifications. For the use of the State on State Aid Bridges, or for Federal and State Aid Bridges and culverts and for the use of the various County authorities, this Department prepares and distributes Standard Specifi - cations, published in 1917. These have become somewhat out of date, and were never officially approved for Federal Aid Bridge work. This necessitated some 'extra work in making special specifications for Indi- </seg>

The County Board has worked in harmony with the Department and as a result a united effort has been made to better the road condi - tions by expenditures from the various funds. Gravel deposits con - tiguous to the State roads have been found and with available funds a considerable amount of gravel surfacing will be placed. The State highways included in the County maintenance program consist of that part of Highways Nos. 46, 47 and 49 which, owing to the floods in the spring of 1920, required reconstruction. These roads which lie in the valley of the Klkhorn River were covered from one to five feet of water and were heavily silted. Thus the soil conditions due to the floods, changed from a heavy gumbo to soft sand requiring an expendi - ture for reconstruction of nearly 60 per cent of the entire maintenance tund. By constant patrol and aid of extra teams the roads have been in fair shape. No doubt Antelope county will be one of the first in the matter of road improvement and maintenance during 1921. Truck patrols aided by teams form the nucleus of the maintenance program. 1918-1920 State and Federal Aid Road Construction. This County has no Federal and State Aid Road Projects BOYD COUNTY. The relations of the County Board have been in harmony with the State Department and the various County road organizations have re - vived, each demanding a road in each district of the same type and quality as the State roads. The State roads under maintenance include that portion of State Highways Nos. 49 and 50 lying within the County. Highway Nos. 49 and 50, extending from Jamison to Monowi, was constructed by heavy gang maintenance crew and represents varied soils', from light sand, gumbo, to gravel on the hills. Highway No. 49 passes almost entirely through sand and clay hills to the Nlobrara River and steep grades are a feature of the road. Limited automobile tax funds have hindered the maintenance of roads in the County. At no time in 1920 were the roads impassable which, in comparison with former years, shows economy of well maintained and well constructed roads. Fully equipped truck partols have taken care of the maintenance program. ["otal Appropriation, less 5% $145,256.7!

The soil on the entire road is sand and gravel glacial deposit and in the future when more funds are available it may be used for surfacing. Truck and team patrol crews have accomplished fairly satisfactory work during 1920. The heavy gang maintenance crew together with a rented County outfit has been used on the road west of Ainsworth and Federal Aid funds are being expended on the road be- tween Long Pine and Ainsworth.

Two large and beautiful concrete bridges over the two creeks will soon be completed. BURT COUNTY. Burt County is one of the counties in the Second Division having first class constructed and maintained roads. The soil throughout is loess, typical of the Missouri River valley, with occasional deposits of gravel which may later be used for surfacing. The State roads included in the County's maintenance program are those parts of Highway Num- ber 12 (known as the Washington Highway), Highway Number 13 and Number 37. Number 12 extends from the Washington County line south of Tekamah to the Thurston County line north of Lyons; Number 13 ex- tends from the Dodge County line north of Hooper to Oakland; No. 37 extends west from Oakland to the Cuming County line. Heavy gang maintenance crews maintained Highway Number 13 during 1920, and County maintenance equipment was used on Highway Number 12.

Blair-Oakland Road. This road, which is now completed, comprises that part of the Wash- ington Highway from Blair, Washington County, to Oakland, Burt County. Heavy drainage structures were required and were partly paid for by the counties. Owing to inclement weather and labor shortage the culvert contractor was unable to complete his work within the specified time. Traffic has increased over this road so that at present 80 per cent of the tourists prefer this to the route on the east side of the Missouri River. See Washington County. CEDAR COUNTY. State Highway No. 17 represents the entire maintenance program of this County and extends from the Wayne County line south of Laurel to the Missouri River south of Yankton in South Dakota. State and Federal Aid road construction has been carried on during 1920 from the County line south of Laurel to Hartington. The soil varies from a heavy black gumbo in the valleys to loess, gravel and chalk rock in the hills. Most of the work of the patrol men has been spent on construction rather than maintenance owing to heavy rains and creek erosions. With normal weather conditions in 1921 a greater degree of success may be expected in the maintenance program. 1918-1920 State and Federal Aid Road Construction.

CHERRY COUNTY The hearty response of the County in all matters pertaining to road improvement for this County should be commended. Very little maintenance has been given to any part of the State road due to the type of soil encountered. From the Keya Paha County line to the Niobrara River the soil varies from heavy black loam to Urule Clay, while from Niobrara to Valentine it is composed mostly of fine sand with occasional Brule Clay hills extending above the general level of the sur- rounding country.

Considering that definite results in the matter of road improvement have not as yet materialized the co-operation of the County Board baa been fairly satisfactory. The State roads in this County include part of State Highway No. 38 and 28, commonly known as the Lincoln Highway and part of No. 27 and 35. Highways No. 38, 28 and 37 are located in the Platte River bottom, while Highway No. 35 is located in the loess hills on the north side of the Platte River, the latter having: exception- ally steep grades and requiring special care in maintenance. A claying program for the valley roads, has been formulated and will be carried on in the spring.

            <seg id="p607">606 REPORT OK SECKKTAUY Schuyler-Platte Road. The project consists of surfacing with concrete the highway from Schuyler, south to the State Aid Bridge. The road lies in the Platte valley and is subject to over-flow water being almost impassable for many months of the year. Silt covered the entire roadway after each of these floods and necessitated heavy maintenance expenditure without definite results. In the spring of 1920 pluns were completed and the contract let for construction, and on September 2'&gt;th the road was opened for traffic. Part of the coarse aggregate used was pumped on the property contiguous to the project, but later the aggregate was found to contain too much silt, and the plant was abandoned. Gravel of proper grading was found in the vicinity of Columbus, shipped in cars, and hauled to the work in wagons. The finishing and tamping was done by machinery and test cylinders of daily mixtures were taken by the testing engineer. These sometimes equalled or ex - ceeded the Standard l'otomac River gravel concrete. Some delay due to shortage of labor and cement was experienced. The traffic has increased to such an extent that 90 percent of the travel of the south side of the river traverses the pavement. CUMING COUNTY The County Board and the County Highway Commissioner have at all times co-operated with the Department and maintenance of the roads has been satisfactory. The State roads included in the maintenance program consist of part of State Highways Nos. 16, IT. 23 and 37, lying within the County, each representing a varied type of soil. Heavy gang maintenance crews have been used to advantage on the roads with the exception of No. 37. The valley roads at all times are subject to floods of the Elkhorn River and have presented a difficult problem both with regard to drainage and maintenance. Considerable Federal and State Aid work is contemplated for the County during 1921, and with the drainage properly and systematically cared for the County may expect gratifying results. 1918-1920 State and Federal Aid Road Construction.

This County has been unfortunate with regard to carrying on a road improvement program due to excessive rains during the late part of the summer which destroyed nearly all of the roads on the bottom land. However, by constant patroling and extra help, together with the ex- penditure of considerable maintenance fund? for culverts, bridges, etc.. these difficulties were fairly overcome. The co-operation of the County Board was a great factor in accomplishing the splendid results under such adverse circumstances. The State Highway No. 13 traverses the County from north to south connecting northern Iowa and Dakota with Kansas and Missouri. A por- tion of the road is through the loess hills of the Missouri River to the sandy bottom lands. Fully equipped truck and tractor patrols furnished the means for satisfactory maintenance. 1918-1920 State and Federal Aid Road Construction.

DIXON COUNTY. The maintenance program of this County constitutes the work on State Highways Nos. 23 and IT lying within the County. Contracts have been awarded and will be completed during 1920. The soil on Highway No. 23 is a heavy black gumbo with light s-and and loess on the hills with occasional outcrops of loose rock. The soil on Highway No. 17 is entirely loess which is easily maintained. Owing to the length of the patrol on No. 17 Wayne County has assumed the responsibility of maintaining the constructed part. That part of Highway No. 23 which is not under construction has been maintained .satisfactorily.

"More and Better Roads" is Holt County's slogan. The State roads included in the maintenance program are those parts of Highways Nob. 48, 49 and 65 lying within the County boundaries. Highway No. 48 ex- tends from Atkinson south and consists partly of sand which requires clay or heavy soil covering. It extends along the Elkhorn valley to the sandhills' to south County line. Highway No. 49 varies in soil from loose sand to coarse gravel with occasional deposits of heavy soil in the valleys. The soil of Highway No. 65 varies from sand to gravel outcrop- pings of which may be used for surfacing. The entire road between Antelope County line and O'Neill has been graded by the heavy gang maintenance crew, and covered with straw to prevent the sand from blowing. Maintenance equipment consists of truck patrols which have been successful considering the various types of soil encountered. 1918-1919 State and Federal Aid Road Construction.

Heavy Gang Maintenance Crews were in operation on the entire road from the Dodge County line to Blair and the finished road presents a uniform alignment and an excellent riding surface. Constant patrol and maintenance of this road has made it the most traveled road east and wet through Washington County. Highway No. 12 from Coffman to Blair has been patroled by light equipment. This road lies along the loess hills of the Missouri valley and is subject to erosion because of the light soil. The construction on the Blair to Florence road will be started next spring. From Blair north and west Federal and State Aid Funds were used in construction of both minor drainage structures and grading.

Only ordinary results have been obtained in the road program of this County, owing to the fact that it lies in a more or less arid region bordering Colorado on the east boundary; thus a small amount of mois- ture was available and road construction not entirely satisfactory. The State road traverses the County east and west over a comparatively flat prairie land. Co-operation from the County Board was immediate and positive as machinery was purchased and a patrol crew put into operation. In addition careful supervision of the expenditure of funds was taken care of by the County. The Federal Project in this 1 County has had the best consistent maintenance of any in the division. Ten miles of Federal and State Aid roads have been turned over to the County for mainten- ance. In addition ten miles have been shaped by county graders and with careful maintenance afford a perfect road from Imperial to Wauneta. From Imperial west to Lamar, 30 miles of prairie remain to be con- verted into roads.

The support of the State's road building and maintenance program by the County Board has been noteworthy and helpful. After the Highway Commissioner was appointed three patrol maintenance crews, fully equipped, were set to work. However, owing to the fact that construction progress was carried on at discon- nected points on the Federal Aid project the maintenance work was rather disjointed. Twelve miles of D. L.

Co-operation has been the keynote between the officers of the County and the Department in all matters pertaining to road construction and maintenance. Resolutions for construction by the heavy gang main - tenance crews were passed, a Highway Commissioner appointed, ma - chinery purchased, and the work started at an early date. An efficient patrol crew operating throughout the season, consisted of a light tractor, maintainer, drags and Federal truck, while an 8-foot blade and a second truck were purchased late in the season to augment this' equipment for 1921.

            <seg id="p637">636 REPORT OF SECRETARY HARLAN COUNTY Harlan County ranks fourth in the Division with 50 miles of State highways. Highway No. 52 follows the Republican River on the southern edge of the County, entering at the east County line between Xaponee and Republican City and ending at Orleans. Clay is the predominating soil except between Alma and Orleans where a heavy black loam is en- countered. This portion of the State highway comprises the part of Federal Aid Road Project No. 71 lying within Harlan County, all of which was under construction during 1920. Heavy expenditures for bridges from County funds have been n drain on the County bridge resources but have been promptly met by an enthusiastic County Board. Highway No. 55 from Alma to the Phelps County line — 22.75 miles — was all graded with heavy gang crew during l!&gt;2o. Highway No. 56. from the Phelps County line near Atlanta to Oxford — 11.5 miles — was graded early in the spring and has had two County grading crews maintaining it during this summer. Harlan County's treatment of maintenance is rather unique. as two tractor units are employed. The one opens the ditches and trims back slopes, and the other dresses up the ehoulder slopes and cares for the surface. Trucks and drugs operate as independent units. Main- tenance has been prompt, thorough, well-organized and excellent results obtained. 1918-1920 State and Federal Aid Road Construction Total Appropriation, less 5T $96,016.63 Total Expended to December 1st. 1920 20.017.14 Balance 7."i.999.49 Number Miles State Roads 50 Number Miles Constructed by Contract 10.1 Number Miles Surfaced 0 Number Miles Constructed by Heavy Gang Crew 33.75 Total Miles State Roads Constructed 43.85 Total Miles Contract Work Accepted 10.0 Number of Projects in County 1 Federal Aid Road Project No. 71 — Franklin-Orleans.

Harlan County's portion of Project No. 71 comprises 10.S5 miles and the construction calls for an average of 7.300 cubic yards of earth. From the east County line to Naponee the country is flat and the work con - sists mostly of casting in with but very little drifting. From Naponee west to the Republican River the grading is heavy. A re-location between Republican City and Alma requires that the County build a new bridge, thereby eliminating three dangerous short turns. All culverts have been placed by the contractor but three bridges remain to be placed by the County before final approval of the Govern - ment. See Franklin County for the remainder of the work on this project. HAYES COUNTY Meager funds, rough sandy country, and a large mileage have com - bined to make road construction and maintainance difficult in this County. Nebraska Highway No. 69 (D.L.D.) crosses the southwest corner of the County from Palisade to Wanneta — 14.75 miles; six miles of this road constitute Federal Aid Road Project No. 26. Highway No. 68 crosses the south County line 12 miles north of Culbertson and runs north and west through Hayes Center to the Perkins County line north — 44.25 miles. A Federal project 12 miles long from Hayes Center sjuth to the County line is proposed for 1921 construction. Co-operation from the County Board has been satisfactory. A light tractor and an S-foot blade grader constitute the equipment used for maintenance by the Highway Commissioner.

Lack of funds in this County has produced negligible results for maintenance. The County Board at once voted to pay for maintenance labor with County funds, but as County funds were small few miles could be worked, and thus no extensive maintenance program possible.

Considerable guard rail has been constructed to protect traffic from the danger of high fills. The grading contractor finished work in the middle of the summer. Most of the bridges have been built by the County, but the progress on culvert work has been very slow. This work was contracted for and to be paid for by the townships through which the road passed. Judging from this project it would &gt;eem a very poor system, as the State and County have no control whatever over the contractor and the townships, due to lack of interest, will not press the contractor to finish his work. At the present time the pipes are all laid but less than half of the head walls are constructed.

It has been difficult to get right-of-way in a few cases, as the property* owners did not see the benefits of the improve- ment. The first half of the season the maintenance was excellent but some difficulty has been experienced in having the roads kept up to standard the last half of the season.

HOOKER COUNTY. Hooker County is one of the five Counties known in the State as the "Sand Hill Group" in which there are no Federal and State Aid road projects. Twenty thousand dollars of State money was turned over to the County to be expended during 1920 under the direction of the County Highway Commissioner, County Board and a representative of the department for road improvement. The total appropriation of Federal and State Funds for the five year period 1917-21 amounts to $49,564.90. The balance of these funds will be turned over to the County at a later date and will be used entirely on roads of the State Highway System.

The response and co-operation of the County Board of Lincoln County with the Department with regard to the County improvement work has been especially good at all times. The type of soil on State roads in this County is so varied and of such materials as to make construction ex- pensive and extremely difficult. The soil varies from loose blow sand in the eastern portion and as far west as Brady. A dependable soil for a distance of three miles is found west of Brady and from this point six miles to Maxwell. It consists of an alkali gumbo which although graded with great difficulty, makes an excellent binder for gravel sur- facing, but is found to be unsatisfactorily maintained, unless gravel is added. From Maxwell west approximately 40 per cent of the soil makes a good road; 30 per cent is a sandy loam and makes a fairly good loam and 30 per cent is a loose sand very poor for such purposes. Im- provements are being made along the entire road. From North Platte west the soil is low and a swampy type making construction difficult and requiring a gravel surface. From Sutherland to the west county line the soil contains enough gravel to make a splendid road. 1918-1920 State and Federal Aid Road Construction.

It was found by the contractor that con- struction could not, be carried on as ordinarily, so a gasoline operated caterpillar dragline was used. A high grade was built by excavating wide deep ditch on the up-stream side of the road. The ditch is adequate to care for all drainage waters, and has proven beneficial for the adja- cent farms and hay meadows. The only objection to this type of con- struction is that it is uneven in settling, due to the unequal dumping from the dragline bucket and the subsequent packing before finishing. It will take considerable maintenance to correct this condition. It is recommended that dragline work be finished as soon as possible after excavation. McPHERSON COUNTY.

In many places where sand-clay is called for on this road, sufficient heavy material was found in the ditches adjacent to the road, thereby eliminating the necessity of hauling clay any long distance as- was originally planned. The contractor for the drainage structures exper- ienced some delay due to the inabittiy to get cement and in meeting the requirements for gravel. Grading has progressed slowly as the work was re-let to several sub-contractors who, in several instances quit work before completing their share of the project THOMAS COUNTY Thomas County along with four other Counties in the State, known as the "Sand Hill Group" have no Federal and State Aid road pro- jects. It win thought best, after taking into consideration the variety of soils encountered on the State roads in these respective Counties, to turn over for 1920, a definite sum of State money to be expended under the direction of the County Board, the County Highway Commissioner. and a representative of the Department. The total appropriation of Federal and State Funds for the live year period. 1917-1921. amounts to $44,080.14. State money to the amount of $20,000 was appropriated for road work in this county for 1920 and the balance will be turned over at a later date. The entire appropriation would be inadequate for the construction of any but small sections of the Federal approved type of road, owing to the peculiar condition of the soil. Thus, in some cases, a mile might require clay surfacing, the next two miles need no surfacing, but considerable grading, while the fourth mile might require a surfacing of hay. For this reason, such projects cannot be incorporated into a Federal Aid project, and thus the State money has been granted. Grant, Hooker.

Wheeler County is one of the five Counties known in the State as the "Sand Hill Group" in which there are no Federal and State Aid road projects. Twenty thousand dollars of State Funds were turned over to the County for 1920 to be expended under the direction of the County High - way Commissioner, the County Board, and a representative of the de- partment for road improvement. The total appropriation of Federal und State funds for the five year period 1917-21 amounts to $49,156.58. The balance of these funds will be turned over at a later date and will be used entirely on roads of the State highway system. See Thomas County for further explanation. 1918-1920 State and Federal Aid Road Construction. The general response of the County Board in Wheeler County has been fair.

Like Grant County on the north, the State road in Arthur County is composed almost entirely of blow sand, with the exception of those points whore it crosses meadows, a sandy loam is found. Surfacing material which can be used for a blanket is found in the meadows in the vicinity of the road, but unfortunately their location is such that the haul in some instances will be excessive. A team patrol has been maintaining the road from Arthur south to the County line throughout the season, covering a distance of 16 miles. All of the wurst sandy stretches of this mileage have been strawed, and considerable has been accomplished in the way of widening narrow cuts and fills. 1918-1920 State and Federal Aid Road Construction. Federal Aid Road Project No. 94 — Arthur-Roscoe, Arthur County Project No. 94 Arthur-Roscoe road, on which construction will begin in the spring, extends from Arthur south to the County line, on the route to Keystone. Practically all of it is blow sand and will require surfacing throughout. In some of the deeper cuts on the road, fences will be placed in much the same manner as a snow fence is placed, to keep the sand from blowing over the finished surface of the roadway. From an economic point of view, an excellent road south will mean much to Arthur County as it is the county seat and depends entirely upon trucks and team haulage for furnishing supplies. BANNER COUNTY North of Harrisburg the soil consists of a light sandy loam whic'.i although light seems to pack fairly well under traffic. To the south, sandy strips are encountered which are being surfaced under Project No. 16-A, Kimball-Harrisburg, now under construction. Continuing south after the table land is reached, the soil is a light loam which makes ex - cellent road building material. Using a County outfit, the State road has been graded during the season from Harrisburg north to the County line. The Commissioners offered the use of the County equipment for this work, and with the exception of a few hills requiring team work, a fairly good grade has 22 Total Appropriation, less 5% !

Due to a shortage of funds, the County has been seriously handicapped in carrying on the work. Between Harrisburg and Gering at the County line, there is a very steep range of hills over which the State Highway passes, and efforts have been made from time to time by the citizens of both counties to rais'e money enough to build a passable road through these hills. Early in the season Scotts Bluff County let the contract for a road through the hills as far south as the County line, which left about seven-tenths of a mile to be built by Banner County in order to complete the project. Through the efforts of the Commissioners, and local citizens Banner County raised the necessary funds to complete the work, and the new road will provide a splendid outlet to the north of the County. 1918-1920 State and Federal Aid Road Construction.

The sentiment in the County appears to be strong for good roads. and the Commissioners have ordered two new trucks to be used with maintainers on the County road system. Splendid co-operation has been gained from local officials and Commercial Clubs in carrying out the season's program. North of Alliance the soil to the County line consists, for the most part, of a sandy loam, with occasionally a sandy strip requiring surface treatment. It is not difficult to maintain and when smooth, forms a very good wearing surface. Bast of the town the same conditions obtain, with the exception of the last mile and a half which is light blow sand, and is being surfaced as Project No. 21. Beginning at Alliance, the State road has been graded north to the County line for a distance of 27 miles with the heavy gang maintenance crew. Two truck patrols have been provided for maintaining the system. one operating from Alliance east to the County line and north nine miles; the other from a point nine miles north of Alliance to the Dawes County line. The latter patrol passes through no towns, and the problem pre- sents itself of securing housing facilities for the men. A portable bunk house has been made to serve the purpose. 1918-1920 State and Federal Aid Road Construction.

The highway parallels the Burlington the entire distance and when completed will form an important link in a comprehensive system of roads which the Commissioners have laid out with a view of facilitating the hauling of the wheat crop to market. DAWES COUNTY In the matter of amount of funds for the proper maintenance of the State highways, the County has been E-eriously handicapped. The County Commissioners realizing this Jiave very generously contributed work at various places, and together with equipment, have in no small degree made possible the successful carrying out of the road work in the County. With the exception of a few miles' of graded roads in the vicinity of Chadron and Crawford, the State highway through Dawes County unti the present year consisted of a mere trail with scarcely any drainage This season 42 miles have been graded with State equipment, from Crawford to Chadron, and east to the County line. Much of the work was heavy, involving in addition considerable team work. Two truck patrols have been operating in the County since April. The mileage covered has been too large to Justify good work, but in another year the funds should permit the addition of a third patrol. Early last spring the County suffered heavily from floods on the White river and Chadron creek, necessitating the replacement of many of the larger wooden bridges. Most of these have been taken care of and the damage repaired. Corrugated pipe has been ordered for the drainage on the work built by the heavy gang maintenance crews.

On the Lincoln Highway through Kimball County for the most part the soil is well adapted to road building. West of town a good gravel is to be secured at several points which will work in well with any sur- facing program that may be adopted in the fulure. The County Commissioners are using the partol system for mainte- nance on the more important County roads, and have secured a truck from the Department for this work. Under heavy maintenance the State highway has been graded from Kimball to the State line, and east four miles, making 25 miles of this class of work.

The "Potash Highway" passes through the lower part of Sheridan County and consists very largely of blow sand covered with sparse vegetation. Along the route are frequent small alkali lakes containing mud which, if care is used in selecting, may bq used as a blanket for the sand. A fairly satisfactory surface may be secured by placing this alkali mud on the road, but the initial cost is high and subsequent maintenance heavy. Under heavy maintenance the road has been graded from the west County line, through Hayes Springs to Rushville and east four miles. a total distance of twenty-four miles. One truck patrol has been operat- ing the entire season from Rushville west to the County line and a second patrol to the line east through Garden; on the south a team patrol has been working intermittently from Lakeside west to the County line. A team outfit followed by a heavy gang maintenance crew through the County takes care of road intersections, approaches. culvert openings, etc. On the Potash Highway between Lakeside ard Antioch five miles were worked over by filling in the low swampy places and surfacing the sandy stretches.

Early in the season the County entered into a contract for a team fresno outfit to be used along the highway to handle such work as might be properly done by the heavy gang maintenance crew. Under this contract the road south from Mitchell through the river flat has been raised for a distance of a half mile. West of town three miles of roads were built through sandy and seepy ground that could not be handled by the grading crew. Other team outfits had been used periodically throughout the season on a similar kind of work. kEast of Minatare by the courtesy of the Reclamation Service the of their drag line aided in building a mile and a half of State high - through the flats.

Considerable blasting has been accomplished on the hills at different points on the State highway during the season, and the construction diffi- culties in this County in the building of roads are numerous. West of the County rsat to the State line the soil is a sandy loam a large part of which will require surfacing. Smiley Canyon through which the high- way passes at the east County line will involve heavy construction and from a scenic point of view can hardly be surpassed. The need of good roads in Sioux County is quite generally recognized, and local officials together with Commercial Clubs have done much to aid in road con- struction. The heavy gang maintenance crews have built the State road from the County seat west through the County line nine and one-half miles and from Harrison east four miles. Next year it is planned to continue this work east to connect with the Smiley Canyon project which will then be under construction. -.engtn 52 of a mije (Bridge 644 ft., S-Clay .4 mile) Percentage ( 'omplete 40 estimated Cost $150,083.71 'ederal Aid 75,041.85 State Aid 75,041.86 </seg>

            <seg id="p692">RELOCATION OF ROADS A very important factor and oft-times the most problematic in road construction is that of the relocation of roads. In this State particularly, relocation is recommended after the preliminary survey has been com - pleted, as a more careful study has shown additional improvements may be affected by considering carefully such points as channel change, rail - road crossings, steep contours and dangerous curves. In this State, a grade of from six to seven per cent may be con - sidered a maximum ruling grade for the average road. Taking into con - sideration the varying conditions present on all roads, the most econom - ical grade is the ruling grade. For this reason, it is economical to increase the length of the road or make similar apparently expensive changes if a reduction of grade will result. The Federal Aid road from O'Neill to Butte in Holt County will illustrate the above point. The original location had a grade of eight per cent for a distance of 1.900 feet. The original line was located on the present road which runs straight down the face of the bluff. The re-location was run slightly to the west, supporting down the hill, with a maximum grade of 7.3 per cent for a distance of 1,200 feet. The length increased 595 feet but excavation decreased 8,659 cubic yards. The saving, figured on the basis of the yardage decrease, was $5,628.35. Naturally, the advantage in the increased length of the road resulted in the reduced grade. Power required to mount the grade on the road increased propor - tionally to the per cent of the grade. In Harlan County, on the Franklin to Orleans Federal Aid road No. 71. the original location made dangerous detours for a distance of 1.400 feet to meet an old bridge which was to be repaired by the County. A re-location was recommended which straightened the alignment and improved the line of vision, making it necessary for the County to build a new 50-foot steel span bridge. The project was shortened 105 feet and the possibility of overflow was entirely eliminated while the excavation was increased 164 cubic yards, thereby increasing the cost $105.00, ex - clusive of the cost of the new bridge which was to be built by the County, at an approximate cost of $5,000. The new bridge is to be standard twenty ton to meet the Federal requirements. The cost in - creased but a permanent improvement affected. In Antelope County, on the NelighAlbion Federal Aid road, project No. 83, a re-location affected a saving of approximately $1,000.00. At the southeast corner of Section 18, Township 24, north.

            <seg id="p693">692 300 feet north of the corner and the south section line, 1,400 feet west of the line. This necessitated two railroad crossings within 1,700 feet of each other as laid out by the preliminary survey, one crossing was considered very dangerous as it was located in a deep cut. It is proposed to re-locate the road parelling the railroad on the north side and thereby eliminating two grade crossings. This change made, will improve the grade, shorten the project 600 feet and reduce the cost $1,000. These are but a few of the relatively important changes recommended after the preliminary stirvey has been made. It can be readily seen from the foregoing projects that considerable time can be profitably spent on the original location by the preliminary survey party, not only from an economical standpoint but that of a permanent and actual improve - ment. </seg>
            <seg id="p694">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 693 CONVICT LABOR ON STATE HIGHWAYS During the season of 1920, convict labor was used to construct State highways in Seward, Johnson and Pawnee counties. This is the second time such labor has been used for road building in Nebraska Convict labor for road improvement in Nebraska was first used in 1915, at which time the preceding session of the Legislature appropriated the sum of $35,000 to pay for the State's share of paving along the south and east sides of the State Agricultural School at Lincoln, the appro - priation carrying with it the provision that the Governor might employ convict labor or let the work to a contractor. When the 1918 session of the Legislature inaugurated the present progressive program of road improvement for Nebraska, they made pro - vision that "the Department of Public Works acquire land and equipment (or road building materials," and in connection with same that "for the purposes provided in this section, said Department may enter into con - tract with the Board of Commissioners of State Institutions, for the employment of convict labor." During the week of April fifth to ninth, 1920. the Department of Public Works decided, because of the excessively high prices bid on earth excavation, to reject all bids on Federal and State Aid road pro - jects numbered 128 A in Seward County, 43-A in Johnson County, am 97-A in Pawnee County and do the grading with State or rented equip - ment and convict labor. The lowest prices bid on the above projects ranged from 63% cents to 64.9 cents per cubic yard, and the Depart ment contracted to do the same work at the estimated price, which was 50 cents per cubic yard on two of the projects and 55 cents on the other project. As a direct result of this action, the bid prices for earth excavation became more reasonable at subsequent lettings, settling a an average of 58 cents per cubic yard. The net profit gained by the State on account of this influence over the prices for all the State during the remainder of the season was greater than will be the profit gained by the use of convict labor on the three projects when completed. The prisoners were carefully selected for the camps by the Board of Commissioners of the State Institution, upon the recommendations of the warden ot the Penitentiary. The majority of those chosen were convicted for minor offenses and are serving short terms. However, a few are serving long terms. The Department of Public Works paid the State Institution $2.25 per day for each man; seventy-five cents of which was for the Institution and the remainder for the man, but held in trust for him by the Institution. The camps were conducted upon the honor system, using only one day and one night guard In each camp, with assured confidence in the men that they would make good in camp and be returned at the end ot the season with good records. When a man failed to live up to his trust, he was returned to the Institution. A total ot ninety man war* </seg>

Two escaped early in the season, but one was recovered before the end of the season. Several of the men were re - turned from time to time during the season for breaking the rules of the camp. The Johnson County project extends from Tecumseh to Crab Orchard, a distance of 13.86 miles, and called for 115,700 cu. yds. excava - tion. The culvert and bridge work was done by private contractors. The equipment used by the State consisted of three Holt Caterpillar tractors two elevating graders, dump wagons, twelve-foot blade, scarifier and twelve-foot tractor fresno tor finishing road surface. The equipment listed belonged to the State and in addition twenty teams 1 were Vented together with other necessary barn and camp equipment to make a complete outfit. The men were housed and fed in bunk cars. The Pawnee County project extend.-* from Table Rock through Pawnee City towards Lewiston. a total distance of 15.7 miles requiring 109.100 cu. yds. of earth excavation. The colored prisoners were assigned to this camp for use as labor on the grading. The culverts and bridges were built by private contractors. In this camp the same equipment as listed for the Johnson County project minus the scarifier, twelve-foot fresno and one Holt tractor, were used. The Seward County project extends from Seward east on the S. Y. A highway to the Lancaster County line. The flat or more level portions of this road were graded with a tractor and blade graders without Federal and State Aid. The portion graded by the use of convict labor is 6.68 miles and required 84,200 cu. yds. earth excavation. The project was originally laid out to include 7.18 miles with 90,400 cu. yds. excava - tion, but was later reduced after petition from the Seward County Board. The equipment used on this project was the same as on the Johnson County project except that for one of the channel changes a small one-half yard dragline was employed to advantgae. As the season advanced the men became more efficient with their work. In fact, at the end of the season eight of the prisoners were beniT employed as elevating grader operators and dump men, and three aa tractor operators. Those employed as skilled laborers were paid one-half the rate paid free labor for the same work. In addition to the work outlined above, thirteen colored prisoners were assigned to work in the Department's Garage and Equipment yards at Sixth and South Streets in Lincoln. They were kept out two weeks, during which time they placed the concrete floor in the new State garage and also dug the trenches for the water supply for the yards. During this period, one prisoner endeavored to leave the works but was captured befcrc he had gone a mile. </seg>

            <seg id="p698">DEPARTMENT OF PfBI.IC WORKS 697 MAINTAINANCE OF STATE AND COUNTY ROADS. Nebraska has entered into the largest campaign of its history. The State will have expended State and Federal Aid funds to the amount of nearly $11000.000.00 for road construction at the close of 1921. This large expenditure may be said to be the largest business the State and County officials have to handle. No sane person should condemn a policy which tends to conserve such an investment, passing it on to posterity intact. Organized maintenance is a means to such an end. By organized maintenance is meant a system of maintenance which functions and cc-ordinates in such a manner that responsibility may be placed upon the proper party. The system of maintaining highways by old patbmaster methods is inadequate. Two years ago legislation was enacted which provided means for the maintenance of the State Highway System. The majority are familiar with the provision of the law and its operation. Prior to that time maintenance was but a theory — not a condition. Today, speaking from experience, the theory may be discarded. The highways have been maintained this year according to definite plans, and the results are credible. The result has appealed to the automobile owner to such an extent that his license tax is an asset — not a liability. The greatest problem that Nebraska has to deal with is the main - tenance of earth roads. Many and varied types of soil within the borders necessitates consideration of maintenance methods' depending upon the character of the soil. To successfully maintain an earth road necessitates having the road first constructed according to standard — a 24-foot road with the crown one-half inch to the foot, with suitable side ditches. About 1,225 miles of roads on the State Highway System have been built by Federal and State Aid. It was therefore necessary to have the remaining mileage conform to a uniform cross-section and grade. As a result it was decided to organize crews, equipped with one 20 Ton tractor and two heavy 12-foot grade bladers. Skilled operators were put in charge of such outfits and provided with the necessary camp equipment and sent into the various counties to grade roads which were not improved by State and Federal Aid. Thirty of these outfits were assigned and excellent results obtained. After the roads were shaped by these heavy maintenance crews, patrol work was at once started on the surface, and after a few days work with a maintainer, drag or plane the surface was kept in race track condition throughout the summer. Nearly 1,400 miles were built by these outfits during the season at an approximate cost of less than $100 per mile, which o' course did not include equipment depreciation. The patroling of State roads may be divided into two types, namely, team and truck or tractor. The team patrols, of which there are nearly </seg>

            <seg id="p700">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 699 one hundred in the state, patrol approximately six hundred miles ol State highways. These patrolmen are hired by contract and are required to furnish a team out of their monthly salary, and give their entire time to the care of the road. Not only does this require looking after sur - face maintenance, but repairing ditches, opening culverts, emergency repair of bridges and guard rail, maintaining all official road signs, etc Some states have written specifications covering the type of man necessary for this work. These specifications put forth a man with the executive genius, of a Nepolean, the courtesy of a Chesterfield, the strength of a Sundow. and the inventive genius of an Edison. Nebraska's standard may have fallen short of such a superman, but generally speaking satisfactory results have been secured. Wherever they have failed to produce satisfactory results the personal equasion was not the principle factor. The remaining roads of the State Highway System are maintained Ly patrolmen equipped with trucks or tractors. Nearly seven hundred ninety miles are being worked with tractors as motive power. The truck is used on nearly two thousand five hundred miles of State highway. Throughout the State the preference seems to be given the truck as molive power. The reasons assigned may be as follows: 1. As a large number of army trucks were available it was possible to assign them to counties at a low first cost. 2. As the speed rate of a truck is higher, a greater mileage may be covered in a given length of time than with a tractor. 3. When not engaged in repairing surfaces the truck may be used for hauling materials to the road and provides a quicker method of transporting the patrolman and his helper to the required spot where the emergency repairs are necessary. The tractor of course has an advantage it there is considerable blade grader work as slow speed in this case is desirable. The comparative costs of patroling roads used by the different types of motive power are given under the heading "Patrol Maintanance" else - where in this report. This analysis gives an average cost of tractor patrol lor three months on a fourteen mile section based upon five patrols as $1.38 per mile per day. The total maintenance cost of a truck patrol for the three month period of a seventeen mile patrol section based upon eleven patrols amounted to $.94 per mile per day. In comparison the cost of a team patrol for the same period based upon ten patrols of a six mile average section shows a cost of $1.38 per mile per day, the same as the average cost of a tractor patrol. A motor patrol requires two men — one for operating the motor and the patrolman proper who operates the various devices used for planing and repairing the roads. Nearly all motor patrols are equipped with a </seg>
            <seg id="p701"/>
            <seg id="p702">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 701 maintainer of the flexible blade type, a drag or plane and small tools. He should also have, at his disposal, a small blade grader. The same duties as outlined for a team patrolman are applicable to a motor patrol - man and should the State hold strictly to the specifications of a patrol - man as has been previously mentioned the same type of superman would be required for this work also. The team patrol has many advantages. The patrol section is shorter and the patrolman can give the road closer attention. .It is very easy for him to stop when defects are noted, whereas the motor patrol - man passes over them rapidly and as a result defects are more liable to escape his notice. The great fault found with team patrol in the eastern part of the state where the soil is heavy has been that a team has not sufficient power to haul a drag or even a Wisconsin plane, and conditions must be just right to haul even a small blade This means that the surface is 1 neglected when dragging is most needed — directly after a rain. A patrolman has to wait until he can borrow another team cr haul a light tool over the road, which fails to leve ruts. Two horses to a patrolman in the eastern part of the State i power enough just to be useless. The motor patrol has sufficient power to haul various planing de vices, and generally keeps the surface as smooth as a billiard ball. The disadvantage of this patrol is, that in planing the road the patrolman is ever alert for the bump, rut or hollow ahead of him and he does not pay much attention to the ditches or shoulders or other parts of the road outside of the 24-foot road surface. It is inconvenient for him to stop and this part of the road is often neglected. To equalize matters, the motor patrol should be shortened so that the patrolman can attend to these duties, and the team patrol should be required to furnish more power when dragging operations are needed. One of the greatest troubles experienced during the past year has been the neglect of ditches and shoulders. It is a question whether or not it is good practice to seed road shoulders. Where vegetation is allowed to grow, the weeds and grass encroach on the roadway. The road plane, avoiding grass, weeds, etc., results in a narrowed roadway with a ridge of sod on the outside which prevents the surface water from passing freely to the ditches. Aside from this fact the road presents an unsightly appearance. During the entire summer's season the surface dirt is being carried to the ditches by both water and wind. This dirt must be brought back to the road over the shoulders, by use of a blade maintainer and grader. Best results are accomplished where the shoulder line of the 24-foot roadway is kept well denned both on cut and nil sections. This may be accomplished by marking out the shoulder lines with a flexible blade maintainer, and then smoothing the shoulder with a small blade. Ditches should be protected from wash, and some sort of check provided on hills where the soil washes badly. The patrolman should </seg>
            <seg id="p703">702 BKPORT OK SKCUKTARY be ever ready to provide some sort of temporary ditch check when w;ish starts, and to make this permanent as soon as possible. It is believed advisable to shape all of the roads with a heavy blade outfit at least once in every three years, in order to restore the road section to standard. Various hard surfaced types of road require particular attention A brick pavement will need no surface repairs for at least twenty years, if It has been properly designed and constructed, however the shoulders and ditches will require attention of the same type as those on an earth road, and therefore patroling will be necessary. A concrete pave - ment needs ditch maintenance. Very few concrete roads have been built which did not crack, and the surface repairs consist of filling these cracks with asphalt or tar. A macadam road needs constant pat ruling. If the road is laid with a bituminous binder the patrolman's best tjot is a supply of cold patch emulsion for small depressions, and a portable heater with a supply of small sized stone, together with material for the larger holes. A macadam should have a surface treatment of light cold oil every two or three years and a new top course after the first five years This of course depends upon the quality of the stone. A patrolman equipped with a single horse and wagon together with small tools and heater, etc., with materials for repair distributed not more than a mile apart will probably maintain nearly four miles of macadam road. Gravel roads are maintained in nearly the same manner as earth roads, materials being available at short intervals for the patching process, the road can be smoothed readily with a Wisconsin plane, and new material added together with a binder, as the holes appear. Gravel in this state is of a very fine texture and makes excellent roads when not spread too thick, and splendid results may be obtained with one or two inches of gravel spread over heavy soils. State roads are the arterial line of communication —the county roads the feeder. The latter may be maintained exactly in the same manner with but a few modifications. Such roads should first be laid out and public opinion regarding the location obtained first. They should then be graded in a systematic way, the County Highway Commissioner con - structing, each year, as funds will allow. The work should be cared for section by section without fear or favor until the entire system is completed. Then the roads may be maintained by the County. Crews are assigned to certain districts to care for. This is applicable to the eastern counties. The western counties have an individual problem for their funds are not nearly commensurate with their mileage. The funds should be concentrated and not spread, thereby doing as much work as possible each year making this work worth while. A subject which requires reasonable and practical consideration is that of snow removal. Snow to a depth of two feet or more has no ten - dency to drift and being fairly light can be cheaply handled with a </seg>
            <seg id="p704">DEPAKTMKNT OP PUBLIC WORKS 703 blade attached to the front of a truck. If the snowfall is less than two feet it has been demonstrated that a truck can draw a maintainer or blade grader and keep the road in excellent condition. In case of drifts a skimmer or rotary is practical. Kadi County should build portable snow fences and place them at cuts where the wind has a full sweep. Snow rollers and packers are used in the east, but they would be useless in this State generally, although a packer might be used advantageously in some parts of the State. The old fashioned "V" snow plow is effective if it can be hauled or pushed through the drifts. In conclusion it might be said that the condition of al) roads will be directly proportional to the energy of the patrolman, and roads will be kept in best condition where there is a spirit of co-operation between County and State officials.

            <seg id="p710">THE PATROL MAINTENANCE SYSTEM IN NEBRASKA The Patrol Maintenance System, organized in the State the first of April, 1920, has been in operation a little over four months, and although late in starting, it has covered a fairly good mileage, and offers a rather interesting and representative report. At the beginning of the season, each of the five Division Engineers, who each have direct charge of the highway work on the State System of an average of eighteen counties, held meetings with the County Boards of each county, in which they took up the matter of highway main - tenance of the roads in that county, together with the matter of funds available for such maintenance, and methods to be adopted. In nearly every county, there were funds left over from the 1919 Automobile li - cense tax, which had not been expended, and this amount, added to the minimum amount which the County Board and the County Treasurer stipulated would, in all probability be collected in that county for 1920 automobile tax, constituted the total available fund for the maintenance expenditures on the State roads of each county. There are three methods of maintaining these roads — namely, by team, truck or tractor. The team patrol consists of one man. who fur - nishes his own team and equipment, and who is paid an average of $175 per month. It can be seen that there is 1 no expense to the State nor the County by this method, as there is no depreciation costs, no feed costs, nor interest on teams to take into consideration when figuring the cost per mile for such maintenance. The equipment necessary may be listed as follows: Equipment for Team Patrol. 1 Six-Foot Blader 1 Farm Wagon 1 Planer 1 Scraper or Fresno 6 Miles — Average 1 Plow Team Patrol Section Small Tools Two men are required for the truck patrol method, and are paid $120 per month; the gas and oil is furnished by the County Boards' who are in turn, reimbursed by the State. This method is used where there is a large mileage to cover. The trucks used are a part of the equip - ment turned over to the State by the War Department, for use on State roads. The price of these trucks to the Counties was the amount of freight and expense put on by the State, and averaged nearly $1,000 varying according to the type of body. The average price of the truck, were the county to purchase them market value, would average from $3,500 to $5,000 a piece. This would necessarily increase the cost of maintenance accordingly. The equipment usually found may be listed as follows: </seg>

Khway Maintainers Wisconsin Planer 14 Miles — Average all Tractors Buck Scraper Tractor Patrol Buck Scraper Tractor Patrol Shovels Section. In order to determine the best methods of maintenance, twenty-two different States were visited and the methods used investigated, and the remits obtained. We concluded that the State of Wisconsin had conditions most similar to those in Nebraska, and that that State was getting a great deal more benefit from the money expended than any of the twenty-two visited. We requested the Chief of the Bureau of Roads to spend two weeks studying the methods of the Wisconsin Highway De - partment. The results of his investigation were explained to the County officials before any definite system of maintenance was adopted. As is stated elsewhere, it was necessary to consider, before completing a maintenance system, that the State had in its possession over 200 army trucks which were available for use on State roads. This fact made it necessary that a plan for patrol maintenance of this type be advised to counties having a large mileage to cover. Also, in some of the counties, in which portions of State and Federal Aid projects were partially completed during 1919, we urged last fall, that these counties do something toward the maintaining of the finished portion of these projects. As at that time teams were hard to find, and the army trucks not yet available, it was recommended that the counties purchase light farm tractors with which to pull the highway maintainers. Thus the three types of maintaining State roads developed and were put in operation April 1, 1920. tNow after four months of continuous operation, it is possible to e a comparative analysis of the three methods used. In making the parison, a three month period of operation has been taken — April, and June. However, we have not taken into consideration the condi - s of the soils of the various roads maintained, nor the weather litions. upon which the condition of all roads Is dependent. This or naturally enters into the costs, and either increases, or lowers n. according to the existing conditions. The following cost figures are quoted as an average, representative of the cost of the three kinds of patrol maintenance, per day. per mile, on roads which are a part of the State Highway System. We would call </seg>
            <seg id="p712">DKPAKTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 711 attention to the fact that it was necessary for a large part of the small equipment to be bought, as well as the machinery. Nevertheless, the counties taken, show a representative amount and kind of work.

However, one must take Into consideration that this figure is based on a 14 mile patrol section; while the average cost of maintaining one mile per day by team is $1.38, it is based on a 6 mile patrol section. It would seem from the figures that the tractor patrol covered twice the mileage covered by the team patrol, and at the same unit rate. However, this is not the case, as the cost of the team patrol per day is $8.32, and the section covered is six mi.es. Now in order to find the cost of the team patrol for fourteen miles, it would be necessary to consider the same mileage. This means that the cost of one and one-third team patrols would be added to the cost of one team patrol (6 miles) in order that the </seg>
            <seg id="p713">712 mileage covered would be fourteen — thus, $11.29 added to $8.28 will bring the cost nl the team patrol lor fourteen miles to nearly the same figure as the tractor patrol cost for fourteen miles, or $19.41 (a difference of $.10). The cost of the team and tractor patrol for a fourteen mile section is practically the same. In this connection it might be stated that for an all-round careful patrol, the team cannot be excelled, as it is much easier to stop and fix ruts, small chuck-holes and the like, when driving a team, than when driving a tractor or a truck. In so tar as: the amount of work accom - plished is concerned, this factor is entirely dependent upon the care of the patrolman, for a conscientious patrolman will work diligently, doing the most careful work possible in the shortest length of time. This is one reason why the Wisconsin State Highway Department favors the team patrol." However, in this State where there is a large mileage to cover, we have found that the truck is perhaps the most economical and best type of patrol. The costs quoted, are, as stated before, an average, and are based on 'he average patrol sections. The cost per day per mile does not actually mean that one mile is gone over but once for the cost quoted, but as many times as necessary. Here again enters the subject of weather and soil conditions. The condition of the road will regulate the number of times the road will have to be gone over. The figures, on face value, would Indicate that the truck and maintainer method is the most desirable in all cases — however here enters the matter of the reliability of machinery against that of the teams. For instance, on a newly constructed grade, with deep fills, it is evident that the larger part of a patrolman's time will be spent in using the slip, if the patrol is team, while on a more level road a truck and highway maintainer would take care of ninety per cent of the work. There is one more thing that should be taken into consideration with regard to the cost per mile per day for the different kinds of patrol maintenance — that is.that the cost of each patrol section will materially decrease if the road is kept in first class condition the greater part of each season. The back slopes, especially, in the cuts will soon become grass covered, and thus will require little maintenance, as they do not wash. At the present time, the new cuts have a tendency to wash, and unless there is some kind of ditch check, the elope will be worn in a short time. The patrolman should be vigilant in noting any tendency of this nature, and immediately place brush to protect the ditch washing, until such a time as he can construct a more suitable protection. Later a more permanent check may be provided, and installed. In conclusion, it may be said that the cost of patrol maintenance is a factor that is almost entirely under the control of the patrolman, for after the road is completed, the problem of drainage and road sur - face belong entirely to him, and he must render the invaluable service of keeping it in first class condition for the traveling public. </seg>
            <seg id="p714">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 713 DIVISION OF TESTS. The Testing Engineer, Mr. Clark E. Mickey.has charge of the anal - ysis and tests of all the materials used in the construction of State and Federal Aid roada and bridges. This includes portland cement, sand, sand-gravel, gravel, crushed rock, concrete, steel reinforcing bare, con - crete and corrugated pipe tests, oils, asphalts, tars, and paving materials In addition to analyzing and testing, recommendations are made as to the advisability of using such materials and inspections of the actual work in progress is made for the purpose of aiding the Project Engineer in securing the best possible results. Reports are made to the Chief ol the Bureau of Roads and Bridges who in turn rejects or approves and reports the results to the Federal District Engineer's office. No materials are used that do not meet the requirements of the Standard Specifics tions of the Federal Government. Testing. The principle object in view in the testing and analyzing of materials used, or proposed to be used in the construction of State and Federal Aid roads and bridges is for the purpose of determining their suitability for this use. The specifications for the various kinds of work state specific ally the specifications for the materials to be used, and as far as possible the materials are tested to determine whether or not they meet with the specified requirements. The methods used for conducting all of the tests and analysis of materials are as provided by the American Society for Testing Materials. On account of the lack of a sufficient quantity of good commercial crushed rock to be used as concrete aggregate, it has been necessary to design a concrete made of sand-gravel aggregate. Nebraska has a large number of deposits of this material, which when of the right analysis, makes an excellent aggregate for concrete. A large number of tests have been made on the sand-gravel aggregate. This determines those particular characteristics which it must have in order to make the best concrete. These tests will be continued for another year. In parallel with the sand-gravel tests, two concrete cylinders six inches in diameter and twelve inches long are moulded in cylo-con paper moulds for each day's run of concrete pavement, concrete pavement base, concrete curb and gutter mixtures, and concrete bridges. Records are kept of the compressive strength of these concrete cylinders at the seven day age and the twenty-eight day age. Together with these tests are recorded the complete physical test for the portland cement and sand - gravel aggregate used in the mixture on the Job from whiah the con - crete cylinders are taken. All of the laboratory testing and analyzing is made in the engineer - ing laboratories' at the University of Nebraska, except when certain projects have a large number of materials to be tested. In such cases a temporary laboratory is set up for that purpose near the work. </seg>

            <seg id="p718">DEPARTMENT OP PUBLIC WORKS 717 DIVISION OF ROAD EQUIPMENT. On February 28th, 1918, Congress passed an amendment to the orig - inal Federal Aid Road Bill designated Section Seven which provided for the transfer by the Secretary of War of all surplus war equipment ma - terials and supplies not needed by the War Department, but suitable for use in the improvement of highways, to the highway departments of the several states, to be used on roads constructed entirely or in part with Federal Aid Funds; such distribution to be made upon a value basis, the same as provided for by the Federal Aid Road Act. The Department, realizing the importance of such equipment in building and maintaining the roads. Immediately gave definite instruc - tions to the War Department for shipment of Nebraska's share, and at the same time organized an equipment division which should have direct control and supervision of such materials. Nebraska's first allotment was received in June, 1919. and the equip - ment division organized at that time. The Superintendent of the Divi - sion, Mr. A. W. Moffitt. is in charge and with his assistants supervises the entire work of the division, which, because it includes so many different types of work may be divided for convenience into the following heads, viz: (1) Care of road equipment. (2) Establishment and equipment of gravel camps. (3) Organization and equipment of heavy gang maintenance crews. (4) State road construction. CARE OF ROAD EQUIPMENT. The equipment division's store room, garage, and general equipment yard is located at Sixth and South Street, Lincoln, Nebr., where all sup - plies are stored, issued, and shipped. The yard, covering eleven acres. Is fenced and a spur of railroad track, used for loading, runs the full length of one side. A large "A"-frame derrick which facilitates greatly the loading of cars stands on this 1 track. Approximately twenty-five men are employed to keep the equipment in repair and see that it is in first class condition before issuing it to the counties. The mechanics prepare the state trucks and other equipment for sale, while the yard men do the general work, such as loading, ship - ping, and general maintenance of the yard. The store room in which all parts are kept is located in the garage building. Doors are locked except when storekeeper is shipping or re - ceiving supplies. As equipment parts are received they are placed in bins or on shelves, with quantity, description and location entered upon store record cards, which give detailed information of each article. A system of duplicate receiving and shipping tickets has been installed as a check upon all supplies on hand. Shipments are checked In on the re - ceiving sheets, the duplicate being kept by the storekeeper and the ortg- </seg>
            <seg id="p719">REPORT OF SECRETARY 718 inal filed in the office. The shipping tickets show the consignee, quantity, and description of the article, and just how the shipment is made. The duplicate of this form is sent to the consignee, but the original is filed. Before securing a piece of equipment, a requisition must be made to the storekeeper on a standard requisition form; the classes of re - quisitions are: (1) The shop for repair and overhaul; (2) From the yard for gas and oil; (3) From the office for state or office use. After filing a requisition, the storekeeper changes the store record card to agree with the parts sent out. By this method a perpetual invoice is kept and may be had at all times from the store record cards. During 1920 gas was bought under contract at dealers' discount and delivered in three to four hundred gallon lots, this year, however, it was bought in carload lots at a saving of several cents on the gallon and de - livered into the ten thousand gallon storage tank in the general equip - ment yard. Eight cars of lubricating oil and transmission grease were bought and delivered during the year. This was not only a great saving because of the quantity purchased but also provided a high grade oil for use on all state equipment. The oil was stored and shipped out as needed to the heavy gang maintenance crews, and to the State Camps. (See list of miscellaneous equipment, materials, and supplies at the end.) Hardware needed in the upkeep of buildings and in the equipment of any outfit is bought by the State Purchasing Agent on standard State requisition forms. Units of repair parts for Holt tractors. Quad, and Velie trucks, Hudson cars and Ford cars were received from the Govern - ment. These are also stored and are requisitioned in the following manner: (1) by the shop for repairs, (2) by the office for sale, (3) by the office for state use. Numerous new parts were bought at dealers' discount in Lincoln, while many repair parts were bought from factories. Touring Car* Some of the equipment received from the Government was in very poor condition, and it was necessary in many instances to overhaul, re - pair and provide new parts in order to property prepare them in first class mechanical shape. Approximately seventy-four touring cars were received from the Government, and are grouped as follows: f 31 Touring cars 61 Fords ■{ 13 Ambulances 17 Delivery Wagons Of this number, twenty-six are used for engineering purposes and wenty-five are used for construction. There are: 4 Hudson Touring Cars Used tor Engineers 1 White Touring Car Used for Engineers 1 Studebaker Touring Car Used for Engineers kl Studebaker Bus Used for Construction 1 Hupraobile Touring Car Used for Engineers </seg>
            <seg id="p720">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 719 Trucks. The trucks received from the Government were practically stripped of equipment, and it was necessary that they be re-equipped as complete - ly as possible from the limited supply received with them. Some difficulty was encountered in overhauling, since some of the manufacturers Had discontinued the parts, and due to the slowness of delivery of these parts which could be had. A total of four hundred seven trucks have been received from the Government to November 1st. Of this number two hundred fifty-one have been sold. The price of these trucks to the Counties varies from $350 to $950, depending upon the type of body desired. The actual mar ket value averages from $3,500 to $4,000. Fifty-three trucks were rented sixteen are being used on State work, forty-three are in the yard, ani forty-four are in such shape that it will be impossible to repair them. (See list of trucks, number, tonnage and type on page 724.) Tractors. Tractors were received from the Government, and after being over - hauled and properly equipped, were sent along with graders to various part of the State for use on State roads by the heavy gang maintenance crews. (See Organization and Equipment of the heavy gang maintenance crews.) It can be readily seen by the above summary that a large amount of equipment and machinery is handled through this division. It has been the policy) of those in charge to see that all equipment is put in first class condition before it is sent out, and during the winter months mechanics are kept busy repairing and overhauling the machinery which is stored at the garage during the season, so that work may begin as early as the season will permit. As has been stated before, some of the trucks have been sold to the Counties, as well as various small equip - ment. When a piece of machinery is rented, a per diem rate is charged, and an agreement made whereby the contractor or the renter must keep the equipment In first class mechanical shape, and in addition be re - sponsible for its proper return to the Department. Fifteen dollars per working day is charged for rented tractors; nine dollars for trucks, and three dollars for touring cars. Bach piece of machinery is stenciled with a State number, the serials starting anew for each different type of equipment. A dailv time record is kept for each man, and the time spent in improving each separate piece of machinery is noted, all labor, costs, gas and oil being charged directly to the repaired car, truck or tractor. Four tractor inspectors are employed to inspect all tractors used, and to make emergency adjustments. In addition to duties of inspection, they observe closely the general management of the machinery, and sug - gest chances which might tend towards greater efficiency. </seg>
            <seg id="p721">REPORT OK SKCRKTARY 720 Establishment and Equipment of Gravel Camps. As a usable quality of gravel for the surfacing of roads was found to be available along many of the State Roads, the Department, early in the Spring of 1919, established Gravel Camps at the following places: Wahoo, Sutherland, Grand Island and Wood River. Claying Camps were also established at St. Paul and Oslikosh. Various equipment is used on each of the projects listed above but in general the equipment for the work is the same. From eight to ten Troy trailers, with capacity of four yards each carries the gravel from the pit to the road, the motive power being furnished by tractors. The list of the equipment for the various camps is given below: WAHOO SUTHERLAND 18 Eagle Trailers 10 Troy Trailers 6 Lee Trailers 3 Holt Tractors 3 Tractors 1 Austin Grader 1 Scarifier 1 Western Blade Grader No. lo 1 Bunkhouse 1 Byers 1 Crane 1 Water Tank 1 Bunkhouse 1 Truck 1 Byers Crane, V.-yard bucket. 1 Gas Wagon WOOD RIVER GRAND ISLAND 1 Ford 2 Tractors 12 Eagle Trailers 1 Truck 8 Trucks 1 Gas Wagon 1 Dredge Pump 1 Power Pump, 6-inch Dredge 3 K.

Bunkhouses 1 Gas Wagon 2 Barber Green Loaders 1 Sand Bin 1 Austin Grader 1 Scarifier 1 Ford The bunkhouses us-vrt at Grand Island and Wood River were large knock-down type of houses, which were taken down upon finishing work at that place, and sent to the camps at St. Paul and Oshkosh. Macadam Maintenance Camp — Douglas County. On the Lincoln Highway in Douglas County at the east end of the recently completed brick pavement east of Elkhorn there was a gap of one and eight-tenths miles of old badly worn macadam road. The State Department placed an outfit on this road composed of the following: 1 Scarifier 12 Federal Trucks 1 Hoisting Engine 6 F. W. D. Trucks 1 Clam Shell Bucket t Ford Cart 1 Roller 2 Bunkhouses </seg>
            <seg id="p722">DEPAKTMKNT OF PUBLIC WOMU 721 The entire project was scarified and on the eight-tenths mile a three - inch layer of coarse rock was laid and covered with tarvia. the propor - tion being one gallon of tarvia, grade B, per square yard. A coating of chips was laid and rolled and this received another coating of tarvia, one - half gallon per square yard. This was covered with a one-half inch layer of gravel and thoroughly rolled. Owing to poor railroad transportation and an unavoidable accident at the quarries, rock could not be shipped to finish the one mile strip so this was graded with a blade grader pulled by a tractor and left throughout the winter season. The equipment for this camp was furnished from the State"s supply of war equipment. The six camps are under the control of a camp foreman, and average fifteen men in each. Forty-eight bunkhouses were built by the Depart ment. They are wooden, eight feet wide, seven feet high and twenty feet long. Each cost unequipped $411.00. They are portable and are drawn on low wheeled wagon beds, and were sent to the various gravel and clay camps also the convict labor camps maintained by the State Depart ment. Several were sent out with the heavy gang maintenance crews. For complete equipment of a bunkhouse see itemized list at the end. On Nocember 1st, seven of these houses were located at the Seward Con - vict Labor Camp, seven at Tecumseh. and six at Pawnee. Throughout the winter season the equipment of these camps will be repaired, over - hauled and stored until spring. Organization and Equipment of the Heavy Gang Maintenance Crew*. As a large part of the State Highway System was practically level, it was necessary to provide some economical means for the construction of such roads, grading them where it was not necessary to make cuts or fills. Thirty-one outfits of State equipment have been doing this work during the past season, these outfits being known as the heavy gang maintenance crews. The entire outfit is operated by three men and the equipment consists of one 120 H. P. Holt army tractor and two 12-foot blade graders and a bunkhouse sufficient in size for the men to cook, eat and sleep in. The foreman supervises the care and upkeep of the equipment orders, materials and supplies, makes report to the superin - tendent and gives information to the Tractor Inspector who is assigned to that territory. The working force consists of tractor operator, two men and blade graders, a cook and the foreman. Such crews can com - plete approximately one mile per day of ten hours work on the average road.

The reason (or this is that (or the first years the available funds (or each County, taken separately would not be sufficient to enable the undertaking of constructing projects of desirable length. Short stretches might have been built, but this would have provided disconnected stretches of improved roads. It would therefore be necessary to postpone such construction uilt.il additional funds became available in such Counties, and this in turn, would result in so large an amount of con - struction work during the last or final years of the appropriations, that it would be extremely difficult to handle, if not entirely impossible. Project Districts. The Department of Public Works shall divide the state into project districts, not exceeding five counties in any one district, in such manner as in its Judgment will best utilize the State Aid Road Fund available each year as well as the money apportioned to the State from the Federal Government under the Federal Aid Road Act of July 11, 1916. Before submitting any project statement to the Secretary of Agriculture, as provided for in the Federal Aid Road Act, the same shall have received the approval of the county board of each county within the project dis - trict. The funds available (or all of the counties in each project district shall be considered as a unit (or such district, and the work of construc - tion or improvement of roads 1 (or each district shall be begun in any part or parts of such district at the placet or places designated by the Department of Public Works. Whenever the work in any project district is completed, the amount of the funds apportioned to each county shall have been expended in the construction or improvement of roads and bridge within said county, or in the event that all of the apportionment for each county is not used in the construction or improvement of the roads utilized in the project district plans for such county, the unused funds 1 shall be used in the construction or in the improvement of such other roads within the county as the County Board and the Department of Public Works may agree upon and which receives the approval of the Secretary of Agriculture. </seg>

The past seven years the Department has grown until this year there are registered a total of 221.950 cars, including 19,000 trucks, 2,200 motorcycles, 750 trailers and 200,000 touring cars. Every owner of a motor vehicle shall apply to the County Treasurer of the County in whicn he resides for license, the fee being based upon weight and kind of vehicle. For the registration of each motor vehicle a minimum of $10.00, and 50 cents for each additional one hundred pounds in weight of such cars in excess of 2,000 pounds. The fee for trucks is based upon the weight of the truck when loaded to capacity, and in esti - mating the capacity of cars equipped for carrying more than seven pas - sengers the weight of such passenger shall be estimated at one hundred fifty pounds. Owners of touring cars converted into light delivery vehicles shall pay for the published weight of the vehicle plus minimum carrying capacity of five hundred pounds. The registration fee for a motorcycle and two-wheel truck or trailer weighing less than one thousand pounds is $5.00. Each dealer in motor vehicles shall register one motor vehicle of each class dealt in by him and the classes of cars are as follows: (1) Electrically driven motor vehicles (2) Those propelled by steam (3) Those propelled by gasoline, explosive type engine (4) Trucks or cars having a carrying capacity of more than four thousand pounds. Where a dealer deals both in cars and trucks and the truck has a carrying capacity of less than four thousand pounds he may take one dealer's license by registering weight of heaviest truck. Duplicate dealer plates will be furnished at $1.00 eacb. and these plates used for demon - strating only and are not transferable or for use on individually owned cars.

            <seg id="p746">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 745 THE SURVEY OF ROAD MATERIALS IN NEBRASKA. The survey of road materials in Nebraska consists of a detailed in - vestigation of the occurrence of suitable road building material with rela - tion to the road on which it is to be used. This investigation not only necessitates an extensive use of geologic and geographic knowledge of the state but also consideration of the economic problems involved in the production of these materials. Road materials used by the Highway Department must comply with certain specifications, must be suitably located with respect to the roads on which they are used, and must exist under conditions suitable to economic production. Sand and Gravel Most of Nebraska's 1 sand and gravel is produced from mantle rock deposits. But a small portion is derived from the bedrock formations These sources of gravel in Nebraska range in geologic time from th Pennsylvanian Beds to the Dakota Formation, the Arikaree Formation the Ogalalla Formation, an unnamed tertiary formation, glacio-fluvial de - posits, glacial drift and alluvium. Among these the most important are the alluvium of the Platte River, the Aftonian Sand Plain and grave bodies occurring at the base of the Dakota Formation. Pennsylvanian Formation. The Pennsylvanian Beds outcrop in the southeastern counties of the state. Sand is found only in a few strata such as those outcroppings at Peru and south of Falls City. Here the sand is too fine to be of value as a road material. Dakota Formation. The Dakota Formation consists mainly of a buff to a rusty brown sand stone heavily stained with iron. At the base of the formation lying unconformably on the Pennsylvanian rocks are lenticular beds of sand and fine gravel. The sand is too fine for construction work but the gravel is very good for road surfacing. These deposits occure quite ex - tensively in the vicinity of Louisville. The gravel ranges from 10 to 20 feet in thickness and contains a great many clay balls, large boulders and often a small body of fire clay. There is also in this same vicinity a buried gravel body which is glacio-fluvial or a stream deposit of creta ceous time. The deposit extends in a generally southeasterly direction from Cedar Creek to south of Richfield and Ik about 10 miles in length Sand is produced from this at several places. Arikaree Formation. The Arikaree Formation outcrops over a large area in northwestern Nebraska. The sands are grayish and generally of fine texture. In a few places it contains deposits of coarse gravel suitable for construction work. </seg>
            <seg id="p747">746 REPORT OF SECRETARY Ogallala Formation. This formation Is tbe bedrock in a large portion of the southwestern counties of Nebraska. It outcrops along the Republican River from be - low Franklin westward to the state line, and in the Lodgepole and North Platte Valleys. It contains a vast amount of sand and gravel some of which occurs as a friable sand stone conglomerate. The particles are made up of rounded grains of material loosely cemented by a calcareous cement. Sand of the Late Tertiary Age. Beneath the loess of much of central Nebraska and extending east - ward under the western edge of glacial deposits is an unnamed tertiary formation which carries vast quantities of sand lnterstratifled with layers of clay and silt. This formation forms nearly a continuous sand plain from 25 to 100 feet tbick. outcropping along the Missouri River in northeastern Nebraska as in Knox and Cedar Counties and in the valleys along; the Republican River in the southwestern counties. The extent of this sand plain is not known nor what its geologic relation to the drift sheet may be. Much of the sand is too fine for use but a portion of it may be utilized as a surfacing material for roads. It is too dirty for concrete work, containing not only clay and silt but also an iron cement. The Glacio-Fluvial or Aftonian Sand Plain. This plain lies between the Nebraska and Kansas drift sheets and has a thickness of from 10 to 70 feet. The sand varies from dirty to clean and from fine sand to coarse gravel. It contains boulders, cobbles and large clay balls which were undoubtedly carried to their present positions from the north, by streams, during the glacial time. Just what caused these streams to drop their heavy load in eastern and central Nebraska is not known. This sand plain extends through much of the upland of the loess hill and drift areas of Nebraska and is reported also in southwestern Iowa, northwestern Missouri and northeastern Kansas. Sand is produced commercially from this source at Falrbury, DeWitt, Ulysses and Wahoo and operation will soon be started by the state at Superior, Nelson and Hebron from the same horizon. As a surfacing material this gravel is the best in the stale. It is of suitable size and quality and has a good binder of clay and Iron oxide. When this gravel is laid upon a road and subjected to the impact of traflfc It forms a sur - face which is extremely hard and durable in either wet or dry weather. There will undoubtedly be a great many miles of road surfaced with gravel from this source in the future. Glacial Drift. The drift of the Kansas sheet covers approximately the tier of the eastern four counties of Nebraska. It is evidenced on the surface by large four counties of Nebraska. It is evidenced on the surface by large boulders of many kinds of material, by rounded pebbles in the soil or by a heavy red clay. The deposits 1 occur in pockets which contain material </seg>
            <seg id="p748">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKS 747 grading from extremely fine sand to large boulders. At the base of these deposits the material Is usually clean but is badly stained with Iron. making it a poor aggregate. Either for construction work or surfacing material drift sands are poor at best, and the supply is so limited that at the present time it seems Inadvisable to utilize it. Dune Sand Dune Sand is the prevailing surface formation of the well-known sand hill region. It is too fine (or any road use and offers a serious problem to road construction wherever it exists. Alluvium. The alluvial deposits of sand and gravel in the state are by far the mcst important source of road material. These deposits occur in the valleys of the Platte, Loup, Elkhorn. Blue, Republican and Missouri rivers. The alluvium of the Platte is very coarse in the western part of the state, becoming finer toward the east, due of course to the action of the water upon the material. That of the Loup and Elkhorn rivers Is almost too fine for road use. The Big and Little Blue carry material derived from the Aftonian Sand Plain, tertiary sand and glacial drift Much of the sand is used commercially. The alluvium of the Republican Valley varies a great deal in size and quality depending upon the region. That of the Missouri grades from very line sand to clay and is seldom used. In the alluvium of the Platte Nebraska has an unlimited source of rotid material. This alluvium ranges from 25 to 100 feet in thickness and extends the full width of the Platte Valley througout its course. It grades from fine sand to coarse gravel and is very hard and durable. Detailed Description of State Owned Gravel Pits. Grand Island: The state pit at Grand Island is located by contract at the west end of Koehler Lake. This lake is located in an old channel of the Platte River about 150 yards wide and extending from Central City to a point about 10 miles west of Grand Island. The material in this channel is a great deal coarser than that in the present channel, about 40 per cent of the sand being retained on a No. 10 screen. The chief drawback to production in this channel is the large number of clay balls encountered. There is also a thin stratum of clay at about 17 feet below the surface, which occurs intermittently along the channel. The state is producing from the west end of the lake where a slightly better grade of gravel occurs than in any other portion. All the fine sand screened from the gravel by the owners of the pit for many years' has been sluiced back Into the lake at the east end making production there inadvisable. Fifty thoutmnd yards of gravel was contracted (or at the rate of 13 cents per cubic yard. The state was to produce the gravel from any </seg>
            <seg id="p749">748 REPORT OF SECRETARY part of the lake. This gravel is being used to surface a portion of the Grand Island-Si. Paul and Grand Island-Wood River Federal Aid Roads. Wood River: The Platte Valley in the vicinity of Wood River is ap - proximately 12 miles wide. The river itself is divided into four channels. This is evidence of the fact that the velocity of the Platte River at this point is much slower than in places where the valley is narrower or the river has not meandered to such an extent. Tne velocity of the river being slower, finer material has been deposited there than in other places. Because of thebe facts it was impossible to locate in the immediate vicinity of Wood Kiver a gravel pit which would produce gravel of suitable size. Therefore the state secured a camp site on the river and are pumping from the main channel at the present time. The river itself is carrying 2j per cent coarser material than is deposited any place in the valley. Approximately 6,000 yards of gravel has been produced to date which is used for the surfacing of the Lincoln Highway from the county line west of Wood River to a point six miles north on this road. Asiiiand: The gravel land at Ashland purchased by the state in May, 1920 is located in Sections 30 and 31 of Township 13 North, Range 10 East, Saunders County. It is on the main line of the ('., B. &amp; Q. railroad between Lincoln and Omaha. There are a great many reasons which enter into the fact that Platte Valley land in the vicinity of Ashland is almost ideal for gravel produc - tion. The Platte valley is but 1% miles in width at this point so the river hag neither had a chance to change its coarse appreciably nor has it lost any of its velocity. There are no tributary streams flowing into the Platte which might carry finer material immediately above this location and the river has not meandered enough to appreciably change the alluvium, as originally deposited, below a depth of about ten feet. There are 62.8 acres of deed land in the tract purchased. With this the state received title to 34 acres of accretion land. The tract has 2,100 feet of frontage on the river and 2,300 feet of trackage on the main line of the C, B. &amp; Q. It is possible to produce from this' land approximately »00.000 cubic yards of gravel and the supply from the river is unlimited. The land is protected on the south from overflow by the grade of the C, B. &amp; Q. railroad and on the east along the river front by a dike thrown up by the railroad company which facts are indeed an advantage. The gravel on this tract, when analyzed, tested from 40 to 46 per cent retained on a No. 10 screen with the exception of a small area of about 27 acres which has about 15 feet of fine sand deposited on the surface. The state is indeed fortunate to procure such a gravel site close to Lincoln for the production of sand and gravel for the new capitol building and any general road work. Wahoo: The pit (rom which the state procured gravel at Wahoo tor the Cornhus-ker Highway from Swedeburg to Colon ii located in blocks </seg>

Gravel is pro - duced here from a buried gravel body, of which there are three in Saunders County extending in a generally northwesterly and south - easterly direction. These deposits may be traced across the county easily by outcrops such as at Wahoo, Ithaca, northeast of Ceresco and southwest of Swedeburg. These locations are the chief ones in the county from which gravel can be economically produced but on account of their location quite a distance from railroad or the Cornhusker High - way none are accessible except that at Wahoo. The gravel in the Wahoo pit is like the material of the Aftonian sand plain in general characteristics, except that there is present more binder than is usually the case. The gravel does not need to be mixed with clay to make a perfect road surface. The state has produced from this pit approximately 20.000 yards of gravel. Future production will necessitate the removal of heavy over - burden or the dredging of the gravel below the water level. COMPLETED GRAVEL ROAD.

            <seg id="p751">750 Proposed State Gravel Pitt. Nelson: On the Little Blue River north of Nelson are situated sev - eral outcrops of glacio-fluvlal gravel. The river has cut into this sand plain in a great many places throughout its course. There are within this vicinity several thousand yards of usable gravel. The over-burden varies from 0 to 15 feet, depending upon the topography. The stratum of sand is a great deal thinner than is the case in the northern counties where the sand plain outcrops. A vertical section is as follows: An average two feet of overburden; 2 to 15 feet, sand and fine gravel; 15 to 22 feet fine sand. In this plain about 65 to 72 per cent of the material is retained on a No. 10 screen. It is much cleaner than that in the sand plain in the northern counties, is more constant in size and occurrence and contains fewer clay halls. Fairbury: Gravel for the Federal Aid Roads in the vicinity of Fair - bury will be procured from several burried gravel bodies or gravel trains. KA great deal of sand and gravel has been produced here in the past the railroads and private concerns. However, there is a vast amount material, that is as yet untouched. It is all fairly clean, approximately per cent being retained on a No. 10 screen. The gravel land provisionally located here will produce approximate - ly 40,000 yards. Superior: Sand and gravel has been produced at Superior for many years from the sand plain in the uplands. The plain is about 75 feet thick and contains gravel of good size and quality. About 60 per cent is retained on a No. 10 screen. LThe state will produce here about 12.000 yards for use on the tolls County Federal Aid roads. E Norfolk: The most likely source of production in the vicinity of oik is the Aftonian Sand Plain. This :--and plain outcrops in the up - s along the valley of the Elkhorn river. The material like most of occurring in this sand plain is fairly clean and of suitable size. It be worked to a depth of approximately 45 feet, depending directly i the region. There are in this area many small pockets of glacial gravel. These are all too small in extent to consider as- a possible source of production. Sidney: In the Lodgepole and North Platte Valleys are a large number of sites suitable for bank pits. The gravel occurs in alluvial fans, sand draws, and the erroded and weathered surface of the Ogalalla formation which is exposed in much of the slope land. The location at Sidney will produce gravel of good quality for surfacing and is well situ - ated with respect to the Lincoln Highway and tributary roads. Valley: At Valley a great deal of sand for commercial use hai already been produced. Dredftaf has taken place to depths raining </seg>
            <seg id="p752">DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC WORKb 751 from 40 to 60 feet. The sand is finer than in most places along the Platte Valley. There are several locations here that will produce sand for use on the Lincoln Highway. The land has very little over-burden and is favor - ably situated with respect to removal for shipping or hauling. Survey Methods. The survey of road materials in Nebraska has been conducted for several years by the State Conservation and Soil Survey. However, when the Federal Aid program was enacted a more detailed survey of certain areas became necessary. The most important road materials surveyed are deposits of sand, gravel, clay and stone suitable for road construction. For the benefit of county officials and others interested in general road work a few general statements will be made regarding methods used. The problem of testing sand deposits is divided into two distinct phases, first that of testing alluvial deposits, and second that of testing bank deposits. These will be treated separately as follows: Alluvial Sand Testing. The economic side of the production of gravel enters so thoroughly into the situation that the quality of gravel pfesible to produce is often neces - sarily disregarded because of economic features. A site must be chosen not only with regard to the possibility of producing gravel of good quality, but also with regard to the distance to the road upon which, It is to be used, with regard to shipping facilities, and the purchase price of the land. Having decided upon a plot of land which is suitably located the de - tailed examination of that particular deposit is made. All alluvial gravel lies either practically at or below the water line, therefore it is necessary to procure such equipment as will work under these conditions. A caseing four or six inches in diameter is sunk and the sand is removed from within this casing by either a sand bucket, a sand pump or a trap auger. The pump is oftentimes mechanically in - efficient, and the sand bucket gives a false impression as to the exact deposition of the sand. The trap auger is the most certain and effective tool for this work. It removes the gravel exactly as It occurs in the ground, taking out the fine and coarse materials in their exact relation - ship. It is much slower than either of the methods mentioned above bat one may be certain of the results obtained. After several test holes have been put down evenly distributed over the plot of ground and samples have been obtained at different depths in these holes, the results are averaged and the quality of gravel possible to produce from the certain plot of ground determined. Next quantities of material present must be figured. An easy way of doing this in the field is to figure the area of usable ground in square </seg>
            <seg id="p753">752 REPORT OF SECRETARY yards, multiply this by the depth to which the "gravel" may be worked and divide this quantity by four. This will give approximately the number of yards of gravel in a given area on the Platte River. It then becomes necessary to map the ground as to the best possible locations for trackage, driveways, buildings and the pits so as to give the largest areas possible to gravel production. Classify the ground then as to the number of trees or stumps to be pulled, the amount of stripping to be done and the nature of the material to be stripped, and evaluate the land to be purchased. Bank Pitt. The location of a dry land pit is much more complicated and uncer - tain as to results than is that of the alluvial pit. The material in these bank pits is derived from the sand plains, from two unnamed tertiary de - posits and glacial pockets and because of the manner of their deposition great care must be taken in their survey. These deposits are not con - istent as to thickness, quantity, quality or geologic relation to other formations, making deductions very uncertain. If seeking to locate a pit in an area where only bank pits will be possible, trace up the drainage ways of the vicinity looking for a stream or intermittent drainage which carry gravel. If such a stream is found follow this until the gravel body is located. Then determine the eleva - tion of this layer of gravel and it by the use of a level and surface indications until a suitable location for production is found. Proceed by putting down test holes and by the methods stated previously, determine the exact quantities of gravel present, map the ground for buildings and trackage and compute the costs. Clay. Clay as treated here is used as a surfacing material on sandy roads and as a binding material on sand-clay and gravel-clay roads. In most places in the state where gravel roads' are constructed the road soil has sufficient cementing quality to bind the gravel together into a hurd wear - ing surface, but in some vicinities this is not true. When such conditions exist a deposit of clay must be found and the clay removed and hauled onto the road to be mixed with the gravel in the proper proportions. Usually sufficient clay may be found at a shallow depth in the sub-soil beside the road. Occasionally, however, it is necessary to haul it for several miles. Clay is also used in the sandhill regions as a surfacing material where it not only binds together the fine particles of sand but also forms a hard crust-like surface that will stand the wear of the traffic. Clay pits have been located for these two kinds of work as follows: Grand Island: The Grand Island-Wood River Federal Aid road is located in the Platte Valley and in a distance of 17 miles crosses 13 dis - tinct soil types, only one of which contains sufficient clay to serve as a binding material for a gravel road. This type is the Hall silt loam. </seg>
            <seg id="p754">IIKI'AKTMKNT OF PUBLIC WORKS 753 The Hall silt loam is uniformly a dark brown friable soil high in organic matter, to a depth of 8 to 12 inches underlain by 6 to 24 inches of stiff plastic clay. This soil is found in isolated areas, in the ditches along the course of this road and is being used as a binder for the gravel. Wherever the Hall silt loam occurs as mapped on the Soil Surrey maps it may be regarded as a suitable binder for road surfacing. Dublin: The Grand Island-St. Paul road from St. Libory to St. Paul crosses several soils such as Dune sand and Valentine sand. Wherever these occur it is necessary to use some sort of a binder or surface material. The only immediate source in this sandhill region is at Dublin. This deposit is not a clay but is a silt that was laid down in the bottom of some small sandhill lake. It varies from 1 to 4 feet in thickness and has Dune sand above and below. The silt has a high sand content but has very good binding qualities for this type of material. A very ex - tensive supply may be obtained with but little stripping. It is- exposed in an open cut along the right of way of the Union Pacific railroad for a distance of about three-eighths of a mile. St. Paul: At St. Paul binding material is found in either of two areas. The first of these in the vicinity of the County Fair Grounds is Hall fine sandy loam which has a subsoil of tough plastic clay about 14 inches thick. The second, just west of St. Paul, is Hall silt loam which has a heavy clay subsoil. These are the only two areas which may pro - duce usable material in the vicinity. Wahoo: The soil types which the Cornhusker Highway in Saundera County crosses are principally the Waukeshaw silt loam, the Scott silt loam and the Marshall silt loam. These soils possess excellent binding qualities and makes a very good road surface when mixed with gravel. In contrast of the condition of the road soils in this loess hill area to the condition of the road soils in the sandhill area and conditions exist - ing where any road is constructed across valley soils, these heavy soils in Saunders County when mixed with gravel form a perfect road surface. The gravel in the construction of these Saunders County roads is merely hauled onto the road and spread out evenly, allowing the impact of traffic to work the gravel into the subsoil. Wherever such conditions exist, gravel roads may be built and maintained successfully with a small cost. Survey Methods. The problems involved in the location of suitable deposits of clay for either binding or surfacing material are fewer than those of a loca - tion of gravel deposits because of the fact that most of the counties of the state have been thoroughly surveyed with respect to the soils exist - ing. This work has been done by the V. S. Bureau of Soils and the Nebraska Conservation and Soil Survey. </seg>
            <seg id="p755">754 When seeking a suitable deposit of clay tbe soil surrey maps are consulted and tbe location for clay made with respect to the road on which the material is to be used. However, due to the many grades and kinds of heavy soils which may be used an important problem is that of determining the proportion of clay to be used with the gravel at hand. Methods used in the determination of these proportions are stated below. A sand clay or gravel clay road is constructed most effectively when the sand and clay are mixed in proper proportions. These proportions are not purely arbitrary but are determined by definite tests of the ma - terial to be used. A gravel road may be constructed but it will only serve the public in the best possible manner when these chief constituents are properly mixed. This is not to state that a road cannot be built that is passable and usable by merely dumping the sand and clay upon the road and spreading It out. But it does state that this road is far from perfect until these materials have been thoroughly mixed in the proportions that the particular size of gravel and the particular clay used work best to - gether. These proportions are determined in the field by tests known as the slacking and flouring tests. A sample of the clay to be used is dried and sieved through a 100 mesh sieve. This clay is then mixed with the gravel in many different proportions, a little water added and the mixture molded into briquettes and allowed to dry. These briquettes are then given the slacking and flouring tests and the best proportion used on the road. For Pl;&gt;t'p River gravel and soil of the loess hills region the best proportioned will be about 40 per cent clay and 60 per cent gravel. How - ever, these will vary to as much as a 70 per cent clay content depending upon the percentage of voids of the sand or gravel. Stone. In the fall of 1919 considerable work was done on tbe location of a stone quarry for the state. Many stone ledges outcropping at various places in southeistrrn Nebraska were examined and these facts together with those already gathered by the Conservation and Soil Survey De - partment were tabulated. A site was chosen and estimates on the cost of production made. However, this site has not been purchased as yet. This paper was prepared to give the scope of the activities of the co-operative work of the Department of Public Works and the Conserva - tion and Soil Survey Division of the University during the biennium </seg>
