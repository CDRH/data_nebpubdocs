            <seg id="p004">SUMMARY. 1. In figuring farm profits, the farm must be placed upon the same basis as any other business. 2. The 80-acre grain and stock farm of eastern Nebraska does not utilize man, horse, or machine labor as efficiently as do farms of a larger size. 3. The family farm which provides work for approximately two men or the equivalent, seems to be the most profitable. On the farms surveyed, approximately half of the work, aside from that done by the operator, was performed by boys under 21. 4. The best paying farms found in this survey had crop yields from 15 to 30 per cent better than the average of all farms, while of the farms whose yields were as much as 15 per cent below the average of their community, few gave satisfactory returns. 5. The most profitable farms included in this survey sold two or three major products and from two to four minor pro - ducts. Those selling but one or two products were not profitable as they did not furnish productive labor for a large enough part of the year. 6. If 5 per cent interest is allowed upon all capital invested by the operator, owned farms returned an average labor income of $203 and tenant farms an average of $806 to the operator. 7. The better showing made by the tenant farms is largely accounted for by the fact that they returned to the landlord only 3.5 per cent interest upon the land valuation, while the owner-operator is charged 5 per cent upon his valuation. The low rate of return is due primarily to the security of the invest - ment. 8. Owned farms in Richardson county contributed $509, and tenant farms $405 toward the farmers' living, in addition to the "labor income". This is somewhat above the average of farms covered by the survey. 9. Placed upon the same basis as the city wage earner, with interest upon land figured at the landlord's rate of return, the average fanner of eastern Nebraska receives between $1,000 and $1,200 per year for his labor and management. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">FARM MANAGEMENT STUDIES IN EASTERN NEBRASKA H. C. FlLLEY. Within the last few years the impression has become general, particularly among business and professional men, that the farmer is making a great deal of money, and that he is enjoying more than his share of the prosperity of the country. Probably the most potent cause for this opinion has been the rise in the cost of living. The consumer unquestionably pays much more for nearly all agricultural products than he did in the middle nineties, and the farmer is receiving more for his products now than he did during the depression which followed the panic of 1893. The decade from 1890 to 1899 is probably the poorest time that can be selected as a b'asis with which to compare present prices, because conditions were not normal during the greater part of the period. The ease with which the level prairies of the middle West could be broken up and prepared for cultivation, the invention of many labor-saving farm machines, the use of which more than doubled a man's productive capacity, the free homestead act, and the large number of immigrants from north - ern Europe who were even more anxious than the Americans to accept the gift of a farm from a generous Government — all these causes united in bringing about the greatest over-production of agricultural products that the world has ever known. In the midst of this over-production came the panic of 1893, followed by a greatly lessened consumption during the ensuing financial depression. Dire necessity and not cost of production fixed the price for agricultural products. The farmer was too absorbed in providing the necessaries of life to consider cost of production, interest on investment, or labor income. In discussing the trend of prices in recent years, the consumer has sometimes neglected to ascertain how large a part of the increased price which he pays ever finds its way to the pockets of the agricultural producer. The farmer pays a higher price for labor and practically all other commodities which he purchases, than was the standard of twenty years ago. Before reaching any definite conclusion regarding farm profits all these factors must be considered. 5 </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 157. The rapid rise in land values during the last fifteen years has strengthened the impression regarding the large volume of the fanner's profits. It is certainly true that the owner of land is worth more today than twenty years ago, and because of that we say that he has prospered. The rise in value has neither decreased his cost of production nor increased the productivity of his land. We must remember that the word "farmer" is not a synonym for "farm owner" as about 40 per cent of the farms in Nebraska are operated by tenants. The rise in the value of farm products has been accompanied by an almost automatic increase in the rent obtained from land. As rents have increased, lands have risen in value, and the man who would buy to avoid paying rent finds that he must invest a much larger sum than was formerly necessary. Increased land values apparently mean increased prosperity for those who sell or rent their lands, but require larger outlays for buyers of land or for tenants. If rent, or interest on capital invested in land, is considered a part of the cost of producing crops, then a rise in land values increases cost of production for the farmer, whether he is a tenant or an owner. In order to find out whether the farmers as a whole are making a profit on their business, we must judge them not by comparing the crop prices and land values of today with the prices of twenty years ago but by using the same standards that are used in judging the prosperity of any other business. In other words, what interest does the farmer receive on the capital which he has invested in land and equipment, and what wages does the Tdrm pay for the labor of the farmer and his family? In practically all communities we find some diversity in types of farming, in methods of work, in management employed, and in the prosperity of the farmers themselves. Some men accumu - late rapidly while near neighbors who apparently work just as hard fail to get ahead. This difference cannot be attributed entirely to soil, climate, or chance; a part of it must be due to the efficiency of the fanner, to his skill in combining the three essentials of production, — land, labor, and capital. All the great business organizations of today are planned with this matter of efficiency uppermost in mind. Many of them have been studied by efficiency experts and organized so that labor and equipment are so well utilized that the greatest economy of production is brought about. In order to produce most economically it becomes necessary to know first what the capa - city of a business is, and then keep it running to its full capacity, if possible. If a flour mill, for example, with a capacity of 100 barrels a day, is made to produce an average of only 40 barrels a </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Farm Management Studies in Eastern Nebraska. 7 day, a loss results because the labor and capital are not being used to the best advantage. The mill owner, other things being equal, cannot manufacture flour as cheaply or compete success - fully with the mill owner who utilizes the full capacity of his plant. Exactly the same principle holds true in farming. If labor and equipment are not made to serve to their full capacity thru - out the year, the output of the farm will be greatly lowered and the profits correspondingly decreased. Every fanner should study his business with the idea of determining its capacity, and it should then be his purpose to keep that business running to the capacity which earns the largest net profits. The best method of making an accurate study of the farm practices and business principles adapted to any given community is by a farm management survey. By visiting a large number of farms, and learning how the more successful ones differ from the less successful, we are able to determine the controlling factors of efficient management in that locality. In general, the results of this survey verify the results of surveys made in other states. The principles of farm manage - ment which should govern farm practice in that part of Nebraska which lies in the corn belt are very evidently the same as have been found applicable in states farther east. We may infer that, while type of farming will vary with markets and natural factors, the fundamental principles of good farm management are widely applicable. AREAS STUDIED. The results given in this bulletin are nearly all from four areas surveyed in eastern Nebraska in the counties of Madison, Platte, Merrick, and Richardson. They represent fairly well the conditions for that part of the state which lies in the corn belt. Some data are also presented from a survey taken in Fillmore county for the crop year 1913, when the corn crop was an almost total failure. This shows subnormal conditions. A very few tables are presented which contain data from four hundred farms for 1914, a year of average yields and of unusually high prices. The Platte County records are for 1911; Merrick County, 1912; Madison County, 1913; and Richardson County, 1914. While the Madison county records are doubtless slightly below normal, the Richardson County records are probably enough above normal to offset any lowering of the average. Altho the soils of the areas studied are&gt; not uniform, there is apparently little variation in their average fertility, compared </seg>

All the areas lie east of the 27-inch rainfall line, and in normal seasons have ample moisture for ordinary crop production. Areas studied. METHOD OF STUDY. The farms in the different areas were visited personally, and the results obtained direct from the operator. The majority of the farmers kept only meagre accounts; but practically all had very definite recollection of the products sold, the price received, and the expenses paid. On practically all Nebraska farms, grain and live stock are sold in large quantities and but few sales made during the year. It is a simple matter to check the sales of wheat with the wheat produced, and to obtain the local price of wheat for each week of the year. The farmer cannot miss either the quantity sold or price received by any considerable amount without the error showing in the record. The majority of men know the exact number of bushels threshed, the amount saved for seed, the amount sold and the exact price received per bushel. Other grains and live stock are checked in a similar way. The expense account may seem at first thought to admit of considerable error, but it must be remembered that household and personal expense does not enter into the survey. These are the expenses that one would forget and have difficulty in estimat - ing. All ordinary items of farm expense are listed on the field blank. Such items as threshing readily check with the amount of grain produced. The amounts paid for labor, feed, seeds, twine, taxes, insurance, and other similar expenses are usually remembered. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Farm Management Studies in Eastern Nebraska. 9 Data from each area surveyed were tabulated separately and the results found to be in general accord with the results obtained when all areas are tabulated together. Because of this it has seemed unnecessary to present tables for the individual areas. This does not imply that the areas are the same in all respects. In Richardson County, for example, because of a slight difference in rainfall, soil, contour, and other natural factors, we find more fruit than in the other areas. According to the 1910 census, there are more than twice as many farms of less than 50 acres in Richardson County as in any of the other counties mentioned in this bulletin. These small farms are quite largely fruit and truck farms. Since the survey in that County includes only one farm of less than 50 acres and none which sold any considerable amount of fruit, this slight difference does not affect any of the conclusions reached. DEFINITIONS. A few farm management terms have come into general use only among students of this subject, and some common words which have a variety of meanings are here used in a particular sense. The following definitions must be thoroly understood before this report can be read intelligently: Farm Capital. — The farm capital is the total value (at the beginning of the year) of all real estate, machinery, live stock, feed and supplies, and cash necessary to carry on the farm business. It includes the value of the farmhouse but not the household furnishings. Money owed by the farmer is not subtracted, and property owned by him outside of that used in the farm business is not added. Gross Income. — The gross income of the farm is the sum of all farm receipts including produce paid for "in trade." It includes nothing from outside the farm such as interest on bank stock or money loaned. In a few instances where the meaning is plainly shown by the context it is referred to simply as the "income." Net Income or Farm Income. — The net income or farm income is the difference between the gross income and the farm expenses. Expenses. — The farm expenses include all business expenses of operating the farm. Depreciation on buildings and machinery, and any decrease in feed inventory are included in the expenses. The cost of the board furnished hired labor is considered a part of the expense of the labor. Unpaid family labor used in any of the farm operations is also considered as an expense. House - hold and personal expenses are not included. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 157. Labor Income. — The business man of the city usually considers his own salary as a part of the expense of doing business, and his net income as his profit. This method is necessarily followed by corporations where everyone who works for the company receives a salary, and many of the stockholders do no part of the work. The business man of the farm does not pay himself a fixed salary, and his net income includes both his wages and the interest on his investment. In dividing the net income of the farm between wages and capital, we can either allow the farmer a fixed wage and consider the remainder as profit on the capital, or set a definite interest rate for the wages of capital, and consider the remainder as the labor income or profit of the farmer. For many reasons the latter method is better. In this bulletin, interest is figured at 5 per cent except where otherwise stated. In addition to the labor income, the operator received a house in which to live, and whatever fruit, vegetables, milk, butter, eggs, meat, and fuel that the farm furnished toward the family living. 1 Farm Owner. — The man who operates his own farm is called the farm owner. Part Owner. — The part owner is a farm owner who rents additional land. Landlord. — The landlord is the owner of land farmed by a tenant. Tenant. — The tenant is the person who operates rented land. Animal Unit. — An animal unit is one full-grown horse or cow, or an amount of other live stock requiring the feed of a horse or cow, as: 2 colts, 2 calves, 5 hogs, 10 pigs, 7 sheep, or 100 chickens. Altho the feed given various classes of live stock varies widely on different farms, the above rough approximation suffices for the purpose for which it is here used. On the average Nebraska farm, a work horse receives more feed than a cow, while on the intensive dairy farm, a cow is apt to receive more feed than a horse. Productive Animal Unit. — A productive animal unit increases the revenue of the farm either by its own growth ; by producing young; or by some livestock product. Colts, calves, hogs, chickens, and milch cows are productive animal units, but work horses are not. SIZE OF BUSINESS. In comparing farms upon the basis of the size of the farm business, several different units offmeasure may be used, among which the most common are: total farm area, crop acres, total 'Table 19 gives an example of the method employed in figuring labor incomi </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Farm Management Studies in Eastern Nebraska. 11 capital, and gross income. Whichever measurement is applied the same general results hold true of the farms included in this survey. In a majority of the tables upon size of business, the farms are grouped in classes according to the area in acres. This is satisfactory since nearly all farms are of the same general type, — mixed stock and grain farms. No data has been collected from farms where the sale of fruit and garden truck provides any con - siderable part of the farm income. Since a truck farm of 20 acres may provide as much opportunity for income-producing labor as a stock and grain farm of 200 acres, it would be manifestly unfair to base any comparison of the size of the business of these two types of farming upon the comparative area in acres. No data are presented in this bulletin from which inferences can be drawn either directly or indirectly concerning the area or profit of the truck farm. Table 1. — Relation Between Farm Area and Labor Income in Neither the small nor the very large farm gave as good returns as those of intermediate size, the farms of from 201 to 250 acres averaging considerably better than any other group. The group of farms of from 40 to 100 acres, nearly all of which are 80-acre farms, returned a labor income of about one-third the wages paid a married farm hand where a house and other perquisites are furnished. The farm doubtless furnishes a better home and contributes more toward the family living than the hired man receives, yet the income seems to be a poor return for the labor expended. WHY THE 80-ACRE FARM SELDOM PAYS ADEQUATE RETURNS. A comparison of the organization of the small farm with those of larger areas shows wherein it is inefficient. Eastern N tel braska.

A study of capital distribution by per cents furnishes a more accurate basis for comparison than does the preceding table. Table 3. — Relation Between Size of Farm and Distribution of Capital (by per cent The per cent of investment in land increases with size of farm but the per cent of investment in house and buildings decreases. The per cent of capital invested in live stock is largest on the small farms, but if we except work horses, it is smallest on the small farms.

Table 4. — Relation Between Size of Farm and Efficiency of Horse Labor. The horse which cares for only 17 crop acres costs the owner almost as much each year as the horse that cares for 30 crop acres. Interest on investment, depreciation, taxes, and cost of shelter are not affected by the number of days which the horse works each year. Care and feed ordinarily vary with the amount of work done, but even the idle horse must have some care and a maintenance ration. Altho the cost of machine labor is much less than the cost of horse labor, it is an item that must be considered. Interest and other costs continue night and day whether the machine works or stands in the shed. Table 5. — Relation Between Size of Farm and Efficiency of Machinery.

After we reach farms of 150 acres there is jess difference in machine cost per acre because duplication begins. The larger farms also often have machines, such as a corn binder and ensilage cutter, which the small farmer cannot afford. Man labor is ordinarily more expensive than horse or machine labor. If man labor is being employed efficiently, a farm will ordinarily show a good labor income. If a man uses two-horse machinery when his neighbor uses four-horse, and if his system of farming fails to provide regular productive labor thruout the year, he can hardly expect to have a large net profit. Table 6 illustrates the handicap under which the man works who farms 80 acres of Nebraska land. TABLE 6. — Relation Between Size of Farm and Efficiency of Man The man on the small farm cares for fewer acres of crops, and also cares for fewer head of live stock than the man on a larger farm. His labor is utilized less efficiently. There is a great deal of farm work, haying, for example, where one man works at a disadvantage. On the size of farm that gave the best labor income, 201 to 250 acres, two men are employed practically all of the time. They are able to use their own labor and to utilize horse and machine labor about as well as the men who farm a larger area. CROP YIELDS AND DIVERSITY It has been popularly supposed that crop yields are better on small than on large farms as a result of more intensive tillage. Yields upon the farms covered by this survey do not bear out the theory of high yields on the small farms due to better tillage. Yield seems to be almost independent of size of farm, the groups of large farms showing up slightly better than the smaller farms. Labor.

'The crop index expresses on a percentage basis the crop yields of an individual (arm com - pared with the average yields of the farms surveyed. All crops and their proportionate areas are considered. The method commonly employed in finding the crop index of a given farm is to divide the quantity of each field crop produced on the farm by the average yield of that crop per acre on all the farms. The quotients obtained from these divisions are added and their sum divided by rh«&gt; field area of the farm. The following example illustrates the method Assume that in the survey area, the average yields per acre are found to be as follows: Corn, bushels: wheat. 24 bushels: oats, 35 bushels: and alfalfa, 2 tons. A's farm for which the crop index is desired has the following acreage and production of these leading crops. Dividing 146, the average number of acres required in this region to produce A's crop, by the number of acres required by A, gives 97.3. the crop index. ■The diversity index is a figure which expresses the number of different farm enterprises in terms of enterprises of equal size. It is determined as follows: The total receipts are divided by the total number of enterprises or sources of income. Kach enterprise which contributes more to the gross income than the average of all is counted as 1. All that contribute less than the average are added and divided by the average. This quotient is then added to those major enter - prises which are counted as one each.

The man who farms a quarter section or over usually sells a greater variety of products than the man who farms only 80 acres. His labor is utilized efficiently because it is distributed thruout the year. The farms of from 201 to 250 acres have the greatest diversity of products as well as the best labor income. Most of them marketed two or three major products and about the same number of minor products. CAPITAL. One of the standards most commonly used in measuring the size of a business is the amount of capital invested. This stand - ard is quite as applicable to the farm as to the city business. The average capital of the 195 farms surveyed was $26,646. Only 10 farms had a capital of less than $10,000, while 40 farms had a capital of more than $35,000. As the farms increased in size, the capitalization per acre increased, being considerably higher on the large than on the small farms. This is shown in Table 8. Table 8. — Relation Between Capital and Farm Area. Average Average Average Capital per farm Number capital area per farm capitalizatic of farms per farm in acres per ac When the farms divided upon the basis of capitalization are compared with the labor income, practically the same relation - ship is found to exist as when they are divided upon area in acres.

After paying expenses and allowing 5 per cent interest upon the investment these men had a labor income of but $214. In order to make a good labor income upon a farm of this size, the receipts must be increased. As the capital - ization increased, the gross receipts increased faster than the expenses. This resulted in the farmer receiving a larger farm income and, until $35,000 capital was reached, a larger labor income. These figures do not look encouraging to the man with small capital who would buy land. They indicate that he should either rent land or engage in a type of farming requiring a smaller land area than grain and stock farms of the corn belt. INFLUENCE OF CROP YIELDS UPON FARM PROFITS. The effect which the general failure of any important crop has upon the prosperity of a community is so striking that it is always noticed. Records taken where the 1913 corn crop failed show that two-thirds of the farms whose crop index fell below 85 were operated at a loss, and only 3 per cent showed more than $500 profit. The farms where the acreage of corn was small and crop index consequently higher nearly all showed a profit. The man whose crop yields in a normal year fall very far below the average of his community has little chance of receiving a satisfactory labor income. The following table shows the charac - teristic effect of crop yields upon labor income. Under $10,000 110,000— $18,000 18,000— 25,000 25,000— 35,000 Over $35,000 $830 1,455 1,980 3,023 4,420 443 582 1,036 1,630 $596 1,012 1,398 1,987 2,790 $382 740 1,046 1,480 2,391 $214 272 352 507 399 Average $2,583 I $866 $1,717 $1,332 $385 </seg>

One method of increasing farm profits is by increasing the yield of crops per acre. It is interesting to note that there seems to exist a relationship between number of productive animal units, good crop yields, and labor income. Grouping the farms to show the per cent having low and high labor incomes as compared with the crop index emphasizes the need of crop yields as good or better than the average.

It is possible to invest so much capital and labor in securing large crop yields that the resulting crop increase will not pay the cost. All our records indicate that this seldom happens in eastern Nebraska, and that the men who are farming a little better than the average of their community are receiving the best returns. DIVERSITY. In any prosperous region a majority of the farmers are usually found following in the main those farm practices which are most The diversified farm of eastern Nebraska which produces both crops and livestock is usually more profitable than is the specialized farm </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 157. profitable. Experience and observation have taught them the type of farming and cultural methods which are best adapted to their region and to their particular farms. Of the 195 farms included in this survey, 150 have a diversity index of 3 or more. This indicates that one-crop farming is not profitable, else it would be more generally followed. In general, the operators with the highest diversity have the best labor incomes. No one crop occupies all of a man's time, and the farmer who works only half of the year cannot compete successfully with the man who provides profitable labor for the entire year. Table 12 shows the variation in labor income when the farms are arranged in classes according to their diversity. TABLE 12. — Relation of Diversity to Labor Income and Other Factors.

The difference in crop acres per man and per horse is due in part to size of farm, but evidently in greater part to the fact that diversity provides a better distribution of man and horse labor thruout the year. A considerable part of the care of live stock comes during the winter months when the crops provide little if any work. The farmer, being an economic producer, prefers working for a low wage to lying idle. The stock utilize considerable roughness which would otherwise be wasted, as well as some high-priced feed. Were it not for the fact that a large proportion of our live stock is produced in part upon cheap feed and by cheap labor, meat would be much higher than it is at the present time. The diversity index as here used expresses only the diversity of products sold and not the diversity of products grown. No distinction is drawn between the man who produces the corn and alfalfa fed his cattle, and the man who purchases them, altho the man who grows his feed is certainly diversifying his farming to that extent. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">Farm Management Studies in Eastern Nebraska. 21 While it is not easy to work out an exact table of diversity of production, the records indicate that such a table would show more characteristic results than are here presented. EFFECT OF SEASONAL VARIATION. In farm management surveys, it is essential that records be taken in an average year, or better yet, that an average of several years be used. The following table shows the difference in farm profits between selling corn at a high price in a year of good crops and purchasing at a high price for feed because of crop failure. It also gives the average labor income of nearly 600 eastern Nebraska farms including good, bad, and average years. Table 13. — Seasonal Variation and Labor Income in Eastern Nebraska. Interest Figured at 5 per cent. Number Corn, Corn, Labor The area in which the average gain in 1914 was $1,448 is normally no more prosperous than the area in which the average loss was $189 in 1913. The difference in profit was due to rainfall and to the high price received for the 1914 crop. The average corn yield for the years 1911-14 is lowered by the one year of crop failure, while the average labor income of the 597 eastern Nebraska farms upon which surveys have been made in some one of these years is slightly above the average of the farms for which more specific data have been given, probably because of the large proportion of 1914 records. Of the 70 farms whose record is given for 1913, the best 10 had an average labor income of $775 and an average area of 192 acres. Each of these farms had three main sources of income, — wheat, hogs, and cattle, and nearly all of them sold oats, horses, and poultry. Altho these farms had an average of 17 animal units but little feed was purchased. Nearly all that the farm produced was utilized, and the stock showed a good net profit. Labor and feed were used efficiently, and the farmer prospered even if his corn was an almost total failure. Seasonal variation has a direct effect upon the size of farm business which is most profitable. Under very favorable con - ditions such as existed in 1914 in the area where the farms returned to the operator an average labor income of $1,448, the labor income increases as the farm area increased. Under very unfavor - able conditions the larger the farm, the larger the loss after the Year of farms average yield average price income 1913 ' 70 2 $0.60 —$189 1914 53 41 .58 +1,448 1911—14 597 27.1 .57 + 521 </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 157. family size of farm is passed. For example, in the Fillmore County area in 1913, the 10 largest farms lacked $764 of paying 5 per cent interest upon the investment. The farm which provides work for from one and one-half to two men or the equivalent thruout the year, employs man, horse, and machine labor about as efficiently as does a larger area. The big profit returned by the majority of these larger farms in favorable seasons is due largely to the profit on hired labor. Upon such farms there is naturally a loss on hired labor in very unfavorable seasons. The family size of farm furnishes about as much toward the family living as does a very large farm, and the wages paid hired labor is a much smaller proportion of the farm expenses. OWNER AND TENANT. In the preceding tables in this bulletin where farms are class - ified upon the basis of size, crop yield, and diversity, no distinc - tion is drawn between owned and tenant farms. Labor income, in all of these tables, means the labor income of the farm, after interest at the rate of 5 per cent has been deducted from the net income. If a tenant paid to his landlord for rent more than 5 per cent upon the value of the land, his individual labor income was less than the labor income of the farm, while if he paid less than 5 per cent upon the value of the land his income was cor - respondingly larger. The following table gives some of the characteristic differences between owner and tenant farmers and the difference in labor income. Table 14. — A Comparison of Owned, Partly Owned, and Tenant Farms Owner Part owner Tenant Number of farms Area in acres Crop acres Crop acres per man Per cent of area in crops Per cent of area in pasture Per cent of area in clover and alfalfa Receipts from live stock Capital Value home Value other buildings Farm receipts Farm expenses Farm income Farm labor income Operators' labor income Landlords' rate of interest 76 214 149 86 69.6 24.3 8 $1,475 27,078 1,347 1,296 2,526 III 1,568 203 203 35 222 180 103 81.1 14.7 I 8.1 $1,362 28,011 949 963 3,028 1,027 2,001 600 707 4.1 84 200 158 104 79 14.5 4.5 $795 25,673 831 731 2,447 707 1,740 456 921 3.1 </seg>
            <seg id="p023">Farm Management Studies in Eastern Nebraska. 23 The average size of the owned and tenant farms surveyed is practically the same. The slight difference in capital is accounted for by the difference in size and by the larger investment in buildings and live stock on the owned farms. The owner receives a much larger per cent of his receipts from live stock than does the tenant, and has a larger per cent of his farm in meadow and pasture, the acreage of clover and alfalfa being almost twice as large. The gross receipts of the owner are slightly larger than those of the tenant, while expenses are considerably larger. A part of the extra expenses of the owned farms are the depreciation and taxes upon the larger building investment. Feed and labor represent two other important items. As a rule the owner is older than the tenant and does less field work. Often considerable time is spent by the owner upon the farmstead, and in activities not directly connected with farm operations. It is usually the farm owner, who because of his permanency of residence and his active interest in the community is called upon to serve as school director, or church trustee, or director of the Farmers' Elevator Company. To fill satisfactorily any one of half a dozen such positions requires time and energy, which must necessarily be taken from farm operations. The part owner has the greatest gross receipts, expenses, and farm income. He has the advantage of owning his own home, and usually farms the rented land with but little additional expense for horse or machine labor. The tenant has the largest labor income, primarily because he pays as rent considerably less than 5 per cent of the value of the land. It is also doubtless due in some measure to the more exploitive types of farming followed and to the necessity of utilizing as much as possible of his time in productive labor. He can afford to spend less time than can the owner in beautify - ing the home place and in bettering the community. The part owner rents land only, the tenant rents both land and buildings. Because of the interest on investment, depreciation, insurance, and taxes on the buildings the tenant farm with buildings nets less than does bare land. The part owner contin - ually takes from the land he rents and puts nothing back so that this system of tenantry means very rapid soil depletion. It has been for several years a matter of common knowledge among farmers that the owner of corn belt farm land receives a low rate of interest upon his investment. This has sometimes been attributed to the so-called "speculative value" at which land sells. The advocates of this theory argue that banks do not loan money upon even the best of security for less than 6 </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 157. per cent. Therefore, if an acre of land valued at $100 nets the owner $3.50 annually it is actually worth only $58.33. It sells for $100 per acre not because of its earning capacity but because of the prevailing sentiment that corn belt land will continue to increase in value very rapidly, and the owner will make his profit, not from the crops grown on the land but from the advance in price. The opponents of this theory admit that not only has land in eastern Nebraska and other parts of the corn belt increased very rapidly in price during the last twenty years, but that the indications are that there is apt to be some increase in the future This rise will be slow, however, as compared with the last 20 years. The man who buys corn belt land today buys primarily be - cause he considers it a safe and satisfactory investment, and regards the hoped-for increase as a desirable feature but not of primary importance. The country banker may purchase land to inspire confidence in his bank, the retired farmer to obtain a known security, the typical American to satisfy his pride in land ownership. A farm furnishes the owner not only a safe invest - ment but also furnishes him with a home and a job. Upon his own ability depends to a considerable extent the labor income which he will earn in addition to the interest upon his investment. Interest rate, where capital is abundant, is governed largely by the security of the investment. Three per cent United States bonds sell at a premium because the security is good. We would laugh at the man who would say that a $100 three per cent United States bond is actually worth only $50, and that the difference between $50 and the selling price is "speculative value". Exactly the same rule holds true with corn belt farm land. The low interest rate is due primarily to the security of the investment and not to land speculation. The more speculative a security, the higher the interest rate which must be promised. As an illustration, we have 5 per cent school bonds selling at a premium, short-time personal notes at 6 to 8 per cent, chattel mortgages at 10 per cent, and mining stock which is confidently predicted to pay 50 per cent, but which guarantees nothing. None of these securities is considered as safe as corn belt farm land. If at any time the income-producing power of land (as a whole) is increased, by increased productivity, by increased prices received for products, or by better farm management, we may expect to see the land rise in price until it reflects the increased income. Present indications are that the capitalization of corn belt farm land in the future will be at a lower rather than a higher rate of interest. </seg>
            <seg id="p025">Form Management Studies in Eastern Nebraska. 25 In addition to paying interest upon the investment, the farm should return the operator a labor income equivalent to that received by skilled workmen in other industries. It should not necessarily be equal in dollars, because a part of the farm income is received indirectly in the things furnished by the farm, such as a dwelling, fruit, vegetables, and meat. In order to compare the labor income of tenants with the labor income of owners, it is necessary to place the farms upon the same basis so far as interest charges are concerned. The average per cent received by the 119 landlords is 3.41 per cent. The average for more than 400 tenant farms in eastern Nebraska is 3.43 per cent. If we exclude some farms rented from relatives on particularly favorable terms, the remainder averages approx - imately 3.5 per cent net income, and this figure will be used as a basis for comparing the owned and tenant farms. TABLE 15. — A Comparison of the Incomes of Owners, Part Owners, and Tenants (Interest on Real Estate Figured at 3J Per cent and Other Capital at 5 per cent.) The owner has a larger net income available for the support of his family than has the tenant because of the interest which he receives upon his investment. The tenant's labor income is the larger for reasons already explained. The owner and part owner, however, have a big advantage over the tenant in home conven - iences. To them the farm is a permanent home, and not a place of temporary residence while accumulating a competence. The owner, especially the owner of middle age, usually feels justified in expending the major portion of his net income in supporting his family. WHAT THE FARM CONTRIBUTES TOWARD THE FARMER'S LIVING. Before any exact comparison can be made of the labor income of the farmer with the salary of the city worker it is necessary to consider what the farm furnishes toward the family living. The following figures were compiled from farmers' estimates of what they received from the farm in 1915. Operators Tenure Number of farms .

It certainly does not bear out the widely disseminated theory that the farmers are securing enormous profits and are directly responsible for the high cost of living. Judging from the con - stantly increasing number of business and professional men these fields must offer at least equivalent monetary opportunities. Poultry is one of the minor products upon nearly all eastern Nebraska farms No small part of poultry profits comes from the labor of boys and girls. A part of the farmer's reward will always come from the opportunity of operating an independent business instead of working for wages. During periods of depression when the city workman is most apt to be idle the farm can be made to provide the major portion of the necessaries of life. The farm usually furnishes employment for the entire family, and the family often operates the farm without hiring additional labor. On the farms surveyed, approximately one-half of the work aside from that done by the operator was performed by boys under 21 years. The training received from the performance of definite daily tasks is of more value to the farm boy than is his labor to his father. These factors will always aid in keeping average farm profits at a low figure. SOME SUCCESSFUL FARMS.

Table 19. — Summary of Business of 10 Successful Farms Com - pared with Business of All Farms Surveyed The difference in capital is not large enough to account for the difference in receipts, expenses, and labor income. The successful men did not have a large labor income because their expenses were small but because their receipts were large. Profits come not so much from never spending money as from getting good value for all money expended. It is interesting to note the factors which were most important in securing the added profit. 10 Farms 195 Farms i Value Totals Value Totals 1 ■ Capital Real estate Live stock Feed Machinery Cash $26,865 $23,816 2,377 1,793 591 414 516 390 280 $30,629 233 $26,646 Receipts Crops Live stock (Net inc.)

TABLE 20.— Factors Affecting Farm Profits. 195 Eastern Nebraska Farms. 10 Efficient I Average The difference in capital, crop area, and productive animal units is not great enough to account for any very large part of the difference in gross receipts. The better farms are more diversified, but the difference is not great since nearly all the farms of the region are diversified farms. Unquestionably, then, these ten farms are prosperous because of their organization and because of the quality of their business. Their crops average 15 per cent better than their neighbors, and this yield is secured without increased cost, as productive animal units per man, and the crop acres per horse are greater for these ten farms than for the average of all the farms, while crop acres per man is but little lower. These farmers not only kept more live stock but cared for it more efficiently. Allowing market price for all hay, straw, and grain fed, and rent for pasture including cornstalks pastured, these farms received $1.33 for each $1 worth of feed consumed, in addition to the meat, milk, and other products consumed on the farm. On some farms in the area, rough feeds were wasted, and upon other farms the stock was not economically handled. farms (195 farms r- 'ize of business Farm area, acres Crop area, acres Productive animal units Total capital Total receipts Total expenses Hversity of business Diversity index hiality of business Crop index Crop acres per man Productive animal units per man Crop acres per horse 228 187 25.5 $30,629 $4,114 $1,201 3.8 115 95 15.5 27.5 207.5 158 19 $26,645 $2,583 $866 3.5 100 98.5 11.4 24.7 </seg>

Occasionally a man may attain success producing figs or thistles, ginseng or onions, muskrats or squabs, but on the average the man is most apt to prosper who grows the products which he knows and for which there is a well-established demand. The growing of nearly all unusual products demands special skill; their sale, a special market; and too often their profit depends upon unusual conditions. While there is nothing spectacular in the results obtained by these ten farmers they nevertheless are worth more than passing notice. The type of farming which they represent is the type which is doing most to bring prosperity to their part of the corn belt. EDUCATION. Education is a factor not always considered in accounting for the success or failure of individual farmers. Nebraska records indicate that the farmer with a college education has a decided advantage over the man who has attended only the common school. Table 22. — Relation of Education to Labor Income.

            <seg id="p032">32 Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Bulletin 157. Only a part of those who had attended high school had completed 12 grades. This group also included Business College students. Normal School students are included among those who attended college, and not all of this group are graduates of an institution of higher education. While the number is so small that we cannot draw definite conclusion as to the exact monetary value of a college education, it can be said very definitely that there are no indications of the once prevalent theory that "book learning" renders a man impractical and unfits him for farming. CONCLUSION. If farm management surveys in Nebraska have proven any - thing, it is that farming is a business and that the farmer is a business man. He can depend neither upon some other man to do his thinking for him nor upon strikes and combinations to give him either higher wages or shorter hours. While the prices of many commodities are apparently influenced, if not entirely controlled by agreements, trusts, and pools, the business of farming yet remains, and doubtless will continue to remain upon a competitive basis. To meet the competition of other producers, not only in this but in foreign countries, Nebraska farms must be organized upon efficiency lines. A good balance must be maintained between crops and live stock so that all crop residues are utilized and a full year of productive labor provided. The largest item in the cost of production is labor. Therefore the most important problem of production for the Nebraska farmer to solve is how labor can be used most efficiently. The men who arrive at the most satisfactory solution of the question are the men who will have, other things being equal, the largest labor incomes. Farm area, diversity of enterprises, intensity of culture, and type of farming are determined primarily by the area, diversity, culture, and type which permit the most efficient use of labor. In deciding these questions personal experience is of first importance. Farm management surveys would add to personal experience the combined experience of other men. A large put of the survey records upon which this bulletin is based were taken by advanced students in the Department of Farm Management. E. L. Currier conducted the survey in Platte County, Arthur Medlar in Fillmore County, L. F. Garey in Madison County, Boyd Hist in Richardson County, and H. M. DUon of the Office of Farm Management United States Depart - ment of Agriculture in Merriek County. The data upon what the farm furnishes toward the family living was collected by J. F. Hendricks. Some of the tables contain data from records taken in connection with the Farm Management demonstration work conducted cooperatively by the United States Department of Agriculture and the Extension Service and Department of Farm Management of the University of Nebraska. 8-30-M6— 17M </seg>
