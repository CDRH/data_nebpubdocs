         <seg id="p003">2 LETTER OF TRANSMITTAL OFFICE OF BOARD OF EDUCATIONAL LANDS AND FUNDS LINCOLN, NEBRASKA Honorable Dwight Griswold Governor of Nebraska Lincoln Dear Governor Griswold: In compliance with Section 72-201 CSN 1941 Supplement, the Board of Educational Lands and Funds of the State of Nebraska, at a meeting held January 13, 1941, appointed for the first time a Secretary other than a member of the board. As such Secretary I have the honor and privilege of submitting herewith the Thirty - third Biennial Report of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, for the biennium beginning July 1, 1940 and ending June 30, 1942. During the past biennium, this department has instituted a card index system giving all data concerning the 6,828 leases and 650 sale contracts now in effect. Of the 1,689,791.41 acres of school land owned by the State of Nebraska all is now under lease with the exception of 322.80 acres. There has also been compiled a complete bond file of all bond issues held by the State Treasurer. These bonds are under the direct supervision of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds. The file shows an investment of $14,262,820.95 of which $'5,331, - -600.00 are Government bonds. The present Board of Educational Lands and Funds has purchased Government bonds in the amount of $1,901,500.00. All government bonds are now registered in the name of the Treasurer, State of Nebraska, this being the first time the State of Nebraska holds no government coupon bonds. It is my opinion that the progress made in this department may well be recognized by quoting in substance the following excerpts from the report of the Hanson Audit Company, dated December 23, 1941, as requested by the Nebraska State School Board^ Associa - tion. "The administration of the several Trust Funds, which, of course, includes the Permanent School Fund, is in the hands of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds. So long as that Board is made up in the main of honest, capable people, we are going to see an efficient administration of the Funds, but if the contrary is true, schools as a whole will suffer. "It is our observation that a vast improvement has taken place as between the way the office of Educational Lands and Funds is being administered now with the way it was so loosely handled sev- </seg>
         <seg id="p004">3 eral years ago. ;: We are not in a position to state the exact date on which the improvement began to.be noticed, but it has been a gradual growth over the past three or four years at least. ""Without any desire or wish to inject politics into this report, one cannot help, sensing the business-like attitude with which the present Governor, Dwight Griswold, and the other members of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds handle the business of the board. ¦ •.• . "The records of the office are in exceptionally good shape, in-. dexed and cross indexed for purposes of ready reference; complete files are maintained on all aspects of the many, lands and, bond issues which the State owns and particularly when delinquencies in the collection of interest and principal occur and any tendency exists for the investments to turn'sour*. '.'¦':.''¦.¦ "It is our studied opinion that since our audits of 1936 and . 1937, as authorized by House Roll No. 97, passed by the 1935 Legis - lature, in which we resorted to caustic comment on the way things had been handled, there has been avast improvement in the manage - ment of the office of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds." I take pleasure in reporting that the audit of the Permanent School Funds, which was authorized by the Board of Educational Lands and Funds under date of February 27, 1942, is progressing very satisfactorily. This audit is being made to determine all losses sustained by the Permanent School Fund from its inception in 1867 to January 1, 1942. , I wish particularly to call your attention to the portions of this biennial report in which there, is a complete recapitulation of revenue derived from school lands; the classification and reappraisal of school lands; facts relating to escheated property; and the status of mineral leases. . ¦ ' The Board of Educational Lands and Funds requested this de - partment to prepare a capitulation of all delinquent rentals due on school land accounts forfeited subsequent to January 1, 1920. There are 1,015 of these accounts upon which the delinquent rental amounts to ?139,874.73. We have, up to June 30, 1942, collected on accounts of about fifteen years standing, $5,579.55. There is at the present time a test case pending in the Nebraska Supreme Court to determine the liability of assignees who have obtained an assign - ment from the original lease holder as collateral. It is my opinion that because of the lapse of time since the accounts were forfeited, the greater portion of the amount is uncollectable. ••'•¦'¦'¦•,. In order to continue the present efficient administration of the office of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds it is being </seg>
         <seg id="p005">4 recommended that in addition to the present permanent personnel of this department, an assistant to the Surveyor be permanently employed. This assistant would, in addition to assisting in the classification and reappraisal of school land, make investigations in regard to the present abuse of the terms of agricultural and mineral leases. The improvement of the Department, as shown in this report, was accomplished with the fine co-operation and loyalty of all em - ployees, in performing their duty of safeguarding the trust funds of our great school system. The assistance of the Attorney Gen - eral's office has been invaluable to the work of this department. The hearty co-operation given me by yourself and the present Board members and the keen interest each member has taken in the administration of this office, has made it possible to accomplish such a fine record. Respectfully submitted HEXRY H. BARTLING, Secretary THE ORIGIN OF SCHOOL LANDS OWNED BY THE STATE At the close of the Revolutionary War, the United States came into possession of a vast area of land reaching from the Alleghenies to the Mississippi, known as the Northwest Territory. When Virginia was admitted to the Union, she requested that the land in the Northwest Territory be set aside to be used to help support schools. The land was surveyed and platted into townships six miles square and containing thirty-six sections. Section sixteen ir "very township was reserved for the maintenance of public schools. Other states, as admitted to the Union, were given the same consideration. The same grant was made to the original thirteen states. When California was admitted to the Union in 1850, section* sixteen and thirty-six of each township were allotted for school purposes and extended to all States. The Enabling Act which ad - mitted Nebraska to the Union was passed by Congress on April 19, 1864. Sections sixteen and thirty-six in every township were granted to the State for the support of common schools. The first statute relative to the control of school land provided that the State Auditor shall be made commissioner and have general charge </seg>
         <seg id="p006">5 of the administration of these lands. This statute was passed in 1867. In each county the lands were to be appraised by three persons and offered for sale to the public. No lands were to be sold for less than $5.00 per acre. The new constitution of the State of Nebraska, adopted by the vote of the people in 1875, created the office of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings. It also called for the creation of a Board of Commissioners for the general management of all lands and funds set apart for educational purposes and for the investment of school funds. It also provided that the Governor, Secretary of State, Treasurer, Attorney General and Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings should, under the direction of the Legislature, constitute said Board! It further provided that no educational lands should be sold for less than $7.00 per acre nor for less than the appraised value'thereof. The new constitution of the State of Nebraska/adopted by the vote of the people in 1920, changed the name of the board to the Board of Commissioners for Educational Lands and .Funds. It also provided that no lands owned :or thereafter acquired by the state for educational purposes should be sold except at public auc - tion under such conditions as the Legislature should provide. In compliance with these provisions, the State Legislature adopted certain rules for the sale of educational lands which, together with certain amendments subsequently adopted, govern the sale of such lands at the present time. In 1936 by a direct vote of the people the constitution of Ne - braska was amended, abolishing the .office.of the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings; This abolishment, however, did not become effective until January, 1939. In 1940 by a direct vote of the people, the constitution of Ne - braska was again amended, naming the Superintendent of Public Instruction as a member of the Board! of Educational Lands and Funds. This amendment became effective in January, 1941. Since that time the Board of Educational Lands and Funds has been composed of the Governor, Secretary of State, State Treas - urer, Attorney General and Superintendent of Public Instruction. A secretary, other than a member of the Board has been appointed to assume the administrational duties formerly performed by the Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings. The Board has full management and control of all school lands and the investment of all funds derived from the sale of school lands. The total assets amount to approximately $21,000,000.00. ; ¦::-''. </seg>
         <seg id="p007">6 Rules and Regulations Pertaining to the Leasing and Sale of Educational Lands LEASE CONTRACTS The Board of Educational Lands and Funds may at least once each year designate a day and an hour for offering in a public man - ner, at the office of the county treasurer in the respective counties, lease contracts on all of the educational lands which may be subject to lease in that county at the time of such offering. The same shall be subject to lease at an annual rental of six (6) per cent upon the appraised value thereof. Provided, if two or more parties desire to lease the same land, the officer having control of the auction shall lease to the person who will pay the greater amount of cash bonus in addition to six (6) per cent upon the appraised value as annual rental. If after due diligence to lease the land at an annual rental of six per cent upon the appraised valuation, the land may be offered for lease at less than the appraised valuation and the board may lease it to the person or persons who will pay six per cent upon the highest offered valuation as annual rental if, in their judgment, it is to the best interest of the State to accept such bid, but they may reject the same and pass said land without leasing at said auction. Lease rentals are due in two installments, January Ist and July Ist of each year. If rentals are not paid within six months after due, the lease holders are declared delinquent and notice is sent them if their post office addresses are known. If unknown, notice is given by publication in a local newspaper. Ninety days after date of such notice lease contracts are declared forfeited and are subject to auction thereafter. Delinquent lease holders are not permitted to bid at the sale of the leases they have forfeited, but at any time before the hour advertised for the commencement of such sale they may reinstate their leases by paying all back rentals, fees and cost of advertising. All school lands under lease are subject to reappraisement at any time the Board of Educational Lands and Funds so elects. All leases expire twenty-five years from the first day of Janu - ary next ensuing after the date of the lease. A lessee has the right at the expiration of his lease to apply to the county treasurer for a new lease and receive the same without competition, at the same time surrendering the old lease, paying rentals six months in advance, and a lease fee of one dollar. This will do away with the public auction except in cases where the former lessee does not apply for a new lease. In such cases, </seg>
         <seg id="p008">7 the lands will be advertised and leased at public auction to the highest bidder, and all improvements on the land appraised by the county board. Improvements to be included in such appraisements shall be all buildings, fencing, wells, windmills, pumps, tanks, irriga - tion improvements, and I also costs for labor expended in breaking sod on said tract of land and reducing same to cultivation, and for alfalfa or other crops growing upon said land. TY\e appraisement shall be made within thirty (30) days after the acceptance of the bid. (See Sec. 72-218; Session Laws Nebraska, 1935.) Where lands are forfeited on account of non-payment of rentals, the mov - able improvements are sold under the direction of the Board ot Educational Lands and Funds as provided by Sec. 72-219, Nebraska Session Laws, 1935. j '¦."''¦'.'¦ '¦';"¦ ; The amount of school land authorized to be leased, direct or by renewal, to one person is limited to 640 acres. EDUCATIONAL LANDS MAY BE PURCHASED FROM THE STATE AS FOLLOWS: Lands known as isolated tracts, lands situated in the irrigation districts, and lands for the use of churches, cemeteries, schoolhouse sites, county agricultural fairs, public roads, and for sewage dis - posal purposes. : }-. Any lessee of land situated within the areas irrigated, or to be irrigated, from irrigation works constructed or controlled, or to be constructed or controlled by the United States, or its duly authorized agencies, or any lessee of any forty-acre tract or government sub - division, any part of which is under irrigation, may purchase the same. (See Sec. 72-211, Nebraska Session Laws, 1935.) ;-0\ The-.law. also, provides, that if any forty (40) acre tract is ad - jacent to other school land which is wholly or partly under irriga - tion, and therefore subject to sale, such tract may be sold even though not under irrigation if, in the opinion of the BoaTd of Ed - ucational Lands and Funds, it is expedient to sell the same. Any irrigation district in which there are or may be any educational lands belonging to the state which are or may hereafter become sites for reservoir purposes may purchase from the state for reser - voir sites such educational land, or portions thereof. (See Sec. 72-211, Nebraska Session Laws, 1935.) The law provides that the Board of Educational Lands and Funds shall make a list of all isolated tracts of school lands con - taining less than forty (40) acres, all undivided interests in realty, and all city lots held by the state of Nebraska in trust for the per - manent school fund, appraise same, and upon the expiration of the </seg>
         <seg id="p009">8 leases or upon forfeiture of lease titles, offer the same for sale at public auction, to be sold by the county treasurer of the county in which the lands are located to the highest bidder for not less than ninety (90) per cent of the appraised value. The purchaser shall pay not less than twenty-five (25) per cent in cash on day of sale and the balance to be secured by sale contract running ten years at six (6) per cent annual interest, the purchaser having the right to pay all of the unpaid money, or any part of it, in multiples of five (5) per cent of the total purchase price at any interest payment date. In the event the purchaser, or the assignee, does not pay the annual interest upon the unpaid purchase price within six (6) months after interest becomes due, the land shall revert to the state. SALE CONTRACTS The owner of a sale contract may at any time pay any portion of the purchase price thereof to the treasurer of the county in which the land is situated; provided, all interest at that time earned and due has first been paid. And when the principal is paid in full other than the first of the year, interest upon the obligation having been paid for the entire year, the county treasurer receiving such prin - ripa] payment may refund to the payor out of any interest money then in his hands the interest so paid in advance in excess of the amount earned and due at the time said final payment is made. All unpaid principal on sale contracts, excepting those covering isolated tracts and lots as heretofore described, draws interest at five (5) per cent per annum, payable annually on January first of each year in advance. A sale contract holder making his final payment to the county treasurer should also surrender his contract that it may be forwarded to the Secretary of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds with receipt showing full payment. RULES No assignment of a school land lease or sale contract is valid until recorded in the office of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, and an assignment will not be recorded if any interest or rental is due at the time it is offered for record. The original sale or lease contract must be sent in with the assignment or the latter will not be recorded. Contracts will be returned with recorded assignments. When a subdivision of not less than forty acres in any contract is assigned, a new number is given the assigned portion of the ledger account and a new lease issued to the assignee. When assignment is made as above, the original contract must be reduced and the in- </seg>
         <seg id="p010">terest or rental, as the ease may be, is adjusted to the new condi - tions. . ./..'. When interest on a sale contract, or rental on a lease contract, is not paid when due, the county treasurers will collect "penalty" interest at seven (7) per cent for the time purchaser or lessee has been tardy in making such payments. Improvements on leased land and the owner's equity in land under sale contract are subject to taxation. No forfeited lessee, or the relative of a forfeited lessee, is eligible to hold a school land lease until such time as all delinquent rentals on said forfeited lease are paid. Lands escheating to the state are appraised and leased or sold in the same manner as educational lands. . ¦¦¦¦-/¦..'¦":': v:- "¦. _':(¦-¦ -FEES--- ¦&#132;.-.¦• Issuance of lease, sale contract, or deed __-__—;—--- $1.00 Recording assignments, each—- .__-¦_.--_. 1.00 Certified copy of lease or contract _____ —— 2.00 Recording any instrument; first 500 words—.—— ,- 1.00 Each additional 100 words ______-___--—-_-—___-— .10 Delinquent Notice _——-—-— -——- ———- l-OO Reinstatement __-——__—---— —;______-__________ 1.00 Recording order of forfeiture __-___--— —- .50 Copies of maps or plats, each hour's work ______—______ .40 Where publication in newspaper is required in lieu of ordinary delinquent notice, the actual cost of such publication is charged where redemption is made. ¦¦¦¦¦¦ 9 </seg>

         <seg id="p016">REAPPRAISEMENT OF SCHOOL LANDS School, lands are reappraised by a standard classification. Where classifications are made, the State Surveyor views each forty - acre tract of school land for the purpose of obtaining all the nec - essary information relative to the type and rating of the soil, its adaptability, and the topographical characteristics of the land. A map is drawn showing the actual condition of each forty-acre tract. Normally school lands are divided into four types, namely, cultivat - ed, hay, grazing and waste lands. Each type of land is divided into more than one different grade according to its degree of pro - ductiveness. In arriving at the productive value of the cultivated land, the soil type, lay \of the land, and the region in which it is located, are the three most important factors. This classification map referred to contains, in addition to the above data, all information relative to movable and immovable im - provements, together with the value of same. Under the law, the State has a prior lien on all movable improvements on State School Lands in the event of unpaid rental or interest on contracts. ¦ After the land in a particular county has been mapped and classified, a public hearing is held at the county seat. The County Commissioners meet jointly with a representative of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds/not to determine the individual lease value, but to arrive at a fair value per acre for the various types of land in the county, thus eliminating the possibility of appearing to show individual favoritism. ;.•:'.¦¦¦¦, ' Subsequent to the reappraisal hearing, the Board of County Commissioners and; the State Surveyor each present a tentative schedule of values for school land in the respective county to the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, for consideration. The Board of Educational Lands and Funds then adopts a schedule of values to be used in determining rentals in the county affected. Subsequent to the passage of the present school land classifica - tion law in 1935 and prior to this biennium, 704,738.59 acres of .school land had been classified, mapped and reappraised. This rep - resented progress at the rate of approximately 117,000 acres per year, all work being done by the State Surveyor in addition to his regular duties. At this rate an additional eight years would have been required to complete the mapping of all state school land; At the request of this department and the Board of Education - al Lands and Funds, the fifty-fifth session of the Legislature pro - vided an additional appropriation to facilitate the classification of school land. The Board of Educational Lands and Funds employed 15 </seg>

The Statutes of Nebraska define the duties of the State Sur - veyor and Draughtsman, and place in his charge, under the super - vision of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, the field notes, and ait other records of the Government Surveys of Public Lands in the state. He conducts all correspondence pertaining to the sur - veys, grievances or disputes growing out of conflicting surveys of lands and lots, prepares the advice, or instructions and opinions, and issues a circular of instructions jto the County Surveyors of the state for their direction and guidance in.the restoration and estab - lishment of lines and preservation of corners in conformity with the laws, tules and .egulations governing the surveys of the United States, and establishes rules of surveying. He performs all other duties as may be required by the Board of Educational Lands and Funds, and acts as arbitrator in ease of any disputes among land owners by reason of any survey of boundaries of lands within the state, or of disputes or disagreements between surveyors as to the survey of boundaries. Upon the receipt of any petition for a sur - vey, the same shall be referred to the State Surveyor who is made the arbitrator to determine and settle such disputes by making the necessary examinations and surveys to settle the same and whose decisions shall be prima facie evidence of the correctness thereof. The law also provides for an appeal to the courts from decisions of the State Surveyor in making such surveys by any person having an. interest in the lands affected by such surveys.

However, by the use of binding tape these records are well cared lor. Many department resurveys made by the United States Gov - ernment under the supervision of the General Land Office have been filed in this office. The plats have been carefully assorted and classified and the field notes arranged and bound in book form con - sisting of twelve nine by fourteen inch volumes, each being two inches thick. There are at the present time, however, sufficient field notes to comprise an additional two volumes. These field notes should be bound. The maps of the Alt Surveys, which are inde - pendent and in many places far removed from the original lines and corners, have also been classified and arranged accordingly All the records of state surveys have been separately bound m manuscript covers, arranged alphabetically according to counties and assembled in spring-back covers about two inches thick, con - stituting twenty-four volumes.
