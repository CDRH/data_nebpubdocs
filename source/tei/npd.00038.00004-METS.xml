He located at Brownville, moving to Broken Bow in the early eighties, where he engaged in the banking and abstract business. In 1901 he was ap - pointed secretary of the State Banking Board, an office of honor and trust, which he filled with marked success and efficiency until the date of his death, March 5, 1917. </seg>

Smith, Auditor of Public Accounts, Hon. Willis E. Reed, Attorney General. Members of the State Banking Board. Sirs: 1 beg to submit herewith the Twenty-fifth annual report of this Depart - ment for the period beginning December 9, 1915. and ending November 17, 1916. On the following pages of this report will be found comparisons, summaries and detailed reports of the banks under your supervision, 839 in number. I wish to call your attention to the following changes and amendments to the banking law, which if enacted by our present Legislature, I believe would be beneficial and a protection to the guaranty fund: It is imperative that some provision be made in the Banking Act itself, directing the disposition of the depositors guaranty fund in banks liquidating or consolidating with other state banks. No provision is made in the law for the disposition of this fund where banks liquidate or consolidate with other banks. It may have been the intention of the Legislature to leave to the Bank - ing Board the disposition of this fund. Litigation, differences of opinion or con - troversy marked the efforts of the Banking Board to determine such matters. The law should specifically provide what is to be done with the guaranty fund in such cases, and the Legislature in its wisdom should settle this question by legal enactment. Another amendment that has heretofore been suggested, with no action by the Legislature, and which I feel constrained to make again; that is, the delegating of discretionary power to the State Banking Board in granting charters. The multiplication and organization of banks in localities where it is apparent there is not business enough for additional banking capital or fa - cilities,, or where banks are organized through jealousy or spite, thus endan - gering the depositors guaranty fund, is a prevalent evil, and cannot be cured except by giving to the administrative body that has supervision and regula - tion of banks and the protection of the guaranty fund as its special duty, authority to use a restraining hand where in its judgment a wrong is being done to the community and the depositors guaranty fund is being imperiled. Experience has demonstrated that the payment of interest on deposits by the banks under your supervision of a rate as high as five per cent, permitted by the banking act, is leading to abuses that were not contemplated when the depositors guaranty feature was added to the law. in that it is building up in the banks of the state a fictitious deposit that in time of depression would, in my opinion, seriously endanger the depositors guaranty fund. I would recommend the lowering of the maximum rate of interest to be paid on deposits protected by this fund, with the specific provision that deposits upon which a higher rate of interest is paid would not be protected. In the event of such an amendment it might be necessary to confine assessments for the depositors </seg>
            <seg id="p006">IV TWENTY-FIFTH ANNUAL REPORT OK THK guaranty fund to such deposits as are protected by it. This should accomplish two purposes. First, it would reduce the tendency to build up fictitious deposits, and second, it would enable the state hanks to pay a higher rate of interest without the protection of the depositors guaranty fund, thus enabling them to meet the competition of their national bank neighbors. Both the national and state banks would then be in the same position in regard to their deposi - tors, as neither would be protected where the state bank paid a higher rate of interest than would be permitted on protected deposits. I would further recommend that the provision of the banking act which limits the total loans and investments of a bank to ten times its capital and surplus be repealed. This provision of the law is irrational, not founded on sound reasoning, and by practical experience proved to be a burdensome and unreasonable restriction. I would also recommend an amendment to the hanking act permitting banks under your supervision authorized to do a commercial bank business to provide savings departments to be conducted under the same rules and regulations that apply to savings banks with regard to pass books, requiring such pass books to be presented at the bank when withdrawing any of such deposits; no other restrictions now accorded savings banks chartered as such to be permitted or provided for, and such savings deposits kept on the books separate and distinct from other deposits, and I would advise placing a reason - able limit upon the amount which any one person may deposit, so as to prevent such savings department being used by large investors, the purpose being to encourage the savings habit in communities where there are no savings banks. Another matter that I would recommend for the careful consideration of the Legislature is the enactment of a law permitting the banks of this state to act as trustees, administrators, executors, etc., as provided in the Federal Banking Act, this of course would apply to both national and state banks. I desire to extend to you my sincere appreciation for your wise counsel and valuable co-operation in the administration of the affairs of this office, and especially to the retiring Chairman, Hon. John H. Morehead, do I wish to extend my sincere thanks and gratitude for his consideration and kindness. To the State Bank Examiners and office force, and to Messrs. E. N. Van Home. John Boatsnian and Tom R. Riley, who have left the service to engage in active banking business, I take this opportunity of expressing my thanks for their competent and faithful services. Respectfully submitted, E. ROYSK, Secretary State Banking Board. </seg>
