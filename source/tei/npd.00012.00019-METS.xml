IX ACCORDANCE WITH LAW. 

The laws of Nebraska require the state superintend 
ent of public instruction to "submit to the governor of 
the state a full report of the operations of his office during 
the year, which report shall contain a statement of the 
school funds of the state, and an account of the receipts 
and expenditures for the purpose of schools, a statement 
of the condition of the common schools and other educ:i 
tional institutions chartered x&gt;r fostered by the 
state, embracing the number of schools of the 
several grades, the number and average compensation 
of the teachers, the names and compensations 
of county superintendents, the number of 
pupils attending the several schools, the enumeration 
of youth by counties, the value of schoolhouses, sites, 
apparatus, and furniture; a statement of such plat 
he may devise for the better management of the school 
funds, and the school system, and such other statements 
as he may deem expedient to communicate relating to 
his office and popular education." — Section 7 or Sub 
division VIII, Chapter 79 of the Compiled Statutes. 

The requirements of the foregoing provisions of law 
are contained in this volume, which includes the reports 
and other requirements not only for the past year (1904), 
but also for the year 1903, or for the biennium January 
1, 1903, to December 31, 1904, inclusive. 

IN GENERAL. 

Nebraska occupies an unrivaled position in lmvinir 
the lowest per cent of illiteracy of all the states in the 
Union. Nowhere has the value of a common school education 
been more generally and universally acknowledged 
than here, nor has the free secondary and higher education 
in the state been altogether neglected. 

Ke constitution of Nebraska, adopted in 1875, 
d that all moneys arising from the sale or leasing 
ions number 16 and 36 in each township in tliis 
state should be perpetual funds for common school purposes, 
of which the annual interest or income onh </seg>

            <seg id="p032">
2 


be appropriated; and the interest on theee school lands 
sold and leased, together with that on warrants, county 
bonds and school district bonds, certain and licenses, 
i he state school tax of I 1 !- mills 'or less upon the 
dollar of assessed valuation of all taxable property in 
itate, provides a sum in excess of $700,000 appornnually 
to all the common school districts of the 
This amount will increase from year to year 
er than diminish. Local school districts may 
i selves not to exceed 25 mills on the dollar o 
I valuation. All fines, penalties, and license 
are appropriated exclusively to the use and supof 
the common schools in the respective subdiviswhere 
they may accrue. 

The constitution also states that the legislature shall 
¦ de for the free instruction in the common schools 
of all persons between the ages of five and twenty-one 
-. Free education, including free text books and sup. 
is furnished in all school districts in the state. 
¦&lt;&gt;1 government, organization, and management in 
Nebraska is almost purely local, each one of the 6,667 dis- 
B being responsible for its own school. Each district 
provides a full course of instruction in all of the eight 
grades or years of work below the ordinary high school, 
and many of them furnish graduate certificates upon the 
'letion of this work. The course includes reading, 
writing, spelling, arithmetic, grammar, geography, his. 
physiology, etc. In some of the larger cities of the 
te kindergartens have been established. 

tiVhen a school district has a population of 150 or 
children of school age, it may organize as a high 
&gt;1 district and furnish free high school privileges to 
s pupils who complete the eight grades of work 
j the high school. We have in Nebraska eighty-five 
res maintaining a high school course of one year, 
total of nine grades of work; there are 175 villages 
high school courses of two years; 101 villages or 
i with high school courses three years in length; and 
y-four cities in the state maintaining a full four </seg>

SUMMARY OF 8TA1 

years, high school course, sometimes differentiated into 
classical, scientific, English, and commercial con 
above the eight grades of common school work. A 
all these we have as a superstructure the magnificent I niversity 
of Nebraska, with its faculty of 200 and an at" 
ance of more than 2,500. The University has a li 
endowment from lands donated to the state by the United 
States, and is supported by the proceeds of investment 
of a permanent fund, by other incomes, and by at; 
one mill upon the dollar of assessed valuation of the 
state. 

During the last school year (1903-1904) there w 
enrolled in the schools of Nebraska 280,000 children ; the 
state had 6,767 schoolhouses, of which 35 were stom 
brick, 105 log, 273 sod, and the rest wood or frame buildings. 
The number of hoolhouses in the state in 
1890 was nearly 800, but it has steadily decreased since 
that time, while the number of brick buildings rapidly 
inere The value of school district property i 
is estimated at $11,000,000; the total indebted 
of all districts at $3,285,000 and the total annual &lt;¦ 
ditures at $4,900,000. Nebraska employs annually 
theachers, including 3,250 in graded schools. 

The improvement in these respects may be seen in 
a comparison of the statistics for 1904 with t!n&gt;former 
years. The number of school districts nc 
Nebraska is forty-one less than the number four 
ago, while the number of schoolhouses is greater by 
thirty-four. The organization of new districts, either by 
detaching territory from organized districts or from 
unorganized territory, tends to increase the number of 
&gt;1 districts in the state, but the consolidation of districts 
during the past few years more rapidly than the 
ion of new ones lias reduced the total net number 
iooI districts in the state from 6.708 in 1900 to 6,667 
in 1904*. Owing to the rapid rise and fall of sod schoolhouses 
in the state the difficulty in sometimes determining 
whether a district actually has a sclioolhounot. 
the number of schoolhouses fluctuates from year to 
year without other apparent cause. </seg>

The finances of the school districts of the state show 
well in comparison. The excess of income over expenditures 
was much greater in 1904 than for several years 
before. The expenditures for buildings and sites was 
less, but the amount of school district bonds issued in 
1904 was nearly double the amount issued in 1902, and 
more than two and one-half times the amount issued 
in 1900. The bonded indebtedness of the districts shows 
an increase in 1904 of a little more than 4 per cent over 
1902, while all other indebtedness shows a decrease of 
more than 11 per cent in the same time.

STATB BUPKKINTENDRNt's REPORT 

In the Seventeenth Biennial Report of this department, 
under the caption, "The Passing of the Rural 
Schoolmaster," I called attention to the rapid decrease 
in the number of men employed from year to year in 
teaching school. Tn 1890 there were 2,861 men thus employed, 
2,062 in 1900, 1,840 in 1901, 1,862 in 1902, 1,490 in 
lOlK!, and 1,389 in 1904. During the same time the in- 
N in the number of women teachers more than offsets 
loss of men, for the total number of teachers was 
!&gt;,4(i3 in 1900, 9,620 in 1902, 9,714 in 1904. As stated two 
years ago, if the loss of male teachers is to be charged to 
-alaries, as is customary, we must make our comparisons 
between the salaries paid men for teaching and 
the salaries paid in the other professions and the trades 
and various lines of business, and not between the 
salaries paid men for teaching and the salaries 
paid women for teaching, for men are paid more 
than women, and men are paid better wages now than a 
fefr years ago. While the number of men teaching school 
in Nebraska has decreased nearly 33 per cent in the past 
four years, their average salaries have increased nearly 
20 per cent in the same time. I agree most heartily with 
the English Educational Commission, whose members 
almost unanimously pointed to the dearth of men ters 
as the most serious fault in the American school system. 
Hon. Leslie M. Shaw, Secretary of the Treasury, 
said recently: "The boy never sees much of his father; 
all he sees are other boys and some very excellent 
women teachers. But you cannot rear a man without 
bringing the boy in contact with a man, just as sure as 
the world." 

Nearly three years ago this department published </seg>

a pnmphlet 01 'Zio pages 6ntitl6d, ©chool ouildiiiirs anci 
Grounds in Nebraska, and distributed several thousand 
copies over the state. This publication contained illustrations 
of more than 100 schoolhouses in Nebraska, 
including many built on a model plan, and it also 
tained plans and specifications of a model rural schoolhouse 
erected in district No. 20, of Washington county, 
known as the Sutherland school, and model plans for 
village schools of two or four rooms, based on the school - 
house in Calhoun. I believe that this publication, which 
was issued in the hope that it might contain some help, 
direct or suggestive, to school officials, has had a good 
effect. The reports of the county superintendents of 
Nebraska indicate an appreciable improvement in material 
school conditions in the state. During the school 
year ending July, 1903, 160 new schoolhouses were 
erected; during the school year ending July, 1904, 165 
new schoolhouses were erected. In this connection it 
must be remembered that the number of school districts 
in the state is not increasing, and that in both city and 
country the tendency is not toward more districts and 
more schoolhouses, but centralization and consolidation 
of weaker districts and weaker schools that better and 
stronger schools may be established. More and more 
attention is being paid to the environment of the child, 
and better school buildings are being erected, with a 
view to the greater comfort and convenience of the child, 
with better seating, lighting, heating, and ventilating. 

NEW SCHOOL BUILDINGS. 

» During December, 1904, I collected statistics of 
schoolhouses erected in Nebraska during the biennium 
then closing, the calendar years 1903 and 1904. A few 
&gt;uj&gt;erintendents failed to report. In the rural communities 
of the state there were erected during 1903, one-room 
schoolhouses, as follows: Frame, 129; brick, 11 ; stone, 3; </seg>

            <seg id="p040">

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S BKPOBT 

divided as follows : Frame, 136 ; brick, 2 ; stone, 1 ; log, 4 ; 
sod, i3. With complete reports these numbers would be 
slightly greater. Thirty-four of these frame buildings 
were constructed after the plan of the Sutherland schoolhouse, 
in District No. 20, of Washington county, a model 
of its kind. The counties with more than one schoolhouse 
constructed upon the Sutherland plan were Burt, 
Butler, Cedar, Hamilton, Lincoln, Polk, Richardson, 
Saunders, and Washington. Garfield and McPherson 
counties each erected three sod schoolhouses during the 
biennium, while Cherry, Custer, Deuel, Hitchcock, and 
Lincoln counties each erected two. Deuel county constructed 
one of stone and one of "grout." Sheridan 
county erected four log schoolhouses. The largest number 
of one-room schoolhouses erected during the biennium 
was in Custer county, where twenty-five frame and 
two sod schoolhouses wer built. Knox county erected 
twelve rural schoolhouses, Cherry county 10, Garfield, 
Keya Paha, and Lincoln, counties 9 each, Frontier, Sherman 
and Hitchcock counties, eight each; Polk and Saun 
ders counties, seven each, and Boone county built six. 

I These rural schoolhouses have been constructed at 
xpense ranging from less than $50 for some of the 
schoolhouses, to $1,500 or more for some of the 
le and brick buildings. 

I Nor have the cities and villages of the state been 
nd the rural communities in the erection of new,

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

Total cost $517,700.00 

This total, however, does not include all the expen 

ditures for new buildings in the cities and villages of 
Nebraska during the biennium 1903-1904, for many 
superintendents and principals failed to report, and the 
laws of Nebraska do not give the state superintendent 
l&gt;ower to compel city superintendents and village princi 
pals to make reports to his office, or to enforce penalties 
when they fail to report. To the amount given above 
about 10 per cent should be added to complete the total 
cost of new school buildings in the cities and villages of 
Nebraska, and perhaps another 10 per cent for addition*, 

improvements, etc., not reported.

THE STATE APPORTIONMENT. 

I desire to call particular attention to the manner in 
which the state apportionment of school moneys is distributed 
to the counties and districts of Nebraska. The 
law was enacted twenty-four years ago (1881), and reads 
as follows: "The state treasurer shall, semi-annually, 
on or before the third Monday in May, and the first Monday 
in December, make a complete exhibit of all moneys 
belonging to the school fund of the state, as returned to 
him from the several counties, together witR the amount 
derived from other sources, and deliver the same duly 
certified to the state superintendent; and within twenty 
days thereafter the state superintendent shall make the 
apportionment of said funds to such counties according 
to the pro rat a enumeration of scholars in each county 
last returned from the county superintendent, and certify 
the apportionment of each to the county superintendent 
of the proper county and to the state auditor, who 
shall draw a warrant on the state treasurer in favor of 
the various counties for the amount so specified by the 
state superintendent. 

"The several county superintendents shall immediately, 
and within twenty days after receiving such 
apportionment, and after adding thereto all moneys 
received by the county treasurer on account of fines and 
licenses, apportion the entire amount as follows, to- wit: 
One-fourth of the whole amount to be distributed equally 
to the several districts in the county, and the remaining 
three-fourths of the whole to be distributed to the several 
districts in his county pro rata, according to the enumeration 
of scholars last returned by the directors of the 
various districts, and no district, city, or village which 
shall have failed to sustain a school for the length of 
time required by section 14, subdivision II, of this chapter, 
shall be entitled to receive any portion of the fund. ' ' 
Sections 3 and 4, Subdivision XI, Chapter 79, of th« 
Compiled Statutes. 

A study of the following table will show how un- </seg>

8TATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

equally this state apportionment of school moneys is distributed 
to the several counties at the present time, when 
we also take into consideration the sources from which it 
is received, the amounts contributed by the several counties, 
etc. In this connection it must be remembered that 
the amounts received by the counties exceed the amounts 
contributed by the counties by $368,873.54, so that each 
county might receive in return 37 per cent more than it 
contributed without detracting from any other county's 
share. Instead of that, forty-two counties in the state 
receive actually less than they contribute, and fourteen 
others receive less than 137 per cent of the amount they 
contribute. Notice that Cherry county, instead of receiving 
137 per cent of the amount it contributes, receives 
only 26 per cent ; Banner county 41 per cent ; Blaine 27, 
Cheyenne 41, Deuel 34, Grant 42, Hooker 23, Keith 26, 
Kimball 37, McPherson 25, Sioux 24, Thomas 43, and 
Wheeler county 39 per cent. Now notice that fifteen 
counties in the state receive in return more than double 
the amount they contribute to the state apportionment of 
school moneys. Adams county receives in return 233 pei 
cent of the amount it contributes, Cass county receives 
285 per cent, Cuming 213, Dodge 240, Douglas 389, Fillmore 
207, Gage 330, Hamilton 245, Johnson 228, Nance 
293, Nemaha 311, Otoe 217, Saline 216, Seward 210, and 
Thurston county 904 per cent. Is it any wonder that in 
the counties first named, Banner, Blaine, Cherry, and 
the rest that receive leas than 45 per cent of the amount 
they contribute to the state apportionment, the average 
number of days that school is held during the year is 
100, while in the latter class of counties, those that receive 
more than 200 per cent in return for their contributions, 
the average number of days of school is 163 T 
And in local taxation there is a great difference. Douglas 
county school districts levy a tax that averages less 
than seven mills, while many of the western counties 
exceed seventeen mills. The average levy in the thirteen 
counties first listed for the current year (1904), under 
the new revenue law is nearly fifteen mills, while for 
fifteen counties mentioned later it is exactly ten mills. </seg>

Now notice hiw the present scheme of state apportionment 
of school moneys works out. Following is a 
table of the semi-annual apportionment of May, 1904, to 
the several counties. The total amount then apportioned 
was $443,288.14, which, with a school census of 376,317, 
was distributed at a rate per child of $1.177964 in accordance 
with law. Notice that the one-fourth apportioned 
to each district ranged from $3.17 in Perkins county, to 
$199.50 in Douglas county, and taking an average of the 
total apportionment for each county we have for each 
district in Perkins county $12.68, and for each district in 
Douglas county $798.01. Perkins county receives a lower 
.•iverage per district than Grant, Hooker, Kimball, Mc- 
Pherson, and other counties, because it has been organized 
into a larger number of districts in proportion to 
the school census. Study the table.

The present method of distributing the state school

for Section 7, Article Vlil, of the Constitution of the 
State of Nebraska reads in part, as follows: "Provisions 
shall be made by general law for an equitable distri¦n 
of the income of the fund set apart for the supof 
the common schools, among the several districts

" Omitting all consideration or 

thought of the sources of the fund the distribution cannot 
be termed equitable, and with these sources in mind, the

I believe it would be a more equitable distribution

STATE BUPEKINTKNDKNT'8 REPORT 

if one-fourth of the whole amount should be distributed 
by the state superintendent to the several districts of the 
state, through the county superintendent, and the remaining 
three-fourths apportioned to the counties according 
to the pro rata enumeration of scholars in each county; 
Then this three-fourths should be distributed by the 
county superintendents in accordance with Section 4 of 
Subdivision XI, on a one-fourth and three-fourths basis. 
If an apportionment amounted to $400,000, under this 
plan one-fourth of that amount, or $100,000, would be 
distributed equally among the 6,667 districts in the 
state, and $300,000 would be distributed to the counties 
according to the pro rata enumeration of scholars in each 
county; then this $300,000 would be divided into onefou~th 
and three-fourth parts and distributed in accordance 
with Section 4. There may be one or several plans 
preferable to this one, but this one is certainly more 
&lt;&lt;iuitable and just than the present law. 

STATE NORMAL SCHOOL APPROPRIATIONS. 

I believe the legislature of the state should make 
more liberal appropriations for the support of the state 
normal schools of Nebraska, whose students are taught 
and trained for the direct benefit of the children of the 
state. A much larger per cent of the normal school 
graduates return immediately to the service of the state 
than the graduates of any other educational institution. 

Besides the receipts from several other funds, the 
University of Nebraska receives the benefit of a tax of 
one mill upon the dollar of valuation of the grand assessment 
roll of the state. The State Normal School at Peru 
enrolls one-third as many students as the University, and 
it receives no financial support from any other source 
than the direct appropriations of the legislature, but I </seg>

            <seg id="p055">
21 

SUMMARY OF STATISTICS 

Clieve a tax of one-fifth of a mill upon the dollar of 
luation of the grand assessment roll of the state would 
be sufficient for the support of the State Normal School 
at Peru, or two-fifths of a mill for the support of the 
two state normal schools. The income from this tax would 
enable the Board of Education to keep the State Normal 
Schools open during July and August, as they should, for 
during this time only are thousands of teachers who enter 
the schoolroom without professional training or preparation 
for their work free to receive the benefit of the state's 
investments at Peru and Kearney. From the standpoint 

of economy, if these institutions are to remain closed 
during any part of the year, it should not be during June. 
July, or August. 

A more liberal policy toward the state normal schools 
would also enable their Board of Education to pay the 
professors and instructors engaged in the training of 
teachers, "teaching teachers how to teach," salaries 
more in keeping with the services rendered. The 
instructors at Peru not only receive lower wages than are 
paid in other state normal schools, but even lower wages 
than are paid for equivalent work in the High Schools of 
Nebraska. The salaries at Peru range from $600.00 to 
$1,300.00, the average being less than $1,000.00 a year. 
Teachers of similar qualifications in the normal schools 
of neighboring states receive from $1,400.00 to $1,800.00 
for work that in many instances is not of as high a grade 
as that at Peru. 

At a meeting of the Board of Education held March 
2, 1904, the committee on Teachers, Employes and Salaries, 
made the following report : 

K' Investigation discloses the fact that the salaries 
in the state normal school of Nebraska are, almost 
ut exception, lower than the salaries paid in the </seg>

            <seg id="p056">
22 


state normal schools of Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Colorado, 
and South Dakota. Many of the Nebraska salaries 
range from two-thirds to one-half the amount paid foi 
similar work in the other states. For instance, note tuc 
following salaries paid in the state normal schools of six 

"A comparison of our present salary schedule with 
the salaries paid the professors and instructors in the 
University of Nebraska reveals the fact that in the state 
normal school at Peru we pay in some cases less than 
50 per cent of the University salaries for similar work. 

I' A comparison with the salaries paid in some of the 
r high schools of Nebraska would prove to you that 
of the instructors in the state normal school at 
receive less than their students of several years ago 
iow receiving. 

iWe, therefore, hereby propose the following salary 
le for the state normal school at Peru. The adop! 
this report with the understanding that the maxitalaries 
in the last column of the schedule will be 
laries actually paid after a number of years of 
ll, efficient service will do much, we believe, toward 
ping the character and efficiency of that service,

JUNIOR NOBMAL SCHOOL APPBOPBIATION : 

The legislature might also, with justice to the state 
at large and particularly to the educational interests of 
northern and western Nebraska, make a more liberal appropriation 
for the support and maintenance of the Junior 
State Normal schools. During the past biennium it has 
beea a struggle to carry out the plans of the state department 
of public instruction and conduct five of these schools 
twenty weeks, employing five instructors In each school, 
with an enrollment each year of 1,100 students (teachers 
and prospective teachers), on an appropriation of 
$1 2,000. This is an average of only $120 a week for each 
school to pay the five instructors and all other expenses. 
Only by local and county support has it been possible to 
carry on the work as well as it has been done, with 8 
lent instructors carefully selected from among the best 
school men and women of the state, with strong lecture 
coursesand other arrangements similar and equal to those 
in the usual "Senior" normal school summer sessions.

-IATK SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

The establishment of the Junior Normal Schools materially 
increased the work of the state department of public 
instruction, whose force has not been increased in num 
ber in ten years, although the work and responsibilities of 
the office have been more than doubled in that time. The 
Junior Normal School bill that will be offered to the 
Twenty-Ninth Session of the Legislature recognizes the 
value of the school to the county in which it is held in 
that it calls for the aid and use of the institute fund of 
that county in defraying in part the local expenses of the 
Junior Normal School. In the counties where Junior 
Normal Schools are held separate county institutes become 
unnecessary. A complete report of the establishment, 
management, maintenance, work, value, and results 
of the Junior State Normal Schools will ha found else 
wheie in this report. 

UNORGANIZED TERRITORY. 

The attention of the legislature is respectfully called 
to the fact that there are yet several thousand square 
miles of territory in the state unorganized into school 
districts, on which many hundreds and perhaps a thousand 
or two children reside who are absolutely denied all 
school privileges. The laws relative to the organization 
of school districts (Subdivision I of Chapter 79) should 
be so simplified that county superintendents may incor 
porate all unorganized territory into new or existing districts 
without petitions.

NECESSABY SCHOOL. LEGISLATION. 

Members of the Legislature of the State of Nebraska 

Twenty-Ninth Session. 
Gentlemen : 

As Chairman of the Committee on Legislation of tin' 
Nebraska State Teachers' Association, as well as in my 
official capacity as State Superintendent of Public Instruction, 
I would respectfully request you to consider 
the following general suggestions and recommendations 
for the improvement of educational conditions in the 
state through the enactment of the following measures 

P(l) A free high school attendance law, or a law for 
establishment and maintenance of state high schools, 
the cities and villages of Nebraska the pupils have the 
privilege of free attendance at high schools for a period 
of two, three, or four years. During the current year 
Ire are 84 city and village school districts in the state 
intaining an established high school course of four 
irs, 101 maintaining a three years' course, 175 main 
aing a two years' course, and 85 maintaining a one 
ir course. In these 445 districts only of the 6,667 dist 
ts in Nebraska do pupils have free tuition above the 
hth grade or common course. These established high 
ools should, in some manner, be opened free of tuition 
the graduates of the rural schools. Three free high </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

school attendance measures have in turn been enacted 
into law and in turn declared unconstitutional by the 
supreme court of the state. I believe, however, that all 
objections on account of unconstitutional!^ and for other 
reasons may be overcome by a state levy of a fraction of 
a mill, to be apportioned to the high school districts in 
ortion to the number of weeks of attendance by nonlent 
pupils who are properly accredited graduates 
of the rural schools of the state. If a state levy for University 
purposes is proper and legal, surely state aid for 
a High School education for the youth on our farms 
should be. The High School work includes the ninth, 
tenth, eleventh, and twelfth grades or years of a public 
school course ; the University work may be described as 
the thirteenth, fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth grades 
or years in the course. The high schools of Nebraska 
enroll seven or eight pupils to the university's 
one; but seven of every eight in the high schools 
live in the cities and villages of the state; one 
or two are the farmer's boy and girl who pay tuition. 
The enrollment in the high schools of Nebraska during 
the school year ending July, 1900, was 16,693; for the 
ending July, 1902, it was 17,160; and for the year 
ending July, 1904, the enrollment was 17,929. There are 
twice as many teachers in the rural schools of Nebraska 
as in those of city and village, and more pupils in the 
former than in the latter, but as already stated a great 
majority of the pupils now in the high schools are fron 
the city and village graded schools of the state. The law 
simply asks that the farmer boy and the farmer girl be </seg>

            <seg id="p065">

offered the same high school privileges that the boy and 
the girl in the city and village now enjoy. 

The proposed state high school bill will, if enacted 
into law, unify educational thought, methods, plans, 
courses of study, and standards throughout the st:r 
Every village and city in Nebraska would have an a 
portunity to share in the benefits of such a measure. The 
opportunities thus afforded would be within the reach 
of every farmer boy and every farmer girl in the statf 
The proposed law would bridge the gap now existing be 
tween the rural school and the university. It would make 
it possible for every county in the state to have at le 
one good high school with a two-year, three-year, or four 
year course of study. More than a dozen counties in 
Nebraska are now without such privileges. Several thousand 
boys and girls in the rural communities would take 
advantage of the privileges offered under this free high 
school measure during the first year and would come 
under the instruction of more than 500 trained high 
school teachers. The proposed measure would also place 

She disposal of the state two million dollars' worth of 
?ol buildings, grounds, apparatus, books, and libraries 
the education of a great army of young people in the 
ler duties of American citizenship. 

In order that you may understand what has been 
accomplished in other states where the law is beyond the 

Brimental stage, we quote herewith from the state 
rintendents of Wisconsin, Minnesota, and North 

Dakota. 

Hon. C. P. Cary, of Wisconsin: The sum appro- 

priated for state aid to high schools is $90,000. This is 
apportioned among the high schools of the state in proportion 
to the amount paid out for instruction in the 
high schools. Each school receives half the amount paid </seg>


            <seg id="p066">
STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

Er instruction in the high school providing the $90,000 
II hold out to pay them all that much, which it does not, 
d the money is therefore apportioned on that basis. 
There is one exception, however, to this rule and that is 
in the case of township high schools. Each school receives 
half the amount paid out for instruction regardless of 
how much there is to be apportioned to the district high 
schools. 

Hon. J. W. Olsen of Minnesota : I do not hesitate to 
state that in my judgment the state is amply repaid in 
iv&gt;ults for the encouragement thus given to this class 
of educational institutions. These schools, coming under 
the supervision of the State High School Board, must 
comply with the rules of the board, and we employ both 
a graded and high school inspector to see that the rules 
are complied with. This results in better buildings, well 
iM'ated, lighted, and ventilated, in good working libraries, 
as well as in physical and chemical laboratories, etc. The 
aim is to induce communities getting this aid to do more 
for themselves. Under the rules of the State High School 
Board also, only competent teachers can be employed, the 
minimum salaries for superintendents and teachers being 
fixed by the board. I feel warranted in saying that the 
State High School system of Minnesota has resulted in 
the employment of men as superintendents who rank high 
in culture and scholarship, as compared with those occupying 
the same positions in other states. This aid from 
the state enables a community in many a small town to 
maintain a high school, that otherwise could not afford to 
do so, which, in turn, draws in a vast number of its best 
young people for high school instruction who would not 
and could not receive it if it were not placed within their 
immediate vicinage. The graded schools of the state 
have also been greatly toned up under this system, which </seg>

has worked so well that some years ago the plan was 
extended clear down to the rural schools of the state. 
where it has also proved helpful, in inducing a number 
of r-ommunities to do more for themselves. 

FJon. L Slockwell of North Dakota: The' law 
providing for a State High School Board and for inspection 
and classification of high schools is now nearly ten 
years old. I wish to say that, in my judgment, nothing 
has had a more decided influence upon the whole scheme 
of education in this state than has this classification, inspection, 
and aiding of high schools. It has had the tendency 
to build up good, strong, efficient high schools in 
every part of our state, and I think the influence of a 
good high school is felt throughout the entire community 
and county in which that high school is located, be&lt; 
of the fact that many of the rural school teachers are 
drawn from among the graduates of our high schools. 
The acceptance of aid by a high school, of course, presupposes 
the acceptance of certain conditions prescribe 1 
by the State High School board. The acceptance of aid 
also gives us the right to inspect and criticise the work 
done in high schools, and in this way we are able to stiin 
ulate the work, and we are enabled to go befor* 
boards of education and insist upon more assistance and 
more material to work with, and are able to support most 
effectively the superintendents and principals of the high 
schools in their work. The conditions which we impose 
now, that the state aid shall be used for certain specific 
purposes, tend to put our high schools in the very best 
shape, so far as laboratories and libraries are concerned, 
and I hear only the most favorable comments upon our 
scheme from those who are working in our high schools. 
It also stimulates towns to bring up the standard of their 
schools and establish high schools. This in turn n </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S EEPOBT 

upon the grades, because it is impossible to maintain 
strong high schools where the system of grades is notably 
weak. The state aid makes the high schools free schools, 
for it is possible for any boy or girl in our state to pass 
from the common school to the high school without 
charge, and from that to our normals or university; so 
that our high schools are free in the broadest interpretation 
of the term. 

1(2) A law providing for a more uniform system for 
Le certification of teachers, and for a board of examiners 
&gt;r the examination and grading of teachers ' manuripts 
in all the branches required for a first grade 
•unty certificate, said board to work under the direcon 
of the state superintendent of public instruction, 
his proposed measure does not change the sources of 
ithority granting certificates in a single instance. The 
niversity of Nebraska, the state normal school, the 
recognized private institutions, and the county superintendents 
will continue to grant certificates as under the 
exising statute. The principal object of the proposed 
plan is to make a uniform standard upon which to grant 
certificates in every county in the state instead of ninety 
different standards as we now have. The plan would 
relieve the county superintendents of their most onerous 
task, do away with the cry of favoritism so often made 
against them, and raise the scholarship of teachers and 
place them absolutely on their merits as all examinations 
would be conducted on strictly civil service rules. It is 
true that "grades do not make teachers," but teachers 
should be able to make grades. Under the present system 
there are two extremes resulting from the forced 
haste in the preparation of questions and in the examination 
of manuscript. The state superintendent with his 
limited office help is compelled to prepare questions with- </seg>

            <seg id="p071">
32a 


our oue consideration 01 tiiGir full scop© and mo*\ninc. 
The county superintendent is likewise rushed in the 
examination of papers. One extreme is a too rigid examination 
by some of the county superintendents on questions 
that are at times susceptible of more than one 
meaning or that admit of elasticity in answering. The 
other extreme is a laxness on the part of the county 
superintendents in granting certificates without a careful 
examination. In one case the county superintendent 
is too rigid through fear of being too lax, in the other 
case he is too lenient through fear of being too severe in 
his requirements. This proposed bill has the unanimous 
support of the county superintendent's section of the 
Nebraska State Teachers' Association where it was discussed 
in full December 30, 1904, and unanimously endorsed. 
We hope the members of the legislature will 
study carefully and conscientiously the proposed act to 
provide a more uniform system for the certification of 

(3) Establishing seventeen (17) years as a Bin 
imum age for legally qualified teachers. 

(4) Amending section 1 of Subdivision IX, relative 
to Qualifications of Teachers, so as to permit the state 
superintendent to endorse or approve professional 
tificates from other states. 

B5) Requiring teachers to make a final report to 
ounty superintendent before receiving their last 
i'8 salary, and requiring city superintendents and 
principals of graded schools to make an annual report 
to the state superintendent before receiving their last 
month's salary.

school principals as well as city superintendents for a 
term not in excess of three years. </seg>

expiration of the terms of the present incumbents, as in 
Lincoln and South Omaha.

three members to hold meetings before money that was 
not directly appropriated at the annual school meeting 
can be legally expended.

the qualified voters shall elect (officers) by ballot, a

department of public instruction with funds appropriated 
by legislative enactment, that the transportation expenses 
of the teachers in attendance at said summer 
school or junior normal school who live outside the county 
in which said school shall be held may be paid for from 
their homes to the county line of the county in which said 
school shall be held and return out of the institute fund of 
?vich county so uniting with said school, pro rata from the 
si mount on hand after all other expenses have been paid. 

ARGUMENTATIVE. 

In support of these measures, Nos. 3 to 15 inclusive, 
1 offer the following arguments : 

(3) I believe that every person should attain to 
the full age of eighteen years before assuming the responsible 
position of a public school teacher, and there are 
many who believe a young man should be at least twenty 
years of age before beginning to teach. During the past 
three years several of our county superintendents have 
licensed persons as young as sixteen years on account 
of the scarcity of teachers. They claim that some j&gt;ersons 
are as competent to teach at sixteen as others are 
at twenty. I will admit that, but I claim also that many 
others are never competent to teach. However, very few 
people possess the necessary tact and good judgment to 
conduct a good school at the tender and immature age 
of sixteen years. It is perhaps inadvisable to enact a 
measure establishing eighteen years as the minimum age 
at the present time, but seventeen years can be established 
with safety in the hope that it may be increased to eighteen 
years two or four years hence. This will insure a 
better preparation in general by those who contemplate 
teaching. It will assist in placing the schools in &lt;i 
of men and women, or those who are nearly men and 
women, for it is true that in manv counties of the </seg>

            <seg id="p074">
32d 

8TATB BOPKRIMTKNDENT's KBPOBT 

boys and girls are licensed to teach. Maturity of thought 
and judgment are necessary qualifications of a successful 
teacher. Then, too, for physical reasons young girls 
should not be allowed to take up the strenuous life of 
school teaching. 

(4) This is a matter of reciprocity. Persons holding 
state or professional life certificates in Nebraska are 
qualified to teach in any state in the Union, but the superintendents 
of other states will not endorse Nebraska 
state certificates unless the state superintendent of 
Nebraska is permitted to endorse or approve these certificates 
from other states. 

(5) This will expediate the work of the county 
superintendent and will also enable the state superintendent 
to make his report to the Governor at the opening 
of the legislature. This department has been compelled 
to send out to some superintendents and principals 
four or five calls for their reports. It simply applies 
business principles to the making of final or annual 

(6) Boards of education of schools in cities now 
have authority to elect their superintendents for a term 
not in excess of three years. There is no valid reason why 
such power should not be given to boards of education in 
high school districts as well. It will establish a longer 
tenure of office for earnest, progressive superintendents 
and principals. Many good school men and women are 
lost to the high schools of Nebraska every year because 
high school boards of education do not have authority to 
contract with them for a longer term than one year. 

B(7) The demand for such qualifications is so self;nt 
that argument should be unnecessary. At prest 
is not only possible but it is true that superintend- </seg>

            <seg id="p075">
32e 


ents are elected wno are not quaiinea to pass upon tne 
manuscript of the teachers they examine. 

P8) Under the existing statute the law contemplates 
ant officer for each district, and when the district 
board fails to appoint a truant officer it is the duty of 
the director to act as such. First, as a matter of economy 
there should be a truant officer for the whole county ; and, 
second, the director in nine cases in ten will neglect his 
duty to enforce the law through fear of gaining the ill 
will of his neighbors. 

(9) This would do away with the possible "deadlocks" 
in the election of teachers and other business that 
requires a majority vote. It would insure greater care 
on the part of the people in the selection of reputable 
citizens for membership upon the school board, and it is 
in line with the prevailing sentiment in favor of a longer 
tenure of office in school management and control. 

(10) It often happens that there are those elected 
as members of school boards whose greatest ambition is 
to secure a place for a daughter or a son, a sister-in-law 
or a brother-in-law, or a cousin, regardless of fitness. The 
temptation for ' ' a trade ' ' is too great to be resisted. ' ' To 
the victor belongs the spoils" becomes the individual 
motto and practice of too many school board members. 
"A community of interests" is established at the expense 
of the schools. To protect the people against the evils 
of nepotism I urge upon the legislature the importance 
of enacting a law which will make it illegal for a school 
board member to vote for a blood or martial relation to 
teach in the public schools. This law should apply to 
every school district in the state. 

(11) Such a law would be a death blow to the chart 
sharks that go about the country seeking whom they may 
devour and devouring all they find. Business interests </seg>

            <seg id="p076">
32f 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT"? REPORT 

demand that the school funds be appropriated for the 
general welfare. Such a law would do away with the 
E'iture of money without due consideration and 
inaugurate system into rural school matters that 
in very few places. 

(12) The law in this section is silent as to whether 
a majority or plurality vote is required to elect. While 
a plurality vote elects in city districts I believe it would 
be for the general welfare of the rural districts to require 
a majority vote of those present and voting to elect 
officers. Otherwise, two or three votes would often elect 
school officers, and even with a majority vote required 
to elect there will still be eases where two or three votes 
will be sufficient to elect. It may be of interest to know 
that in many districts only the three school officers and 
perhaps one or two others attend the annual meeting. 

(13) Such a law would make it possible for county 
superintendents, school board officers and teachers in 
rural districts to get rid of ancient text books and substitute 
in their stead, modern, up-to-date ones. The teachers 
and pupils need these new books as much as the farmer 
needs modern farming implements. As it is now, the text 
books used in the cities of Nebraska are far superior to 
those used in the rural schools. 

E(14) See the report on Junior Normal Schools as 
blished and conducted in 1903 and 1904, published 
inhere in this report. 

(15) I feel that the state can well afford to make 
a strenuous effort to place within the reach of its. teachers 
opportunities for a better preparation for their signal 
calling. This plan would afford the teachers outside the 
county where such summer school or junior normal is 
held the same opportunities as the teachers in such 
county. In other words, it is practicing as well as preaching 
the grand motto of our state, "Equality Before the </seg>

force of law till reversed by the courts." Section "&gt; of the same 
subdivision requires the state superintendent to prescribe forms 
for making all reports and regulations for all proceedings under 
the general school laws of the state. 

During the biennium now closing I have visited nearly ever\ 
part of Nebraska in person, eighty or more of the counties at 
their county seats, one hundred and fifty or more other cities and 
villages, and some rural schools ; the deputy superintendent has 
also visited a majority of the counties and many cities and

schools employing two or more teachers, and more than 6,000 
rural school districts in the state : and as there are more than

arise in the conduct of school district affairs, T have endeavored to 
reduce the number of disputed points in school law and the irregularities 
of school proceedings by issuing printed circular 
letters of direction and warning at irregular intervals to county 
superintendents, to city superintendents and principals, to school 
district officers and to patrons of the schools. The Nebraska

of more than 5,000 copies, has been recognized as the official

Lincoln, Nebraska, November 26, 1902. 

To the County Superintendents and Teachers of Nebraska : 

Teachers' Library Union 

IJnder date of July 29, 1901, 1 gave the Teachers' Library Unien 
Chicago a recommendation, believing that its plan afforded 
ellent opportunities for teachers to study history, literature. 
:nce, etc., in a systematic way, and that the Union woukl 
business on business principles. Upon statements made by 
pt. Ed C. Bishop of York county in a letter dated September 
1901, that an agent of the Teachers' Library Union had done 
tie work that appeared crooked in several respects, frightening 
mbers into paying notes secured by misrepresentation, etc.. 
evoked my indorsement September 25, 1901. 

Under date of March 25, 1902, Supt. Bishop informed me that 
these difficulties had been adjusted to the entire satisfaction of 
himself and teachers of York county, and I gave the Teacher^' 
Library Union permission to use again my indorsement of July 
29, 1901. 

Inder date of June 23, 1902, I informed the Teachers' Library 
9n that I was in receipt of a letter from Seward county to the 
:t that their agent, a Mr. . had made all manner of 
: statements, among others telling the teachers of the county 
their county superintendent would revoke their certificates 
ley did not join the Union, and in other ways frightening 
n. I told the Union that if these charges could be substanid 
or if I heard any more complaint regarding the matt* r 
&gt;uld be compelled to recall again my recommendation which 
' held and to warn the superintendents of the state against 
tg business with them. Under date of June 28, 1902, I wrote 
Teachers' Library Union that I was in receipt of infr— '*tion 

from two or three sources to the effect that their agents 


insistent in canvassing teachers and that in some cases the a^ent* 
had told the teachers that their certificates would be revoked 
if they did not take the Reading Circle work of the Teachers' 
Library Union. I wrote also that the county superintendents. </seg>

            <seg id="p081">
("KKMIAI. CIIttlLAK AM) N&lt; &gt;': 

35 

of the state and this department insisted that the represent;', 
of the Union use no compulsion of this or similar nature. 

Under date of November 14, 1902, Supt. I). D. Donova- 
Greeley county wrote for an opinion of the Teachers' Library 
Union, informing me that some people in his county seemed to 
entertain the opinion that they were a fraudulent concern who 
charge exorbitant rates for what they offer and induce Unpeople 
to join the Union by misrepresentations. 

Under date of November 21, 1902, Supt. R. If. Thomson 
Ravenna wrote as follows: 

"A concern calling itself the Teachers' Library Union of Chicago 
has been doing a land office business among the teacher&gt; 
of this section. A denunciation of this concern, purporting ftp 
be from State Supt. Carrington of Missouri, appears in the St. 
Joseph Daily News of the 18th inst., page 4. I found upon writ 
ing to the Secretary of State of the state of Illinois that the 
charter of this corporation is cancelled, and I believe they are not 
chartered in this state. Then, is there any validity to their 
contracts? If this corporation is not responsible I do not want 
to see any teacher fleeced out of $12.50. If the corporation is abic 
and will perform its part of the contract, all right, but can it fort . 
collections?" 

The item referred to states that Superintendent Carrington 
warns the county school commissioners of Missouri against a 
concern known as the Teachers' Library Union of Chicago which 
claims to have the endorsement of the state board for library 
raks. He says these are false pretenses and th«ir agents shotrid 
prosecuted. 

The letter of the Secretary of State of Illinois reads in part 
as follows : 

t-"int me to say that certificate of complete organizath.»n 
under the laws of this state (Illinois) January 34, 
1902, incorporating the TEACHERS' LIBRARY UNION fur 
a period of ninety-nine years, capital stock of $100,000, and principal 
office located in Chicago. Said corporation has failed Jo 
file an annual report as required by law and in consequence of </seg>

36 


El failure the cancellation of the charter thereof has been en 
d of record in this office as provided by law. 1 cannot advise 
3 the financial standing of this corporation." 

Ender date of November 22, 1902, I received the following from 
t. Clara L. Dobson of Frontier county : 

"Three weeks ago I was called upon by Mr. and Mr 

, representatives of the Chicago Library Union. I was 
not favorably impressed with the men but the plan seemed good, 
and they had such excellent testimonials from people I knew 
to be trustworthy that I signed their letter of introduction. Since 
that time they and a Mr. , who works with them, have 
canvassed the county and made contracts with many of our 
teachers. I am told that they rushed into the schoolhouses and 
began explaining their errand in a rude and boisterous way before 
the teachers were aware of their being on the premises. 
They interrupted schools and in some cases frightened teacher 
and pupils. They hurried teachers into signing the contracts 
without a moment of consideration, and were angry and abusive 
when a teacher refused. They promised that the books would 
be here in a week but we have heard nothing from them. The 
teachers are growing uneasy and we all wish we were out of the 
business. 

Will you kindly inform me whether the firm these men represent 
is entirely reliable and whether their plan has been successfully 
carried out in other places? If so, I cannot understand 
why they employ such unworthy agents. If we have been victimized, 
have we any recourse? Hoping your reply will reassure 
us or suggest some way out of a disagreeable situation, 
I am," etc. 

Under date of November 24, 1902, Supt. Donovan again wrote 
me, in part as follows : 

"The Teachers' Library Union has succeeded in getting notes 
from thirty of our teachers. Some or nearly aH these notes have 
been obtained only after the most gross misrepresentations 
Quite a number of those notes have been signed by minors and 
are, I think, null. Please le* me know whether or not a school </seg>

district may be garnisheed. If they cannot garnishee the teachers 
salary they cannot collect any of the notes which they have 
obtained in this county. I am not now and never have been in 
favor of repudiating an honest debt, but T do not call the&gt;&lt;honest 
debts because the agents did not hesitate to misrepresent 
either you or me in their endeavors to persuade the teache 
Greeley county to join their so-called Union. " 

In the face of this "long train of abuses" and complaints, 
others that I have not mentioned but have heard incidentally 
on my travels, I consider it my duty to recall again my in&lt;!&lt; 
ment and to warn the count) superintendents and teacht ¦• 
Nebraska that in doing business with the Teachers' Library 
I "nion of Chicago they do it strictly on business princij' 

Exclude Agents from School Rooms 

not doubt that the Teachers' Library Union will within 
onable time send the teachers their books, and I am not 
that the terms are in any way exorbitant, but what T object t&lt;&gt; 
very strenuously is their method of canvassing. The teacher a 
ft during school hours does not belong to any agent or re 
tative nor to the teacher herself. It belongs to the district. 
:nts and representatives should not be permitted to do business 
nor to attempt to do business with teachers during school 
hours. In fact, many school district boards in cities do not permit 
agents or representatives of any kind to canvass teacher* 
in their school rooms. 

They must either go to their homes, their boarding places &lt; 
an office in the school building, for the purpose. This is a rule 
that might with profit be adopted by rural school district boards, 
individually or through the county school officers' organizations, 
or by the teacher. Teachers should absolutely refu 
listen to agents or to discuss matters that do not pertain to the 
school and the school district (hiring school hours. It is the 
duty of the county superintendents to refuse to endorse the goods 
of agents who interfere in the least degree with the school or 
the teachers' duties in the school room, and upon learning of such </seg>

NTATK srpKRINTKNI&gt;KNT's IfKI'OKT 

action they should revoke any endorsement they may have 
tfiven. 

Like Supt. Donovan, I do not believe in repudiating honest 
debts nor breaking contracts unless they have been incurred or 
made through misrepresentations and false statements. I would 
advise teachers to carry out the contracts they have signed, if 
made in good faith and the other party stands ready to perform 
his part. 

The Teachers' Library Union does not need a charter to do 
business in Nebraska. When we do business with firms or corporations 
outside the state we are taking chances. 

It is true that minors cannot make legal contracts and notes 
signed by them are null and void. According to section 1 of 
chapter 34 of the compiled statutes of Nebraska for 1901 : 

"All male children under twenty-one and females under eighteen 
years of age are declared to be minors ; but in case a female 
marries between the age of sixteen and eighteen her minority 
ends." 

Male teachers, therefore, are minors until twenty-one years of 
age and female teachers until eighteen years of age. 

A school district cannot be garnisheed nor can any municipality. 
This is the decision of the courts. 

Understand me, it is not the plan of the Teachers' Library 
Union that I oppose. I heartily favor teachers' libraries, school 
libraries, and reading circle work. But I am absolutely opposed 
to the methods of doing business adopted and used by the authorized 
representatives of the Teachers' Library Union of Chicago.

that some time recently a letter was written from this office to

of the TEACHERS' LIBRARY UNION had been cancelled

fact is. that the organization of said corporation was comjV

wrote as follows : 

"We acknowledge receipt of a copy of the circular letter aildressed

carefully. 

"We must admit that your endorsement of the Teachers' Library 
Union seems to have been the source of great annoyance 
to you and are not without an appreciation of the patience you 
have shown in the matter. In every controversy there are always 
two view points and our experience in dealing with the 
public has taught us that oft-times people of apparent good standing 
in the community in which they happen to reside may make 
exaggerated and distorted statements, and it is but justice to yon 
whose endorsement has had great effect in promoting our organization 
in Nebraska that von should be familiar with the I

had the support of the State Superintendent in Missouri, but 
they have made the statement that we had the support of several 
"State Superintendents.' and that in some places credit is given 
teachers for work done oti our Course of Reading at the time 
they took the examination for license, which statement is . 
lutely true and we are prepared to make same under oath, 
have laid all the facts before Superintendent Carrington and we 
have no doubt but what the outcome will be entirely satisfactory 
to all concerned. Superintendent Carrington has expressed his 
approval of our Course of Reading and announced his faith in

K Messrs. and , who organized the Union hi

canvassing high grade propositions among the business people

submitted by them at the time they made application with us 
for a position are men who are prominent, not only locally, but 
throughout the state of Illinois. We called upon these people and 
were informed that the men were gentlemen in every respect and 
from what we have seen of them personally we had no ri 
to think differentlv. We do not believe that a teacher with 

enough intelligence to be attracted by a high grade course of reading 
such as we have to offer would be likely to patronize an .1

advantage of this fact. We do not candidly believe, how 
that the district has lost anything whose teacher having de-, 
twenty minutes to an explanation of our Course of Reading an.t 
having become interested in same takes up the work and put

culiar fact : That where our representatives dispose of a fi

1 county that is going to raise a great hue and cry of misrepr

are disposed of, there is no trouble and everything usually moves 
very smoothly. 

e have given you this long detailed explanation that 
may be fully cognizant of all the important facts in the case and 
we believe that in the foregoing recital you have as fair and impartial 
a statement as it is possible to obtain from any sou re i. 
We fear to some extent the statement which you sent concerning 
our charter having been cancelled and we would be much pleased 
if you would take immediate steps to correct this impression. 
We have practically completed our organization in your state 
and within a few days all members will have access to the bookof

it you will let it be generally known that you are in 
hearty sympathy with the work of the Course of Reading bein^ 
pursued by the union members. It will make but little material 
difference to us from a financial standpoint, as the majority or 
the notes taken by us have either been negotiated or have been 
paid by the teachers. It will simply give the work a higher cast 
and teachers will follow up the work with a greater degree ni 
enthusiasm.

My Dear Superintendent: 

Normal School Question 

The Normal School question will be up for discussion 
so far as the county superintendents of Nebraska are concerned, 
for settlement, if possible, in our evening business session, I 
day, December 30. A record will be made and distributed 
the state giving the names and addresses of the county superin 
tendents present and absent, and of those present the vote or re 
fusal to vote on the removal of the state normal from Peru, on its 
location elsewhere, on the establishment of additional normal 
schools and similar questions. The roll of county superintendents 
will probably be called on these questions. Shall your county and 
locality go unrepresented? 

I have no desire to force my views on the county superinten 
dents of the state. I will change or modify my views on normal 
school legislation if their better judgment, as evidenced by a majority 
vote is contrary to mine. Of one thing I am thoroughly 
convinced, however, and that is the great need of a good, strong, 
first-class state normal school accessible to the teachers of western 
Nebraska.

This department has printed a third edition of the Reports 
of the Committees on English for the Grades and for High 
Schools, and will be pleased to forward copies on request. 

The county commissioners or the board of supervisors of the 
following counties appropriated one hundred dollars for their 
institute of 1902. Adams, Buffalo, Cedar, Cuming, Dakota. 
Dundy, Franklin. Furnas. Hall, Harlan, Hitchcock. Kearney. 
e, I'helps. Platte. Stanton and Valley. 

Emiparison of salaries in the Educational Directory thi^ 
hat of last year will show some changes. In the cases of 
uperintendents there have been quite a number of increases. 
In the salaries of city superintendents and principals 
there are increases in many cases where the same person was 
re-employed, but in many other cases the new superintendent &lt;&gt;r 
principal accepted at a much lower salary. I believe this to !&gt;&lt;.¦ 

a mistake. 

The Educational Directory for 1902-1903 has been distributed 
to the superintendents and principals of the state. Anyone failing 
to receive a copy should write for it. The directory this 
contains the additions and improvements adopted last year and 
one other change, — in the column of special teachers will be found 
a capital letter denoting employment of special teachers of music, 
drawing, penmanship, kindergarten, physical culture and manual 
training. To get data for this directory required in some i 
five calls from this department. A number of blanks may be 
found in the directory as the fifth call brought no response up 
to the time of going to press or the present writing. A few small 
village schools were struck out altogether on account of our inability 
to determine even their very existence.

imports for the school year 1901-1902 have been received from 
the graded schools in the state except Davenport, DeWitt. 
rrison, Heartwell, Loomis, May wood, Ragan, Stamford and 
ckville. For the year (1900-1901) we received reports from 
the graded schools except twelve and they were an entirely 
erent list from the nine named above. 

An examination for professional state certificates will be held 
in the office of the State Superintendent on Monday and Tuesday. 
December 29 and 30, 1902. Examinations will also be held 
Ersday, Friday and Saturday, June 11, 12 and 13, 1903, in the 
e of the State Superintendent, and on the same dates at 
id Island, Norfolk, North Platte, and all places where Union 
mal Institutes are in session. 

Eandidates may take all or a part of the branches at any exnation. 
Credit will be given for satisfactory work in the 
iches taken. No fee is required. 

Following are the programs for these examinations : 

Monday, December 29, 1902

1 :30 p.m. — Intellectual Philosophy. 
3:30 p.m. — Rhetoric. 

r:c. 5, subdivision 9, of the School Laws of Nebraska, specifies 
branches required for a professional certificate. Applicants 
who hold a first grade certificate granted in this state will be 
required to take the examination in the additional branches only 
(see program above). Provided, however, that if the applicant's 
papers indicate a lack of scholarship in the elementary branches. </seg>

E application will be rejected. The statutes make no provision 
electives. Grades from any other source will not be re

Applicants must also furnish satisfactory evidence of hijjli 
character and successful experience in school work. Testimonials 
from persons competent to judge of such matters will be required. 


E'rofessional certificates will not contain numerical standing.-, 
the different branches, but a grade of at least NO per cent

School Legislation 

EFhis department of The Nebraska Teacher will appear regu 
ly until the adjournment of the next state legislature. 

The committee on legislation of the Educational Council of 
the N. S. T. A. consists of Supt. Wm. K. Fowler, Dr. W. A. Clark. 
Supt. C. G. Pearse, Dr. H. B. Ward, Rev. L. P. Ludden and Supt 
W. T. Bottenfield. This committee will report to the Council 
at the regular meeting, Wednesday morning, December 31. 

A business session of the county superintendents of Nebraska 
will be held in the capitol building, at Lincoln, the afternoon and 
evening of Tuesday, December 30, 1902, for the discussion of 
school law. The county superintendents will sit as a single 
legislative assembly, discuss the proposed measures, and amend, 
pass or "kill" them. Those that pass that assembly will be presented 
to the legislature of the state of Nebraska with the nonpartisan 
endorsement of the ninety county superintendents of 
Nebraska, a body of men and women who are perfectly familiar 
with the school laws of the state, and their workings or failure 
to work. 

Ernie very important school legislation will be asked of the 
state legislature ; also some pernicious legislation, if we are 
ectly informed. The State Superintendent would be pleased 
to receive suggestions relative to needed school legislation, and 
opinions on the following: A minimum age for teachers, say, 
seventeen years ; six as the minimum age for pupils ; educational </seg>

qualifications for state and county superintendents; four y 
term for county superintendents ; county truant officer ; a; 
nriation for an educational exhibit at the St. Louis World's Fair 

in 1904 ; a school board of five members in high school and cit\ 
districts, one elected each year for a term of five years ; election 
of principals as well as city superintendents for a term of threi 
years, etc. Send also suggestions of other measures that should 

!&gt;&lt; enacted into law, of laws that should be amended, and of laws 
that should be repealed. 

Inder date of October 20, the State Superintendent sent out 
blanks to the county superintendents of Nebraska to ascertain 
what they had accomplished under section 3 of subdivision I 
of the school laws. At the present writing (November 20) 62 
of the 00 county superintendents have replied. Probably the 
others are waiting for a "second call." Of these 62, 12 have effected 
a county school board organization and 24 others contemplate 
such a move this year. Twelve of the 62 counties represented 
have county uniformity of text books, 8 others have uniformity 
in part, and all but 11 of the &lt;&gt;2 county superintendents favor 
county uniformity of text books. Fifty of the 62 counties have 
adopted the State Course of Study, three counties have 
adopted rules and regulations for their rural schools, and none 
of the 62 has a countv truant officer. 

The following suggestion has been offered : 

The State Department of Public Instruction shall prepare and 
distribute to the county superintendents of Nebraska in good and 
sufficient time for use on the third Saturday, and Friday preceding, 
of each calendar month examination questions in all branches 
required for all grades of county certificates. The envelopes or 
packages containing the questions shall be sealed, and contain 
on the envelope or wrapper printed instructions relative to tin 
time and manner of breaking the seal. The written answers, 
with a given number, the date, and name of the county, but 
without the name of the writer of the papers so as to conceal 
his identity, shall then be sent to the State Department of P </seg>

Instruction, there graded, and returned to the respective county 
superintendents. 

This would necessitate a force of four or five persons in the 
State Superintendent's office, who would be paid, together with 
expenses of printing, furnishing paper and examination questions, 
'.ge, express, etc., by means of a legislative appropriation, 
probably, or with the usual teacher's examination fees of one 
dollar each. In the latter case it would be necessary to amend 
the law providing a county appropriation for the institute fund, 
increasing the amount to not less than $50 nor more than 3 

This would place the certification of teachers under civil service 
rules. County superintendents would still issue the certificates, 
but have nothing to do with the examination of papers or 
the grades on certificates, nor would the examiners know whose 
papers they were passing upon. The supply of teachers would 
still be within the control of the county superintendents, as they 
would determine passing ' grades for certification of teachers. 
Teachers could cross boundary lines for endorsement of certificates 
into counties only whose superintendents would accept 
the (state department's) grades on the certificate they held. 

Ehas been suggested also that the said State Superintendent 
Board of Examiners examine all graduates of the normal 
&gt;ls of the state for state certificates, grading their papers, etc. 

P greatest objection to the original proposition, in my 
n, is that county superintendents would fail to obtain a 
i knowledge of their teachers' ability and preparation that 
through examining their papers. The most consciensuperintemlents 
would, perhaps, look over the papers after 
their return from the state department.

Argumentative 

In support of these measures I offer the following arguments: 

(1) I believe that every person should attain to the full age of 
eighteen years before assuming the responsible position of a 
public school teacher, and there are many who believe that a 
young man should be at least twenty years of age before beginning 
to teach. During the present calendar year several of 
our county superintendents have licensed persons as young as 
sixteen years on account of the scarcity of teachers. They claim 
that some persons are as competent to teach at sixteen as others 
are at twenty. I will admit that, but I claim also that many 
others are never competent to teach. However, very few people 
possess the necessary tact and good judgment to conduct a good 
school at the tender and immature age of sixteen years. It is 
perhaps inadvisable to enact a measure establishing eighteen 
years as the minimum age at the present time, but seventeen 
years may be established with safety in the hope that it may be 
increased to eighteen years two or four years hence. This will 
insure a better preparation in general by those who contemplate 
teaching. It will assist in placing the schools in charge of men 
and women, or those who are more nearly men and women, for 
it is true lhat in many counties of the state boys and girls are 
licensed to teach. Maturity of thought and judgment are necessary 
qualifications of a successful teacher. Then, too, for physical 
reasons, young girls should not be allowed to take up the 
strenuous life of school teaching. 

(2) Bookkeeping has no place in the course of study (or the 
average country schools, that is, as a separate subject. The 
keeping of accounts in a neat, careful, systematic manner should 
be taught in connection with arithmetic. A large nrajority of 
the teachers in the rural schools hold second and third grade 
certificates. The omission of this subject from the second grade 
certificate requirements would permit teachers to make a more 
thorough preparation in the fundamental branches that they must 
teach.

or one or more of their pupils do so. Two 3 ears or more are 
given to prepare for the examination in music. 

14) The plan of establishing aboard of examiners, in the 
:e department for the examination and grading of all teachers' 
Duscript would relieve the county superintendents of their 
st onerous task, do away with the cry of favoritism so often 
de against them, raise the scholarship of teachers and place 
m absolutely on their merit-', as all examinations would be 
ducted strictly on civil service rules. It is true that "grades 
not make teachers," but all teachers should be able to make 
des. For a further discussion of this subject see "Tlie Exination" 
and "Trained Examiners," pp. 189-191 of this re- 

(5) This is a matter of reciprocity. Persons holding state or 
professional life certificates in Nebraska are qualified to teach in 
any state in the Union, but the superintendents of other btates 
will not indorse Nebraska state certificates unless the state superintendent 
of Nebraska is permitted to indorse or approve these 
certificates from other states. 

(6) This will expedite the work of the county superintendent 
and will also enable the state superintendent to make his report 
to the governor at the opening of the legislature. This department 
lias been compelled to send out to some superintendents 
and principals four or five calls for their reports. It simply applies 
business principles to tie making of final or annual reports. 

(7) Boards of education of schools iu cities now have authority 
to elett their superintendents for a term not in excess of 
three years. There is no valid reason why such power should 
not be given the boards of education in high school districts as 
well. It will establish a longer tenure of office for ean.est, progressive 
superintendents and principals. Many good school men 
and women are lost to the high schools of Nebraska every year 
because high school boards of education do not have authority </seg>

point a truant officer it is the duty of the director to act as such. 
First, as a matter of economy, there should be a truant officer 
tor the whole county ; and, second, the director in nine cases in 
ten will neglect his duty to enforce the law through fear of gaining 
the ill will of his neighbors. It has been suggested that the 
sheriff is the proper truant officer, but it seems more in keeping 
with school work to place this duty upon the county superintendent 
or his deputy. 

fl2) This would do away with the possible "deadlocks" in 
election of teachers and other business that requires a majority 
vote. It would insure greater care on the part of the 
people in the selection of reputable citizens for membership 
apon the school board, and it is in line with the prevailing 
sentiment in favor of a longer tenure of office in school management 
and control. 

(13) It often happens that there are those elected as members 
of school boards whose greatest ambition is to secure a place 
for a daughter or a son, a sister-in-law or a brother-in-law, or a 
cousin, regardless of fitness. The temptation for "a trade" is 
too great to be resisted. "To the victor belongs the spoils" 
becomes the individual motto of too many school board members. 
'A community of interests" is established at the expense of the 
tchools. To protect the people against the evils of nepotism 
I urge upon the legislature the importance of enacting a law 
which will make it illegal for a school board member to vote 
for a blood or marital relation to teach in the public schools. 
This law should apply to every school district in the state. 

(14) Such a law would be a death blow to the chart sharks 
that go about the country seeking whom they may devour and devouring 
all they find. Business interests demand that the school 
hinds be appropriated for the general welfare. Such a law would 
do away with the expenditure of money without due consideration 
and would inaugurate a system into rural school matters

would often elect school officers, and even with a majority vote 
required to elect, there will still be cases where two or three votes 
will be sufficient to elect. It may be of interest to know that in 
many districts only the three school officers and perhaps two or 
three others attend the annual meeting.

to build better school houses. 

1 23) This recommendation simply relieves our statutes of 

h cumbersome obstacle for whose existence there can no longer 

be given any good reason. 

Such a law would make it possible for county superin- 

tendents, school board officers, and teachers in rural districts to 
get rid of ancient text books and substitute in their stead modern, 
up-to-date ones. The teachers and pupils need these new books 
as much as the farmer needs modern farming implements. As 
it is now, the text books used in the cities of Nebraska are far 

superior to those used in the rural schools. 

Many county boards will not go above the minimum 

sum in their appropriation for the county institute. This is 
false economy. This minimum amount was made when the state 
was young and many counties were unable to go above it, but 
now every interest of the general public demands a more liberal 
appropriation for the county institute and in many counties th&lt;; 

imum can and should reach $150.

Capitol, January, 2T, 190j. 

Members of the House of Representatives, Legislature o ; 

braska, Twenty-Eighth Session. 

Gentlemen : — The superintendents, principals and teachers of 
the state are practically unanimous in their desire for the passage 
of the following bills: House Roll Nos. 1. 79, 81, 99, 100, 111, 
114, 116, 117, 118, 119, 134, 143, 144, 151, 152. 153. 154, 163, 169 
and 206. These bills are all designed to improve our school 
conditions and to aid in the administration of school affairs. 
They have all been carefully drafted and are the results of actual 
experience in the administration of our schools. 

Junior Normal Schools 

K House Roll No. 100 provides for three, four or five Junior Noral 
Schools. This bill does not call for any construction of 
buildings and therefore is not affected by the Sears resolution. 
For a full explanation of the plan and purpose of these schools 
see pages 180, 181, 182, 183, 995, 1001 and 812 of the Seventeenth 
Biennial Report of this department. 

Some of the private school interests are said to be opposed to 
the Junior Normal School plan, because, forsooth, while it would 
afford a summer's term instruction to a thousand or more teacher 
in the uttermost parts of the state, if not thus provided for </seg>

from 1871 to 1903, and the decisions of the state superintendent 
on the school laws of Nebraska from 1SS1 to 1903. Almost every 
possible question that may arise under our school laws has 
been passed upon either by the supreme court or the state super 
intendent. The county superintendent is in possession of these 
decisions of the supreme court and the state superintendent. The 
county superintendent has an opportunity to investigate both 
sides of every question. He is, therefore, better prepared to pass 
intelligently and impartially upon them, and every question 
contemplated in the above resolution will be referred to thtcounty 
superintendent for adjudication. Let county superintendents 
give the public due notice of this resolution. If any ques 
tion arises on which the county superintendent may desire the 
opinion of this department we shall be pleased to give it upon 
eqttest. . 

Needed School Legislation 

Below is a brief summary of the result of the discussions of 
the county superintendents and the Educational Council, on 
the suggestions and recommendations for school legislation, 
printed in the Nebraska Teacher for January, pages 333 to 338 : 

Recommendations 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 25 
\sore adopted. 

Eo. 4 was amended by the superintendents by striking out the 
d "county" in the second line, and adding a provision aling 
the county superintendents to renew the certificates in 
force at the time of the passage of the act. The Council amended 
No. 4 to read: "Providing for a board of examiners for the examination 
and grading of all teachers' manuscript in the subjects 
required for a first grade county certificate, said board to be appointed 
by and to work under the direction of the state superintendent 
of public instruction.' 

ro. 6 was adopted by the superintendents, but amended by 
council to read : "Requiring teachers to make a Anal report 
to the county superintendent before receiving their last month's 
salary, and requiring city superintendents and principals of 
graded schools to make an annual report to the state superinten- </seg>

Et and to the county superintendent before receiving their last 
ith's salary." 

ENo. 11 was amended by the superintendents to permit the head 
lant officer to be appointed by the county school board organition. 
Where no truant officer is provided through a school 
ard organization, if the director refuses or neglects to act as 
aant officer, it shall be the duty of the county superintendent to 
point a truant officer ; and also that the director and teacher 
port delinquents only under the compulsory attendance law. 

INos. 16 and 17 were adopted by the superintendents, but not 
esented to the Council. 

INos. 18, 19, 20, 21 and 22 were adopted by the superintendents, 
it the Council made the following amendments : The seventh 
d eighth lines of No. 19 to read : "The annual meeting or board 
education in city districts shall determine that school shall 
taught in the district during the year ;" to No. 20 was added : 
Ifter each ballot the name of the one receiving the lowest numr 
of votes shall be dropped;" No. 22 was amended to permit 
e issuance of bonds in districts where there are at least eight 
ildren of school age. 

No. 24 was amended to read : "Amending sec. 3 of subdivision 
V, school laws for 1901, so as to permit counties through their 
school board organizations to provide for county uniformity of 
common school text books outside of city districts." 

INos. 26 and 27 were not acted upon, but both bodies expressed 
emselves in favor of two state normal schools located one on 
ch side of the sixth principal meridian. The superintendents 
io favored the establishment of Junior or Summer Term Noril 
schools at from three to five points in the state where public 
lool buildings may be secured for the purpose without extra 
pense to the state. 

Nos. 28, 29, 31 and 32 were adopted. The superintendents also 
adopted No. 30, but the Council amended by adding that twenty 
per cent of the total appropriation of the state should be devoted 
to an educational exhibit.

them have been read the second time and referred to the Committee

Committee on Public Schools, and George L. Day, of Superior, 
is chairman of the Senate Committee on Education. E. E. Good,

and Normal Schools, and Richard O'Neill, of Lincoln, is chairman 
of the Senate Committee. 

Lincoln, Nebraska, February 3, 1903. 

My Dear Superintendent: 

Again, — look out for forged county certificates. 

Questions for all grades of county certificates will be issued 
this month. 

E/e are preparing copy for a new edition of Special Day Pro¦ns. 
Send us suggestions, selections, extracts or clippings, 
shall include a McKinley Day. The programs will not be 
ributed before April or May. 

As soon as the legislature adjourns we shall begin preparing 
copy for the new edition of School Laws. Should we publish 
"School Law for Teachers" again? New blanks will also be 
printed. Any suggestions as to these? 

House Roll No. 134, relative to the salaries of county superintendents, 
was amended by the Committee on Public Schools, 
who struck out the $1,400 class. The bill, however, is still an 
excellent measure and will help many of the poorly paid county 
superintendents. So whether your salary is affected or not, I 
hope you will write to your senators and representatives in behalf 
of the measure. As amended it provides that "such compensation 
shall not be less than $1,200 per annum in counties having a 
school population of 4,000 or more ; and not less than $1,000 per 
annum in counties having a school population of 2,500 and less 
than 4,000 ; and not less than $800 per annum in counties having 
a school population of 1,500 and less than 2,500; and in counties 
having a school population less than 1,500 a per diem of not less 
than $4.00 or more than $5.00 for each day actually employed in </seg>

the duties of his office, but the total compensation of this class 
shall not exceed $800 per annum. The number of days neccfor 
the duties of his office shall be determined by the county 
superintendent, but the number of days so employed shall not be 
less than two times the number of districts in such county and 
one day for each precinct thereof for the examination of teachers." 

House Roll No. 115, providing for a deputy county superintendent 
in the larger counties ; House Roll No. 116, permitting 
the employment of a superintendent or principal for a term not 
in excess of three years in high school districts, and House Roll 
No. 169, providing for a force in the office of the state superintendent 
to examine the manuscript of all applicants for teachers' 
certificates in the subjects required for all grades of county certificates 
— these three have*bten indefinitely postponed. 

Bills in accordance with the recommendations on pages 991-995 
of the biennial report have been introduced and are numbered 
as follows : Recommendations Nos. 1 and 5, House Roll 
No. 81; recommendations Nos. 2 and 3, House Roll No. 11?

The Valley County School Officers and Teachers' Association

House Roll Nos. 1 and 100 and petitioning their representatives 
to use all honorable means to secure the passage of 
said bills.

School Legislation 

On pages 333 and 334 of the January issue of the Nebraska 
Teacher, and on pages 991-995 of the Seventeenth Biennial Report 
of the state superintendent, will be found a number of recommendations 
of the county superintendents, of the Educational 
Council of the N. S. T. A., and of the state superintendent, for </seg>

            <seg id="p122">

school legislation. These will be referred to by number for the 
sake of brevity and to save space. 

Recommendations Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17, 20, 
25, 31 and 32 have been killed by the legislature ; the bills embodying 
these resolutions were indefinitely postponed. 

Eecommendations Nos. 6, 9, 14, 16, 18 and 28 have been apred 
by the House and are now on their passage through the 
ite. 

Recommendation No. 8, relative to the term of county superintendents, 
Senate File No. 73, is in the hands of a Senate committee. 
House Roll No. 134 increases the salaries of county superintendents, 
and at this writing is on general file in the House. 

Jtecommendation No. 19, amending the compulsory educa:ion 
law, and other amendments to 4he same law, have been 
embodied in House Roll No. 259, which is now on general file 
in the House. 

Other bills on general file in the House are House Roll No. 
233, in line with recommendation No. 21; House Roll No 
recommendation No. 22 ; House Roll No. 205, recommendation 
Xo. 23, and other amendments; House Roll No. 1, establishing 
an additional State Normal School west of the sixth principal 
meridian ; House Roll No. 2, appropriating $75,500 for two new 
buildings, chapel and library, at Peru ; House Roll No. 163, recommendation 
No. 29. 

It may appear strange that so many excellent school measures, 
neither partisan nor mercenary in their character, were killed in 
:he cominittee of the whole. It was not on account of any particular 
opposition to them, but because few or none of the leaders 
;:i the House were interested in their passage and active and outspoken 
in their behalf. If one or two of the leaders took a dislike 
to a bill and nobody else cared very much about it, it was 
sure to be killed. This department has furnished each member 
of the legislature with a copy of the Seventeenth Biennial Report 
and with numerous circular letters relative to the desires of school 
people of the state for better laws, but this kind of work is largely 
ineffective. Legislators will not read reports and circular letters, </seg>

            <seg id="p123">

OFFICIAL CIBCCLAK8 AKD NOTICES 

and strange as it may appear, nearly as many letters have been 
received by the legislators from the school people of the state 
in opposition to the school bills as in support of them. The 
reason is simple : If a superintendent learns that a bill he 
favors is before the House there is less than one chance in ten 
that he will write a letter in its support ; if there is a bill before 
the House that he is opposed to there are about ninety-nine 
chances in one hundred that he will write a letter to every member 
of the House that he knows in opposition to it. 

Free Text Book Law 

The act of 1891, entitled "An act to provide cheaper text books, 
and for district ownership of the same," reads as follows : 

Section 1 — Purchase of Books by Board. — District school 
boards and boards of trustees of high school districts, and boards 
of education in cities of the first and second class, and in cities 
of the metropolitan class, are hereby empowered and it is made 
their duty to purchase all text books necessary for the schools oi 
such district ; and they are further authorized to enter into contract, 
as hereinafter provided, with the publishers of such books 
for a term of years, not to exceed five (5) ; Provided, That the contract 
prices of such books shall not exceed the lowest price then 
granted to any dealer, state, county, township, school district, or 
other individual or corporation in the United States, to be determined 
as hereinafter provided ; And provided further, That such 
contract shall guarantee to such districts any* further reduction 
that may be granted elsewhere during the life of such contract. 

Kec. 2. — Bond of Publisher. — Before any publisher of school 
ks shall be permitted to enter into contract with any school

fn the Fourteenth Biennial Report of the state superintendent 
public instruction to the governor of Nebraska (1895-6), Supt. 
II. R. Corbett gives the result of a special investigation of the 
results and popularity of the free text book law. I give herewith 
a few of the questions submitted bv him to the countv and citv

superintendents, principals, and country school teachers, and the 
replies received thereto. In some cases I include comments 
made by Supt. Corbett in his report. 

Is the average condition and care of books better or worse 
than it was in the same schools under individual ownership? 
Of the 164 answers received, eighty-six indicate "better," thirtyfive 
"worse" and forty-three indicate no difference. 

Does the free text book system lead to any increase in school 
enrollment? Of the 172 answers, 129 say "yes," thirty-seven "no" 
and six are doubtful. 

Does it promote regular attendance? Of the 161 answers, 
eighty-nine answer "yes," fifty-eight "no" and fourteen are 
doubtful. 

»Is there any marked decrease in the entire cost of books to the 
mmunity as a whole? Of the 168 answers, 128 are "yes," 
thirty-three "no" and seven doubtful. 

Do school boards as a rule furnish books more promptly and 
in sufficient quantities? Is the supply more full and prompt and 
satisfactory than when pupils furnished the books? Of the 176 
answers, 161 are "yes," twelve are "no" and three are doubtful. 

What means are employed for securing good care of books? 
Among the significant answers to this question are the following: 
"Regular inspections, books being inspected and their condition 
being recorded by the teacher." (This is one of the most 
effective means, and if systematically done requires but very 
little time.) "Books numbered and charged to pupils in text book 
register." "Tact and care on the part of the teacher." (This 
suggestion gives the key to the situation.) "Pupils required to 
purchase books lost or carelessly injured." (A requirement eminently 
proper under the law.) "The covering of books." (A 
fresh new paper cover at the beginning of the term will go a long 
way towards making the books uniform and attractive.) "Careful 
use of bookcases." "Care insisted upon by the school boards." 
"Talks to teachers in institutes and associations." "Circular to 
teachers." 

In conclusion, Supt. Corbett says : 

"I have taken pains in compiling the answers received to re- </seg>

port favorable and unfavorable replies with equal fairness. My 
desire has been to enable the reader of this summary to gain 
from it in brief compass an accurate idea of the esteem in which 
the law is held by the school people of the state. 

"These are its advantages, briefly stated : It is a logical sequence 
to the free school idea, diminishing still further the barrier 
between rich and poor, removing an obstacle which stands in 
the way of attendance of the very class the common schools arc 
chiefly designed to reach ; it reduces largely the cost of books 
to the community as a whole ; it enables the management of the 
school to secure a more satisfactory and seasonable supply of 
books and materials ; when properly administered, it freely permits 
the use of books which are needed for study at home and 
helps the teacher to inculcate habits of neatness and care in the 
use of books. 

"The chief objections to the system come from two sources: 
(1) From those who oppose all taxation for school purposes. 
(2) From places where carelessness in the administration of 
the law has resulted in unnecessary destruction of the books, and 
in careless habits on the part of the pupils. 

"I consider it safe to affirm that wherever proper attention 
has been paid to the administration of the law, the results have 
been highly gratifying to school authorities, teachers and patrons. 
It is furthermore safe to assume that having once come to understand 
the advantages of this logical extension of the free school 
idea, the people of Nebraska will not willingly go back to the system 
formerly in use." 

From Supt. W. R. Jackson's Report 

In the Fifteenth Biennial Report (1897-8), Supt. W. R. Jackson 
gives the result of his inquiries and observations as follows : 

The free text book law has been in operation in this state since 
1891. Of the 6,703 school districts in Nebraska, 5,775 own and 
furnish text books to the pupils free of cost. In many districts 
it is mutually agreed among the patrons of the school not to take 
advantage of the provisions of the law. While all within the district 
are satisfied with this plan, they may, of course, furnish the </seg>

            <seg id="p130">
74 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT^ REPOBT 

books individually, or the district may plan to secure books at 
contract price and sell to pupils at cost, but if anyone living 
within the district demands free text books for his children who 
attend school, the law not only "empowers" the school board to 
furnish them, but makes it "their duty to purchase all text books 
necessary for the schools of such districts." 

One of the features which commends our present law to the 
favorable consideration of the taxpayers is the provision regulating 
the cost of the books, as follows : "That the contract price 
of such books shall not exceed the lowest price then granted to 
any dealer, state, county, township, school district, or other individual 
or corporation in the United States, to be determined as 
hereinafter provided ; and provided further, that such contract 
shall guarantee to such districts any further reduction that may 
be granted elsewhere during the life of such contract." It will 
be seen by the above extract that school districts in this state, 
regardless of size or financial ability, may obtain text books on 
as favorable terms as the largest and most influential district or 
corporation in the United States. 

Another strong feature may be noted. The law does not restrict 
the district to purchasing books from one firm or company. 
This gives great latitude in the selection of books and is a very 
desirable feature. 

The law as a whole is a good one, perhaps one of the best found 
in any state, and scarcely needs any amendments. About twenty 
of the leading book companies of the United States have filed 
bonds, together with sworn statements of their lowest contract 
prices for books. Some districts have contracts with five or six 
of these companies and thus are able to select the best books put 
out by each company. 

The advantages and arguments in favor of free text books may 
be summed up in the following : 

1. They increase the school attendance. 

2. They save time in the organization of the school. 

3. They secure complete uniformity of text books within the </seg>

            <seg id="p131">
75 


4. They enable teachers to control better the organization 
and administration of the school. 

5. They spread a richer course before pupils in the lower 
grades. 

6. They will render more frequent changes possible. 

They are much cheaper to the community 

Reports having reached this office that our present free text 
book law is not giving satisfaction, it was thought expedient to 
canvass the views of the people generally throughout the state 
for the purpose of ascertaining the exact status of this matter, 
thus enabling us to recommend such measures for the consideration 
of the legislature as might be best for the educational interests 
of the state. For this purpose the following questions 
were submitted to school officers, principals and superintendents 
throughout the state. 

1. In your judgment, has this law had the effect of improving 
the school work in your community? 

2. Are the people of your community satisfied with it? 

3. Has it, in your judgment, had the effect of reducing the 
cost of school books? 

4. Would you favor a change in the law? If so, in what 
respect ? 

5. Would you favor a repeal of the law altogether and return 
to the old plan of the individual purchase ; that is, where the 
pupils purchase the books themselves? 

6. Additional remarks and suggestions. 

I have received replies from over 3,000 persons. Of this number, 
only five out of 132 town and city superintendents favor a 
repeal of the present law. But one or two county superintendents 
are opposed to the law as it stands, and a vast majority of school 
officers reporting for their districts say they are in favor of the 
present law. Eighty per cent of the school officers answer the 
first question in the affirmative ; eighty-three per cent are satisfied 
with the present conditions ; seventy-six per cent inform me 
that the present law results in a reduction of the cost of books; 
twenty-eight per cent favor some change in the law, but the </seg>

            <seg id="p132">
76 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

changes proposed are almost as numerous as the persons suggesting 
them, many suggesting points already covered by the 
law ; while eighteen per cent favor a repeal of the law altogether, 
the reason given by the major portion is "that individual ownership 
would result in better care of books." Under "additional 
remarks and suggestions," the statements made would indicate 
that in some districts too little pains is taken in the care of text 
books ; while on the whole these remarks would indicate that the 
present law is about as satisfactory as it would be possible to 
make it. 

At the end of another two years, in the Sixteenth Biennial Report 
(1899-1900), Supt. Jackson says, relative to the free text 
book law : 

The law enacted in 1891 providing that the text books for use in 
the public sch°ols of the state shall be furnished free to the pupils 
is still in force and effect. It has not been modified in any way. 

The purpose of the law is to secure to the people of each district 
the widest latitude in the management of their schools. 
The object of the law in authorizing the school districts to contract 
for the needed text books was two-fold. 1st, to insure to 
the district the right to purchase the books at the very lowest 
wholesale rates offered on such books anywhere in the United 
States, thus securing to the district the benefit of universal competition 
throughout the country, and 2nd, to protect the people 
of the district against the expense incident to too frequent 
changes. 

K Preparatory to entering into a contract under the law, the pubhers 
must first have filed with the state superintendent of public 
instruction a sworn statement of their lowest wholesale prices 
of books, and must be willing to execute a bond for the protection 
of school districts contracting for the same. By this provision of 
the law, each district secures not only the benefit of competition 
in this state, but in all other states where the said publisher's 
books are used. The protection of the people of a district against 
too frequent changes in text books is sought to be secured by </seg>

            <seg id="p133">
77 

OFFICIAL CIRCULARS AND NOTICES 

the provision in the law authorizing school boards to enter into 
contracts with publishers for their books for a term of years. 

I might add that experience has shown that teachers moving 
from one district to another frequently feel it incumbent upon 
them to discard some of the books in use for others of the same 
kind but of different authorship. This disposition often exists 
where there is a large supply of the text it is proposed to throw 
out in good condition ; and where the change is made, under such 
circumstances particularly, it results in a large expense to the 
people of the district. The correct procedure for any school 
board, in my opinion, is to exercise discriminating care in making 
its first selection of books ; being solicitous to get the best that 
the market affords at the lowest obtainable price, then to keep 
its teachers informed from year to year as to the names of the 
books selected in the different grades, so that when handing in 
their requisition to the school officer charged with keeping up 
the supplies, none but the regularly adopted books will be called 
for. Of course, this suggestion is not intended to apply where 
new studies are added to the course, or where the books in use 
need to be supplemented in the judgment of the teacher, acting 
with the board, in order to secure the best results. 

Statute, Decisions of the Supreme Court, Official Decisions 

Damage to. — If any person shall wilfully and maliciously injure 
or deface any church edifice, school house, dwelling house, 
or other building, its fixtures, or books, or appurtenances, or shall 
commit any nuisance therein, or shall purposely and maliciously 
commit any trespass upon the enclosed grounds attached thereto, 
or any fixtures placed thereon, or any enclosure or sidewalk 
about the same, such person shall be fined in any sum not exceeding 
one hundred dollars. — Section 111, Chapter XIV, Criminal 
Code, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1903. 

Must Furnish. — Subdivision 18 of the School Laws is mandatory, 
and it is not within the authority of the annual district 
meeting to vote not to furnish text books ; and under this law any 
patron of the district, by the proper legal proceedings, could compel 
the district board to furnish his children, pupils in the school. </seg>

            <seg id="p134">
78 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

the necessary text books, notwithstanding any action or failure 
to act on the part of the district meeting. Some patron of the district 
should apply to the district court in behalf of the district 
for a writ of mandamus to compel the board to furnish to the 
children of the district the necessary text books. See the case of 
Ambrose Affholder et al. v. State of Nebraska ex rel. Peter Mc- 
Mullen, 51 Neb. 91. In this case, in the district court of Burt 
county, Peter McMullen made application for a peremptory writ 
of mandamus to compel Ambrose Affholder and others constituting 
the school board of district No. 58 of said county to purchase 
and furnish to the children of school age of said district 
the necessary text books in accordance with the free text book 
law. An alternative writ was issued, and for a return thereto 
the school board interposed the defense that said act was unr 
constitutional. The writ was issued as prayed, and the school 
board appealed the case to the supreme court. The supreme court 
sustained the district court. A writ of mandamus will not issue 
where it is not within the power of the respondent lawfully to 
vomply, or where it would otherwise be unavailing. 46 Neb. 857. 

Funds for Purchase. — Text books may be paid for out^of any 
funds on hand belonging to the general fund, to the incidental 
fund, or to a fund especially provided for this purpose. 

Includes Supplies. — In passing upon the constitutionality of 
the free text book law, in discussing the word "supplies" the following 
language is used by the judge rendering the decision : 
"We do not think the term 'text books' should be given a technical 
meaning, but that it is comprehensive enough and does include 
globes, maps, charts, pens, ink, paper, etc., and all other 
apparatus and appliances which are proper to be used in the 
school in instructing the youth, and we conclude, therefore, that 
the act under consideration is not broader than its title, and the 
term 'school supplies' found in the tenth section of the act is not 
foreign to the term 'text books' found in the title of the act, but 
¦rmane to and comprehended and included within the term 
•text books.' " 

Loaning Books. — The law provides that text books shall be </seg>

            <seg id="p135">
79 


fried to pupils while pursuing a course of study in the schools, 
is the duty of the board of education to place books at the dis 
posal of pupils who need to study in the evenings. If. however, 
in the judgment of the teacher and the board, pupils of certain 
classes cannot study profitably outside of school hours, it is 
proper to place reasonable restrictions upon the use of the books 
at home by such pupils or classes. It is not within the authority 
of the school board to loan text books, which are the property 
of the district, to be used in schools held outside the district. 

' Pupils Responsible For. — Section 9, subdivision 18 of the 
School Laws, provides that all books purchased by the district 
board shall be held as the property of the district and loaned to 
pupils of the school while pursuing a course of study therein, 
free of charge ; but the district board shall hold such pupils responsible 
for any damage to, loss of, or failure to return such 
books at the time and to the person that may be designated by 
the board of such district. 

Present Status 

A bill was introduced into the legislature of 1903 to repeal the 
free text book law. After a brief discussion in a committee the 
bill was reported for indefinite postponement. Experience proves 
that, where proper care is exercised by the school board ami the 
teacher, this law is popular and satisfactory ; but it becomes a 
detriment and a nuisance whenever pupils carelessly soil, mark, 
deface, or destroy the books. See that teachers appeal to the 
pride of their pupils ; that they insist on habits of neatness and 
cleanliness ; that they make a regular inspection of books at least 
once a month — no other agency is more effective than a regular 
book inspection. Teachers should also hold pupils responsible 
for preserving and returning books in good condition, by a proper 
use of the Permanent Text Book Record. School boards should 
furnish each school room with a bookcase. We urge upon school 
officers the importance of furnishing their schools with up-todate 
text books. You should no more expect pupils and teachers 
to work with text books that are behind the times than you should 
think of throwing aside the selfbinder and checkrower to return </seg>

My Dear Superintendent: 

This department will issue questions for all grades of county 
certificates and for eighth grade examinations before the third 
Saturday in April. 

I shall publish one extra document or pamphlet this summer, 
and it will be on the subject of Consolidation of School Districts, 
Centralization of Schools, and Transportation of Pupils at Public 
Expense. Later on I shall ask you for information on this subject, 
arguments for and against, the situation in your county, 
what has been accomplished, what is contemplated, photographs, 
etc. 

The state printing board has refused to order or allow any more 
printing for this department until the new appropriation becomes 
available, in April. This will delay all blanks and supplies for 
the annual meeting, the new edition of School Laws and Special 
Day Programs. Copy for the last named is now ready, but contracts 
for the printing cannot be let until late in April. However, 
we hope to have all blanks and supplies for the annual meeting 
ready for distribution June 1 or soon thereafter. 

I hope that you will ask for a general observance of Arbor Day, 
Wednesday, April 22, in the schools of your county, the planting 
of trees, particularly to the memory of the late President Mc- 
Kinley and the late J. Sterling Morton, and a generous collection 
of pennies on Arbor Day for the fund to erect a monument to 
the memory of Mr. Morton. This cause has my hearty endorsement. 
I presume you and your teachers have received circulars 
from the Arbor Day Memorial Association, through its secretary. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

Mr. John Nordhouse, of Nebraska City. For Governor Mickey's 
Arbor Day Proclamation, see daily papers of March 20. 

Lincoln, Nebraska, March 31, 1903. 

My Dear Superintendent: 

Nearly all our important school legislation has gone glimmering. 
No important school bills have as yet been enacted into law 
in which the school people of the state generally are interested, 
with the exception of House Roll No. 100, the Junior Normal 
Scho°l bill. Three-fourths of the recommendations of the county 
superintendents, of the Educational Council and of this department 
have been indefinitely postponed by the legislature. 

House Roll No. 1, providing for an additional State Normal 
School in the central or western portion of the state of Nebraska, 
passed the House this morning on third reading, by a vote of 
74 to 14. It will go to the Senate immediately, and probably be 
read there the first time today, the second time tomorrow, and be 
discussed and acted upon in committee of the whole in the Senate 
Thursday, Friday or Saturday of this week. If it passes the Senate 
it will then go to the Governor for his signature or veto. 
The bill has been amended so as to call for an appropriation of 
only $50,000, buT the main thing now is to get it located and established. 
We can ask future legislatures for sufficient funds for 
its maintenance. The bill also calls for contributions of real 
estate, money and property from the place securing the location 
of the school. 

This is the most important school legislation asked for this 
session. If we can secure the passage of this bill it will compensate 
us for the loss of everything else. Can we not all work 
together, shoulder to shoulder, in behalf of this measure? Will 
you not, in behalf of the children of Nebraska and the public 
school interests of the state, sit down immediately and write 
the strongest personal letter possible to the senator from your 
district and any other senator with whom you may be acquainted, 
urging them to support House Roll No. 1 a"nd to vote for it? 
Some grave doubts have been expressed as to the intention of </seg>

Governor John H. Mickey in the premises. Will you not write 
him also, telling him of the importance and necessity of this 
educational institution? It is true that large amounts are being 
and may be appropriated by this legislature for the penitentiary, 
the insane asylums, the university, and for several other institutions 
and purposes, but very little has been done for educational 
interests west of the sixth principal meridian. 

Nebraska needs an additional State Normal School. 
From the Nebraska Teacher for April, 1903: 

K'he season for high school declamatory contests is just closing, 
h the exception of the state contest. The following addition 
to the rules is suggested : Selections in which murder is committed 
and where the contestants are required to act out the 
commission of the crime shall be barred. 

Arbor Day will be observed Wednesday, April 22. For Governor 
Mickey's Arbor Day proclamation see the daily papers 
of March 20. Trees should be planted to the memory of the 
late President McKinley and the late J. Sterling Morton. It is 
also to be hoped that a generous collection of pennies will be taken 
up for the fund to erect a monument to the memory of Mr. Morton. 
This matter is in charge of the Arbor Day Memorial Association, 
the secretary of which is Mt^ John Nordhouse, of Nebraska 
City.

Lincoln, Nebraska, April 20, 1903. 

To the County Superintendents in the Territory of the Junior 

Normal Schools : 

Ily Dear Superintendents : — House Roll No. 100 establishes 
ior Normal Schools at Alliance, McCook and Valentine, and 
lot more than two other places to be determined by the state 
erintendent. Provided, That at each of these places the pubschool 
buildings, text books and apparatus of the respective 
ool districts be placed at the service of the state under the 
isdiction of the state superintendent. I have located the two 
itional schools at Holdrege and North Platte. These schools 
1 all begin June 8 and continue ten weeks, except Valentine, 
ich will open June 15 for a ten weeks' term. The conductors 
1 be the local city superintendents, with the exception of the 
: at North Platte, where Supt. W. H. Gardner, of Auburn, will 
the conductor. 

The appropriation by the state for these five schools for the 
biennium is but $12,000; in other words, $1,200 for each school 
each year. This is the maximum amount that may be used by 
one of these schools one year. However, where there are counties 
in the territory of any of the Junior Normal Schools that desire 
to be incorporated with it under the union normal institute law 
and thus by a merging of state and county funds add to the 
efficiency of the school, in faculty, lecture course, and such advantages 
and opportunities, we shall be pleased to comply with </seg>

            <seg id="p145">
87 

OFFICIAL CIRCCLAR8 AND NOTICES 

such requests, as we have already done at Holdrepe and North 
Platte. We shall make each school the best possible with thtfunds 
at our command. 

The last week of the Junior Normal School will be the Union 
Normal Institute for those counties incorporated under this 
plan, and while attendance at such institute is as compulsory 
as attendance at a home institute, I would suggest a three to six 
days' professional institute in each county, except the county in 
which the Junior Normal school is located. This would accommodate 
those who have a reasonable excuse for non-attendanc* 
at the Junior Normal School and the Union Normal Institute. 
An institute fee should be charged those in attendance at the home 
institute. Some of the instructors whose terms would close with 
the Junior Normal School might be secured for the home institute 
at reasonable terms. As a matter of simple justice and as bm 
encouragement to professional training, I most heartily recommend 
that county superintendents excuse those teachers who 
attend the full term or nearlyso of the Junior Normal School 
from the home institute, if they desire to be excused. 

The attendance at these schools depends almost entirely upon 
the attitude of the county superintendents in such territory. The 
teachers in these counties need the training which these schools 
will offer. Hence, the duty of the county superintendents in their 
attitude toward these schools is plain. 

These Junior Normal Schools will be absolutely free to all 
teachers and prospective teachers of Nebraska. Not even an 
institute fee can be charged. Attendants must be "fourteen years 
of age, of good moral character, and of good physical health," 
who "have a fair knowledge of the common school branches 
such as may be obtained in the country schools or in the lower 
eight grades of well organized city schools." Primary methods 
will be taught and a model school conducted at each point. 

The railroads make a rate of a fare and one-third for the round 
trip. Special arrangements for board and lodging at reasonable 
rates should be made at each of these schools. McCook figures 
from $3.00 to $3.50 per week for board and lodging. So does </seg>

            <seg id="p146">
88 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S KFPORT 

Valentine. Alliance, Holdrege and North Platte should do as 
well. The average cost to each teacher for the full term of ten 
weeks, including board, lodging, railroad fare, etc., need not ex? 

ceed $45.00. 

The question has been raised relative to counties using the 

institute funds to pay the transportation expenses of their teachers 
to the Junior Normal Schools. I regret that the bill giving 
such authority failed to become a law. Under the existing statute 
and the ruling of the attorney general relative to this question 
in connection with the State Normal School at Peru, I am com- 

pelled to say that such use of funds would be illegal. 
None of the state appropriation can be used for a lecture course. 

Such expense must be paid out of the county funds and by local 
patronage. If we have a lecture course it should be made free 
to teachers. It would seem to me that a small pro rata fund from 
each county for its teachers and the local patronage would give 

us something about as follows for the lecture course : 

I shall leave the price of single and season tickets for the public 

to the local manager at each place. 

"The studies pursued at these Junior Normal Schools shall be 

a part of the regularly prescribed course of the State Normal 
School or Schools, and students in regular attendance and pursuing 
and completing these studies in a satisfactory manner shall be 
granted a certificate to that effect, signed by the conductor of 
the Junior Normal School and countersigned by the state superintendent, 
which certificate shall entitle th£ holder to proper 
credit at the state normal school or schools. — Section 4 of House

Lincoln, Nebraska, May 15, 1903. 

To the Principals and Instructors of the Junior Normal Schools : 

I have already mailed you a bulletin of the Junior Normal 
Schools. I enclose a tentative program to show the assignment 
of work which will be expected of each of you. So far as possible, 
from the information at my command, by correspondence with 
all of you and by conference in the office and elsewhere with most </seg>

            <seg id="p150">

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S BKPOBT 

fyou, I have endeavored to give each instructor his highest prerence 
of subjects to be taught. It has been impossible to do this 
for any one of you in all the work assigned. I hope you will 
find it satisfactory. If you feel that any of the work is such that 
you cannot do yourself and your class justice in teaching it, 
notify the principal of the school in which you are to teach at 
once, naming some other subjects you would be willing to teach 
in its stead. However, it will expedite the work of the principal 
for you to ask for a change only when it is necessary for the 
success of your work. 

rf you have read the bulletin, we believe the work as named 
the program is self-explanatory as to scope in most cases. 
"Pedagogy" the work should be based on "The Method of 
the Recitation" by McMurry, one of the books for the reading circle 
course for the ensuing year. Those who enter this class 
should have the text in hand. One book will accommodate two 
teachers where the expense makes it necessary. New reading 
circle circulars will be printed next week ; read them. In "School 
Management" the work will be based on "Turning points in 
Teaching," "Jean Mitchell's School," or "White's School Management." 


K look- Keeping and Physiology," "School Management and 
of Study," "Mental Arithmetic and School Laws," "Draw- 
Penmanship," as listed in the program, it is the plan to 
have the first named subject run the first half of the term and the 
second subject the last half of the term. 

Kn the three model school periods given in the program it has 
n found from experience in conducting model schools in the 
Union Normal Institutes that the following plan is an excellent 
one : 

Program of Model School 

3:00 to 8:10 Music. 
3:10 to 8:25 Story. 

to 8:40 Reading, 1st grade. 
3 :40 to 9 :00 Reading, 2nd grade. 
9:00 to 9:20 Nature Study. </seg>

            <seg id="p151">
91 

OFFICIAL CIRCULARS AND NOTICES 

9 :20 to 9 :40 Language. 

0:40 to 10:00 Number. 

The work of the first period is given in the second period 
during the second week, and in the third period during the thirl 
week, thus revolving the program. Students observing om 
iod receive some idea of each subject. 

The art exhibit will be in charge of the conductor of the model 
school at each place. 

Ehe chapel and chorus period should be devoted to special 
sic by the chorus class or an address by an instructor two i 
i week, and three days each week should be given to the 
rus class for rehearsal after a song by the entire school and 
ouncements by the principal and instructors. 

The principal of each school, as soon as he hears from each of 
his instructors and secures a satisfactory assignment of work, 
should have a sufficient number of daily programs of the work 
in his school printed and sent to the county superintendents in 
the territory of his school for distribution among their teachers. 
This will expedite the organization of classes when the school 
opens. Recitations should be running in full blast the second 
day of the term. 

E r numerous changes in the program seem necessary and unidable, 
I hope the principal will communicate with me before 
iting his revised program. 

For further information relative to this work, instructors and 
county superintendents should address the Principal of the schooi 
in which they are interested.

school houses in your county a copy of School Buildings and 
Grounds in Nebraska and another of Rural School House Plans 
and Specifications. We have on hand several hundred copies 
of each of these publications. 

County superintendents interested in the Junior Normal Schools 
should not make any purchase of music books for the use of their 
teachers in attendance at the Junior Normals or Union Normal 
Institutes, as we have made arrangements for every teacher 
in attendance to have the free use of a copy of Uncle Sam's Song 
Book during the session. 

I The attorney general has ruled, as House Roll No. 134 relative 
the salaries of county superintendents goes into effect July 
md at the same time repeals former statutory provisions fixing 
the salaries of county superintendents, that from July 9, 1903, 
House Roll No. 134 will become operative, and that from that 
date the compensation of county superintendents should be the 
compensation authorized by the new law. 

I believe county superintendents should establish and maintain 
a reasonable standard of requirements for certificates without 
regard to the supply of and demand for teachers. Last year some 
county superintendents in Nebraska licensed just enough persons 
to supply all the schools in their respective counties without regard 
to qualifications. This I now believe to have been a mistake. 
Better shorten the terms or temporarily close down schools 
than license utterly incompetent, unqualified persons who will 
undoubtedly fail in management, instruction and discipline, and 
who should themselves be "kept" in school instead of "keeping" 
school. r

a package or packages containing your annual supply of blanks 
and blank books. Kindly examine them as soon as received

This department will use all old blanks No. 2, "Annual Report 
of the Director," on hand and has had many thousand new ones 
printed for this year and next year. The new ones have been 
made to conform to the compulsory attendance law as amended, 
so that items No. 2 and No. 3 read : Number of children . . . 

between 7 and 15 years of age." The blanks used this year should 
be made to conform with the old law. Item No. 20 on new blanks 
was placed there by request. Item 3 of blanks Nos. 6 and 7, for 
next year's use, should read : "Number of months children must 
attend school under compulsory education law (two-thirds of 
No. 1, but not less than 12 weeks)." See House Roll No. 259 
All old blanks on hand should therefore be changed before send

Lincoln, June 1, 1903- 

Members of Nebraska School District Boards : 

Gentlemen : — This department desires to call your special attention 
to a number of questions of importance relative to th^ 
annual school district meeting and the school work during thr 
ensuing year. 

Communications on Legal Questions 

The following resolution was passed at the last session of the 
Nebraska State Teachers' Association. 

"Whereas, It has been the custom of a great number of teachers, 
patrons and school officers throughout the state to write 
the state superintendent for a decision on legal questions before 
consulting the county superintendent for his decision ; and 

"Whereas, The state department often finds it difficult to pass 
intelligently upon these questions when only one side to a controversy 
has been heard ; therefore be it

officers to discharge their respective duties in an impartial manner, 
all questions of this nature be referred to the county super- 

!n accordance with these resolutions, whenever a person writes 
this department asking for some decision, he is notified by 
;tal card that his letter has been referred to his county superjndent, 
who is in possession of the decisions of this office 
ich enable him to answer almost every possible question 
t may arise. When the letter is sent to the county superindent, 
a card is enclosed asking the superintendent to give the 
:losed letter his personal and immediate attention, and advishim 
that should any case arise on which he desired the opinion 
this department it would be gladly given him upon request. 

Care of Property 

IFhe abuse of school property in many districts of Nebraska 
little short of criminal. We urge school officers to exact of 
chers and pupils a better care of text books, supplies, appara&gt; 
and all school property. The board should authorize the 
cher to impose a reasonable fine on any pupil who carelessly 
Is, marks, defaces or destroys any school property whatsoever, 
i until such pupil pays said fine, after three days of grace, 
should be suspended from the school. A regular inspection 
books and school property, at least once a month, by the 
.cher and director, is the remedy we suggest for this evil. We 
ve all the law necessary on this question if it be enforced in 
: proper manner. Section 9, subdivision XVIII, school laws 
1903, contains this proviso: "School district boards shall 
Id such pupils responsible for any damage to, loss of, or fail; 
to return such books at the time and to the person that may 
designated by the board of such district." In extreme cases 
ply section 111, chapter XIV, Criminal Code, Compiled 
itutes of Nebraska for 1001 : 

"If any person shall wilfully and maliciously injure or deface 
any church edifice, school house, dwelling house, or other building, 
its fixtures, books, or appurtenances, or shall commit any 
nuisance therein, or shall purposely or maliciously commit any </seg>

            <seg id="p155">
95 


trespass upon the enclosed grounds attached thereto, or any fixture 
placed thereon, or any enclosure or sidewalk about the 
same, such person shall be fined in any sum not exceeding one 
hundred dollars." 

Books for School Libraries 

The Reading Circle Board of the Nebraska State Teachers' 
Association approved a number of lists of books submitted by 
publishing houses for use as school libraries, and the attention 
of superintendents, principals, teachers and school boards is called 
to these lists and the prices for which the books may be obtained. 
ihe books in the lists were all carefully considered before the 
sts were approved. 

The books were selected to meet the wants of the respective 
grades. Just what grade a book will best serve is often a problem 
which puzzles the teacher. 

The teachers and school officers may secure lists of these books 
by addressing their county superintendents or the leading book 
companies. Books will be sent in a single parcel, transportation 
prepaid by the publishers, to any teacher or school officer in Nebraska 
on receipt of the money for the books ordered. A $5 
library, a $10 library or a $25 library may at once be secured. 
t:ording to the funds at command. A library being among the 
cessary school supplies, the state superintendent has ruled that 
books for a library may be purchased out of school district money 
the same as any other books. 

A graded "List of Books for School Libraries," published by 

t Nebraska Public Library Commission, has been sent to 
nty superintendents for distribution to the teachers undei 
meir jurisdiction. Any teacher who has failed to receive a 
copy of this list should apply to the county superintendent. For 
information relative to a free library, write Miss Edna D. Bullock, 
etary Nebraska Public Library Commission, Lincoln. 

Let us begin a campaign for the establishment of at least a 
$5 library in every country school of this ereat state. Here is 
an opportunity to do great good for the country school children. </seg>

OTATB SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

Consolidation of Districts 

During the past biennium this department has been waging a 
campaign in favor of better schools for the rural districts. This 
we believe will be best accomplished by consolidation of school 
districts, centralization of schools, and transportation of pupils 
at public expense. Arguments in favor of this plan were given 
you in the circular issued two years ago to School District Boards. 
Last year this department issued a publication entitled "School 
Buildings and Grounds in Nebraska," and also a reprint of a portion 
of it entitled "Rural School House Plans and Specifications.'' 
The former publication gives in detail the plan of consolidation 
of schools and an account of its successful operation in some of 
the rural districts of Ohio. The consolidation of districts makes 
possible better rural school houses, and the reprint gives up-todate 
plans for such in detail. I trust you will ask your county 
superintendent for copies of these publications and make a study 
of the plans therein contained. 

School Board Organizations 

The school district boards in some twenty or more counties 
of the state have effected county organizations under the provisions 
of section 3, subdivision V, of the School Laws. It is 
as necessary now to have school officers' associations as to have 
teachers' associations. 

The school laws of Nebraska give the school boards of a county 
the right to adopt a course of study with the consent and ad.vice 
of the county superintendent, and they also make it the duty 
of each district board, or of a representative, to attend all meetings 
called by the county superintendent for the purpose of 
adopting or revising the course of study and making necessary 
rules and regulations. We hope more of the county superintendents 
of the state will organize their school boards as soon as 
possible under the provisions of this law. In one county the 
boards have organized with monthly meetings held in different 
parts of the county on different Saturdays of the month, and they 
have elected one truant officer to serve all the school district* 
m the county under the compulsory attendance law. In other </seg>

counties text books have been selected, and but two or three 
books in each branch have been named. For instance, in geography, 
the selections were Natural, Frye and Swinton, Swinton 
being placed in the list because a majority of the rural schools 
now use that text, and changes may be made gradually at the 
close of the term or when the books are badly worn, for one of the 
other more highly favored texts. Advisability of uniformity of 
text books for a county may be an open question, but there is no 
doubt that if uniformity is a good thing, progress toward it 
should be gradual, and the districts should be allowed a year or 
two to exchange the books now in use to the one adopted or recommended 
by the association of school boards or its committee. 

Free High School Attendance 

tThe supreme court has handed down a decision in the Cass 
inty case relative to the free high school attendance act. The 
syllabus of the opinion is as follows : 

"1. Chapter 63 of the laws of 1901, commonly known as the 
Adjunct School District Act (school laws subdivision VI, sections 
5-8), provides no method for submitting the question or creating 
an adjunct district a second time, and no officer or person is 
thereby granted authority to submit the question or give notice 
thereof. 

K2. To create an adjunct school district it requires the conted 
action of all the common school districts embraced therein. 
And the question must be submitted to, and voted on, by all 
of such districts. 

K"3. Where the question was submitted to only a part of 
ch school districts, and in many of the districts embraced in 
the proposed adjunct district no vote was taken on the proposition, 
the election is void and no adjunct district is created thereby. 

"4. In such a case a writ of mandamus to compel the county 
board to levy a tax to carry on the business of an adjunct school 
district must be denied." 

According to No. 1 above, Douglas county, where there 
more votes for than against the adjunct district proposition 
in 1901, is the only county in which the proposition was legally </seg>

            <seg id="p160">
98 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

submitted, and according to Nos. 2 and 3 the adjunct district of 
Douglas county is void. According to the entire decision the law 
is now dead because the proposition cannot be legally submitted 
the second time or after the annual meeting in 1901. A request 
for a rehearing may be filed with the supreme court within forty 
days, but at this writing I do not know whether or not such a 
motion will be made. 

Teachers' Qualifications and Teachers' Salaries 

No man of prominence has emphasized the value of normal instruction 
with better logic than the late J. Sterling Morton : 

"We demand for Nebraska educated educators. We demand 
professionally trained teachers, men and women of irreproachable 
character and well-tested abilities. We demand from our 
legislature laws raising the standard of the profession and exalting 
the office of teacher. As the doctor of medicine or the 
practitioner at law is only admitted within the pale of his calling 
ton the production of his parchment or certificates, so the apcant 
for the position of instructor in our primary and other 
schools should be required by law to first produce his diploma, 
his authority to teach, from the normal schools. 

"We call no uneducated quack or charlatan to perform surgery 
upon the bodies of oxxjr children lest they may be deformed, 
crippled and maimed physically all their lives. Let us take equal 
care that we intrust the development of the mental faculties to 
skilled instructors of magnanimous character that the mentalities 
of our children may not be mutilated, deformed and crippled 
to halt and limp through all the centuries of their never-ending 
lives. The deformed body will die, and be forever put out of sight 
under the ground, but a mind made monstrous by bad teaching 
dies not, but stalks forever among the ages, an immortal mockery 
of the divine image." 

The teachers of Nebraska have the best opportunity this year 
for professional training ever offered them. Junior Normal 
Schools have been established at Alliance, Holdrege, McCook, 
North Platte and Valentine. These are ten weeks' summer 
schools conducted by this department with state funds and are 
absolutely free to all teachers and prospective teachers of Ne- </seg>

braska. Some county superintendents in the territory tributary 
to these schools are advising teachers and school boards to make 
their contracts before these schools open, with the proviso in the 
contracts that teachers attend the Junior Normal School for the 
full term of ten weeks, or nearly so. I favor such a stipulation 
in the teacher's contract, provided school officers will pay a salary 
commensurate with such preparation. I believe teachers stand 
ready to meet such terms when there is a tenure of office and 
salary guaranteed which will warrant such an expense and such 
preparation on their part. 

In addition to these summer schools conducted by the state 
and for the state, summer schools will be conducted in connection 
with the University of Nebraska, at Lincoln, the State 
Normal School at Peru, the Nebraska Wesleyan University at 
University Place, Fremont Normal College at Fremont, 
braska Normal College at Wayne, and a number of other bu- 1 
and normal schools. A few county superintendents will conduct 
summer schools for five or six weeks. 

Every teacher who attends one of these summer schools for 
the full term will be worth from five to ten dollars per. month 
more to her school. I urge upon school officers, then, only 
simple justice when I say that they should pay higher salaries 
to those teachers who thus prepare for their wark than to the 
indifferent teachers who do not make such preparation. There 
is no way to have better schools unless we have better teachers. 
Let teachers prepare for their work ; let school officers pay the 
highest wages the funds of the district will permit for the best 
qualified teachers available. In this way and this way only 
can we exalt our schools.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S BEPORT 

E:w editions of Special Day Programs and the State Course 
tudy will be distributed to the teachers of Nebraska during 
summer at the county institutes, union normal institutes 
junior normal schools. The former publication will be en- 
Y new, while the latter is almost entirely unchanged. 

A teacher cannot be compelled to take an examination in the 
elements of agriculture before July 1, 1903. All certificates 
granted before July 1, 1903, will be valid for the full life of the 
certificate. All applicants for certificates after July 1, 1903, 
will be required to pass examination in the elements of agriculture. 


A Junior Normal School Bulletin, giving complete information 
relative to these schools, was issued by this department May 
i4. Write to any county superintendent in the territory of these 
schools for a copy of the bulletin. The schools at Alliance, 
Holdrege, McCook and North Platte begin June 8, and the one 
at Valentine begins June 15. They continue ten weeks. 

Blanks for Graded School Reports have been sent to every 
village principal and city superintendent in the state. We trust 
that each one will take special pains at the close of this school 
year to see that this blank is properly filled out and returned to 
this department. Promptness in this matter will expedite the 
compilation of reports in this office and will save principals and 
superintendents annoyance in the fall at the beginning of the 
new year's work. 

E^t the dedication ceremonies of the Louisiana Purchase Exition 
at St. Louis, April 30, an immense audience of 40,000 
iple sang the first verse of America and practically broke down 
the second verse. They did not know the words. Every pupil 
the public schools of Nebraska should know the words of 
four verses of America as well as they know their multipliion 
table, or better.

rfhis department is in receipt of 300 or more of the reports 
the 450 graded schools in Nebraska. We hope there will 
less than 100 to call for in September. 

I The next state examination for professional life certificates 
ill be held August 6, 7 and 8 at Lincoln, Beatrice, Norfolk,

I Three publications of this department, — Special Day Programs,

I for the two ensuing school years, we are distributing to the 
iunty superintendents as rapidly as they are received from 
e printers. They will all be shipped out soon after the aparance 
of this announcement. The Course of Study is a reint 
of the edition of 1901 with the exception of the Elements 
Agriculture which has been revised by Mr. G. F. Warren, now 
Cornell University, Ithaca, New York. Teachers of Nebraska 
ill receive copies of these publications from their county supertendents, 
except in the cities of Omaha, Lincoln, South Omaha, 
astings, Kearney, Fremont, Beatrice, Grand Island and Neaska 
City. Teachers in these cities will be supplied in the fall

The Junior Normal Schools opened at Alliance, Holdrege, 
McCook and North Platte on June 8, and at Valentine on June 
15, with an attendance which is highly gratifying to this department 
and to all interested in the professional training of teachers. 
The enrollment in one of the schools has already reached the 
200 mark, while some of the others are crowding that number 
closely. The instructors are giving their best efforts to these 
schools and the teachers in attendance are earnest and enthusiastic.

been provided for each place, which, with the concerts to be given 
by the chorus classes, will accord a rare treat for the teachers. 
From The Nebraska Teacher for September, 1903 : 

The members of the Reading Circle Board hope that a larger 
number of the city teachers will take up the work of the Nebraska 
State Teachers' Reading Circle this year than ever before. They 
will find all three of the books wonderfully adapted to graded 
school work. 

An examination in the Elements of Agriculture, including a fair 
knowledge of the structure and habits of the common plants, 
insects, birds and quadrupeds, is now a requirement for first and 
second grade certificates. I believe that teachers in the city as 
well as those in the country should have a knowledge of this 
subject and that it should be made a requirement for teachers' 
city certificates as well as for teachers' county certificates. 

Nearly 350 of the 450 graded schools of the state have sent 
in their reports for the past school year. During the current 
month we will request the principals of the 100 or more schools 
that have not yet reported to do so. We are well aware of the 
fact that in a few cases this will be impossible, as there are some 
principals in Nebraska who fail to leave any record of their 
work either in the form of statistics or in mental or moral impressions 
upon their pupils. From a majority of the 100, however, 
we hope to hear before the close of September. Do not confuse 
this report for the past year with the blank for the data 
for the Educational Directory for the ensuing school year. 

Every teacher in the public schools of Nebraska should be 
supplied with Special Day Programs, School Law for Teachers 
and the State Course of Study, all for the calendar years of 1903 
and 1904 and all published this summer by this department. 
They have been sent to the county superintendents in sufficient 
quantity to supply all the teachers of the state except those in 
the cities of Omaha, South Omaha, Lincoln, Beatrice, Fremont, 
Hastings, Grand Island, Kearney and Nebraska City, who will 
be supplied through their city superintendents from this office.

at Ord, says : "A third objection (to scientific temperance instruction) 
is to the use of charts in common schools which show 
morbid physiological conditions resulting from the use of alcohol. 
This objection is absolutely without foundation, since the Department 
of Scientific Temperance Instruction recommends no charts 
whatever. It would be glad to do so, but up to this time nothing 
of the kind that is either suitable or accurate has been brought to 
its attention. There are so many difficulties in the way or representing 
pictorially the effects of alcohol on any of the tissue* 
of the body. Black and white drawings are out of the question, 
and if colors are used they can show. only the condition of an 
organ as it appears at a single moment ; whereas, in reality, its 
appearance is almost continuously changing, to a certain degree. 
Furthermore, alcohol affects different people in different way?. 
In some persons one organ or set of organs suffers severely, while 
others may escape unharmed. In other cases a totally different 
set of organs is attacked." 

Lincoln, Nebraska, September 7, 1903. 

My Dear Superintendent, or Principal: 

Congratulations 

I Permit me to congratulate you on the auspicious conditions 
school affairs now prevailing in Nebraska. During the tamer 
just ended more teachers have taken professional training 
an ever before. These teachers return to their schools at ineased 
salaries. We had the largest delegation at the N. E. A. 
er in attendance from this state, the Denver meeting alone 
cepted. These teachers come back to their schools with a 
der view, a greater interest in their profession and a deeper 
ve of their country. The School of Superintendence at Omaha, 
riginated, planned and conducted" by Superintendent Pearse, 
irks an epoch in school supervision. It was an inspiration to 
Dre than one hundred superintendents and principals o 
aska, who will take up their work with greater skill, happier 
arts and a stronger faith in themselves, their teachers, their 
pils and humanity. Therefore, I am confident that the ensu- </seg>

8TATK SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

ing school year promises the greatest success of any in the history 
of our beloved commonwealth. 

Attitude Toward Predecessor 

The attitude of a superintendent or principal toward his predecessor 
is a question of great importance. When taking charge 
of a new school it is better to be an evolutionist than a revolutionist. 
Make changes in rules and regulations and the course 
of study only after careful consideration and investigation. Do 
not criticise the work of your predecessor. Speak well of him and 
his work, or say nothing. 

Your Successor 

IVhen you leave a place be content to let your successor do 
his judgment deems best without any dictation from you. 
lie asks for your assistance, lend a hand. But remember, if 
makes a success of the school he must do it on his own plans, 
: yours. If he takes down your idols and breaks them into a 
iusand pieces, even when you are in hearing distance of his 
timer, for the sake of the school bid him God-speed on his plans, 
u have enough to keep you busy and interested in your own 

Board of Education 

You must have the support of your board of education if you 
are to succeed. Boards of education are, as a rule, composed of 
reasonable men. If you approach them in a frank, common-sense^ 
manner, they will meet you more than half way and will stand 
by you when the test comes. However, do not be discouraged 
if you cannot always have your own way. Sometimes the board's 
judgment is better than yours. 

Support, Criticism and Praise of Teachers 

Be firm in your support of your teachers. As long as a teacher 
is in your faculty give her your unqualified support. If she is 
not deserving of this, you should be brave enough to ask for her 
resignation. Be careful of your criticisms. Be wise in your suggestions. 
Do not forget to commend the good work of your 
teachers. Let them know you appreciate honest effort. You can 
find something worthy of praise even in the average teacher. 
Judicious praise of a teacher is as conducive to a successful </seg>

school as proper criticism. Make the burden of the teacher 
lighter and the school better by a word of praise. 

Relation to Pupils 

Among the forces that make or destroy a superintendent or 
principal is the general attitude of the pupils toward him. He 
must command their respect and win their confidence. No where 
is it truer and surer than in our dealings with pupils that a 
measure to others it will be measured to us again : we get from 
pupils just what we give, — suspicion for suspicion, ill will for ill 
will, hate for hate, and likewise confidence for confidence, friendship 
for friendship, love for love, and may I add, obedience and 
respect for fair, unwavering discipline. 

Co-operation of the Home 

It would avoid much trouble and irritation if the school would 
consult with the home more than it does on questions of discipline, 
home study, attendance, punctuality, party going and party 
giving, etc. A regulation harmless and proper in itself might be 
enforced in such a way as to render it exceedingly obnoxious and 
almost unendurable to parents and pupils. Reason with the par«nts 
if they are reasonable, and parents usually are when the 
facts are fairly stated and they see that some action is neco 
for the good of their own children. The school should not be 
arbitrary or dictatorial. Parents have rights and are and should 
be the proper guardians of their children and responsible for their 
acts in school and out. Many parents would prefer to punish 
their children themselves for misconduct in school and would 
do so more severely than the teacher, if applied to in the proper 
spirit. How to secure the proper co-operation of the home is a 
problem, the solution of which demands the best efforts of the 
superintendent or principal and his teachers. 

Rhetoricals or Athletics ? 

While some of the schools may have a place for both rhetoricals 
and athletics. I am of the opinion that in a majority of the 
schools rhetoricals should be given the greater emphasis. There 
is a discipline and training in a good, clean game of football or 
basketball, and the various contests in our field meets. But it is </seg>

            <seg id="p170">
106 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

a fact that the athletic enthusiast is not, as a rule, the best student. 
It is a physical impossibility for him to be the best student. 
The mission of the school is to train for citizenship. Rhetorical 
exercises give opportunity for general development, discipline 
and culture. They promote a toleration of the opinions 
of others, and furnish models for correct speech in written and 
spoken forms. They call into use all the pupil has gained in 
every other field of his work. They are the gauge of his gain and 
growth. They teach the pupil how to use for a definite end the 
resources acquired in his general course of study. As a means of 
right application of knowledge and mental power there must bo 
an inspiring, invigorating force to help the pupil to be at his best 
and to do his best as declaimer, essayist, orator, debater. The 
high school literary society furnishes the field. Here is an opportunity 
for the essay, declamation, society paper, debate, impromptu 
speech, oration, critic's report. It is the only place for our high, 
school boys and girls to receive special and comprehensive drill 
in parliamentary tactics. Every American boy and girl needs this 
training. The duties of American citizenship demand it. The 
man or woman who can arise in a public gathering and combat 
another's statements, who can build up an argument in behalf 
of a cause, strongly, logically and effectively, who can think 
clearly and easily while on his feet, who can be depended upon 
not only to defend the right but to assail the wrong, who can 
fight for the faith that is in him, is not only a power for good in 
the community, but he may shape that community's destiny ; 
he may become and remain a leader in whatever profession he 
may choose to enter. I desire to offer this kindly warning : That 
you do not permit a few talented students to monopolize this 
very valuable and important part of the education and training 
of an American citizen, — debating. This is the charge frequently 
brought against athletics, particularly baseball, football and basketball, 
and also against oratorical and declamatory contests: 
That a few only take part, and they alone derive the benefit. In 
my opinion debates should not be left entirely to societies that 
meet in the evening, but should be class room exercises held </seg>

once or twice a week with several assigned speakers on each 
side, and following them the subject should be generally and 
extemporaneously discussed by the members of the class or section. 
Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler, now president of Columbia 
University, has proposed the following five tests of education, 
in the broadest sense of the term : 

1. Correctness and precision in the use of the mother toneue 

'_'. Those refined and gentle manners which are the expression 
of fixed habits of thought and of action. 

3. Power and habit of reflection. 

4. The power of intellectual growth. 

5. Efficiency, the power to do. 

fThe arrangement is Dr. Butler's, and you will notice, please, 
at he names as the first test of education, "Correctness and 
precision in the use of the mother tongue." 

Course of Study. 

For schools having three teachers a one-year high school 
course is all that should be attempted ; four to six teachers, a 
two-year course ; six to eleven teachers, a three-year course ; 
eleven or more teachers, a four-year course. These recommendations 
are based upon the Nebraska High School Manual issued 
jointly by the University of Nebraska and the state department 
of public instruction. Inspector Crabtree in his report of December, 
1900, said : 

"The strong desire of high schools to affiliate closely with the 
university, while on the whole beneficial, has produced an unfortunate 
tendency among the smaller schools to carry heavier 
courses of study than is consistent with the size of the town. 
This gives overcrowded programs and overworked teachers. It 
gives a top-heavy course of study. It means that if the high 
school work is well done the work of the grades is neglected. Still 
worse, it means a reaction in the school sentiment of the com- 

munity in a few years which will place the standard as mucd 

» 

too low as it is now too high." 

Eighth Grade to Ninth 

Promotion from the eighth grade to the high school should be </seg>

            <seg id="p172">
108 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

a clearly defined step. Pupils are ofter permitted to slide along 
from year to year through the eight grades, but in the eighth 
grade, where in a well graded school all common school subjects 
are completed, there should be called a "halt." I believe that 
no other one thing that is possible and practicable would do as 
much for the public schools of Nebraska as to have it well understood 
that the eighth grade is not necessarily the eighth year, 
a division of the course to be completed in a term of nine months, 
nor that it is a year of preparation for the high school. (Let us 
drop this idea of preparation for something else.) But let us have 
it thoroughly understood that the eighth grade is the place for the 
satisfactory, intelligent completion of all common school subjects, 
and that it is no disgrace for a pupil to remain there two years. 
I believe that no other one thing would raise the standard of our 
high school work so rapidly and so thoroughly as to keep about 
sixty per cent of our pupils in the eighth grade for two years. 

Review the Common Branches 

I he benefit to pupils of a thorough review of the common 
iches during their higher course cannot be too strongly emiized. 
Especially is this true of reading, spelling, letter writarithmetic, 
geography of the United States and her possess, 
United States history, English grammar and composition, 
subject of letter writing is the most generally practiced 
practically considered, the most important of all kinds of 
position. It is indispensable in business. To be able to write 
&gt;od letter is greatly to a person's advantage in any occupa. 
Many excellent situations are obtained by teachers, clerks 
others, on account of this ability ; and quite as many are lost 
aigh the want of it. 

Free High School Attendance 

The Free High School Attendance Act, commonly known as 
the Adjunct District Proposition, was declared unconstitutional 
by the supreme court of Nebraska. Non-resident pupils in attendance 
at your high school should be received upon whatever 
terms your board of education may determine to be fair and just. 
I hope that the desire of the pupils in our rural districts for </seg>

            <seg id="p173">

OFFICIAL CIRCULARS AND NOTICES 

high school education is so earnest and sincere that they wiii 
overcome all obstacles, financial and otherwise, in the way of receiving 
this higher education, and that the non-resident attendance 
at pur high schools will show no decrease for the ensuing 
year. The enclosed copy of a circular letter to members 
of Nebraska school district boards, dated June 1, 1903, contains 
mention of the decision of the supreme court relative to the free 
high school attendance act. I ask your careful perusal of the 
syllabus of the opinion therein given, and I believe you will find 
the other subjects in the school board circular letter of interest 
also. 

Reading Circle Work 

tThe Nebraska Teachers' Reading Circle Board hopes that the 
chers in the cities and villages of the state will pursue the 
work of the course for 1903-1904, either with the teachers of the 
county or in their own local circles. I enclose herewith a circular 
of this branch of professional study and preparation. The books 
required for the current school year are as valuable to the teachers 
in the graded schools as to those in the rural districts. 

Association of Superintendents and Principals 

The October meeting of the superintendents and principals' 
section of the N. S. T. A. grows annually in attendance and interest. 
An excellent program is in course of preparation. For 
those to whom this circular letter is addressed this section is the 
most important of the many in the State Teachers' Association. 
The meeting this year will be held in Lincoln, Thursday, Friday 
and Saturday, October 22, 23 and 24, and I hope you will plan to 
attend. It is not a question whether you can afford to go, but 
rather whether you can afford to stay away. 

New Law on Cigarettes 

A new law relative to the sale of cigarettes was passed by the 
last session of the legislature and is now in effect and a part of 
the Criminal Code of Nebraska (House Roll No. 385). It reads as 
follows : 

Section 245q. — That hereafter no person, firm, association or 
corporation in this state shall sell, give, or furnish in any way </seg>

            <seg id="p174">

tobacco in any form whatsoever, or any cigarettes or cigarette 
paper to any minor under eighteen years of age. 

Sec. 245r. — That any person, firm, association or corporation 
violating the provisions of this act shall, upon conviction thereof, 
for each and every offense, be fined in a sum of not less than 
Scnty dollars and not more than fifty dollars, and costs of suit, 
be imprisoned for not less than ten nor more than thirty 
ys, in the discretion of the court. 

New School Laws 

K Superintendents and principals of schools in Nebraska should 
perfectly familiar with the school laws of the state. The 
following sections were amended by the last legislature : Section 
fi of subdivision II; section 2 of subdivision VII, and sections 
and 2 of subdivision XVI. There were also new laws enacted 
relative to the establishment of an additional State Normal 
School and three to five Junior Normal Schools for western Nebraska, 
an entire subdivision relative to the school district City 
of South Omaha (14a), and several minor laws. Ask your county 
superintendent for a copy of the School Laws of Nebraska as 
revised and amended in 1903. 

Elementary Agriculture 

I desire to call your attention to the new requirement now in 
effect for teachers' first and second grade county certificates, 
viz., the Elements of Agriculture, including a fair knowledge of 
the structure and habits of the common plants, insects, birds and 
quadrupeds. I believe that the teachers in the city as well as 
those in the country should have sufficient knowledge of this 
subject to be able to teach it intelligently. It will certainly prove 
a valuable aid in teaching geography and nature study in the 
grades and all sciences in the high school, and every teacher 
should be familiar with the "Nebraska" publication, "The New 
Elementary Agriculture," written by Nebraska talent and published 
by a Nebraska firm.

Lincoln, Nebraska, October 3, 1903. 

Honorable Board of Education : 

KThe most important state educational meeting of the year, 
e most profitable to the superintendents and principals of our 
graded schools, the most valuable to the teachers and children 
of our state (through the aid and inspiration afforded the superintendents 
and principals), is the annual fall meeting of the Superintendents 
and Principals' Section of the Nebraska State Teachers' 
Association, to be held this year in Lincoln, beginning Thursday 
evening, October '22, and closing Saturday noon, October 
24. Among the subjects to be discussed are : 

Business Men's Criticisms of the Public Schools. 

The Business Management Work of a Superintendent or Principal. 


Some Fundamental Principles of Discipline. 

Supervision Work in the Grades with Reference to the Material 
to be Taught and the Efficiency of the Teacher. 

Starting the New Teacher and Improving the Weak One 

Co-operation of City Superintendents and Principals with 
County Superintendents. 

I believe the attendance of your superintendent and principals 
at this meeting, their taking part in the discussions and improving 
the opportunities' thus afforded to meet other supervisors 
of school work and exchange ideas would prove of great value 
to the educational interests in their charge.

Department of Agriculture, Office of the Secretary, 
Washington, D. C. 

October 14. 1903. 

Mr. William K. Fowler, State Superintendent of Public Instruc- 

tion, Lincoln. Nebraska: 

Dear Sir : — Some time ago I received a copy of your delightful 
little book on Elementary Agriculture. The names of Drs. 
Bessey, Bruner and Swezey are enough to float a much heavier 
volume. I am delighted with the step you have taken. I have 
been urging the necessity of this for some time. The education 
of a man who is to devote his life to producing from the soil 
has not had attention. The beginning should be made in the 
common school, or probably, it should begin further back than 
that — in the normal school, with the fitting and preparing of 
teachers, so that when they take up common school work they 
can introduce this delightful and beneficial study. It will set 
young people thinking along these lines early in life and prepare 
them for higher studies along the line of scientific agriculture. 
I have no doubt you have done many valuable things in your day, 
but I doubt if anything you have done compares in value with 
this. Every child in Nebraska would be benefited by a course of 
study in this book and instruction regarding it in the class room. 

I find that agriculture requires attention at both ends. We 
have had agricultural college work, but we need elementary instruction, 
and we need postgraduate work. You can attend to 
the elementary work, and this book indicates you are doing your 
duty along that line. I have made the Department of Agriculture 
a postgraduate institution for the graduates of the agricultural 
colleges. We have their graduates specialize, when they come 
to us, along the lines of .meteorology, animal industry, plant industry, 
soil physics, entomology, etc. I do not happen to know </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

Perintendent of public instruction who is doing this 
;11 as you are doing it. You have taken a sensible 
i have gone to the doctors in your state university 
em prepare something for young minds ; and it reunited 
work of three great men to do this. 

Wishing you all the success you deserve, I remain 

Very cordially, 

(Signed) JAMES WILSON, 

Secretary. 

From The Nebraska Teacher for October, 1903 : 

Eave you seen the "New Elementary Agriculture?" If not, 
should write to The University Publishing Company, Lin, 
for a copy. 

Bishop Meade, of Virginia, once wittily said of conditions in 
that state, "Our girls are poorly educated, but our boys will 
never find it out." Nebraska girls are fairly well educated, but 
I fear Nebraska boys will never find out how well. 

Probably seventy-five per cent or more of the city superintendents 
and the principals of the village and high schools of 
Nebraska will attend the meeting of the superintendents and 
principals' section of the N. S. T. A., to be held in Lincoln, 
October 22-24. Except for circumstances beyond your control, 
you should be with this great progressive majority at that time. 

!"he state of Nebraska is to be congratulated on the increased 
:rest within its bounds in normal school training and nor-1 
school facilities. One thousand one hundred teachers atded 
the Junior Normal Schools during the past summer, and 
irly three thousand others attended the "senior" normal and 
nmer schools. This is exclusive of the attendance at the 
mty institutes. During the current school year $43,000 will 
expended at Peru in the construction of a magnificent chapei 
1 gymnasium building. The new state normal school at Kearr 
will be opened to the public in 1905 and will assuredly enroll 
re than five hundred students the first year. It will be a great 
titution. 

On the 7th of last month this office sent a circular letter of </seg>

            <seg id="p181">
115 


that date to every superintendent and principal of city and village 
schools employing two or more teachers, enclosing therewith 
a blank for the educational directory statistics. Within two 
weeks about two hundred and fifty of the superintendents and 
principals, or more than one-half the total number, had responded. 
A second call was sent out to the others, and it is to be hoped 
that it will not be necessary to send the third call to more than 
fifty or seventy-five persons. The directory will not be issued 
until November 15 this year on account of the fact that we cannot 
obtain a correct list of the county superintendents for the biennium 
1904-1905 until several days after election (November 3), 
but all except the two pages containing the list of county superintendents 
will be printed before November 1. There are still 
a number of reports of graded schools missing. A fourth call 
and possibly a fifth one will be made for some of these. 

Normal School and College State Certificates

The next examination for professional state certificates will 
be held in the office of the state superintendent Monday and 
Tuesday, December 28 and 29. Circulars giving full information 
will soon be ready for distribution. If interested, write for one. 

I he Educational Directories for 1903-1904 will be distributed 
ut November 20, or just as soon as we can learn and print 
names of the successful candidates for the county superini« 
~ies of the state. The new directories will contain a 
of the county superintendents whose terms expire in January, 
another list of those whose terms begin at that time. The 
;ctorics will contain also the enrollment and average daily 
;ndance in the high schools of the state during the past school 
r, and the names of our state officers and congressmen. In 
er respects the new directories will be similar to those of 
past two or three years. 

| r rom The Nebraska Teacher for November, 1902, page 
quote : To get data for this educational directory required in 
le cases five calls from this department. A number of blanks 
y be found in the directory as the fifth call brought no response 
to the time of going to press or the present writing. A few 
all village schools were struck out altogether on account of 
• inability to determine even their very existence. And as in 
•2 so it is in 1903 and so it will be in 1904. As we havi 
ore, there are some principals in Nebraska who fail to leave 
r record of their work, in either statistical, mental or moral 
m. However, we rejoice in the fact that we are not as other 
tes are, that we have the smallest per cent of illiteracy in the 
ion, for it was an Iowa principal who asked us for a "coppy" 
the directory. 

I The number of sod school houses in Nebraska in 1902 was 
6. Reports for 1903, from 75 of the 90 counties in the 
ow a net decrease in the number of 90, and the total decrease 
ill exceed 100. Custer county, which a year ago had 99 of these

county from 27 to 15. McPherson county still reports 6 sod 
school houses and none of any other kind. Dawes, Greeley. 
Scotts Bluff and Valley counties each report one new sod school 
t during the past year, and Dundy reports two new ones, 
e rapid change from sod school houses to good, substantial 
frame ones, for these are the kind that have usually been substituted, 
is very gratifying to those interested in educational work 
in Nebraska. In addition to these, new and better school buildings 
have been erected during the past year at Kennard, Friend, 
Wilber, Louisville. Naper, Monowi, Preston, Hyannis, Decatur 
and many other places. Hastings has begun the erection of a 
new high school building that will cost nearly $48,000. and many 
other cities and towns will soon follow her example. 

Teaching for Women Only 

rthe last biennial report of this department under the cap- 
The Passing of the Rural School Master, attention was 
called to the rapid decrease in the number of men teachers in 
Nebraska. In 1871 the percentage of school masters to the total 
number of school teachers in the state was 52. In 1880 the 
percentage was 40, in 1890 it was 27 ; in 1900 it was 22, and in 1902 
the percentage of men in the ranks was 19. I submit herewith 
a showing of the number of men teachers in sixty-four of the 
ninety counties in Nebraska. The annual reports of these sixtyfour 
counties for the school year ending July, 1903, have been 
received and checked up, and the comparison is made with the 
reports of 1902. 

In this connection the range of salaries from year to year may 
be interesting. In 1871 the average monthly salaries of men 
and women respectively were $39.24 and $36.64. In 1880 the 
tries averaged $36.12 and $31.92. In 1890 they were $43.00 
$37.92. In 1900 they were $46.26 and $36.90 ; in 1901 $47.54 
$38.23, and in 1902 $49.15 and $38.51. The table below 
shows a magnificent increase during the past year in many 
counties : </seg>

Lincoln, Nebraska, November 9, 1903 

My Dear Superintendent-Elect : 

E?sire to congratulate your county on your election to the 
of superintendent of her schools, and to assure you that the 
you will assume in January are great and the responsibilities 
grave and important. During the years 1904 and 1905 
you will be held chiefly responsible (and justly so) for the success 
or failure, the progress or retrogression, of the rural schools 
of vour countv. 

I hope you will feel free to call upon this department for any 
assistance it may be able to give, and I hope that our relations 
may be mutually pleasant, and very profitable to the school 
interests generally of our great and beloved state. 

»By express prepaid I am pleased to send you a number of pubations 
of this department for the current year, including School 
Laws, Official Decisions, Course of Study, Special Day Programs, 
Nebraska School Buildings and Grounds, Consolidation of Rural 
Schools, Circulars, Price Lists, etc., and the last biennial report 
of this department. Copies of all of these should be in every 
county superintendent's office, but this package is sent that you 
may acquire, before your induction into office, a greater knowledge 
of the law and its requirements, and of what may be expected 
of this department. 

Those of you who are in the territory of the Southwestern 
Nebraska Teachers' Association, which meets at McCook, November 
27 and 28, are requested to meet me there at that time ; 
those in the territory of the Northwestern Nebraska Teachers' 
Association, are requested to meet Deputy J. L. McBrien at 
Chadron the same dates. 

A business meeting of the county superintendents and county 
superintendents-elect will be held in Representative Hall, State 
Capitol building, Lincoln, Tuesday evening and Wednesday forenoon, 
December 29 and 30, immediately preceding the N. S. T. A., 
for the discussion of business matters connected with your new 
office, the institute and rural schools. </seg>

OFFICIAL CIRCULARS AND NOTICES 

Lincoln, Nebraska, November 9, 1903. 
My Dear Superintendents : 

Permit me to congratulate us all upon the fact that the county 
elections are again in the past, and that we may now turn our 
attention anew to our legitimate work, — our faces to the schools 
and our backs to politics and the campaign. Among you all 
there are three classes : First, you who were not re-nominated 
and who have known for weeks or months that you would relinquish 
the supervision of the county schools in January, — you 
have been free from the turmoils of the county campaign ; second, 
you who were re-nominated, but were defeated in the election, — 
you have a shorter period in which to set your houses in order 
and to alter and arrange your own plans for the future, but you 
should leave your schools in as good condition as the first d 
and third, the re-elect, you who will continue your efforts for the 
improvement of your schools throughout another term, — much 
more will be expected of you than of the new incumbents in officf ; 
with you are included two or three superintendents who had 
no opponents, and, therefore, like the first class were free from 
the turmoils of the county campaign. May such a class increase 
and multiply ! I hope that all superintendents will feel free to call 
upon this department for any assistance in its power, and thai 
our relations may be mutually pleasant, and profitable to the 
schools of our beloved state. 

Permit me to suggest that all superintendents look over their 
summer and fall correspondence with this department, including 
all circular letters received from this office. Outgoing superintendents 
should settle all controversies that have arisen during 
their administrations, with or between their school officers and 
patrons. Do not leave such troubles and perplexities for your 
successor in office. Leave with him, please, a complete and detailed 
statement of the condition of the institute fund, January 

The Nebraska Educational Directory for the current year will 
follow this in about ten days. The programs for the N. S. 1 
will soon be sent out by the executive committee. The / 
ciation meets December 30 and 31, and January 1. I hope your </seg>

should meet with us and discuss frankly and freely the subjects 
on th,e above program that they may begin their work in a more 
intelligent manner, with a larger comprehension of their important 
duties. On no other one person does the success or failure 
of the rural schools of any county depends as much as it does on 
the county superintendent. 

From The Nebraska Teacher for December, 1903 : 

Applicants for school positions in the Philippine Islands must 
qualify in the regular civil service examinations before their 
applications will be given further consideration. 

We will be pleased to greet the county superintendents, — the 
elect, re-elect, and the non-elect, — at their business meeting to 
be held in Representative Hall, State Capitol building, Lincoln, 
Tuesday evening and Wednesday forenoon, December 29 and 
30. Programs of this meeting will be furnished on request. 

A typographical error occurs in the official decision relative 
to bible reading in the public schools, page 169 of the School 
Laws of Nebraska for 1903-1904. Paragraph 7 should read : The 
law does not forbid the use of the bible in the public schools ; 
it is not proscribed either by the constitution or the statutes, 
and the courts have no right to declare its use to be unlawful 
because it is possible or probable that those who are privileged 
to use it will misuse the privilege by attempting to propagate 
their own peculiar theological or ecclesiastical views and 
opinions. 

From The Nebraska Teacher for January, 1904 : 

A most successful and prosperous as well as Happy New 
Year to all ! 

The new state song, "Nebraska," should be sung in every 
school room of the state. 

County superintendents are in duty bound to guard always 
the interests of the school districts of their counties and to 
protect the school district treasuries from waste through the purchase 
of worthless and useless charts, apparatus and supplies.

superintendents promptly of the presence in their districts of 
any agents for these goods. It would be well to refuse to purchase 
anything of these agents unless they carry a letter of recommendation 
from the county superintendent, and county superintendents 
should refuse to write such letters unless satisfied that 
the purchase of the agent's goods would aid materially the work 
of the schools. Neither the state department of public instruction 
nor the Nebraska public library commission has an agent 
or representative in the field, and no member of either the department 
or the commission is engaged in any business wh 
ever. The state superintendent has persistently and consistently 
refused to write letters of recommendation for any kind of a chart 
whatsoever, and almost invariably refuses to write letters for 
subscription books. The only books he cares to endorse are those 
recommended by the Reading Circle Board of the Nebraska 
State Teachers' Association for school libraries. Any person, 
who in his efforts to sell books, charts, apparatus or school supplies 
to school district officers, alleges that he represents the 
state department of public instruction or the Nebraska public 
library commission, or any member of the department or th^ 
commission, is a fraud. 

Fhe Nebraska Educational Directory is a growth. The Graded 
ool Directory for 1890-1891 was a folder, and contained the 
names of 125 towns in the state, with the number of teachers, 
and the names of the superintendent or principal and the secretary 
or director in each town ; nothing else. D. C. O'Connor 
was then at Arlington, J. W. Crabtree at Ashland, Charles Fordyce 
at Auburn, C. G. Pearse at Reatrice, A. O. Thomas at Cambridge, 
J. If. Scott at Columbus, W. H. Skinner at Crete, W. R. 
Jackson at Ewing, W. L. Stephens at Fullerton, C. A. Fulmer 
at Gibbon, Robert J. Barr (as ever and always) at Grand Island. 
W. H. Gardner at Nebraska City. J. A. Hornberger at Norfolk,

list, only one still holds the position he then held, — Supt. R. J 
Barr of Grand Island. In 1892-93 the directory began to assume 
its present form. That edition contains the names and addresses 
of the county superintendents, seven pages of city superintendents 
and principals of graded schools, the faculties of the University 
of Nebraska and the State Normal School and of five other state 
institutions. From year to year the directory has been enlarged 
and improved. The present administration has made additions 
from year to year, and now disinterested persons in other states 
say we publish the most complete, concise and yet comprehensive 
state educational directory. But how may it be still furt'uei 
improved? Perhaps the names of supervisors on full time should 
be added. Here are some of them for the current school year :

I it conferences held in this office Tuesday afternoon and Saturforenoon 
of the week of the N. S. T. A., many were the 
ressions of approval regarding the plans so far formulated. 
[ all seemed enthusiastic and earnest in their efforts to make 
schools of 15)04 surpass in every respect those of 1903, and in 
humble opinion the Junior Normal Schools of 1903 were 
inently satisfactory, with far-reaching results in the better 
ching of many thousands of school children in Western Neska. 


tfhe salaries of the instructors have in many cases been inased 
$25 for the term and the pay of the principals has been 
reased $50 for the term, but the sums are yet less than many 
the instructors might earn in a less number of weeks in county 
titutes. However, none of them complain on this score and, 
i have alr&lt; ted, all will do earnest, commendable work: </seg>



            <seg id="p199">

* j n P lv 1 A Lj vIhv A* J» *fcB JL W LJ \J A 1^ vO 

but the salaries offered will consume the balance of the state's 
appropriation of $12,000, and all other expenses must be met with 
county institute funds or by the teachers themselves. I am, M 
ever, averse to taxing the teachers any fee whatsoever, but it 
has been strongly recommended by some of the county superintendents 
and some of the instructors that we conduct a lectim 
course in 1904, superior to the course of 1903, charging the 
teachers about $1.00 each for a lecture course ticket with a promise 
to refund to them a part or all of this if the receipts from the 
county institute funds and local patronage permit. I want yous 
advice on this matter. 

The consensus of opinion is in favor of nine weeks' academic 
work followed by a one week's strong, professional, inspirational 
institute. 

The model schools and the work of the primary instructors 
will begin the third week. If any of the county superintendents 
interested in these schools desire the primary instructors to 
begin their work the first week or the second, they should correspond 
at once with their primary instructor, as some of them have 
already secured institute work for these two weeks. This department, 
however, has no money to pay for more than eight weeks' 
work, — the last eight weeks of the school. 

All railroads in the territory of the Junior Normal Schools 
have made a rate of a fare and one-third on the certificate 
plan, going June 11, 12 and 13 and two other dates to be selected, 
with limit for returning August 23. 

The conference hour should be held at the close instead of 
the beginning of the afternoon session. 

I hope each county superintendent in the territory of these 
schools will arrange his home institute, if he holds one, so that 
it will close before June 13, or begin after August 19. 

In order to pay all expenses of the Junior Normal Schools 
other than the salaries of principals and instructors, including 
such items as postage and stationery of the principals, printing 
of bulletins and programs, model school and other supplies. </seg>

and other incidental expenses, and also the deficiency in the lecture 
course, if any, I hope that the county superintendents in the 
territory of these schools will arrange to pay from their institute 
funds $1.00 for each teacher in attendance from their respective 
counties, or as much thereof as may be necessary for this 
purpose. Please write me about this soon. 

Lincoln, Nebraska, January 9, 1904. 

My Dear Superintendent: 

rthe late sessions of the Nebraska State Teachers' Associathere 
were in attendance fifty-eight (58) of the ninety 
(90) county superintendents for the new term. Of the thirtytwo 
(32) absentees, seventeen (17) are new to the office, and these 
lost the advantage of the many valuable suggestions offered in 
the business sessions of the county superintendents by their experienced 
fellow officers. One superintendent who e" f ered upon 
the duties of his office ten months ago by appoii stated in 
open meeting that the one suggestion to enter the first item in 
each Director's Annual Report, "Money in District Treasury 
2d Monday of July, 1902, as given in the last annual report," 
copying in red ink the figures from the amount reported or 
at the close of the preceding year before sending out tL: blanks, 
would have saved him days of unnecessary work and worry last 
summer. And in requiring attendance of teachers at county associations 
and institutes, county superintendents must exercise a 
sufficient degree of "sweet reasonableness," remembering that 
only 65 per cent of their own number were in attendance at 
their business sessions and section meetings during the N. S. 
T.A. 

During the year 1904, the fourth and last year that we will 
hold our respective positions in this department, we hope to maintain 
the pace of the past three years. We will visit as many 
school board associations and teachers' institutes as our time and 
strength and our other official duties will permit. Each of us will 
visit in 1904 the institutes that he has not visited since 1901, and 
all or nearly all those not visited since 1902. 

We would be pleased to conduct a debate by correspondence </seg>

            <seg id="p201">

on these two subjects: 

(1) Resolved, That the transfer law (section 4a, subdivision 
V, School Laws) should be repealed. 

(2) Resolved, That section 11, subdivision IV, relative 10 
Teachers' Contracts, should be repealed. 

If you will kindly send us a written argument on either side 
of either or both of these questions, one hundred to two hundred 
words, we will be pleased to arrange the best arguments submitted, 
alternating for and against, and each answering the 
ceding, as far as possible, and publish the same. The negative 
side has the right to offer substitutes and amendments in lien 
of repeal, and the affirmative on the first question need not 
get "Consolidation."

the new Revenue Law : 4946, section 25. (County Superintendent—

The coi nty superintendent of public instruction of the se\

S. W. Witman, Belgrade ; H. W. Curtis, Coleridge ; A. E. Hildebrand

two teachers failed to report, but they no longer appear in the 
Educational Directory and we are not sure that they are on 
the map. 

We hope to publish in the next biennial report of this department 
half tone illustrations of the new school, buildings in the 
state, — those erected during 1903 or 1904. Please send us the 
photographs and we will do the rest. The collection should include 
the new buildings at Alliance, Arapahoe, Bloom field, Burwell, 
Decatur, Elgin, Fairbury, Friend, Hastings, Kennard, Louisville, 
Monowi, Mullen, Naper, Seward, South Omaha, Wahoo. 
Wilber, York and probably other places, as well as a number of 
the excellent rural school buildings in process of construction. 

Chapter 70 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1903 
(Wheeler Ed.) requires, "That all public buildings . . . 
which may or shall be used for churches, school houses, . . ., 
shall be so built and constructed that all doors leading from the 
main hall or place where said collection of people may be assembled, 
or from the principal room which may be used for any 
of the purposes aforesaid, shall be so swung upon their hinges 
and constructed that they shall open outward, and that all means 
of egress for the public from the main hall or principal room 
and from the building, shall be by means of doors which shall 
open outward from the main hall or buildings." Penalty for 
violation, one hundred to one thousand dollars. This law has 
been in effect since 1877.

rather that portion of it which affirms that the married woman </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

of forty years of age may teach at least as well as the young girl 
who cannot make a legal contract to teach or marry because she is 
"ower (not over) young," has brought us the following letter : 
"Having realized personally the injustice of school boards in prohibiting 
the election of married women as teachers in the public 
schools, although they are equally as well qualified as other* 
who are eligible, I wish to thank you for your recently expressed 
opinions on the subject. Knowing by experience how motherhood 
develops all that is best in the nature of woman, and makes 
her more sympathetic and patient, more capable of understanding 
the real needs of the young, I feel that there is much lost and 
nothing gained by such discrimination. I know that my love 
for my own boy has helped me many times to be more just and 
more patient with other boys in my school." And also the following 
from a Nebraska weekly paper: "State Superintendent 
Fowler's suggestion that the necessary quota of teachers be kept 
up by employing married women of the age of forty or more 
is not at all a bad one. After a woman has had experience with 
family affairs she is more competent to do good work in a school 
room with a little brightening up than is a young girl. The ybang 
woman schoolma'am is "all right, the older schoolma'am is even 
more so, provided she has not become sour and cranky. Wtfehood 
and motherhood make a strong woman stronger, a sweet 
ivoman more sweet, a talented woman more talented. In short 
it is a school of development." 

From The Nebraska Teacher for March, 1904 

In 1901 the ninety county superintendents of the state received 
eighty thousand dollars for their year's work. This 
the compensation will approximate ninety thousand dollars, an 
average of one thousand dollars for each superintendent. Note 
the increase in three years. Salaries are going up. 

Fj publications of this department, "Special Day Programs' 
School Law for Teachers," are stacked up in the offices 
ot a tew county superintendents of Nebraska, where they have 
been since last June. If you, teacher, do not have a copy of 
each on your desk, upbraid your county superintendent. 

Meetings of teachers and school officers should be advertised </seg>

in the county papers. Nearly all editors of local papers artpleased 
to receive and publish copies of programs, in connection 
with which there should be a cordial invitation to patrons to 
attend. Mention date and exact time and place of meeting. 

We are in receipt of a copy of "Moderne Amerikani 
Volksschulhauser auf dem Lande," by Professor Karl Hintr 
published at Vienna, Austria, in 1903. It contains referenc 
one of our publications, "School Buildings and Grounds in 
braska," and reproduces the perspectives and floor plans of the 
Calhoun and Sutherland school houses in Washington county, 
and an interior view of a primary school room in Blair. 

Isupt. J. F. Conner, of Holdrege, was offered the principalship 
the Holdrege Junior Normal School during the session of 
•4, but declined on account of poor health. Mr. Conner was 
principal of the Holdrege Junior Normal School during 
summer of 1903 and of the Holdrege Union Normal Institute 
ing the summer of 1902, and this with his institute work 
1901 has left him very little vacation in four years. He will 
:nd much of next summer and perhaps all of next year on 
farm. Mr. Conner's school work is highly esteemed and 
cessful, and he has earned a rest ; but it must not be for the 
t of his life ; he must return to school work. 

Ifhe Thayer County School Officers' Association met at Hebi, 
January 30, in the court room of their beautiful new court 
lse, which cost $75,000, and where Superintendent Cal R. 
illippi has convenient and commodious quarters, consisting 
four rooms ; a public reception room, a private office, an exination 
room, and a vault for the storage of supplies, records, 
. Fully one hundred members of school district boards were 
sent, some of whom had driven twenty miles or more to 
end this meeting. The New Elementary Agriculture was 
&gt;pted unanimously for use in the schools of the county. Suintendent 
Fowler talked on consolidation of school districts, 
owed by an interesting discussion in which many joined. 

It is a common courtesy to acknowledge receipt of valuable 
letters, papers, etc., and to answer letters that require an answer 
within a reasonable time. This department is sadly hampered </seg>

in its work the year 'round by the fact that a few county superintendents, 
or a few city superintendents, or a few village principals, 
will neglect to respond to a request or an appeal or even 
a demand, and it is impossible to complete a tabulated report 
with even one county or city missing. Letters to this department 
are usually answered the day they are received, excepting, of 
course, those that do not require an answer and those that require 
much reference or research. Photographs of school buildings 
and important documents are always acknowledged, but 
we count it a remarkable fact that a majority of the professional 
life certificates granted and mailed are never acknowledged, 
not even by a postal card. Is it because the recipient feels that 
he has "earned" the certificate? 

May 14, 1904, the one hundredth anniversary of the beginning 
of the Lewis and Clark Expedition should be celebrated by the 
schools of Nebraska on Friday, May 13, with appropriate exercises. 
For suggestions see Special Day Programs for 1904-1905. 
pages 127-139. In addition to the bibliography on page 127. 
A. S. Barnes &amp; Company, of New York City, has just published 
a History of the Expedition under the command of Captains 
Lewis and Clark, in three volumes, with maps and illustrations. 
If there is not a sufficient amount of material at hand to constitute 
an afternoon's program, permit me to suggest that the pupils 
be required to write stories of the early settlement and history 
of their school district or village or city or their part of the 
county or state, which they may learn about from old settlers. 
The best of these stories should be sent to the county or city 
superintendent, and the best of these to the state superintendent 
or the state historical society. Thus we may rescue from ob- 
Kion many a fact worth preserving, and stimulate interest anew 
the history of Nebraska.

Junior Normal School in which you are particularly interested. 

I am sending by express to county superintendents a sufficient 
number of catalogues to supply each teacher with a copy. For 
counties some of whose teachers will go to one school and some 
to another, we have sent a sufficient number of catalogues of each 
school, to be distributed according to the discretion of the county 
superintendent. County superintendents in need of more catalogues 
should address the business manager of the school in nis 
territory. We are sending also envelopes for mailing these catalogues 
out to the teachers. It is hoped county superintendents 
will not delay in the distribution of these catalogues. Teacher* 
are a"nxious to make their plans for attending school this summer. 

We are sending to the business manager of each school 
catalogues for local distribution. These should be used to supply 
miscellaneous requests from teachers and others intere 
About 100 copies should be distributed judiciously among the 
leading citizens in the town where the school is located. We 
must not forget the importance of securing good local patronage 
for our lecture course. 

Instructors should correspond with the principals of their respective 
schools relative to information on assignment of work, 
daily program, etc. 

Principals should plan a definite program for practical talks 
by the county superintendents listed in their respective faculties 
on school government, methods of teaching, and the /arioas 
problems relating to the betterment of the rural schools. None 
are better fitted for such discussions than the county superintendents, 
who come from the actual field of supervision and 
know from the school of experience the difficulties confronting 
the rural school teachers. This will be one of the most interesting 
and profitable features of the work in these schools. 

We appeal to principals and instructors, county superintendents 
and business managers, for a united effort in making the 
Junior Normal Schools a great success again this year.

that time, plant them today. But plant trees, and then care for

desk, ask your county superintendent for one. 

Those interested in the one hundredth anniversary of the Lewis 
and Clark Expedition may find valuable information in the 
following publications : The Louisiana Purchase, and the Exploration, 
Early History _and Building of the West, by Ripley 
Hitchcock, with illustrations and maps published by (.iinn &amp; 
Company, Chicago, 1903 ; The History of the Louisiana Purchase, 
by James K. Hosmer, with illustrations and maps, published by 
D. Appleton &amp; Company, New York, 1902 ; Early Western Fxplorations, 
six volumes, including three volumes of the Lewis 
and Clark Expedition, two volumes of Mackenzie's Vovagea 
to the Arctic, and one volume of Butler's The Wild North Land, 
published by A. S. Barnes &amp; Company, New York, 190o ; The 
Louisiana Purchase, As It Was and As It Is, by A. E. Winship 
and Robert W. Wallace, published by A. Flanagan Company, 
Chicago, 1903. 

rhope and believe that the teachers of Nebraska will base 
reading circle work and professional study during the next 
school year on the two books selected by the Reading Circle 
Board of the Nebraska State Teachers' Association. These two 
books are Common Sense Didactics, by Henry Sabin, late state 
superintendent of Iowa, and Geographic Influences in American 
History, by Albert P. Brigham, professor of geology in Colgate 
University. Mr. Sabin is well known in Nebraska, having delivered 
scores of lectures in the state and instructed in many 
of her institutes. The experience of many of our counties with 
the Teachers' Library Union of Chicago, and other non-resident, 
irresponsible concerns, will probably limit the professional study 
of the teachers of those counties to the state reading circle work. </seg>

            <seg id="p211">
139 


Other counties, however, should profit by the experience of those 
who invested in these Chicago-Twelve-Dollar-Reading-Circle 
courses. We believe that it will be profitable in the long run 
not only to limit our reading circle work to that recommended 
by the State Teachers' Association Board, but also to pure 
school libraries only from firms doing business regularly under 
the laws of Nebraska and under bonds to the state, or from firms 
whose libraries have been approved by the reading circle board.

My Dear Superintendent: 

Last Saturday I learned that representatives of U School 
F company of Chicago were selling the "Union School Li

of the books. They sold five warrants in McCook last Thur 
at five per cent discount, and left Friday morning for P.enkelman. 
Dundv countv. 

Their proposition is to send any forty books out of a list of 
ninety-three in a case and a speaktr for the Bam of $ 
warrant, registered or payable in cash to the agent, to be given 
him in person, and the books to arrive at the pleasure and con-

What do think of this selection for the beginning of a school 
library in rural school districts? I cannot imagine why intelligent 
school district boards in this state of Nebraska will buy 
such books and pay for them in advance when they will keep 
the school text book publishing houses waiting oftentimes from 
three to six months for their pay. My advice to county superintendents 
is to warn their school district boards through the newspapers 
and circular letters against the purchase of school libraries 
from irresponsible concerns. They will do much better for 
their districts if they will purchase the $5, $10 and $15 school 
libraries recommended by the Reading Circle Board of the N. S. 
T. A. They should not pay for any text books or library books 
or apparatus until the same have been delivered and found to be 
according to representation. The stories above named and similar 
books may be purchased at department stores for 19 cents 

Lincoln, Nebraska, May 4, 1904. 

My Dear Superintendent : 

I am in receipt of your letter of April 29 informing me that 
my warning to you not to endorse the representatives of the 
U School F company came too late as you had already 
endorsed them. You say in explanation of your action : </seg>

"This firm has canvassed the northeastern part of the state 
and hold recommendations from county superintendents dated 
toth before and after having placed their libraries in the counties 
of said superintendents. They have a list of something like 
three hundred books from which to make a selection, and I think 
a fair library can be selected from them, just about the class of 
books that is being placed in most of our schools. Of course, 
there are some books in their list that I would not recommend 
for a beginning library. In regard to the payment of the books 
in advance, I do not blame them so very much for requiring that ; 
besides they leave a receipt with the purchaser and a voucher 
to deliver the books at whatever time the purchaser demands. 
Is that not fair? It is my desire to do the best for our schools 
and I do not want to recommend anything that I think will prove 
a detriment to them. I shall be very sorry if I have been duped 
by this firm, but I do not think I have." 

Yes, I know the firm holds recommendations from some of 
the county superintendents in northeastern Nebraska, and I wonder 
if these representatives could go back there and get another 
endorsement? It may interest you to know that the districts in 
northeastern Nebraska are as a rule in very much better financial 
condition than those in southwestern Nebraska. And yet I do 
not look upon school libraries as a luxury only. I would like 
to see a good library in every rural school district in Nebraska, 
but I do not believe that in counties where the average 
term is only five or six months, school district boards can afford 
to pay $45 for a $15 library. And who will select the "fair library" 
from the list of three hundred books? I am just in receipt of 
printed lists from a school text book publishing house of Chicago, 
which has a guarantee bond on file in this department in the 
sum of $10,000 for the faithful performance of its contracts with 
rural school boards, in which it offers one $5, two $10 and one $15 
library, containing a total of 113 books with no duplicates. All 
these, you see, for the sum of $40 net, transportation prepaid. 
(No, it is not the A. B. company.) 

Are your school boards in the habit of paying for their text </seg>

books in advance? What is the receipt or voucher of the representatives 
of non-resident concerns worth? Suppose the books 
do not come : Can this school board afford to go to Chicago 
to begin action ? I sincerely hope the schools of your county will 
not suffer too severely through your endorsement. 

Chicago. April 28, 1904. 

Dear Mr. Fowler: 

Yesterday I visited the U School F company, and 
T &amp; T , besides making some investigations among the 
large printers as to the probable cost of such books as are being 
offered in Nebraska. The questions were put as if from a school 
teacher who was wishing to make a little money on Saturdays 
by selling school libraries in adjoining districts as well as in 
his own. 

The U School F company offered me two grades of 
books, one of whicli was claimed to list at a dollar. The better 
grade — in which edition 1 am sending you today a copy of 
Treasure Island— was to be supplied to school districts at 
the rate of fifty volumes for fifty dollars, including a very cheap 
but pretentious oak case. A special price of sixty cents per volume 
was made to me as prospective agent. The same concern 
publishes a cheaper list of books called the New Oxford Series, 
a circular of which I enclose. The price is seventy-five cents per 
volume — a book case being offered with a hundred volumes. 
I was offered a price of thirty-seven and one-half cents per volume 
on this lot. The only difference between this and the dollar 
edition is that this edition is bound entirely in cloth while the 
dollar edition has a cheap leather back. 

fThe I* School F company said that they bought the 
tnd bound them in their own bindery at Hammond, 
diana. It is entirely improbable that they have any binder&gt; 
of their own and their hint about Hammond is enough to justifv 
the conclusion that the work is done by the \V. B. C. company 
of Hammond, Indiana, who print a great deal of this cheap 
stuff and bind up editions in any form to suit- the purchaser. A </seg>



            <seg id="p215">
eid of mine who is connected with one of the large printing 
ses tells me that such a book as the one I am sejiding you 
can be printed, bound and supplied in quantities at from thirteen 
to fifteen cents per volume. 

T &amp; T put up a library which differs from the U 
School F company's sample only in having leather corners 
and marbled edges. The sheets are identical and are probably 
printed by the same parties. They list these books at $1.25 per 
volume, offering forty volumes for $50, with $5 extra for a cheap 
case. I was offered this $55 library for SI 1 

The only other printers in Chicago and vicinity whom 1 know 
to be printing these cheap non-copyright books and selling them 
in large lots, bound up to suit the purchaser, are If. A. D. 
&amp; company ; the H company and R. R. D. &amp; Sons 
company. 

Chicago, April 30, 1904. 

Dear Mr. Fowler: 

Eiur letter of the 27th inst. came to hand yesterday after I 
answered your former letter in reference to the fake libraries 
:h are being sold in your state. The copy of the Hoosicr 
Schoolmaster which you send is far above the average of the 
books which I saw. Probably this book was sent out as a 
sample and this may explain the difference. It looks much like 
the books listed in the T &amp; T libraries, which they claim 
to be worth $1.50 a volume, but which cost perhaps fifteen to 
twenty cents. I think this book is printed by C of Hammond. 
Indiana, though this is merely a guess. C is doing a good 
deal of this work, more than either of the other two houses named 
in mv last letter.

Dear Sir: — We have your letter in response to ours of the

STATE SOTERTNTENDENt'S REPORT 

furthermore you have the Library Commission. We shall beg 
the privilege of writing you once more in order to remove a misapprehension. 


In the first place, as we understand the law, it is not compulsory 
upon school boards and teachers to buy the books nor to 
buy of the firm recommended by the State Commission : the latter 
acts as an advisory committee : still the law permits county superintendents 
to use their own judgment and discretion. 

In advising us that our books come too high you are making 
a great mistake, but we, of course, realize that you have not seen 
the library, and we assume that you concluded beforehand that 
it was a lot of cheap books. As a matter of fact, the county superintendents 
in your state who have seen our libraries are most 
enthusiastic in their behalf, and before we thought of the plan 
of writing for a list of the teachers' names, already a half dozen 
superintendents have sent us a list and requested us to do so. 

Let us go into facts and figures. The price of No. 1 library 
of 50 books with dictionary and case is $37.50. On cash sales 
we offer to allow a discount of 40 per cent, the benefit of which 
you could give direct to the school board or to the school fund, 
as you thought best. That would make the net price, which we 
would receive for the library, $22.50. The library case, if you 
were to try to buy it from any school supply house, would cost 
you all the way from $3.50 to $5.00. The Webster Unabridged 
Dictionary published by the Merriams, 1903 copyright, in full 
sheep binding, is sold at all the way from $3.50 to $5.00; ten 
years ago it sold for $10.00. The set of "Great Americans," all 
handsome books, are sold for cash at $6.00. A special arrangement 
was made with your state superintendent to furnish them 
at $3.00 per set for introductory purposes. We enclose herewith 
a copy of his letter upon the subject. *We have made arrangements 
with Mr. Campbell to handle the state of Nebraska on this 
set of books. The Shakespeare, which we include, is a large 8vo, 
handsomely bound, and could not be bought in any of the book 
stores for less than $1.25. The New Idea Speaker, especially for 
school purposes was sold on subscription at $1.75 ; you could not </seg>

• 

buy it from any source for less than $1.00. Furthermore, in 
addition, with each library we agree to give a premium, which 
may be either another set of "Great Americans" or one of our 
handsomely framed pictures, which is especially adapted for 
educational purposes. These pictures will not only add to the 
appearance of a school room, but they have their educational 
value. We suggest that you carefully look over the enclosed 
circular regarding it. 

Xow, these are not- cheaply bound books, but are printed from 
good plates on a fine quality of paper, substantially bound with 
gilt tops. In fact, over 50 books in the list are from the Cornell 
Series, which retail at 75 cents per copy, and which we venture 
the assertion you could not get from any other source at less 
than 30 cents per copy if you took them in quantities. 

Instead of sending shrewd agents into the county to make a 
et canvass, get school boards to sign the warrants, discount 
warrants, and then ship the district any old thing, we an: 
king this fight on the merits of our goods, and it is our aim 
i desire to work with the co-operation of the county superinident, 
and to consult his interests, providing that he is willing 
meet us half way. We handle everything in the school supply 
e, and we prefer to push the sale of the goods in the county 
it meet with the approval of the superintendent, but if he 
:lines to co-operate with us, then we must use our own judg:nt 
as to what goods we push in the county ; that is, whether 
,vill be school libraries, maps, globes or furniture. 

I Now, in closing, we want to say that if you are interested in this 
itter and request it, we will be pleased to ship you a complete 
mgress library with the premium, the latter for yourself, the 
&gt;rary for your inspection and to stand in your office for a 
onth or two where the teachers can have an opportunity of 
amining it, with the further understanding that when any disict 
wants that particular library that they can take it and remit 
; the net price for it. This is certainly a fair proposition, and we 
&gt;pe that we may receive a favorable reply. 

Very truly yours,

8TATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

In the fourth paragraph of the letter above the company 
Ss a discount of 40 per cent and in the fourth paragraph of the 
wing letter a discount of only 30 per cent. But the latter 
am a letter to a teacher whereas the former is to a county 
rintendent. That accounts for the difference. 

The Merriams do not sell nor do they permit any one else 
to sell the Webster International Unabridged Dictionary, full 
sheep binding, late edition, at less than $8.."&gt;0 without index and 
with index. 

Kin 1908 I wrote a letter to the Harry G. Campbell Publishing 
lpany relative to the "Great Americans of History," comiding 
their special introductory price for school purposes of 
$3.00 net for the entire set of books, but no special arrangement 
was made with me and I have never been consulted since my 
letter of last vear was written. 

Note the sly dig in the next to the last paragraph of the letter 
above on the other concerns referred to in the printed folder, as 
tl as the threat to the county superintendent ; also the "bid" 
endorsement in the last paragraph of the letter. 

In fact, all letters from these irresponsible concerns should bo 
; very carefully. — W. K. Fowler. 

Lincoln, Nebraska, March 30, 1904. 

C Publishing Company, Chicago: 

Elemen : — Your letter of the 24th inst. received. My expernd 
observation do not harmonize with yours relative to 
j libraries in the public schools. You claim that some one 
must be paid for actual work in the field to induce the directors 
of the schools to take action in the matter. I beg leave to differ. 
There have been more libraries placed in the public schools of 
Nebraska without special agents in the field than there have 
been by traveling agents or questionable propositions like yours 
The reason for this is that the Reading Circle Board of the Nebraska 
State Teachers' Association and the Nebraska Public 
Library Commission created by the legislature furnish county 
rintendents, teachers and school officers with lists of books </seg>

            <seg id="p221">
147 


suitable for school libraries, selected from the publications of 
the leading school book companies of the United States at competitive 
prices. These libraries range in price from $5 to 
and are laid down at the nearest station, freight prepaid, at prices 
on an average of less than fifty per cent of those asked by traveling 
agents. This plan, compared with that of paying some one 
for actual work in the field, saves in livery hire, hotel bills, and 
the salary of the oily-tongued agent sufficient money to procure 
for each district improving its opportunity an additional $5. $1"! 
or $15 library. And the $5 and $10 libraries recommended by 
the State Reading Circle Board and the Nebraska Public Library' 
Commission are, as a rule, better bound and better selected than 
the $3") and $45 libraries offered by traveling agents. 

I challenge also most emphatically your statement that: It 
is decidedly better that the school should pay two prices for a 
school library than that they should go without a library, because 
it were possible to procure them somewhere at a good deal 
less price." When it is possible to get a thing for its real value, 
it is sheer folly and unwarranted extravagance to pay two prices 
for it. 

A comparison of one price you make and one furnished our 
Reading Circle Board and through the board to the school 
tricts of the state may not be out of order. You list the "Great 
Americans of History" at $6 per set. Your further proposition 
is to deduct 30 per cent from the list price, which would make this 
set of books $4.20. The offer to our Reading Circle Board for 
school district libraries on this same set of books is $3. Hen? 
is a clear saving of $1.20 if the teacher-agent does not claim her 
tjcount. It is evident that what we have already stated on prices 
not misleading. ( 

I 

Then, I must condemn your proposition in the letter sent 
out to teachers, wherein you say : "As we have no agent in your 
county, we will make you our agent in your district and give 
you 30 per cent discount from the price of library given in 
the enclosed circular. That would reduce the price of No. I 
library, which sells regularlv at S net, and it </seg>

            <seg id="p222">
STATE SUPERINTENDElCT B REPORT

would reduce the price of No. 2 library, that ordinarily sells at 
$50 to $35 net to you. You can send us either the cash, or the 
school board may issue to us a legal school warrant for the 
amount if not exceeding one year's time and bearing the legal 
rate of interest or with interest added to the face of the warrant. 
We prefer the cash, but if your board will not raise the cash 
but will buy on a year's time and will issue a legal warrant, it 
will be satisfactory to us." 

In addition to this proposition, which may seem very flattering 
on its face to the teacher, you say, "We give the teacher a very 
handsome copy of some great painting in colors, splendidly 
framed in solid gold to hang up in her school room as a little 
bright spot of inspiration relieving the ordinary bare walls of 
a country school house." 

My first objection to your plan is that you tempt the teacher 
with an agent's fee of $11.25 on library No. 1 and $15 on library 
No. 2. While I have confidence in the teachers of Nebraska 
and believe that most of them would give the district the advantage 
of the agent's profit, your proposition bears on its face 
the appearance of graft. 

My second objection is, notwithstanding the fact that I believe 
in the gold standard, to the additional temptation to the 
teacher in giving her "a very handsome copy of some great 
painting in colors, splendidly framed in solid gold." This is too 
much. But why not make it a gold brick? 

My third objection is that it is illegal for a school district in 
Nebraska to issue its warrants payable at a specified time in 
the future. 

My fourth objection is, that before your agent, even though 
a Nebraska public school teacher or superintendent, can legally 
do business in this state and contract with school district boards 
for your libraries, you must furnish a bond as provided in section 
2, subdivision XVIII, School Laws of Nebraska for 1903. 
This law relates to text books and supplies. Our supreme court 
in passing upon the constitutionality of this law made use of the </seg>

            <seg id="p223">

• 

following language: "We do not think the term "text books' 
should be given a technical meaning, but that it is comprehensive 
enough and does include globes, maps, charts, pens, ink, paper, 
etc., and all other apparatus and appliances which are proper to 
be used in the school in instructing the youth, and we conclude, 
therefore, that the act under consideration is not broader than 
its title, and that the term 'school supplies' found in the tenth 
section of this act is not foreign to the term 'text books' found in 
the title of this act, but is germane to and comprehended and included 
within the term 'text books.' " 

Under separate cover I mail you a copy of the School Laws 
of Nebraska, and call your careful attention to subdivision 
XVIII, relative to text books and supplies. Until you have complied 
with the law therein we shall hold that your contracts with 
the school districts in this state are null and void, and we shall 
warn county superintendents, teachers and school officers and the 
general public to take due notice of the same. 

You need not send me the sample library offered in your 
letter of the 24th inst. 

April 6, 1904. 

The C Publishing Company, Chicago : 

Gentlemen: — Your letter of the 2d inst. received. There is 
nothing in your explanation that would cause me to modify, 
in the least, my letter of the 30th ult. I am satisfied now that 
I had a clear conception of your propositions. 

Your letter of the 26th ult. which you claim was held until 
you conld find out my attitude toward your proposition and which 
was enclosed to me in yours of the 2d inst., is filled with the 
tricks of legerdemain. All your propositions vary. It is one thing 
one time, something else another, and still a different proposition 
the third time. I hardly see how you can comply with the 
law which will require you, under a guaranty bond (personal 
bonds not accepted) to file with the state superintendent of public 
instruction a sworn statement of the lowest prices for which 
your series of supplies are sold anywhere in the United States, 
and of course these prices must not vary, at least in Nebraska. </seg>

            <seg id="p224">
150 


Relative to the gift to the teacher of a "very handsome copy 
of some great painting in colors, splendidly framed in solid gold." 
etc., you say in your letter of the 2d inst., "These frames are 
what is known to the public as 'gold gilt' frames. If they were 
mentioned as solid gold in any letter, it was certainly an oversight 
too apparent to mislead one." In your letter of March 24. 
in the description of this gift to the teacher, it was typewritten 
"'solid gilt," but the word "gilt" was changed in ink by the one 
who signed the letter so as to read "gold." This only emphasizes 
what I have already said, that your propositions are as 
changeable as the chameleon. 

However, if you will comply with the law and furnish us a 
guaranty bond of $2,000, the smallest amount required on any 
bond of any school text book or supply company doing business 
in this state, and will do business on business principles under 
the law and such a bond, we shall interpose no objection to your 
doing business in Nebraska. 

Chicago, April 18, 1904. 

Mr. , County Superintendent: 

Dear Sir: — Wherever county superintendents make an effort 
to bar us out without regard to circumstances we then feel at 
liberty to put a crew of agents in the county, and to canvass it 
thoroughly on the sale of charts, or anything that suits our purpose. 
Where superintendents are friendly toward us, we endeavor 
to sell what will meet their approval and not to push the 
sale of anything that they are really opposed to. but if they put 
us under no obligation, then we authorize agents to sell whatever 
will yield the most profit. 

E, we are not unreasonable, and if there is any legitimate 
why we should be barred out of your county we would 
sed to have you submit your case. Unless plausible reasons 
are advanced then we do not feel that we are under any 
further obligations to consult your interest in this matter. 

Very truly,

Ten or more county superintendents have reported to this office 
the failure of the Teachers' Library Union of Chicago to 
fulfill its contracts with the teachers of their respective counties. 
This little experience cost the teachers of Nebraska many thousands 
of dollars, for which they cannot show an equivalent in as 
many hundreds of dollars' worth of books. 

A number of our school district boards ordered some co 
pondence instruction by mail for their districts from the Educational 
Association of Chicago. The order, agreement or contract, 
whichever it was that was signed under the impression that it 
reads $4.75 turned out to be a note of $47.50 bearing interest since 
last summer and becoming due in next June. Worst of it is 
that some of the districts did not receive any books while others 
received books worth only about three or four dollars. — Butler 
County Public School for March, 1904.

Ask your county superintendent for lists of approved school 
librarv books. 

This department will issue teachers' county examination i 
tions monthly until August inclusive, and eighth grade graduation 
questions in May. 

The maximum school district tax levy allowed under the law 
is still twenty-five (25) mills. It was not altered or amended 
by the new revenue law or the legislature of 1903, and school 
districts anxious to receive sufficient taxes to carry on their 
schools should not reduce their usual levy this year. Should 
the new revenue law increase the income, districts maintaining 
less than seven or eight months of school and paying their teachers 
less than thirty-five ($35) dollars a month may im] 
their conditions. 

Blanks for the Graded School Reports have been mailed to the

I am in receipt of letters from Argyllshire, Scotland, making 

inquiries relative to "the reform of rural schools by some workable 
method of consolidating them." The writer says, "An 
educational bill for Scotland will be before parliament soon, 
dealing with the co-ordination of all grades of education and especially 
with the correlation of our primary and secondary systems. 
We are deeply interested in the various attempts at consolidation 
in the states. I had the honor of reading a paper at 
the Annual Congress of the Educational Institute of Scotland in 
December last in which I advocated consolidation through grouping 
(using transport to a restricted degree). It may interest you 
also to know that in the report on Irish education just presented 
to parliament 'transport in covered wagons' is strongly recom- 

mended for the rural districts of Ireland." 

Many of the statistical tables of the annual reports of the county 

superintendents for the year ending July, 1903, have recently 
been completed in this office. The reports show some remarkable 
changes, particularly in the decrease of men teachers in the 
state and the increase in salaries of both men and women. 
For the year ending July, 1902, there were 1,862 men teaching 
school in Nebraska. During the year ending July, 1903, there 
were only 1,490, a decrease of 20 per cent. The number has 
steadily decreased since 1890, when there were 2,861 men teaching 
in the state. The number of women teachers has, of course, 
correspondingly increased. Men now constitute but 16 per cent 
of the total teaching force of the state. The average monthly 
salaries during the past six years for men and women were as

The Northwestern Iowa Teachers' Association, held at Si 
City, April 14-16, was a great success, with an enrollment of 
about 800 members, many of whom were from Northeastern Nebraska, 
Southeastern South Dakota, and Southwestern Minnesota, 
although the reduced railroad rates were from poin 
Iowa only. Sioux City is more accessible to the teachers of 
several counties in the northeastern part of Nebraska than 
Omaha, Lincoln, Fremont or Norfolk would be, and altli 
an honest pride in our own state and its high standing in the 
field of education should bring many of the superintendents, 
principals and better paid teachers of Northeastern Nebr 
to the annual meetings of the Nebraska State Teachers' 
ciations, yet the same educators and many others might mingle 
with their educational brothers and sisters of Iowa and South 
Dakota with profit to all. The Sioux City Inter-State Teachers' 
Association, with railroad rates and other concessions to all 
alike (within a given.radius, say 200 miles), a general program for 
all in attendance, with Iowa, Nebraska, South Dakota and Minnesota 
Round Tables especially provided for, would, we think, 
be quite satisfactory.

Nebraska as a territory has our hearty endorsement. The governor 
of the state suggests Friday, May 27, as an appropriate 
time for school exercises. Read the suggestions in the department's 
notes in The Nebraska Teacher for March, April and 
May. The governor's proclamation reads in part as follows: 

Rhe 30th day of May, 1854, President Pierce affixed his 
re to one of the most important enactments which has 
congress during the existence of these United States. 
The incidents leading up to the introduction and final passage 
of the Kansas-Nebraska bill were history-making in their character 
and have indelibly stamped their impress upon our national 
life. The succeeding events were even more decisive 
and tragic in their results, ultimately plunging the north and 
south into fratricidal war and testing in the balance of sanguinary 
conflict the mooted question of the times affecting human 
liberty. Such stirring scenes as these marked the enactment 
of the Kansas-Nebraska bill, by the terms of which the future 
state of Nebraska, then in territorial form, first emerged from the 
wilderness lying west of the Missouri and assumed its initial 
civic responsibilities. Owing to the intensity of the times the 
eyes of the nation were fixed upon Nebraska then, and because 
of our spectacular growth and development the attention thus 
attracted has never been withdrawn. Much was expected of 
Nebraska, but not more than she has been able to deliver. Her 
early settlements of God-fearing, liberty-loving, school-fostering 
citizens exerted a wholesome influence upon the trend of national 
events from the very first and laid the foundations for the magnificent 
statehood which is our heritage today. </seg>

In the hurry and bustle of life it is profitable at times to pause 
briefly for retrospective view. In harmony with this idea many 
of our citizens have thought it wise. to celebrate properly the 
semi-centennial anniversary of the signing of the Kansas-Nebraska 
bill and the plan meets with my hearty approval. As the 
date occurs on the 30th of May, a day consecrated to the memory 
of our soldier dead, a delay of one day is fitting and proper. 

Therefore, I, John H. Mickey, Governor of the State of 
braska, do hereby appoint and set apart Tuesday, May 31, 1904, 
as a day commemorative of the signing of the Kansas-Nebraska 
bill, an event of the utmost importance to this people. I suggest 
that on the Friday preceding, the schools of the state take 
cognizance of the matter and by appropriate exercises challenge 
attention to the progress of the half century, the history attending 
the birth of the territory, and seek to inculcate such lessons 
of patriotism as befit the occasion. 

Closing of School, Epidemic Disease 

It has been the ruling of this department that when a teacher 
is employed for a definite time and durieg the period of his 
employment the district officers or board of health close the 
school on account of the prevalence of an epidemic disease in 
the district and the teacher continues ready to perform his contract, 
he is entitled to full wages during such period ; provided, 
there is nothing in the contract to the contrary. A late decision 
of the supreme court reverses in part our ruling, although it ha? 
been endorsed by the attorney general of Nebraska and the supreme 
court of other states. As the case now stands, a teacher 
cannot collect pay on such a contract when school is closed bv 
order of the board of health. 

State Examinations 

Examinations for life professional certificates will be held 
August 19 and 20, 1904, at the following places : Lincoln. Fremont, 
Norfolk, Beatrice, Grand Island, Alliance, Holdrege, Me 
Cook, North Platte and Valentine. Candidates may take all 
or a part of the branches at any examination. Credit will be </seg>

            <seg id="p232">
156 


given for satisfactory work in the branches taken. No fee is required. 
About one and one-half hours are allowed for the examination 
in each branch. The following order of examination 
will be followed : Chemistry, general history, English literature, 
plane trigonometry, zoology, geology, physical geography, intellectual 
philosophy, rhetoric. Principals and teachers who do not 
hold professional certificates are urged to try at least a part of this 
examination. For a circular giving full particulars address this 
department. 

Summer Schools 

The Nebraska Institute Directory for 1904 shows a list of 
about fifteen summer schools for teachers, exclusive of the five 
Junior Normal schools located at Alliance, Holdrege, McCook, 
North Platte and Valentine. Superintendents and principals 
should urge their teachers and the graduates of their high schools 
who intend to teach to attend a good summer school six or eight 
weeks. The day is at hand when boards of education in cities 
and villages should require that all applicants for high school 
positions should be either normal school, college or university 
graduates, or holders of professional state certificates ; that all 
teachers in the grades should have at least a three-yeaT high 
school education and one year's normal school training. We are 
glad to know that many boards of education are now demanding 
similar qualifications. We believe the day is also near at hand 
when no one shall be licensed to teach in the rural schools of 
Nebraska who does not possess as a minimum qualification a 
thorough knowledge of the common English branches such as 
would admit to the average high school and also one year's drill 
in a teachers' training class. The summer schools this year, and 
especially the Junior Normal schools, will lay especial stress 
upon school economy and will give those in attendance ten weeks 
of professional training. No inexperienced teacher can afford 
to neglect the opportunities offered in these schools. 

Superintendents and principals should plan to spend six weeks 
in the summer session of the University of Nebraska, June 10 
to July 22 inclusive. There will be a Department of Superinten- </seg>

            <seg id="p233">

dence in connection with this summer school designed to aid 
experienced executives through the exchange of thought and discussion 
of methods and to teach the new and inexperienced superintendents 
and principals the essentials of supervision. 

N. E. A. 

I he National Educational Association will hold its annual 
i this year on the exposition grounds at St. Louis, beginning 
e 28. By this arrangement of time and place teachers may 
&gt;y the two-fold pleasure of attendance at this meeting and a 
t to the World's Fair. It will perhaps be several years bei 
the meetings of the N. E. A. will be held again so near our 
1 state, and this may be an opportunity of a lifetime. Write 
Irwin Shepard, secretary N. E. A., Winona, Minnesota, for 
&gt;py of the program and general information. 

Reports 

County superintendents are expected to send their annual re : 
ports to the state superintendent before the close of July. They 
&lt;:annot make complete and accurate reports unless they receive 
such reports from the directors of their various school districts. 
And the directors cannot make complete and anthentic reports 
until the superintendents, principals and teachers make their report 
of school for the year. We urge that you exercise unusual 
care this year in making complete and correct reports 
immediately upon the close of school to the directors of your respective 
districts, and that the Graded School Report be filled out 
and mailed to the state superintendent before the school room 
door is closed behind you for the year. Attention to these matters 
at the proper time will be easier for you and will save others 
a vast amount of unnecessary worry. If for any reason you do 
not receive blanks or requests for these statistical reports, write 
to this department for them. You understand, of course, that 
these reports cannot be made out until the term registers are in 
proper completed form. 

Defective Children 

In connection with your report to the director, please do not </seg>

            <seg id="p234">

fail to take special care in reporting the number of defective 
children in your district. This will enable the county superintendent 
to co-operate more intelligently with the superintendent 
of the school for the deaf at Omaha and the superintendent of 
the school for the blind at Nebraska City. There are numbers 
of these defective children in Nebraska who are unaware that 
the state is ready, willing and anxious to give them an education 
fid fit them for useful citizens in spite of their misfortunes, 
indlv bear this matter in mind. 

State Reading Circle Work 

We believe that the Reading Circle Board of the Nebraska State 
Echers' Association has adopted two particularly strong and 
•ful books for the course of 1904-190.') in Sabin's Common 
Didactics and Brigham's Geographic Influences in American 
History. While the results of Dr. Sabin's fifty years' experience 
in all branches of school work and supervision will be 
especially interesting and instructive for the teachers in the 
grades and the rural schools, it contains much of value to the 
high school teacher, principal and superintendent. On the other 
hand, while Brigham's correlation of geography and history 
will be invaluable to the high school and eighth grade teacher, 
it contains enough that is familiar to the average teacher to keep 
alive the interest and at the same time introduces much that is 
new and highly instructive. As a means toward securing better 
work in every school room next year, every superintendent and 
principal should see to it that his teachers are taking this course. 
Circulars giving complete information of reading circle work may 
be secured from the county superintendents or the state superintendent 
in June. 

School Libraries 

The Reading Circle Board has approved numbers of $5, 
and $15 libraries submitted by the various book companies doing 
business in Nebraska under a guaranty bond. Every book in 
these lists was examined before the list was approved. In addition 
to these approved lists, the secretary of the Nebraska </seg>

OFFICIAL CIRCULARS AND NOTIC» 

Public Library Commission has published a list of books suitable 
for school libraries, arranged by grades. Printed copies of all 
these lists may be secured from the county superintendents or 
through this department. Before purchasing a library examine 
these lists. 

Organization of Districts 

All school districts in Nebraska are organized under one of 
five different subdivisions of the school laws ; rural and small 
village school districts are organized under subdivision III with 
a board of three members ; high school districts, with a board of 
six members elected in June, are organized under subdi\ 
VI ; city school districts, with a board of six or nine members 
elected at the municipal election in April are under subdi\ 
XIV; Omaha and South Omaha are organized under subdivisions 
XVII and XI Va, respectively. 

Election of Teachers 

In districts organized under s '^division III no contract 
a teacher shall be valid unless agreed to either by all the members 
of the district board or by two members of such board who 
are not related to the fourth degree to the said teacher and \\ 
terms of office extend beyond the date of the term of school 
contracted for. 

In districts organized under subdivision VI or XIV with a 
board of six members, it requires the affirmative vote of four 
members to elect teachers, and this election may take place at 
any regular meeting or special meeting legally called. 

In districts with a board of five, nine or fifteen membt ; 
requires a majority vote to elect teachers. 

Boards of education in districts organized under subdiv 
XIV, XlVa or XVII, may elect a superintendent for a term not 
to exceed three years. Boards of education in districts organized 
under subdivision III or VI may not elect for a term 1" 
than one year.

School Property 

Urge upon your school boards the necessity of making all 
needed repairs to the school building during the summer vacation, 
in sufficient time that the opening of the school may not 
be delayed in the fall. Should it be necessary for a board to do 
any extensive repairing they should be so authorized by the voters 
of the district in the annual or a special meeting, as the supreme 
court has decided in one case that $80 was too much for a board 
to expend in repairs without authority from the voters of the 
district. This, of course, applies to districts organized under 
subdivisions III and VI. Urge, also, the propriety of keeping the 
school grounds in presentable condition during the long summer 
vacation. Local pride should at least keep down the weeds. 
Be sure that the drinking water is pure when school opens, and 
that the water closets, whether interior or otherwise, are in firstclass 
sanitary condition. 

Your Successor 

If there is ever a time when one's work should be completed, 
accounts of all kinds balanced up, and everything arranged in 
good order, that time is when you are leaving a school and a 
town not to return in the same capacity. You will merit the 
gratitude of your successor, but you are doing no more than your 
duty, if you leave all school affairs in as clear and complete a 
condition as possible. If you are going to a new field, you will </seg>

certainly appreciate such a condition of affairs there, anil whv 
should you not do your part toward your successor? However, 
do not attempt to dictate to him who follows you, but be content 
to let him follow his own judgment. If he asks for your assistance, 
lend a hand. But remember, if he makes a success of 
the school he must do it on his own plans, not yours. Give him 
a clear field, hampered by nothing you have left undone. 

From The Nebraska Teacher for June, 1904 : 

About a month ago the Chief of the Educational Department, 
Philippine Exposition Board, asked for a list of Nebraska teachers 
that he might supply each one with enough copies of a beauti 
fully illustrated booklet descriptive of the Philippines for the 
pupils under his charge. A Nebraska Educational Directory 
mailed him and I presume ere this every superintendent and 
principal in the state has received a supply of these booklets 
for the pupils in the graded schools, and the county superintendents 
for the rural school pupils. If not write said officer at St. 
Louis, Missouri. 

Prof. L. H. Bailey, whom you all remember as the author of 
Principles of Agriculture, has issued "An Appeal to the Teachers 
of New York State." He says : "The problem of the development 
of the rural school is the most important single educational 
problem now before us ; and it is essentially an agricultural problem." 
And he appeals to the city teacher as well as the rural 
teacher, for the city teacher makes public opinion, helps to set 
educational standards and many of the country children go to 
school in the cities. He urges the importance of improving 
the school grounds, school gardens and similar work. 

School districts in Butler county have been the victims of a 
swindler who has been doing business in that part of the country. 
It seems that last fall a stranger purporting to be an agent for 
charts and school supplies sold these districts each a small bill 
of goods. Nothing more was heard of this man or his goods, 
but through a local bank the district that bought $4.75 worth of 
goods was called upon to pay a note having the exact signatures 
of the three members of the board to the amount of $47.50. The </seg>

other districts were called upon to pay notes of different amounts. 
How the man secured the signatures is a mystery to the members 
of the board. The districts have united to fight the payment 
of the notes. 

Lincoln, Nebraska, June 11, 1904. 

My Dear Superintendent : 

Eerewith find blanks for your annual report to this office. This 
&gt;rt should be filed in this office, correct, complete and in all 
ects ready for compilation, on or before August 15. 

I Since the report of this department to the governor, based 
rgely upon the reports of the county superintendents, must 
compiled and printed prior to the meeting of the next legislature, 
on the first Tuesday in January, 1905, it will not be pos- 
Kle for this office to delay the receipt of the reports of the county 
&gt;erintendents, as was done last year. 

Your report will be made up almost entirely of copies of the 
annual reports of the several directors, which are due at your 
office within ten days after the annual district meeting. 

In order to guard against mistakes, omissions, and consequent 
it would be well for you to inspect and verify each dior's 
report at the time of its delivery. To this end satisfy 
yourself: (1) That EVERY ITEM IS REPORTED. (2) 
That TOTAL RECEIPTS balance TOTAL EXPENDITURES. 
(3) That the several items reported are consistent with each 
other. 

Elotice that the CENSUS should be reported by you under 
item "NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN THE DISTRICT 
TWEEN 5 AND 21 YEARS OF AGE." The corresponding 
item in the annual report of the director should be verified by 
checking with the directors census report. 

"Average Daily Attendance" may be taken from the "Term 
Summary," as recorded in the register, or from the duplicate 
report filed with the county superintendent. 

In the case of a joint district, care should be taken to report 
the "Census" of only that part of the district which lies within </seg>

163

your county ; and the, report for such joint district of finances, 
indebtedness, enrollment, etc., in short, all items except the 
"Census" should, to prevent duplications in our tables of statistics, 
be reported only from the county in which the school hoisc 
is located, or if there be no school house in the district, from the 
county in which the director resides. Be careful to designate in 
what counties each joint district is situated, and by what number 
it is known in each county. 

|&gt;hould any district in your county fail, for any reason, to hold 
minimum amount of school required by section 14. subdivin 
II, School Laws, 1903, for that district, be sure to note in 
etter to me the reason for such insufficiency oi school, that, 
t furnish a valid excuse, I may be able to include such district 
the next apportionment of state school funds to your county. 

Eake report of "GENERAL STATISTICS" in figures, and 
t. Do not use "some," "but few," "nearly all" and such 
finite terms. 

iDne of the most fruitful sources of error in the annual re¦t 
of the county superintendent is the practice of copying 
! original report, which has been carefully verified, and forrding 
such copy to this office without verification. While neat-5s 
in these reports is very desirable, accuracy and complete»s 
are the prime requisites. FILL ALL BLANKS, ADD ALL 
)LUMXS AND VERIFY ALL RESULTS, in the copy sent

rindly send in the report of your institute immediately after 
close of the same. 

From The Nebraska Teacher for July, 1904: 

We are pleased to acknowledge receipt of two institute reports, 
Gosper and Johnson counties. We hope many other county superintendents 
will be as prompt. Johnson county enrolled 
eighty-one actual teachers this year and sixty last year. 

Since writing the above we are in receipt of the institute reports 
of Antelope, Chase and York counties.

by a forfeited bond. That county received -from the state apportionment 
$1,888.28, from county fines $111, and from the forfeited 
bond $2,049.97, making a total for the county of $4,049.25. Butler 
county swelled her apportionment of $6,630.76 with $49.10 from 
fines and $1,500 from licenses. 

The registrar of the State Normal School at Peru has written 
Supt. George Crocker of Richardson county as follows: "In 
the order of county representation for the year, either with or 
without the summer school, the following is the rank : Nemaha, 
Douglas, Richardson ; for attendance in the summer school alone, 
the counties rank as follows ; Nemaha, Fillmore and Richardson 
same number, and then follow Johnson, Boone and Gage. We 
are proud of the record Richardson county has seen fit to give 
Kthis year and I notice the attendance has been equally 
good during the two previous years." 

I Two Union Normal Institutes were arranged for this season, 
le for the counties of Burt and Cuming, to be held at Oakland, 
ugust 8, the other for the counties of Madison and Pierce at 
torfolk for the week of June 6. The Norfolk Union Normal was 
decided success, having an enrollment of about 175. The instructors 
were Hon. H. R. Pattengill, Lansing, Michigan ; Supt. 
W. M. Kern, Columbus ; Miss Anna Vander Cook, Council Bluffs, 
Iowa, and Mrs Jeanette Richmond, South Omaha. Mr. Ed 
Amherst Ott of Chicago delivered one of his popular lectures 
during the session. Note the following resolutions adopted 
by this body of teachers : 

We, a committee of experienced teachers of Madison and Pierce 
counties in institute assembled, believing that the best interests 
of the schools of said counties demand that the teachers thereof 
receive salaries equal to the importance of the work they do, 
would respectfully present the following facts and suggestions 
for the consideration of school authorities : 

EMore is being demanded of teachers every year and they 
constantly being required to make more expensive preparafor 
the work of teaching. 

2. There exists a spirit of progress and desire for improvement </seg>

            <seg id="p243">
165 

OFFICIAL CIRCULARS AND NOTICES 

on the part of the great mass of teachers and they are anxious 
to meet the demands of the age. 

3. The majority of teachers receive but $1.50 to $300 per 
for their services, and the increased demands upon them for preparation, 
educational literature, institute and other necessary 
penditures exhaust the entire salary. 

4. The best teachers are constantly leaving the schools because 
they find that they cannot make a living. They receive 
less for the important work of teaching and training the children 
of the county — the most important occupation within our border 
— than does the unskilled farm hand and the kitchen girl. 

S. It is largely for this reason that one-third of our schools 
are filled annually by young and inexperienced teachers ; and that 
greater progress and improvement is not made. 

• &gt;. For these reasons we believe the best interests of the 
schools demand that living wages be paid to teachers ; that school 
boards discriminate between the successful, experienced teacher 
and the beginner; that not less than $35 be paid to any teacher, 
and the salary be increased as the teacher becomes more experienced 
; that beginning teachers should not offer to teach for 
less than this amount ; that the county and state superintendents 
do all in their power to keep such persons from teaching for lower 
wages. 

T. We pledge to do all in our power to further improve 
the quality of teachers and to meet the demands for improvement. 


K. We ask the county superintendent to send a copy of the 
ve statement and suggestions to all the school officers of the 
above counties and to have the same printed in all the newspapers. 


On the train the other day I picked up a copy of a great Chicago 
daily newspaper which condemned editorially and in severe 
terms the proposed harnessing of the power of Niagara Falls. 
This great cataract, it was stated, would one day be a dry precipice, 
while its waters turned the wheels of mills and factories </seg>

            <seg id="p244">
166 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

This shame, this humiliation was prophesied as a direct result 
of "the commercial spirit of the age," and the American people 
were urged to arise in their might and protest against the rape 
of Niagara. Well, they should ! This would furnish a mighty 
interesting topic for a Fourth of July orator. But turning to another 
column of the same newspaper we find a protest against 
the culture side of a public school education, a demand that 
vocal music, drawing, nature study, physical culture, kindergartens, 
"dead"' languages, etc., be stricken out, and that we 
return to the three R's of our fathers (and our mothers), supplemented, 
perhaps, with bookkeeping and other commercial, 
bread-and-butter branches, as demanded by the business men. 
Niagara must not be '"hitched up" for commercial reasons, but 
our children may be "hooked up" and driven over the dry precipice 
of only that knowledge which assists in warming their 
backs and filling their stomachs. Is there no room for the joy 
of life, the study of nature, in the public school? When will 
we reduce our public school curriculum to the three R's? When 
the business man dispenses with the telephone and the typewriter, 
without which he conducted all his business thirty years 

IFhe June institutes have a much better attendance than for 
reral years past. This will enable county superintendents to 
icriminate as they have not been able to do during the past 
o or three years, when in order to supply their school districts 
th teachers they have been under the painful necessity of 
ensing from ninety to one hundred per cent of all applicants 
• certificates. On the other hand, with this more plentiful 
pply of teachers (for so it appears at this writing), we should 
ard against a reduction in the present salaries or even a check 
their upward tendency. If county superintendents license only 
jse who are thoroughly well qualified and competent to ornize, 
manage, discipline and instruct a school as it should be 
ne, there will be no "teachers" out of a job in September. 

Under date of April 16, 1904, one of our county superintendents 
wrote me as follows: "You have ere this received a letter </seg>

            <seg id="p245">
167 


giving full information concerning the library proposition presented 
in this county by Mr. who has friends here among 
our leading citizens, who also recommend him very highly. I find 
him an efficient school man. His proposition to school boards 
is this: A library of forty volumes, well bound in three-fourths 
morocco, plainly printed on tough paper, some books with illustrations, 
and a hard wood bookcase, for $37.50. School boards 
purchasing these libraries sign a bill of purchase and pay for 
the goods when received. Mr. has ordered the books shipped 
to this office so all his business dealings here will be open and 
above board." Under date of June 13, 1904, the same county superintendent 
writes me: "It may be interesting for you to know 
that my library man was, as usual, a failure. I watched him 
closely, found him not exactly honest, and stopped his business. 
A suggestion to brickbat any agent out of the court house hereafter 
will be quite literally carried out." 

Comment would be superfluous. 

Junior Normal Institutes 

The Junior Normal Schools of 1904 opened June 13, at Alliance, 
Holdrege, Me Cook, North Platte and Valentine, under 
the most auspicious circumstances, and with the same principals 
as in 1903, except at Holdrege, where Supt. A. A. Reed of Superior 
succeeded Supt. J. F. Conner. Mr. Frank R. Roberson 
made the rounds of the schools the week of June 20, delighting 
those in attendance with "Norway, the Land of the Midnight 
Sun.' The enrollment the first seven days of the session was

An examination of the above 

table will reveal the fact that 

a few counties in the territory of these schools are not reaping 
their share of the state's beneficence as exhibited in its appropriation 
of twelve thousand dollars for the maintenance and support 
of these schools — at least not yet. But it is hoped that 
every teacher in western Nebraska who feels the need of better 
and higher preparation for her noble calling will attend a Junior 
Normal School or some other institution during a part of the 
summer. Get your share, teacher, and your county's share, 
superintendent, of this free instruction provided by the state of 
Nebraska. 

The second session of the McCook Junior Normal School 
opened at the east ward school building on Monday with a 
larger attendance than last year and with excellent prospects 
of a term of helpful instruction. It is pretty generally known that 
this school is a state institution, supported by appropriations 
made by the legislature. Provision will have to be made by the 
coming legislature for the continuance of the schools and it is 
the hope of the friends of education over the state that such a 
record will be made this year in the five Junior Normal Schools 
as will warrant their re-establishment for another period o.f 
two years. — McCook Republican.

pals of graded schools are still delinquent in their reports. Many 
of the school men are in the mountains or at the seashore, where 
we cannot reach them, but they will receive a "third call" from 
us in September. 

Several county superintendents have already filed with us 
their annual reports for the past school year. As in 1903, Stanton 
county's report came in first and Washington county's second. 
Madison county was the third to report this year and Harlan 
county the fourth. In Stanton county the average school district 
Levy was reduced from 14 mills in 1903 to 11.6 mills in 1904. 
In Washington county the reduction was from 13 mills to 9 
mills; in Madison county from 17 mills to 12 mills, and in Harlan 
county from 19 mills to 15 mills. 

Junior Normal Institutes 

The Junior Normals are doing a work for western Nebraska 
that no other agency could do. The twelve thousand dollars appropriated 
by the last legislature for the support of Junior Normals 
is having a greater influence on the schools than any other 
sum of four times that amount appropriated by any legislature 
of Nebraska. — Valentine Republican. 

A very marked feature of this year's attendance at the Valentine 
Normal is the large per cent of teachers who have had 
some experience. Evidently last year's work demonstrated that 
the normal is a school for vigorous, continuous work where ten 
weeks of honest effort will give valuable results far different from 
those secured at an institute. There is a unanimous feeling in the 
school, frequently expressed, that the present session promises 
to be even more of a success than that of last year. Personally 
I find it very pleasant to be associated with such progressive 
Eing people, striving so earnestly to fit themselves better for 
y in the school room. — G. A. Gregory. 

In an excellent address before the Holdrege Junior State Normal 
School Tuesday Deputy Superintendent McBrien advocated 
the requirement of a reasonable amount of professional training 
before granting even the lowest grade of teacher's certificate, </seg>

with an increase in amount for each of the higher grades. The 
idea met with the hearty approval of those present. The enactment 
of such a law would dignify the profession, placing it 
nearer the professional standing of law and medicine. It would 
make it more attractive to ambitious young teachers, who soon 
desert it for the more stable professions. It would increase the 
wages of those engaged in the work, and would greatly improve 
the efficiency of our schools. The teachers in this section of the 
state are ready for this most important step. — Holdrege Pro- 

gress, July 8. 

Valentine normal instructors and teachers celebrated the sue 

cessful completion of the first half of the term last Saturday 
with a grand excursion and picnic in the beautiful Parry grove, 

ten miles from Valentine, down the Niobrara river 

Hundreds of children in rural and town schools in north Ne- 

braska will be made wiser and happier during the coming year 
as they listen to descriptions of this trip given by teachers who, 
in this normal, are learning to appreciate the value of nature 
studv and how to use it in the school room. — Nebraska State 

Journal. 

The enrollment of the Junior Normal Schools during the 

first six weeks of the session of 1J»O4 is as follows : 

This is a substantial increase in the enrollment at Alliance 

e 

and McCook over the first six weeks of last year. At the other 

schools the enrollment for this period is not as large as in 1903,

Mv De:ir Superintendent 

I hope you will endeavor to secure a greater interest and 
heartier co-operation in reading circle work on the part of city 
superintendents and village, ward and high school principals, 
with the county superintendents than ever before. The two 
books of the course for 1904-1905, Common Sense Didactics for 
Common School Teachers and Geographic Influences in American 
History, are admirably adapted to all grades of teachers, instructors 
and supervisors. If you want additional copies of reading 
circle circulars or enrollment cards, an order by postal card will 
bring them to you. I will supply city superintendents and village 
principals with copies early in September. Let all work together 
in this good cause. Appoint your principals as managers 
of reading circle work for their respective localities. Have, 
if possible, five or six local meetings during the year for each 
section of the county, and about three general meetings. I will 
be pleased to receive from you a letter of general information 
relative to your plans and what you expect to accomplish in 
reading circle work in your county during the year. 

Quite a number of counties now have libraries in a majority 
of their rural schools. How many are there in your county? 
Can you not break the record? Why not set out to have at least 
a five dollar library in every rural school in your county? Pre 
sent the matter to the teachers, earnestly, enthusiastically, and 
send them copies of printed lists of five, ten and fifteen dollar 
libraries approved by the Reading Circle Board of the &gt; 
T. A., with a circular letter of your own containing suggestions.

project. Suggest to those districts that have good libraries 
that they work for a good globe, provided they have none. I have 
been dumfounded at the ignorance displayed in some institutes 
this summer by teachers in attendance, of a practical, working 
knowledge of the simplest elements of mathematical geography. 

ff you have a surplus of teachers in your county this fall, 
if you require more teachers for your schools, kindly notify 
this department of the number. If you have a surplus, please inform 
us how many of them are competent, well qualified, experienced 
teachers, how many are inexperienced, grade of certificate 
held, etc., and we will be pleased to refer same to superintendents 
of counties where there is a scarcity of teachers. 

Questions for August examinations and Junior Normal School 
examinations will be mailed in about ten days, but no examination 
questions will be issued during September and October. 
From The Nebraska Teacher for September, 1904 : 

The determination of "passing" grades for teachers' certificates 
is a difficult matter for many county superintendents. I 
have on my desk a statement from the superintendent of a county 
of Nebraska where an excellent educational spirit prevails, as 
follows: "Second grade certificates must average 85 per cent 
with no grade below 75 per cent." Some superintendents grade 
their teachers' papers so closely that were they to live up to a 
statement like the foregoing they would not have teachers enough 
to fill one-fourth of the school rooms in the county. Where teachers 
are scarce and papers closely graded, giving each exactly 
what it is worth instead of giving the applicant the benefit of a 
doubt in every case, a passing grade of 70 per cent in each branch 
with an average of 80 per cent would seem sufficiently high. 
For first grade certificates these figures might be increased to 
80 and 90 respectively. For third grade certificates it does not 
matter very much what the grades are, for a third grade certificate 
is usually a "permit" for an unqualified, incompetent person, 
at least so far as professional training or special preparation is* 
concerned, to "keep" school for a term or two. In a few counties 
of Nebraska where the supply of teachers has been sufficient. </seg>


            <seg id="p255">
OFFICIAL CIRCULARS AND NOTICES 

the superintendents have eliminated persons who were unable 
to pass a good examination for a second grade certificate. I do 
not deem it wise or advisable to refuse to issue a second grade 
certificate to applicants without experience. One who 
graduate from a three or four-year high school course, who has 
had at least ten weeks' professional training or preparation in 

a summer school, and who can pass a good examination with the 
grades mentioned above should, in my opinion, be granted a 
second grade certificate. 

If the names of any cities or villages in Nebraska employing 
two or more teachers were omitted from the Educational Directory 
for the past school year I would be pleased to be informed 
of the fact, although such omissions, if there were any, were 
probably due to the fact that the principals of the towns failed 
to report to this office even after a fourth request. 

Supt. J. M. Richardson of Antelope county has published a 
very complete and concise school directory which contains opposite 
the number of each school district the names of the school 
officers with their postoffice addresses. There is also a complete 
list of the teachers of the county with their postoffice addresses, 
and many valuable statistics with a summary of the same, a list 
of books in use in the county, and a list of supplies furnished 
by the county superintendent. Supt. Frank Pilger of Pierce 
county publishes a little pamphlet of the school officers' association 
containing constitution and by-laws, approved school 
rules and regulations, and uniform text books recommended 
for use in the county, etc. Th'ose interested in these publications 
should write the county superintendents for a copy. This department 
would be pleased to receive copies of all similar publications, 
including outlines for county reading circle work. 

In an educational journal I notice an advertisement of "The 
Acme Library," consisting of forty volumes which will be sent 
by freight or express to any address for $7.80. The advertisement 
states that the volumes are of uniform size, printed from 
large, clear type on good paper and bound in cloth. An examination 
of the titles reveals the fact that they are almost identical </seg>

with the libraries that are being sold in many Nebraska school 
districts by irresponsible concerns for from $37.50 to $45. 

The Union Normal Institute of Burt and Cuming' counties, 
held at Oakland, August 8-13, was a great success. The attendance 
was nearly 200. The high school room was cleared of 
desks and seated with chairs. One of the recitation rooms adjoining 
was used as a reception room with rocking chairs and a 
table, and adjoining it was a reading room for teachers' periodicals. 
Ice water was provided in immense stone jars, and there 
were flowers, palms and flags in great profusion. An art exhibit 
was one of the features of the institute. Heavy straw boards 
for lap use were provided in lieu of desks in the assembly room. 
The instructors were Superintendent Pearse of Milwaukee ; 
Messrs. E. J. Hoenshel and Ed C. Bishop of Lincoln, and Miss 
Anna .Vander Cook of Council Bluffs. On Monday evening a 
reception was held in the high school room, which was attended 
by many of Oakland's best citizens, and where light refreshments 
were served. Senator Dolliver lectured Tuesday evening, and 
other entertainments were provided for each of the following 
three evenings. Superintendents Brookings and Stahl are to 
be congratulated, for certainly "things educational" will now 
move in Burt and Cuming counties as never before. 

At this writing (August 22) we are in receipt of annual reports 
for the past school year from fifty of the ninety county superintendents 
of the state. There will undoubtedly be a few delinquents 
September 1. 

Final reports of the enrollment and other matters relative to 
the Junior Normal Schools will appear next month. There was 
so much work connected with the closing of these schools that 
we could not prepare their reports in time for this issue. The 
total enrollment was approximately 1,100.

ditions now prevailing in school affairs in Nebraska, and to extend 
to you our best wishes for the greatest success in public 
education that has ever been known in voiir community. 

In previous greetings from this office we have counseled you relative 
to your attitude toward your predecessor as well as your 
successor. We have urged upon you the importance of securing 
the support of your board of education. We have advised you 
on the support, criticism and praise of your teachers. We have 
written of your relation to your pupils as one of the forces which 
make or destroy a superintendent or principal. We have pleaded 
for a greater care of school property. We have sounded the alarm 
against the marauding library and chart agent. We have warned 
the smaller schools against carrying a heavier course of study 
than is consistent with the size of the town. W r e have tried to 
make it understood that the eighth grade is the place for tin 
isfactory, intelligent completion of all common school subjects, 
and that it is no disgrace for a pupil to remain there two 
in order to do thorough work. We have argued as best we could 
for a more comprehensive, minute and practical study of English. 
In all schools we have advised placing rhetoricals above 
athletics. We have made war on the infernal cigarette. We have 
emphasized the necessity of having the co-operation of the home 
in your school work. These are questions which are always confronting 
us. Eternal vigilance is the pfice to be paid in mastering 
them. We bespeak your hearty co-operation in a proper 
solution of these problems. Pardon us for repeating more at 
length some of our previous suggestions, and permit us to call

Courses of Study 

The following courses of study and suggestions are taken 
largely from the Nebraska High School Manual, issued jointly 
by the University of Nebraska and this department. For schools 
employing two or three teachers, a one-year high school course 
is all that should be attempted ; four to six teachers, a two-year 
course ; six to eleven teachers, a three-year course ; eleven or more 
teachers, a four-year course. Suggestive course for Ninth grade ; 
mathematics, Latin (or reviews and agriculture), bookkeeping 
and physical geography, civics and English. Tenth grade ; mathematics, 
Caesar (or ), general history, botany and English. 
Eleventh grade; mathematics, Cicero (or ), physics and English, 
. The University and the state department urge upon 
all principals and superintendents the importance of maintaining 
breadth and symmetry as well as thoroughness in their high 
school curricula. Courses of any length which omit important 
rs of study, such as English, mathematics, history and science, 
not to be encouraged. 

Reading Circle Work 

We enclose herewith a reading circle circular for the current 
school year, and we desire to call your attention to the fact 
that we have for this year's work the two best and the best 
two books that have ever been adopted for reading circle work 
in this state. Common Sense Didactics for Common School 
Teachers and Geographic Influences in American History are ad 
mirably adapted to all grades of teachers, instructors and supervisors. 
We hope you will see your way clear to co-operate 
this year with your county superintendent and other city superintendents 
and village principals in your county in this good 
cause. In The Nebraska Teacher for August you will see a few 
preliminary outlines on Sabin's Common Sense Didactics pre-

A Teachers' Book Review Club 

I The State Teachers' Reading Circle books should be read and

ge through the county and city superintendents and principals. 
:&gt;th books are professional in their nature, and the study of them 
ill undoubtedly prove an aid and inspiration to any teacher. 
it we desire to suggest another plan of book study, supplcentary 
to the reading circle work, but in no sense a substitution 
erefor. In the cities now among the women's clubs then

a review of the story, how much more intense would your interest 
be, how much more you would get out of the narrative ; instead 
of "skimming" you would be reflecting; you would note the good 
points, the apt illustrations, the suggestions that appeal to reason, 
to a more rational view of child life in its relations to school. 
Each teacher should read eight or ten such books every year, 
and she may do so without purchasing more than one or two of 
them. Organize a circle or a club of a dozen members with the 
understanding that each member is to purchase one or more 
books during the year and review at least one book ; then exchange 
books at the meetings. You may borrow these books of 
the Nebraska Public Library Commission, State House, Lincoln, 
but in these borrowed copies you must not make marginal notes. 
While reading a book to review in the meeting make notes freely, 
marginal if your own book, or in a note book. Marginal notes 
are valuable for those who read the books after you, and on the 
first fly leaf you may enter the numbers of the pages to which 
you wish to refer in your review. Take notes in the meetings of 
the views and reviews presented by others for reference when you 
read the book, and be sure to question the reviewer. Further dc 
tails of this plan may be worked out to suit local conditions :

published on many of the books, but the transportation charges 
vould be greater. Relative to this matter, The Century Company, 
of New York, writes : "Your plan for expanding the Nebraska 
State Teachers' Reading Circle by means of a fiction 
library is an excellent one, and we shall be glad to do anything 
we can to further it. The successful enterprises along this line 
seem to be those that have the active support of the state and 
local school authorities, which we presume you will be able to 
enlist." 

Principal T. A. Blakeslee, of Giltner, writes: "I am greatly 
pleased with the reading circle books of this year. In my estimation 
they are the best that have been adopted since I have been 
in the profession — nine years. The Giltner division, comprising 
eighteen districts, had the reputation of doing the best reading 
circle work in the county last year. We are going to try to maintain 
that record this year." 

Supt. W. T. Stockdale, of Wisner, writes : "During the last 
three years all of my teachers, with a single exception during 
one year, have done the reading circle work. Books this year 
are excellent." 

Valley county has entered upon a royal campaign for the 
State Reading Circle work, with every teacher enlisted. Among 
other forward movements for Valley county's progressive superintendent 
and teachers are: A library for every school, agriculture, 
a Boys' Agricultural Club and a Girls' Home Improvement 
Club, Outdoor and Indoor Art and improved attendance on the 
part of pupils. 

Every child in Nebraska schools should know by heart the 
words of "America," "The Star Spangled Banner" and 
braska" from beginning to end. 

"Rules and Regulations for the Schools of Boone County" 
are excellent. We especially commend Rule 8: "No teacher 
shall allow any person to enter the school, while it is in session, 
for the purpose of exhibiting any book, apparatus, or any other 
article for sale to teachers and pupils, except upon the written 
permission of the director." Write C. M. Penney, Albion, for

work will be so well done that you will be found in the - 
school another year." We might go a step further and say : 
hope your work will be so well done that you will be found in 
the same school throughout the year. Too many teachers change 
schools, too many schools change teachers, during the school 
year. Only two Washington county school rooms changed teachers 
during the past school year, and one of them was in town 
and caused by a resignation. 

Eupt. Chas. L. Coons, of Clay county, has sent excellent cirirs 
to his teachers and school officers. Twenty districts in 
t county have increased the teacher's salary and nine have inised 
the number of months of school from eight to nine. 

Supt. C. S. Wortman, of Cass county, says to his teachers and 
school directors : "Reading circle work is expected of even 
teacher in the county. Lawyers have their bar meetings ; physicians 
have their medical meetings ; preachers have their ministerial 
meetings. Ten times more important than any of these, 
that those who labor in the school room with the child mind 
also have their meetings. So impressed am I with the necessity 
of this work for teachers, that I uniformly refuse to endorse any 
grades on a teacher's certificate the second year if she has not put 
forth an effort to perform this needful duty the previous year. In 
a few bad cases I have gone further than this, and have absolutely 
refused to grant a certificate to such a teacher under any circumstances. 
On the other hand, it is my custom to endorse good 
certificates in their entirety when the holder thereof^has made 
commendable efforts in this work. 

We are in receipt of thirteen excellent photographs of as 
many school houses in Dundy county, from the superintendent. 
Miss C. Estella Goodwin. Among them are those of the only sod

STATK SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

Teachers' Association, and another of the Pierce County School 
Officers' Association. 

f aunty Superintendents' Annual Reports are "for the year 
ng second Monday of July, 190 — " and should not be held 
statistics of teachers examined or licensed during July and 
August. Close up business the second Monday of July, compile 
your report and send it in during July, as some superintendents 
do^ 

Read "Educational Possibilities for the Country Child," by 
County Superintendent O. J. Kern, Rockford, Illinois, an address 
delivered before the N. E. A. at St. Louis. It was published 
in The School Journal, New York, July 2, 1904. 

You should see Supt. Hyland's "Things that Shoud Be and 
As I Shall Expect to See Them When Visiting Your Schools," 
to Stanton county teachers. I like Hyland's Anglo-Saxon ! His 
specific directions are good. Read his folder. 

Burt county is one of the thoroughly organized counties of 
the state in all lines of educational endeavor. Supt. Brookings' 
circulars are pithy, practical, progressive and helpful. 

I The Western Nebraska Educational Association will meet in 
rtober, at Ogalalla. Supt. B. K. Bushee, of Kimba.ll county

Ehe corner stone of the new State Normal School building at

A. M., some time in October. 

Brown, Uawes, Frontier, Harlan, Kimball, Madison, Red Wiland 
Sioux counties report the need of a few more teachers 
for their schools this fall. Cedar, Colfax, Douglas, Hall, Lanr 
and Valley counties report a surplus of experienced 
teachers. 

We hope to finish the Nebraska Educational Directory, October 
15th, but in order to do so we must have the county superintendents' 
annual reports, from which we copy the census, 
enrollment and average attendance of the graded schools for 
the Directory. 

With an excellent circular letter Supt. Baker of Kearney county </seg>

sends two blanks to his teachers, asking in one about their preparation 
for reading circle work and professional reading generally, 
and in the other : Has your school a library ? How many books ? 
A bookcase? A record of books, their use, and condition? etc. 
In his circular letter he says: We expect every teacher in the 
county to enroll in the reading circle this year. We hope that 
the majority of teachers may have the pleasure of doing the work 
with a circle, but there is no reason why a teacher cannot do the 
work if it is not possible to belong to a circle, as the work is highly 
interesting and helpful. Of course, I maintain that it is more 
advantageous to belong to a circle if possible. Supt. Baker 
further says : Our county teachers should be at our first meeting 
(October 1st) to welcome our new teachers from other counties, 
and thus make them feel at home with us ; and our new teachers 
should be there to become acquainted with Kearney county 
teachers, and bring with them helpful suggestions which they 
used in their home counties. 

Eupt. Bottenfield will worry the "born short" spelin' people in 
rkolls county again this year. We do not think there will be 
of the careless kind left in that county after 1905. Pronunion 
and definition of words will also be emphasized. 

The Public School, a monthly publication devoted to the educational 
interests of Butler county, is now in its fifth year. Butler 
county is divided into seven sections for association and reading 
circle work. 

Lincoln, Nebraska, September 24, 1904. 

My Dear Superintendent:

and courses of study, and your circulars and circular 
ters to teachers and patrons. 

The finest Teachers' Reading Circle note book with printed 
headings and general information that we have seen comes 
from York county, Charles O. Stewart, superintendent. York

of professional advancement, and the reading circle is </seg>

Eepartment of the county association. Local divisions meet 
nthly at eleven different points in the county, and there are 
&gt; general annual meetings in the city of York. 

A sample foot note to some of the graded school reports recently 
received : The above figures are estimates only ; all records 
are missing. — Yours? And another: I cannot fill out 
upper half of report because I cannot find attendance or any 
other records of the last principal. 

What would you do with a principal who reported a larger 
average daily attendance than the total enrollment? With one 
whose totals seldom equaled the sum of males and females? 
With one who cannot correctly figure out average monthly 
salary of teachers ? There are such teaching school in Nebraska, 
as we know to our sorrow and humiliation. 

Supt. Dan H. Fishburn of Hall county has sent his teachers 
a "sermon" that will keep them awake for an entire year. There 
is a superintendent who keeps in touch with his schools, and 
one whose teachers are in harmony with him. He furnishes his 
teachers with copies of School Rules and Regulations, Text Books 
in Use, Suggestive Program and Outlines, Report Cards, Certificates 
of Attendance, etc. His plans for reading circle work 
are especially good. Hall county has had four Eighth Grade 
Graduating Classes from her rural schools. 

KJnder the compulsory attendance act, pupils are required to 
end school from their seventh birthday to their fifteenth birthday. 
Pupils fifteen years of age are exempt from its provisions. 

Eupt. Koch of Seward county says : I am happy to say that our 
t teachers, teachers who hold the best positions and receive 
best pay, have been most faithful in association and reading 
circle work the past three years. Many principals of our town 
schools are urgent believers in reading circle work, and the success 
that has been made in this line is due largely to their untiring 
efforts. Every teacher will be expected to do the reading 
circle work this year. 

Now is the time of year when the teachers in the rural communities 
should know of the traveling libraries and of the ad- </seg>

vantages offered by the state through the Nebraska Public Library 
Commission. During the summer months the demand for 
libraries greatly decreases, for then the people in the rural districts 
are too busy to do much reading. At present there are 
twenty-four libraries in the office ready for use. These libraries 
may be used to good advantage in any rural community if the 
teacher possess the proper spirit. The library will serve as a 
nucleus for a school library and through it the parents of the 
pupils may be reached. Half of each library is for adults and the 
other half for children. The commission will be glad to loan to 
the farmers and their wives, for winter reading and study, books 
on home and farm topics. These can be sent in the traveling 
library box, without additional expense. A list of special loan 
books on these topics will be gladly sent to any one who may 
desire it. Please impress upon the teachers in your county that 
the only expense attached to the traveling libraries is the transportation, 
which includes twenty-five cents drayage and freight 
both ways. The commission will be glad to supply the county 
superintendents with any number of application blanks they may 
be able to use, to be distributed among their teachers. Any information 
concerning the traveling libraries and special loans 
will be promptly given, if inquiry is made of Miss Edna D. 
Bullock, secretary, State House, Lincoln. 

Supt. Frank Pilger of Pierce county will revoke the certificate 
of any teacher within his jurisdiction who breaks his or her contract 
with a district. He believes the school boards should be protected 
in this matter. 

There are ninety-four school rooms in Pierce county, and 
eighty are furnished with maps, twenty-seven with globes and 
thirty-three with libraries. 

Supt. Penney of Boone county wrote several days ago that 
ninety-four of their teachers had enrolled in the reading circle 
work and he expected the few remaining ones to do likewise 
in a few days.

Judging from the demands made upon young men and women 
by the business world when they enter its school, I am constrained 
to say that the habits boys and girls form while attending 
school are of a» much value as the things they learn from 
books. Have you ever thought what it means to a pupil to be attending 
to the business of going to school so closely that he 
will be in his place exactly on time, every day, for the entirf 
school year.' We have pupils in school now who have not 
been ab.-tnt or tardy for ten years. The habit these pupils must 
have formed of attending strictly to the business in hand appeals 
4-tronger to the business world than what they learned from 
their books. Parents, in a way, appreciate this fact, but not all 
parents, for if they did some of our pupils would certainly be 
more regular in their attendance. Why not appeal to the boys 
and girls themselves? — Blair School Notes. 

Supt. Pilgcr of Pierce county not only attends his own teachers" 
meetings at Pierce, Plainview and Osmond, but with some 
of his teachers attends and takes part in the meetings at Randolph 
in the southwestern corner of Cedar county. He writes : I should 
like to know the plans of other superintendents. Very few senrl 
me their circulars. I always mail my school paper and circulars 
to surrounding superintendents. Mrs. Dobson and Mr. Ward are 
the best exchanges I have. 

Iiupt. H. E. Bradford of Chadron writes: We found things 
in good shape by Supt. Poucher and were able to get our bears 
pretty well before school began. We have a strong corps 
teachers. Our board is certainly giving us a chance to get 
ults. They made all necessary repairs and improvements 
1 ordered necessary text books. They bought a set of relief 
ps, expended $100 for physical apparatus, and $30 for a n-fer:e 
library in history. But the best of all are their plans for

Supt. Baker of Kearney county says there is no one tea 
in his county this fall for less than $33.00 a month, and threefifths 
of his teachers receive $40.00 or more a month. 

After two weeks in the field Supt. Brookings of Burt county 
writes an excellent letter to his teachers, dated September 19, 
in which he discusses many topics: He states that district Xo. 
26, Nina Bennett, teacher, has one of the neatest and cleanest 
rooms and that the board had the building in excellent condition 
before school opened. He says of Uniformity: The uniform 
list of books has been introduced into the schools the past 
much faster than I had expected. Teachers, patrons and the 
board members are well pleased with the plan. We cannot 
estimate the great amount of good "uniformity" is doing for our 
schools. Supt. Brookings also suggests that teachers introduce 
system into every part of their work, and keep a note book or 
"plan" book. 

Lincoln, Nebraska, September 27, 1904. 

My Dear Superintendent: 

On the following pages of this circular is a statistical table 
compiled from reports from the county superintendents of the 
state. These reports were received in answer to the following 
questions: Have you a county school officers' organization? 
Have you adopted rules and regulations for the schools of your 
county? Have you adopted the State' Course of Study? Have 
you county uniformity of text books? Do you publish a county 
educational or school journal ? Have you organized Teachers' 
Reading Circles? Into how many Reading Circle sections is the </seg>

county divided? Have you adopted for reading circle purpose* 
Sabin's Common Sense Didactics? Brigham's Geographic Inflm-nces 
in American History"' Any current events periodical? 
About what per cent of your schools have libraries? How many 
eighth grade graduates did you have in your county this past 
spring or summer — Boys? Girls? Will you hold eighth grade 
graduating exercises in 1905? How do teachers' salaries compare 
with those paid last year? 

Figures are given where possible in answer to the above 
questions. The " * " indicates an affirmative reply, while 
a blank indicates a negative reply or no answer. In the last column 
H means higher, S means the same, and a figure indicates 
the average monthly increase in salaries in dollars. 

One of the most gratifying exhibits of county school organization 
is the large number of counties that intend to emphasize 
next year the importance and value of graduation from the eighth 
grade of rural and village schools. Many of these counties will 
hold uniform examinations for the eighth grad^? of all village and 
rural schools, and graduating exercises at one or more central 
points in the county. 

In the text book uniformity column I have included with those 
that have adopted it whole, while others that are approaching it, 
that have it approximately, or that have recommended 11 list of uniform 
text books that are to be introduced as rapidly as the old 
books are worn out with use. 

A majority of the counties that have School Officers' A 
ciations bold meetings of the association, annually, while many 
others meet twice a year. Pierce and York counties hold three 
meetings a year. Many superintendents that do not now have 
these associations announce in their reports a determination to 
organize this year. Two superintendents inform us that they 
have tried two or three times but gave it up because they failed 
to get more than twenty-five per cent of their officers to attend. 
It seems to me that twenty per cent would be a splendid 
beginning. It would be well for all counties to hold at least one

iiiscuss the new school laws enacted by the Legislature of 
5, and plans for and the duties of the annual school district 
:ting. Had this been done in 1903, fewer districts would be 
rived this year of their apportionment of state school 
leys on account of not holding the amount of school required 
section 14 of subdivision II, as amended in 1903. 

tfew counties are using the Illinois Course of Study, and 
t, Clay, Douglas and Wayne counties have their own 
rses of Study. 

Sixty-nine of the counties in Nebraska that have reported 
have uniformity of text books, in whole or in part. Sixty-nine 
county superintendents favor it, twelve oppose it, and the others 
give equivocal replies or fail to answer the question at all. One 
superintendent interprets uniformity to mean that when books 
are once adopted they can never be changed and she wants her 
county to adopt the best of the new books as they appear. This, 
however, can be done more rapidly with county uniformity 
than without it. Three superintendents favor uniformity as a 
means of getting rid of the many old, out-of-date text books 
still in use in *heir counties. One superintendent says it is a 
good thing in every way if you could control the book companies. 
And another in the same part of the state says of favoring 
uniformity: In theory, yes; in practice, no; on account 
of the work of the book companies. Another says uniformity has 
a narrowing effect on teacher and pupil. And two others say: 
Teachers should teach the subject and not the book ; one of them 
adds, all one-book teachers get into a rut. One superintendent 
is opposed to uniformity because he "thinks it is a graft," 
while still another thinks it better " to recommend text books 
to school boards" direct from his office ! The county uniformity 

list comes usually from a committee. 

tMany of the superintendents who favor text book uniformity 
e very emphatic in their approval of it. Following is a brief 
mmary of the reasons, many of which were given by a number 

of superintendents: Systematizes work, makes possible many

helps from the superintendent, aids in supervision, helps in 
grading schools, makes grading rural schools possible, convenience 
and economy, assists pupils going from school to school, 
makes more work possible, increases efficiency of superintendent 
and teacher and pupil, best means to eliminate old books, makes 
close supervision possible, makes work more uniform, there's 
strength and power in uniform and systematic work, makes 
use of course of study possible, places examinations and graduation 
from the eighth grade on the same level, unifies school work, 
good thing in every way, lessens chance of obsolete books being 
used, good for young teachers, uniformity in classification, introduces 
new and up-to-date books, easier to get book stores 
and drug stores to keep books on hand under unifom.ity as 
they then do not need to have such a variety of texts, easier to 
get someone to handle books, have a much better grade of books, 
better results, only way to make course of study effective, prevents 
green teachers from selecting some old book each term, 
teachers may be more definitely instructed at county institute, 
school boards know what to get and where to get it, teachers 
in new schools are familiar with texts from beginning, advantageous 
from every point of view. 

I wuld like to suggest that county superintendents who publish 
an educational or school journal place all other county 
superintendents that do the same and this department also on 
their general mailing list. 

Although the report of Reading Circle organization and work 
is very gratifying, it will be even more so when all reports are 
in. Several superintendents reported that they would take up 
the matter at their first county teachers' association this fall. 
A number of superintendents report that two general or county 
Reading Circle meetings will be held during the year, while others 
report four, three, one of none. Where less than two general 
meetings are held, it is usually because there are a large number 
of local or section meetings. Colfax, Rock and Stanton county 
superintendents do not hold Reading Circle meetings, but conduct </seg>

the work by correspondence, with written questions and answers 
or note books. Among some of the county adoptions for Reading 
Circle work are The Nebraska Teacher, The Little Chronicle, 
The Pathfinder, Our Times, Primary Teacher, Silas Cobb, Phelps 
and His Teachers and Seeley's New School Management. While 
some county superintendents think one book is enough for Reading 
Circle work, others want three. 

The report of the per cent of libraries in the rural schools, 
though an excellent one, is decidedly mixed. Some superintendents 
report five per cent of their schools thus provided, while 
others report ninety-five per cent. In connection with this question 
we asked: What per cent have wall maps? An unabridged 
dictionary? A globe? A goodly majority of superintendents 
reported from fifty to one hundred per cent of their schools 
provided with wall maps; four reported one hundred per cent, 
six reported forty per cent, fifteen reported thirty per cent or less, 
and twenty failed to report on this item. The report on unabridged 
dictionaries was, in general, from ten to twenty per cent 
poorer than that on wall maps. Antelope and York counties reported 
ninety-five per cent of their schools with dictionaries. 

Id according to reports there are less than 2,000 globes in the 
00 rural schools of Nebraska. Several superintendents report 
5 than fifteen per cent of their schools to be so provided. And 
.t reminds us that a school supply agent who has an admirable 
tare on globes, having relieved himself of the same at one 
our institutes this past summer, was assured by one of the 
&gt;spcctive teachers in attendance, a Nebraska school girl, of 
• delight in listening to him and looking upon a school globe 
the first time in her life ! 

The county superintendents' annual reports now being checked 
over in this office, so far as examined, show a substantial increase 
in teachers' salaries for the school year ending July, 1904, 
compared with the year ending July, 1903. Increase in salaries 
herein given is for this fall compared with the past year. 
They are estimates, largely, and very liberal ones, too, for I fear </seg>

            <seg id="p282">

STATE SUPfcBINTKNDENT's EKPOBT 

some superintendents do not realize what a very substantial increase 
an average of five dollars a month is, — five dollars a month 
increase in every district, on an average. One superintendent 
reported from $5.00 to $7.50 average increase. 

The statistical table is incomplete in some particular but 
with the aid of the county superintendents we hope to complete 
it, and it will be published in the Eighteenth Biennial Report of 
this department. </seg>

OFFICIAL CIRCULARS AND NOTICES 

From The Nebraska Teacher for October, 1904 

The enrollment of active members of the N. E. A. at St. Louis 
from the state of Nebraska exceeded the enrollment from any 
of the South Atlantic, South Central, or Western Division of 
states, and of the New England states with the exception of 
Massachusetts, and Kansas, and in the largest associate membership 
Nebraska ranked eleventh. 

The Nebraska Educational Directory for the current school 
year we hope to distribute October 15, but as we have experienced 
the usual difficulty in gathering data for this important 
and highly prized publication, it may be a few days later. The 
names of a few villages will not appear, as we have not been able 
to secure any information from their principals of schools, even 
after four "calls." Perhaps they haven't any schools, or their 
schools haven't any principals. 

Supt. A. E. Ward writes that a special effort will be made 
to secure the attendance of practically all Cedar county teachers 
at the Nebraska State Teachers' Association in Omaha this winter. 
Superintendent Ward says : It will be convenient for them 
to reach Omaha and I shall urge them to attend." The teachers 
in all the counties in northeastern Nebraska through which runs 
the C, St. P., M. &amp; O. railway will find Omaha more convenient 
than Lincoln for the N. S. T. A., and Washington, Burt, Cuming, 
Thurston, Dakota, Dixon, Wayne and Cedar county teachers 
should turn out en masse this year. 

The Seventeenth Biennial Report of this department contained 
photographs of nearly 200 school buildings in the state of Nebraska. 
In the Eighteenth Biennial Report we hope to include 
as many more. Kindly send us a photograph of your school 
building or of the pupils or any interior views that you may have 
on hand, and remember us when you have any new ones taken. 
We would like to have a photograph of every school house 
erected in Nebraska during the biennium. Your school building 
should be included in this collection as it costs you nothing 
but the photograph and a postage stamp.

should characterize the entire school year. Ask your teachers 
to begin with the first day of school to interest pupils and patrons 
in the school library. Make Library Day, October 21, a 
red letter day. 

Erge your teachers to examine thoroughly all books bought 
the school library, and to read as many of them as possible, 
: they may thus keep in touch with their pupils.

Lincoln, Nebraska, October 1, 1904. 

My Dear Superintendent : 

Peru, Nebraska, has the best natural setting of any state normal 
school in the United States. It overlooks the Missouri river and 
valley, is on the highlands far above the town and valley, is on 
the crest of the hill looking off in both directions, is in the forest 
primeval, with a large variety of noble trees ; the grounds are 
an ever-changing dip and tip of hill and vale ; there are sixty 
acres in the forest grounds of the school. I only know sixtyfour 
of the state normal schools, and many of these have beautiful 
grounds, but no one of them has sixty such acres as these. </seg>




            <seg id="p289">
If one of the normal schools that I do not know has superior 
grounds, it would be interesting to know of it. — Dr. A. E. 
Winship. 

Every school district in Nebraska that can afford it, that is, 
that does not tax itself to the limit allowed under the law, should 
have— 

A flag 

A flag staff. 

An unabridged dictionary 

A school globe. 

A set of wall maps. 

A good school library 

A library bookcase. 

E/ill you not organize to secure one or more of these essen-5 
this year for every school in your county, or every school 
se in your city? 

Supt. E. Wood Smith, of Nance county, has issueH some excellent 
circular letters this fall to his teachers and school officers. 
He furnishes his school officers with a blank to be filled out and 
returned to him after they visit their school, a "Report of School 
District Board, District No " It is certainly suggestive, 
even though it may cause some school officers a little worry and 
perhaps occasion some hesitancy about visiting their school. 

All Hooker county, 24 by 30 miles in extent, is divided into 
three and one-half school districts, with by far the larger part 
in district No. 2, the Mullen district. In Mullen there is a new 
four-room frame school house, and in the outskirts of this district 
there are four new frame one-room school houses. There 
are pupils in attendance at Mullen from Hooker, Cherry and 
McPherson counties. A half or one-half district is a fractional 
district, lying partly in one county and partly in another. 

Ei many towns in Nebraska it is a problem how to get the 
th grade graduates into the high school. Not so in Blair, 
of last year's eighth grade graduates, who have not moved 
i town, are in the high school this year, with the exception </seg>

P girls; and one of these, perhaps all three, will be in 
;xt week. With us it is more of a problem how to keep 
jvers in the seventh and eighth grades in school after 
e reached the age of fifteen. — Blair School Notes, Sep-1904. 


And of the fifty-eight pupils who finished the eighth grade 
in Blair in June, 1898, fifty-two entered the ninth grade in the 
high school early in September, 1898, and another one entered 
later. Two others of that class had removed from Blair during 
the summer and were in school elsewhere. 

You probably read in the daily papers of September 23 and 
24 of the awful disaster and fatality that overtook nine or more 
little school g'rls in an outbuilding of a school house near Cincinnati, 
who were precipitated into a vault below because of 
the criminal negligence of those in authority in not examining 
the condition of these buildings and replacing the rotten timbers 
in the flooring. There are outbuildings of school houses in Nebraska, 
undoubtedly, that require attention, and it is your duty 
to inspect them and report to the board, verbally or in writing, 
any conditions that demand immediate action on their part. 
And in calling your atention to this matter, permit me to again 
call your attention to the fact that not only are some outLr 1 tidings 
a menace to life and limb, but there are other condition- there, 
which we ignore because we have become accustomed tr» them. 
Do the outbuildings rival those at many railroad depots and 
hotels as breeders of immorality and vice? Are they dens of 
pollution that, through obscene writings and marks, are filling 
the minds of the little ones with wickedness, hardening and 
callousing their minds to purity of thought, word and deed? 
Think on these things, and act ! 

The president of the Superintendents and Principals' Association, 
Superintendent W. H. Bartz, of Alliance, plans to hold a 
round table meeting in the afternoon of Thursday, October 20, 
just pieceding the regular meeting of the Association, partly 
for the benefit of the county superintendents of the state. There

Lincoln, Nebraska, October 10, 1904. 

Necessary School Legislation. 

Abotit a month ago the county superintendents of Nebraska 
were asked the following questions : 1 — What new school laws 
should be enacted ? 2 — What laws should be repealed? 3 — What 
laws should be amended? How? 4 — How should the Junior 
Normal School law be amended? 5 — What should be enacted 
in the line of higher qualifications for teachers? 6 — Do you favor 
the repeal of the transfer law (Sec. 4a, Subd. V) ? And answers 
have been received from 86 of the 90 county superintendents 
of the state ; but many of them answer only one or two of the six 
questions. 

In answer to the first question, what new school laws should 
be enacted ? one superintendent says : "Laws to give power to 
enforce something." Agreed ! Two or three superintendents 
answer : "None ; too many laws now." There is no question 
about our having too many laws and too much law, but we need 
some better ones, we should repeal some poor and "dead" ones, 
and we should amend others. Among the suggestions received 
in answer to the first question were the following: Educational 
qualifications, a four-year term, and a deputy for the county 
superintendent; county superintendent's term should begin the 
second Monday of July; school warrants should not outlaw in 
less than ten years ; a free county high school ; minimum salaries 
for teachers ; grading salaries according to qualifications ; music 
as a requirement for second grade certificate ; permitting issuance 
of certificates at any time ; examinations quarterly, minimum 
age limit for teachers ; state board of examiners for all applicants 
for all kinds and grades of teachers' certificates ; placing all railroad 
taxes and saloon licenses in county school fund ; more 
equitable distribution of state school moneys ; a county auditor 
for the examination of all school district officers' books, particularly 
those of treasurers ; fining officers who fail to report within 
specified time. (We rise to amend the last suggestion by including 
superintendents, principals and teachers with school officers.) 

In answer to the second question, what laws should be re- </seg>

            <seg id="p293">
205 


pealed? one superintendent proposes a wholesale elimination by 
answering : "Those not enforced." Two or three superintendents 
ask for the repeal of authority to issue third grade certificates, 
but they surely do not understand the conditions that prevail in 
other counties. It would be more sensible to ask for authority 
to issue fourth grade certificates to meet the conditions in some 
parts of the state. When the supply of teachers largely exceeded 
the demand, superintendents could and did eliminate from the 
ranks the class of teachers that were formerly granted third 
grade certificates, but when superintendents are compelled to 
»snse ninety per cent or more of all applicants for certificates, 
all attendants at the county institute, good, indifferent and too 
many poor, it seems unwise to reduce the young people with 
widely varied talents and ability to two classes only — those granted 
first grade certificates and those granted second grade. Five 
superintendents demand the repeal of the law granting graduates 
of the common school course at the State and recognized 
normal schools an elementary two-year state certificate, and 
four others demand the repeal of all laws permitting the recognition 
of private institutions, particularly private normal schools, 
whereby they become empowered to issue state certificates. The 
elementary two-year state certificate has been the means of drawing 
hundreds if not thousands of young people to the normal 
schools fo'r thirty-six weeks of professional training and certainly 
it would not be wise to withdraw this incentive. If these 
young people have not a sufficient amount of academic instruction 
or knowledge of the common branches when they enter upon 
this course of professional training, then raise the standard of 
admission to the course, but let us take no backward step. Some 
superintendents say the holders of these elementary state certificates 
do not compare favorably in education with the holders of 
End grade county certificates, and one superintendent says 
when the state certificate of one of his teachers expired at 
the end of two years she was unable to pass a satisfactory examination 
for a second grade county certificate. Surely this was an 
exceptional case, for an ordinarily bright girl without either </seg>

            <seg id="p294">
206 

8TATK BUPKRINTKNDENT'b REFOKT 

high school education or normal training should, after two 
years' experience teaching school, be able to pass a satisfactory 
examination for a county certificate. It seems to me the proper 
course to pursue would be to raise the standard for admission to 
the training course, as it is called at the normal schools, or extend 
it to two years as it used to be. Personally I believe that 
young people should have a three-year high school education, 
or its equivalent, with excellent grades (eighty per cent or more) 
in the common branches, before they are admitted to this common 
school or training course, so that graduates of this course 
will be as mature as and will have no advantage in point of time 
over the graduates of the four-year high school course, who are 
compelled to accept second grade county certificates, good for 
one year only, after a twelve years' course in the public schools. 

In answer to the third question, what laws should.be amended, 
and how? the compulsory attendance law received the bulk of 
attention. Seven county superintendents asked that a county 
truant officer be required by law, and one superintendent suggested 
that he be paid by the county. Two or three superintendents 
suggested that the law be made more stringent, giving 
superintendents more power and placing responsibility somewhere, 
on some one. One superintendent said the law should require 
attendance until the completion of the eighth grade or attainment 
of sixteen years of age, and another asked that the 
local board be given some discretion in requiring attendance of 
the older pupils. Several superintendents asked that county 
uniformity of text books b£ made cumpulsory. One would include 
relationship by marriage in the last proviso of section 11, 
subdivision IV, of the school la*ws. Another superintendent asks 
that the minimum valuation of school districts be raised, while 
still another would abolish all district treasurers, and have all 
warrants registered and made payable at the county treasurer's 
office. 

In answer to the auestion, how should the Junior Normal 
school law be amended? many superintendents answered briefly, 
re-enact ! Two superintendents not in the territory of these </seg>

            <seg id="p295">
207 

OFFICIAL CIRCULARS AND HOTICB8 

schools and whose counties were therefore not directly benefitted 
thereby answered, repealed ! But can educators afford to oppose 
that which does not directly benefit them arid theirs, without investigating 
its value to others? Several superintendents replied, 
larger appropriations for their support, and one says, make 
them permanent. One superintendent suggests more schools 
with less equipment at each, another says one Junior Normal for 
each county west of the middle of the state, and another asks for 
state aid for any county holding a summer school. But we all 
know that the legislature will not make appropriations for county 
purposes, that if Junior Normals and summer schools are to become 
universal and general, as numerous as the counties, the 
counties must support them. Suppose each county should demand 
a "Senior" Normal School, or a University, or an Institute 
for the Blind, or an Insane Asylum, the legislature would say : 
"Well, establish one, and support it — with county funds, as you 
establish and support your poor farms, and court houses, and 
county jails, and other establishments in your county." The 
state will support one University, and two State Normal Schools, 
and five or six Junior Normal Schools, but it will not maintain an 
institution in each county of Nebraska. Let us then, generally 
and generously, unite in support of a limited number of Junior 
Normal Schools for western Nebraska. 

In answer to the question, what should be required in the line 
of higher qualifications for teachers? twenty-four superintendents 
responded, compulsory normal school or professional 
training, and most of them mentioned periods of time for this 
which varied from ten weeks to two years, a majority demanding 
one year of thirty-six weeks. Two superintendents suggested a 
minimum requirement of ten years' schooling, of its equivalent, 
with one year's professional training added. Three superintendents 
would have fewer subjects required in examination and 
more thoroughness demanded. One superintendent would secure 
thorough knowledge of all subjects by close grading. Another 
says, qualifications high now; have to mark liberally on 
branches required in order to get teachers. Another one says, </seg>

            <seg id="p296">
STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

208 

high enough ; need now higher standard for school officers. And 
still another, higher qualifications for county superintendents, 
as first grade county certificates ; then higher qualifications for 
teachers will follow naturally. Other suggestions were to repeal 
the third grade certificate law, establish minimum ag* (17 or 18) 
for teachers, limit the number of second grade certificates, make 
first grade county certificates more difficult to secure but extend 
their life to four or five years, enact state examination law by 
state board and force higher standards or close schools, and require 
every teacher to have a state certificate after 1910. 

In answer to the sixth question, do you favor the repeal of the 
transfer law? nine superintendents answered yes and fifty answered 
no. There were some other answers, a summary of which 
is herewith appended : It is a fraud ; it retards the consolidation 
movement ; yes, for something better ; yes, especially that relating 
to the transfer of real estate with a renter; it is not fair to districts 
holding school, very few transferred pup*ils ever paying 
tuition, teachers having extra work, and resident pupils less individual 
attention ; a law which allows a person to have school 
privileges in one district and voting privileges in another is unjust 
; a law which allows a man to leave his district without the 
consent of the voters is unjust; a person who is transferred from 
a district is a detriment to that district ; it works something of a 
hardship on county superintendent and county clerk : not at 
present ; no, but it should be amended ; it lessens the demand for 
new districts ; it creates some feeling but does great good ; amend 
so parents could vote in the district where their children attend 
school ; no, amend, making transfers absolutely permanent and 
change boundaries ; amend so yearly applications should be 
made, as at present many parties do not notify the superintendent 
of removals; amend so that when the transfer remains in 
force, say five years, it then becomes permanent and the superintendent 
shall then change the district line accordingly, which 
would soon put our school districts into more sensible shape, 
for at present it is almost impossible to get a change in district </seg>
boundary lines.

Lincoln, Nebraska, October 31, 1904. 

I am in receipt of a letter from Dr. Edward A. Ross, professor 
of sociology in the University of Nebraska, in which he says: 
"I am thoroughly in sympathy with your wise endeavor to put 
the teachers on their guard in respect to book buying. I have 
never yet seen the day when I felt able to afford to buy a book 
from an agent. That method of selling is entirely too expensive 
for any intelligent person. There are simple and economical 
ways of getting in touch with the publishers of good books, 
and no teacher can afford to hire a man to drive around and 
give him personal instructions in the merits of a volume. There 
are plenty of people for the book canvassers to go after without 
pestering teachers. I see no reason why agents for school supplies, 
books, etc., should not exhibit their wares in an office at 
a county institute, so the teachers can compare the merits of what 
is offered them. The rest of the time they ought to be left alone." 
This letter from Dr. Ross does not refer, at least in particular, 
to school text books but rather to "subscription" books and school 
libraries. Again would I suggest that teachers ask their county 
superintendent, this department, or the Nebraska Public Library 
Commission for its lists of approved books for school library 
purposes. 

Kuperintendent Hyland, of Stanton county, is certainly oped 
to the agent for miscellaneous supplies and apparatus. 
On postal card he addresses his teachers as follows: "Do not 
buy any books, supplies or apparatus from traveling agents. 
You pay their expenses and profits. It is not in their line to tell 
the truth. Do not believe nor patronize them. You can buy anything 
you need direct." 

The tendency to multiply school houses in rural communities 
is quite in evidence in one portion of Dodge county, where on 
ten miles of straight road running east and west there are seven </seg>

            <seg id="p300">

fol houses. These school houses average less than two miles 
t. Superintendent Arnot hopes to reduce the number in 
near future. 

I his year the schools of Richardson county require 125 teachand 
of this number 27 are beginners. Last year just 100 of 
se changed teachers. This year 83 of the schools changed 
:hers. This is a nice improvement, but still we have too 
ly changes. Such a change in leadership would ruin any 
iness and no corporation would think of changing employes 
ry year. A teacher should be able to take charge of his school 
l pastor takes charge of his church, with the intention of staywith 
it for several years, to build it up and be happy in watchit 
grow. — Superintendent Crocker's Educational Departlt, 
Falls City Tribune. 

At a meeting of the school officers of Dodge county held 
October 14, forty-four of the eighty-three school districts of the 
county were represented. A proposition to employ a county 
I ant officer was submitted and carried by a vote of twentyle 
to fifteen, but said truant officer is not to be appointed 
less at least fifty-five of the districts in the county adopt the 
n. Superintendent Arnot is corresponding with the districts 
it were not represented at the meeting relative to this question, 
all the districts unite in the appointment of a truant officer 
: expense to each district will be about 91 cents a month, 
fifty-five districts adopt the plan the expense will be about 
40 a month for each district. 

Mrs. Clara Dobson, superintendent of Frontier county, has a 
large number of traveling libraries "at work" among her schools. 
She says in the September issue of "Our School Bulletin," a publication 
devoted to the educational interests of Frontier county : 
"A few sections of the traveling library have not been sent in 
as requested during vacation. Those that were brought in have 
been put in good order for the year and assigned with great 
care. We believe the systematic arrangement of dates for their 
removal from one district to another will prove very satisfactory, 
if those who have them in charge will make an effort to carry </seg>

out the plan. We expected to give a report of the library in this 
number but could not complete it on account of not having all 
the sections. We doubt if any other library in the state can show 
a greater amount of reading in proportion to the number of 
books and the expense of operating the library."

year. Desultory reading cannot take the place of systematic 
work, nor can local clubs answer the purpose of a state organization. 
This willingness on the part of the teachers to do this 
systematic work and to increase in this way their professional 
knowledge and training is highly satisfactory and encouraging, 
not only to the Reading Circle Board but to all interested in 
the educational affairs of Nebraska. The practical value of 
Hodge's "Nature Study and Life" in the course last year makes 
it probable that on account of local conditions it may be found 
desirable to use the book this year in some parts of the state. 
For this reason the board has decided to retain Hodge's "Nature 
Study and Life" as an optional book, allowing credit for its study 
on the Reading Circle Course of 1902-1903. They will also encourage 
the completion of Bailey's "Principles of Agriculture," 
allowing credit for its study on the Reading Circle Course of 
1901-1902. These books may be secured through the county 
superintendents from the publishers, Ginn &amp; Co., and the Macmillan 
Co., respectively, for the price of one dollar each, or from 
the publishing houses direct, (Chicago), for $1.12. 

Fredit for the year 1903-1904 can be given only when the 
her has studied and completed two of the books adopted 
this year's work. 

Reading — How to Teach It 

Eothing is more important to the teacher than the ability to 
h reading; for rightly taught the child will like to read; 
ig to read he has the foundation for scholarship. 

"These pages are written," says the author, "in the hope of 
helping teachers to appreciate the true import of the familiar 
task." "Why Do We Read?" "Learning to Read," "Expression 
in Reading" are among the topics discussed. Miss Arnold considers 
both the pedagogical and educational sides of the subject, 
indicating how and what children should read, together 
with the best methods of instruction. 

Method of the Recitation 

McMurry's Method of the Recitation is, as its title suggests, </seg>

            <seg id="p303">
213 


a practical application of the principles of method to the various 
problems of class room instruction. As in all of the McMurry 
books, the authors give in clear and concise style an organized 
plan for laying out recitation work of decided value to every 
teacher. The book furnishes inspiration to teachers in giving 
them new and suggestive material enabling them to avoid the 
ordinary rut of class room work. 

Teaching of English 

Among the recent books for teachers, none has attracted more 
attention than Chubb's "The Teaching of English." Its great 
value lies in the fact that it is not limited to the discussion of 
English teaching in the elementary schools, but correlates the 
grade work with that of the secondary school. After applying 
the principles of education, the author treats very clearly and in 
an interesting style the subject of reading -in the primary and 
grammar grades. Chapters on composition, grammar and 
language work in the grades follow. A wide choice of material 
is given illustrating each subject taken up. Professor Chubb's 
book is in every way practical. Definite aims and definite ways 
of achieving these aims are given.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

Prizes Offered 

The Reading Circle Board will present one hundred ($100) 
dollars worth of the best books published for the use of teachers 
to the three counties that enroll the largest percentage of their 
actual bona fide teachers in the Reading Circle work, who systematically 
and successfully pursue the work outlined for 1903-. 
with two Reading Circle books in the hands of each ami 
every teacher. The books to be presented are to be used as 
county teachers' libraries, and will probably be divided into three 
prizes, valued at $50, $30 and $20, respectively. No county shall 
be awarded more books than the number of teachers that pursue 
the work of the course. Therefore, if some western county 
with a total of twenty teachers enroll every one of that number 
in the Reading Circle work, that county will receive a first prize 
of twenty books, and then there will be a fourth prize consisting 
of the balance of the $50 worth of books, to be presented to another 
county. Credit for these teachers' prize libraries cannot be 
given for work on the Reading Circle books of previous years. 
In competition for these prizes those actually teaching in the 
county during the school year 1903-1904, the sole possessors 
of two of the Reading Circle books for 1903-1904, systematically 
studying and completing these books, will be the only ones considered. 


Books for School Libraries 

Ifhe Nebraska Teachers' Reading Circle Board has approved 
lumber of lists of books submitted by publishing houses for 
! as school libraries, and the attention of superintendents, 
ncipals and teachers, and school boards is called to these lists 
1 the prices for which the books may be obtained. The books 
the list were all carefully considered before the lists were 
proved. The books are made up into $5, $10 and $15 libraries, 
ch library will be sent to any railroad or express office in the 
te. transportation prepaid, and sectional bookcases may be 
rchased of the nearest furniture dealer for a few dollars. 

The $5 libraries include a list of twelve books, American Book 
Co. ; other lists of twelve books, Longmans, Green &amp; Co, ; Silver, </seg>

Forty-seven books, Ginn &amp; Co. In the books of any one pubiing 
house there are no duplicates; therefore, by combination, 
, $25 and $30 libraries may in some instances be secured, 
ts of these books may be secured by addressing State Supt. 
n. K. Fowler, Lincoln, Nebraska. 

Duty of the County Superintendent 

It is expected that each county superintendent will distribute 
this circular at the Institute, and secure as large a Reading Circle 
membership as possible. He should set apart a suitable time 
in his program for a discussion of the purpose and plan of the 
Reading Circle, and should make recommendations relative to 
the home study of the year. For the convenience of teachers, 
and to save time at the Institute, he should arrange to have a 
supply of the books on hand at the beginning of the session. 

The county superintendent should report at the close of the 
Institute the number of books sold and remit for those copies 
for which cash has been received. Thereafter, the county superintendents 
should report on December 1 and March 1, the 
number of books sold and remit cash received. On June 1, 
final settlement should be made. 

Outlines 

At the Institute the reading for the year should be outlined, 
certain chapters being apportioned for each month. • The apportionment 
should be noted in the fly-leaves of the books. </seg>

Credit for Reading Circle Work 

It is recommended that a credit of one and one-half per cent 
on the general average be given to teachers for each of the 
Teachers' Reading Circle books of the year that has been carefully 
read, or three per cent for completing the entire work of 
the year. 

Certificates and Diplomas 

The teacher should sign the appended enrollment card, and 
indicate upon it the books desired. The card should be detached 
and handed to the county superintendent, who is to retain it 
until the close of the Reading Circle Year. He is then to satisfy 
himself, by examination or otherwise, as to the work done, to 
fill out the certificate of credit on the reverse side of the caf4, 
and to return it to the teacher. When the teacher has secured 
four Certificates of Credit for satisfactory work done, he should 
present them to the county superintendent, who will secure the 
diploma for him from the manager, Supt. Wm. K. Fowler, 
Lincoln.

Required Work for the Year 

I While fully three-fourths of the counties were interested and 
o-thirds of all the teachers in the smaller cities, the villages and 
! rural districts of Nebraska actively engaged in and successfulcompleted 
the Reading Circle work of last year, it is hoped that 
nuch larger number will take up the work of the present year. 
&gt;th the books selected are well adapted to the work of the 
icher in the graded schools of the cities and the high school 
itructor as well, and it is hoped that city superintendents, 
d high school, village and ward principals will endeavor to 
erest their teachers in the Reading Circle work. At the same 
ie the teachers in the small villages and the rural districts of 
¦braska will find this year's books as helpful, as suggestive, </seg>

            <seg id="p310">
218 


as valuable to them in their work as the books of any former year. 
Teachers of whatever age or experience may read together and 
discuss with great interest, profit and pleasure the printed history 
and testimony of Mr. Sabin's fifty years' experience in 
school work. Two very important branches of study, too often 
poorly taught and seldom correlated as they should be, are geography 
and history, and a study of Geographic Influences in American 
History by any teacher will make her a better teacher of 
geography, a better teacher of history, and a better citizen. 

Common Sense Didactics 

Dr. Henry Sabin, of Iowa, has done a good deed in presenting 
the results of his fifty-seven years of educational experience in 
"Common Sense Didactics for Common School Teachers." Few 
men in the United States have had a longer school experience ; 
few men have observed more widely or studied more profoundly 
the problems of our educational system than Doctor Sabin. 
His service has covered the whole field of public education 
from the country school to the superintendency of all the schools 
of the state of Iowa. 

"Common Sense Didactics" is not in the strict sense a work on 
pedagogy. It is a book of common sense applied to the work 
of the common school teacher. It tells how to teach rather 
than how not to teach. It tries to interest teachers in the lives 
of boys and girls. It emphasizes the fact that education has to 
do, not with the subject matter of books, but with the lives and 
characters of boys and girls. The following quotation from 
the preface reveals the spirit of the book. Dr. Sabin says : 

"I have no desire to appear as a critic. The oft-repeated story 
of incompetent teachers and wretched schools dinned into the 
ears of young teachers has a most disheartening effect. It. kills 
their ambition, dwarfs their enthusiasm, and sends them to their 
schools with the feeling that in nine cases out of ten failure is 
inevitable. On the contrary I would take down the shutters 
and throw open the school room doors, that God's pure air, the </seg>

warm sunshine, the songs of birds, and the smell of flowers may 
come in and fill every crevice and corner of the room, so that the 
humblest teacher may see and feel what a noble, God-like thing 
it is to strive honestly and conscientiously to do one's duty." 

I 'Common Sense Didactics" will be supplied to the members 
the Teachers' Reading Circles through their county superindents 
at 90 cents a copy. 

Geographic Influences in American History 

|»r. Albert Perry Brigham, professor of geology in Colgate 
versity, Hamilton, New York, has in this new book presented 
dly and clearly those physiographic features of America which 
e been important in guiding the unfolding of our industrial 
national life. "Geographic Influences in American History" 
its greatest value in the way it correlates history with 
graphy and geology. It contains enough that is familiar to 
average teacher to keep alive the interest, and introduces 
ch that is new and highly instructive. It approaches history 
11 what, for most of our public school teachers, is a new view 
nt. The book impresses on as one of the sanest contributions 
the study of American history that has come out in many 

I Among the themes receiving special treatment are : The 
istern Gateway of the United States, the Appalachian Barrier, 
e Great Lakes and American Commerce, the Civil War and 
ines and Mountain Life. Closing chapters deal with the unity 
d diversity of American life, and with the physiography as 
Fecting American destiny. 

I The book will be found particularly interesting and valuable 
students and teachers of geography and history, but it will 
so appeal to the general reader. The very large number of 
re and attractive photographs and the numerous maps are of 
iportance in vivifying and explaining the text. 

Eiphic Influences in American History" will be supplied 
:rs of the Teachers' Reading Circles through their 
city superintendents at $1.00 a copy. </seg>

Recommended Supplemental Work 

The Little Chronicle 

The Reading Circle Board was unanimous in its recommendation 
of the study of current events, by the teachers of the state. 
The value of a school newspaper may be summed up as follows : 
It continually supplies fresh material for language lessons and 
supplementary reading lessons ; it reviews without repetition ; 
it gives interest to the study of geography by connecting countries 
with events that are happening there, to past history by 
connecting it with present history, to civics by connecting it with 
current legislation and current politics. In connection with the 
study of current events the Board endorsed The Little Chronicle, 
a weekly published by the Little Chronicle Publishing Company, 
Chicago. The rate to teachers through the county or city superintendents 
is $1.00 a year or 75 cents for nine months. 

The Nebraska Teacher 

The Nebraska Teacher was adopted as the official organ of the 
Board. Items of interest to the members of the Nebraska Teachers' 
Reading Circles will appear in the Reading Circle department 
from month to month. Dr. Brigham's outlines on his "Geographic 

nfluences in American History" will be published in this 
department of The Nebraska Teacher from September, 1904, to 
May, 1905, inclusive. These outlines and suggestions will be invaluable 
to the students of the book. Outlines and suggestions 
on Dr. Sabin's "Common Sense Didactics" are found in connection 
with the other material in his book. 

New Elementary Agriculture 

The New Elementary Agriculture by Dr. C. E. Bessey, Prof. 
G. D. Swezey and Prof. Lawrence Bruner, all of the University 
of Nebraska, was approved for use in Nebraska schools. The 
law requiring teachers to pass an examination in Elementary 
Agriculture after,1903 was passed in order to have agriculture 
taught in the public schools of the state. There being no book </seg>


            <seg id="p313">
221 

on Elementary Agriculture adapted to the rural schools and 
grammar grades, the state superintendent asked these eminent 
scientists to prepare one adapted especially to country schools 
and grammar grades. That they did the work better than was 
thought possible is evidenced by the following quotations from 
a letter received from Hon. James Wilson, secretary of agriculture, 
Washington, D. C. : 

"Some time ago I received a copy of your delightful little book 
on Elementary Agriculture. The names of Drs. Bessey, Bruner 
and Swezey are enough to float a much heavier volume. You 
have taken a sensible course; you have gone to the doctors in 
your State University and had them prepare something for young 
minds ; and it required the united work of three great men to 
do this. The education of the man who is to devote his life to 
producing from the soil has not had attention. The beginning 
should be made in the common school, or probably, it should 
begin further back than that — in the normal school, with the 
fitting and preparing of teachers, so that when they take up 
common school work they can introduce this delightful and beneficial 
study. Every child in Nebraska would be benefited by 
a course of study in this book and instruction regarding it in 
the class room." 

Books for School Libraries 

The Nebraska Teachers' Reading Circle Board approved a 
number of lists of books submited by publishing houses for use 
as school libraries, and the attention of superintendents, principals, 
teachers and school boards is called to these lists and the 
prices for which the books may be obtained. The books in the 
lists were all carefully considered before the lists were approved. 
The books are made up into $5, $10 and $15 libraries. Each 
library will be sent to any railroad express office in the state, 
transportation prepaid. Sectional bookcases may ,be purchased 
of the nearest furniture dealer for a few dollars. </seg>

houses at the close of the Institute the number of books sold 
and remit for those copies for which cash has been received. 
Thereafter, the county superintendent should report on December 
1 and March 1 the number of books sold and remit cash received. 
Final settlement should be made on or before June 
1, 1905. 

Credit for Reading Circle Work 

It is recommended that a credit of one and one-half per cent 
on the general average of examinations for certificates be given 
to teachers for each of the Teachers' Reading Circle books of the 
year that has been carefully studied, or three per cent for completing 
the entire work of the year. 

Certificates and Diplomas 

Each teacher taking up the work of the Reading Circle should 
sign the enrollment card furnished by the county superintendent 
and return it to him. At the close of the year the county superintendent 
should satisfy himself, by examination or otherwise, 
that the work has been well done, fill out the Certificate of Credit 
on the reverse side of the card, and return it to the teacher. 
When the teacher has secured four Certificates of Credit for satisfactory 
work done, he should present them to the county superintendent, 
who will secure the diploma for him from the 
manager, the state superintendent.

Consolidation of Rural Schools 

An address delivered by the State Superintendent before the De- 

partment of School Administration, National Educational Association, 
Boston, Mass., Thursday morning, July 9, 1903, re- 

vised to date : 

This subject is usually more fully expressed as the Consolidation 
of School Districts, the Centralization of Rural Schools, 
and the Transportation of Pupils at Public Expense. 

The ideal plan contemplates the discontinuance of the small 
schools within a given area, say a congressional township, and the 
maintenance of one graded school instead at some point near 
the center of the township. To illustrate : Suppose a township 
to be divided into nine rural school districts, each comprising 
four square miles of territory, with a low assessed valuation, 
a high tax levy, a small, neglected and dilapidated frame school 
house varying from 16x24 feet to 24x30 feet, with three windows 
on each side and one window and a door in one end, a stove, 
and without basement and interior closets. This school house, 
if located at the center of this school district of four square miles, 
will be two miles by section line roads from the homes at the 
corners of the district. School is maintained six, seven or eight 
months during the year, under the jurisdiction of a board of 
three trustees, and in our busy western section of the country, 
is usually taught by a young woman under twenty-one years of 
age, who is paid $30 a month for teaching or "keeping" school, 
building fires and "sweeping out." In this school we may find </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

f average daily attendance of sixteen pupils, a high estimate 
the way, representing all ages from five to twenty years, 
all grades from the primary to the high school and occasionally 
with two or three high school branches crowded in, and from 
thirty to forty recitations daily. The attendance is irregular 
and spasmodic, and tardiness is often the rule, children continuing 
to arrive until ten o'clock. Pupils are "put back" term after 
term by the "new" teacher, as records are usually destroyed or 
lost. Apparatus is either unknown or out of date, blackboard 
scanty and furniture rackety. This is the good old-fashioned 
"deestrick skool" taught by the new woman of twenty who has 
succeeded and supplanted the old man of forty — and of forty 
years ago! 

Consolidation or centralization proposes to discontinue these 
small districts as separate organizations, and these rural schools 
and school houses, and to establish in lieu thereof one central 
graded school for the township, housing ten or more grades 
in a four-room frame or brick school house, well constructed, 
correctly lighted, heated, ventilated and seated with basement 
and interior closets, a janitor, a principal and three other teachers, 
thirty-six pupils and three grades to the room, twelve to fifteen 
recitations daily in each room, and to transport the pupils by 
public conveyance to and from the school house daily. We 
would then have a township board of education of five or seven 
members, would and could pay the principal $60.00 to $75.00 
a month and the three assistants about $45.00 a month each. 
With reference to the attendance of pupils, nine times sixteen 
is equal to four times thirty-six. But the attendance would be 
better, larger, more regular, pupils would be more punctual, 
and their progress provided for systematically. Their health 
would be better and better cared for, and their happiness would 
be greater. 

Es is the "extreme view" and "ideal plan," perhaps, "before" 
after" taking consolidation and centralization. But condiin 
many rural communities may be vastly improved by 
lidating and centralizing in part, by discontinuing per- </seg>

CONSOLIDATION OF SCHOOL!" 

Enently or temporarily a school district and uniting it to an 
oining one. 

Consolidation of schools and transportation of pupils is operative 
to a greater or less degree in the following states, either 
under provision of law or by sufferance : 

California, Connecticut, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Indiana, 
Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Maine, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, 
Missouri, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, 
North Dakota, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South 
Dakota, Texas, Vermont, Wisconsin, and in the five provinces 
of the Dominion of Canada under the Macdonald plan. 

Arguments for Consolidation 

1. It insures a much larger per cent of enumerated pupils enrolled. 


2. Reduces irregular attendance. 

3. Prevents tardiness among transported pupils. 

4. Pupils can be better classified and graded. 

5. No wet feet or clothing, nor colds resulting therefrom. 

6. No quarreling, improper language, or improper conduct 
on the way to and from school. 

7. Pupils are under the care of responsible persons from the 
time they leave home in the morning until they return at night. 

8. Pupils can have the advantage of better school rooms, 
better heated, better ventilated, and better supplied with apparatus, 
etc. 

9. Pupils have the advantage of that interest, enthusiasm and 
confidence which large classes always bring. 

10. Better teachers can be employed, hence better schools. 

11. The plan insures more thorough and more complete 
supervision. 

tl2. It is more economical. Under the new plan the cost of 
ition per pupil on the basis of total enrollment has been reduced 
from $16.00 to $10.48 ; on the basis of average attendance, 
from $26.66 to $16.07. This statement is for pupils in subdistricts 
Nos. 10 and 13, Lake county, Ohio. 

13. It permits a better grading of the schools and classification </seg>

            <seg id="p322">
228 

STATB SUPERINTENDRWT's BEPOBT 

of pupils. Consolidation allows pupils to be placed where they 
can work to the best advantage, the various subjects of study 
to be wisely selected and correlated and more time given to recitations. 
Pupils work in GRADED schools, and both teachers and 
pupils are under systematic and close supervision. 

14. It affords an opportunity for thorough work in special 
branches, such as drawing, music and nature study. It also allows 
an enrichment in other lines. 

15. It opens the door to more weeks of schooling and to 
schools of a higher grade. The people in villages almost invariably 
lengthen the school year and support a high school for advanced 
pupils. 

16. It affords the broader companionship and culture that 
comes from association. 

17. It quickens public interest in the schools. Pride in the 
quality of work done secures a greater sympathy and better 
fellowship throughout the township. The whole community is 
drawn together. 

18. Public barges used for children in the daytime may be used 
to transport their parents to public gatherings in the evenings, 
to lecture courses, etc. 

19. Transportation makes possible the distribution of mail 
throughout the whole township daily. 

20. By transportation the farm again, as of old, becomes the 
ideal place in which to bring up children, enabling them to secure 
the advantages of centers of population and to spend their evenings 
and holiday time in contact with nature and plenty of work, 
instead of idly loafing about town. 

21* The teacher's work is so well organized that the average 
recitation period is trebled. 

22. One or two large families cannot "freeze out" the teacher. 

23. The fanner and his family are more content with their 
self-sustaining occupation. 

24. Ethical culture is afforded free from the dissipations of 
social life as manifested in cities. 

26. Parents who are observant say that the cost of shoes worn </seg>

out in walking to the separate schools and the cost of medicine 
and doctors' bills more than pay for the transportation. 

K26. Transportation makes it easier to maintain a quarantine 
case of disease and prevent the spread of contagion. 

127. By centralization there will be fewer and better teachers 
our schools. It will be a case of the survival of the fittest. 
;tter salaries will be paid those who do teach, thus enabling a 
rson to acquire high school and normal training before atnpting 
to teach. 

E8. By centralization all the children of the township have the 
le chance for higher educational advantages, which under the 
sent plan only five or ten persons are able to get by leaving 
ne and going to the city. 

129. By centralization we go a long way toward the solution 
the problem, "How to Keep the Boys on the Farm." We bring 
the farm that which he goes to the city and town to secure, 
ch a school may become the social and intellectual center of the 
nmunity life. With a library room, music, debating club, 
., our boys and girls will hesitate to leave home and such a 
tool for the uncertainties of city life. Centralization will not 
ly keep the boys on the farm but it will help to keep the big 
vs in school. 

Arguments Against Consolidation 

K. Depreciation of property; decreased valuation of farms in 
:ricts where schools are closed. 

2. Dislike to sending young children to school far from home, 
away from the oversight of parents ; and to providing a cold lunch 
for them rather than a warm dinner. 

3. Danger to health and morals ; children obliged to travel 
too far in cold and stormy weather; obliged to walk a portion 
of the way to meet the team, and then to ride in damp clothing 
and with wet feet; unsuitable conveyance and uncertain driver; 
association with many children of all classes and conditions ; 
lack of proper oversight during the noon hour. 

4. Insufficient and unsuitable clothing; expense to parents of 
properly clothing their children. 

5. Difficulty of securing a proper conveyance on reasonable </seg>

The Rural School Problem: A Solution 

rsolidation of School Districts, Centralization of Schools, and 
Public Transportation of Pupils. 

From the Seventeenth Biennial Report of the Department of 

Public Instruction, State of Nebraska. 

II have great faith in tne rural school, n its powers, and in 
at it may do for the individual pupil, but I think the result 
its work on the average does not compare with the work of the 
it city schools, and cannot under the present conditions. How 
improve the present conditions is a serious problem, and I 
ow of but one solution. Rural mail delivery is now spreading 
•ough this western country. Roads are being improved. Teleones 
are coming into common use in the country as well as 
the cities. Many counties in Nebraska have organized county 
ephone systems, and before long all calls for physicians, for 
pplies and provisions, for broken castings for farm machinery, 
r twine for the binder, for drugs and medicines and for hundreds </seg>

of other things will be by telephone, and thereby one-half of the 
time usually expended in securing them will be saved. 

We must enrich rural life and increase the advantages of the 
farmer and his family in order to counteract the flow of humanity 
from country to city. A census bulletin issued last year states 
that the percentage of population of the United states in cities 
of 8,000 or more inhabitants has steadily increased each decade 
It was 3.4 per cent in 1790, 12.5 per cent in 1850, 22.6 per cent 
in 1880, 29.2 per cent in 1890, and 33.1 per cent in 1900. The percentage 
of our population that lived in cities of 4,000 or more inhabitants 
in 1880 was 25.8 ; in 1890, 32.9, and in 1900, 37.3. These 
figures are significant. They mean that from 1880 to 1890 seven 
persons in every one hundred of our population moved from 
country and village to city and none moved back. From 1890 
to 1900 four or five persons in every one hundred moved from 
country or village to city and none moved back. What shall we 
do to be saved from our great cities? Shall we permit the decay 
and destruction of our pure country life, or shall we endeavor to 
bring some of the great comforts and conveniences and advantages 
of city life into the country? 

Now for years we have been working at cutting up Nebraska 
and its counties into small school districts. Schools of a few 
pupils are the rule, and large schools are the exception. What inspiration 
can the pupils of a school of three or four or a half 
a dozen have to do good work ? There is no life, energy, inspiration, 
emulation or desire to excel. The school is dead spiritually 
and intellectually, and I have seen many a small school that might 
as well have been discontinued as far as practical results were 
concerned. You may be doing well under the conditions, but 
what are the conditions? How could they be much worse ? Poor, 
battered old school houses, sometimes lacking paint, with cannon 
ball stoves, and cheerless yards ; while in our cities we are building 
modern, scientific structures, correctly heated, ventilated, 
lighted and seated, often built of brick, sometimes with stone 
foundations and with beautiful surroundings. Many of the best 
schools of Nebraska are in towns employing from three to six </seg>

teachers. There they have but two or three classes in each room, 
with all the rooms in one building, a principal who may know 
what each class is doing, thereby securing a better and closer 
supervision than is possible in larger places, and a janitor to look 
after the school property. 

Why do you not have the same in your rural communities? 
It is not an impossibility. Let me suggest to you what has been 
done in some of, the eastern states. Thirty years ago in Massachusetts 
they began centralizing their rural schools by public 
transportation of pupils in vans or wagons. About ten years ago 
the plan had reached Ohio, and in the last few years it has spread 
into Indiana and Illinois, and is now being strongly advocated in 
Iowa. Briefly the plan is this: Instead of nine rural districts 
with about four sections of land each, teachers with salaries 
of about $35.00, and an average enrollment of twenty pupils, we 
have in the center of the township a brick building of four rooms, 
with forty-five pupils in each room, and two or three grades 
only. We may have a principal of considerable training and experience, 
who receives a salary of from $60.00 to $75.00, and 
teaches the highest room. The three other teachers receive about 
$45.00 each. There is a janitor who looks after the building, 
its heating plant, its toilet rooms or outbuildings and the grounds 
generally. There may be sheds in which the horses are kept 
during the day. The pupils are gathered from various parts of 
the township by covered vans or wagons that start at 7 :45 a. m., 
or at a stated regular time, day after day, and cover an established 
route, picking up the children along the way and delivering them 
at the school house at about 8 :45 ; distributing them again after 
four o'clock in the afternoon. Where the plan has been in 
operation, the drivers selected are clean, capable, sober men, 
not given to profanity or tobacco, and are paid $25.00 or $30.00 
per month. They furnish their own team and wagon, with lap 
robes, and as a rule, carpet their vehicles and provide seats ; 
let us say right here, that in bad weather, in rain or storm or 
strong wind, I would rather my child would ride five miles m 
such a vehicle than walk one or two miles. In pleasant weather 
I would just as soon have him walk as ride. </seg>

COSNOLTDATIOH OS SCHOOLS 

Consolidation of Schools 

To overcome the many disadvantages in the present rural 
school system in Nebraska, and for the purpose of giring every 
farmer's girl and boy in this noble commonwealth opportunities 
equal to those of the girls and boys of the village and city, we 
recommend to the careful consideration of every rural school 
board and to the fathers and mothers in these rural districts the 
consolidation of schools and the transportation of pupils. Consolidate, 
or centralize the weak districts into a common central 
school, conveying the pupils from every part of the greater district 
or the congressional township to and from the central schools 
by means of covered vans or wagons, in charge of clean, capable, 
careful drivers. Such a plan would now be legal, as the six-mile 
limit in the formation of school districts has been removed. And 
we already have the transportation law. Notice the following 
provisions of Nebraska School Laws: 

1. One district may be discontinued, and its territory attached 
to other adjoining districts, upon petitions signed by one-half 
of the legal voters of each district affected. (Subdivision I, 
Section .4, Fourth Condition.) 

2. The six-mile limit in the formation of school districts has 
been removed, and districts may now be formed extending more 
than six miles in any direction. 

3. The district board may (and usually should) close the 
weaker and smaller schools in a district and transport the pupils 
at public expense to any other school in the district. A board 
of education of a city, or board of trustees of a high school district, 
by a two-thirds vote of the entire board, or a district board 
of any school district in this state when authorized by a two-thirds 
vote of those present at any annual or special meeting, is hereby 
empowered to make provision for the transportation of pupils 
residing within said district to any other school (within said district) 
to which the pupils may lawfully attend, whenever the distance 
from' such schools shall render it impracticable for said 
pupils to attend without transportation. (Subdivision V, Section 
4b.) 

4. Or, the district board may close school and transport their </seg>

            <seg id="p330">
234 

STATE SUPERIirrElCDENT'8 REPORT 

pupils at public expense to a neighboring district without forfeiting 
the state apportionment. A board of trustees of a high 
school district, or the district board of a school district in this 
state, when authorized by a two-thirds vote of those present at 
any annual or special meeting, is hereby empowered to contract 
with the district board of any neighboring district for the instruction 
of (all) pupils residing in the first named district 
in schools maintained by the neighboring district, and to make 
provision for the transportation of said pupils to the abovenamed 
schools of the neighboring district under the conditions 
named in the preceding section ; Provided, That school districts 
thus providing instruction for their children in neighboring districts 
shall be considered as maintaining a school as required by 
law ; Provided, further, That the teacher of the last-named school 
shall keep a separate record of attendance of all pupils from the 
first named district and make a separate report to the director 
of said district. 

Manner of Consolidation 

The consolidation of school districts is one of the most important 
and delicate of the county superintendent's duties, always 
to be performed with great care and deliberation. It must 
not be confused with the discretionary power of the superintendent 
to create a new district from other organized districts upon 
petition signed by one-third of the legal voters in each district 
affected. See condition first, section 4, subdivision I. The creation 
of a new district under this provision will not permit the 
discontinuance of any district. The consolidation of school districts 
contemplates the discontinuance of one or more districts 
every time a consolidation is perfected. "One district may be 
DISCONTINUED and its territory attached to other adjoining 
districts (or district), upon petitions signed by one-half of the 
legal voters in each district affected." See fourth condition, section 
4, subdivision I. 

Emust be remembered that the petitions for the consolidaof 
two or more school districts shall contain an exact statet 
of what changes in district boundaries are proposed. The </seg>

            <seg id="p331">
CONSOLIDATION OF SCHOOLS 

235 

notices of said petition shall be likewise specific relative to 
changes proposed. Said notices shall be posted in three public 
places, one of which places shall be upon the outer door of the 
school house, if there be one, in each district affected, or territory 
not organized into districts proposed to be attached to an 
existing district, at least ten (10) days prior to the time of presenting 
the petitions to the county superintendent ; Provided, 
That changes affecting cities (districts organized under subdivision 
XIV or XVII) shall be made upon the petition of the board 
of education of the district or districts affected. 

Suppose districts Nos. 1,2, 3, and 4 of a certain county decide 
to consolidate with district No. 5. Separate petitions must be 
circulated in each of these districts, 1, 2, 3 and 4, asking to be 
discontinued and to have its territory attached to district 

5, which district shall retain its old number. Four separate 
petitions must also be circulated in district No. 5 ; one asking that 
the territory in district No. 1 be attached to district No. 5 ; one 
asking that the territory in district No. 2 be attached to district 
No. 5 ; one asking that the territory in district No. 3 be attached 
to district No. 5, and one asking that the territory in district No. 
4 be attached to district No. 5. This plan is somewhat cumbersome, 
it is true, but under the existing statute it is the only 
legal way. The consolidated district shall take the number of 
the said district No. 5, and be under the control of its officers 
until the annual meeting, when it may organize as a high school 
district ; Provided, It contains more than one hundred and fifty 
children between the ages of five and twenty-one years. See 
section 1, subdivision VI, School Laws, 1903. 

The county superintendent must either grant the petition 
asking for the annexation of territory to a certain district as 
it comes to him, or reject it. He cannot attach a part of the 
territory mentioned in a petition and reject the remainder of it. 

On the 9th of April, 1872, school district No. 9 of Hamilton 
county was formed, eighteen miles in length and six miles in 
width. The formation of school districts and the power to 
change or modify boundary lines of same under the statute </seg>


            <seg id="p332">
236 

as it then existed was a question entirely at the discretion of 
the county superintendent. There was no limit to the extent 
of school districts, neither was there any law providing for 
the free transportation of pupils. However, the legality as to 
the formation of this district was tested in the district court. 
This court held its formation legal. The case was appealed to 
the supreme court, where the judgment of the district court 
was reversed. In discussing the principle of law which should 
govern in such cases, Justice Maxwell said: "A school district 
being formed for the purpose of affording an education 
to all the children of school age within its boundaries, is or 
should be limited in extent by the distance scholars are able 
to attend school. No satisfactory reasons can be given for including 
hands in a school district so remote from the school 
that it is impossible for those residing on those lands to attend, 
It is imposing a burden upon the owners of such property, from 
which they derive no benefit whatever." 

This decision was no doubt responsible for the six-mile limit 
which prevailed for several years in the formation of school 
districts. But since there is a law which provides for the free 
transportation of pupils when the distance from school shall 
render it impracticable for them to attend without transportation, 
the legislature of 1901 deemed it wise to repeal the sixmile 
limit in the formation of school districts. 

When several districts are consolidated, the new district not 
only becomes invested with the property rights of the former, 
but also becomes answerable for their debts. This includes 
bonded indebtedness as well as all other obligations. For the 
court's decision and exposition of the law on this question, see 
15 Nebraska Reports, pages 1 to 7, inclusive. 

After several districts have been consolidated, any property 
which shall no longer be needed for the use of the new district 
may be sold by the district board of such district when authorized 
and directed by a two-thirds vote of the qualified voters, 
present and voting, at any annual or special meeting ; and when 
real estate is sold the district may convey the same by deed, </seg>

            <seg id="p333">

COB8OLIDATION OF SCHOOLS 

signed by the moderator of the district, and such deed, when 
acknowledged by such officer to be the act of the district, may 
be recorded in the office of the recorder of deeds of the county 
in which the real estate is situated, in like manner as other 
deeds. 

Consolidation in Other States 

ti answer to an inquiry for the latest phase or condition of the 
solidation of rural schools, the state departments of public 
instruction of the several states, in 1903, sent the following brief 
expressions of opinion in addition to the printed matter hereafter 
referred to : *» - » 

ARIZONA — There has never been any concerted action in 
Arizona in the matter of consolidation of rural schools ; we having 
such a sparsely settled country and the districts being in many 
instances several miles apart, the consolidation idea cannot be 
satisfactorily worked to any extent. We have no matter, printed 
or otherwise, bearing on the subject. When the population has 
become more dense, there will be closer relations between districts 
and the plan of consolidation may be more seriously considered. 


CALIFORNIA — There was a measure enacted at the recent 
session of the legislature (Assembly Bill No. 532). As yet it is 
only an experiment in California, but I anticipate good results 
from it when it shall have been tried. Of course, I do not think 
it adapted to many sections of our state, only to those portions 
where there are good roads and well populated communities. 

COLORADO — Conditions are such in Colorado that we have 
practically done nothing in this line, but interest is now being 
awakened. 

K DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA— As we do not have to deal with 
ral schools as they obtain in a state, we have no printed matter 
on the subject. For the same reason there is nothing that I 
could say from a practical point of view that would be of service 
to you. 

' GEORGIA — Consolidation has gradually been going on in </seg>

            <seg id="p334">
238 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

this state, although there have been no laws passed on this sub- 
Kt. The matter is left largely with county boards of education, 
most cases they have proceeded very slowly in the matter and 
•e obtained good results. 

ILLINOIS — There seems to be. a wide-spread interest in this 
state about the matter of transportation. There was no legislation 
passed during the last session of the general assembly. 
I think, however, by the next biennial session the sentiment will 
be so strong that the legislature will be disposed to act. 

IOWA — The work of consolidation goes forward merrily in 
this state. 

1904 

Kl few schools in Iowa have been consolidated within the past 
r, and the movement is slowly gaining in favor. Reports 
show that the consolidated schools in this state are greatly superior 
to the former sntall separated schools, and the people are 
generally well pleased with the change. 

KANSAS — Consolidation is rapidly gaining favor in this state, 
ere it has been tried there is no fault to find with it. 

1904 

Since the publication of our last biennial report for the years 
1901-1902, there have been formed in the state six consolidated 
districts. In every instance consolidation has proved successful. 
After the plan has a fair trial the people have no desire to 
return to the old district plan. 

r MICHIGAN — We have just secured the necessary legislation 
which we are now able to centralize schools, using a portion 
the public money for the transportation of pupils. That was 
all that was necessary, and we are now in shape to begin an 
active campaign and to reach some definite practical results. 

1904 

Matters are progressing satisfactorily in this state and we are 
consolidating schools at several points in the state with a great 
deal of public discussion and agitation of the subject, which </seg>

            <seg id="p335">
239 

CONSOLIDATION OF SCHOOLS 

seems to indicate that much work will be done in the immediate 
future. 

MINNESOTA— I have nothing original to add to our bulletin 
at this time. We have but three or four consolidated districts 
in Minnesota as yet, but in about a dozen places schools are 
temporarily suspended and the pupils are being transported at 
public expense to adjoining districts. Last winter upon my recommendation, 
this plan was legally authorized. 

rISSOURI — We have not done much in Missouri along the 
of consolidation of rural schools. We have a law authorizing 
it, but the people have not consolidated in more than four 
places, and only in two of these have the schools been consolidated 
; in the other two it is simply district consolidation. * 

* 

» NORTH DAKOTA— Consolidation has been tried in several 
the counties in this state, and the reports which we have on 
file indicate that this plan is entirely satisfactory and a great 
improvement over the old system. 

&lt; 1904 

Consolidation of rural schools is in successful operation in 
Traill, Grand Forks, Nelson, Rjamsey, Towner, Rolette, Benson, 
Wells, Cass, Ward, Barnes, Griggs and Stutsman counties. The 
people all over the state are thoroughly alive to the advantages 
of consolidation, and only the fact that many of our counties are 
sparsely settled and distances too great for transportation of 
pupils prevents the more general adoption of the plan. We are 
handicapped in five of our largest and most thickly populated 
counties by reason of the district system of school organization. 
In the township system the legal steps in consolidation are easily 
managed. 

The results from consolidation when it is given a fair trial 
are uniformly good and fully ninety-five per cent of the patrons 
are enthusiastic in their praise. One consolidated school of four 
departments located at Caledonia, Traill county, has had its 
high school placed on the accredited list by the state high school 
board. 

We are pushing the work as rapidly as is warranted by perma- </seg>

nent results. We do not believe in advising it where the conditions 
are such that it will be a failure. 

OHIO — This plan gives general satisfaction in this state where 
the conditions are at all favorable, and I personally believe that 
it is the solution of the question of better schools in the rural 
districts. 

f OKLAHOMA — We are just beginning the plan in Oklahoma, 
is being discussed in every county. We are having trouble, 
however, because most of the districts have bonded and cannot 
lose their identity. 

OREGON — We are crowding the consolidation idea and are 
meeting with much encouragement, although we have n6t had 
any districts, as yet, consolidate. It takes time to overcome the 
inertia of long settled customs and so we will not be at all discouraged 
if the movement advances slowly. I am particularly 
anxious that no districts do consolidate unless they make a success 
of it. We find the best way to get it before the people is 
to present it in mass meeting and have before the people maps 
showing the boundaries of the districts, roads, residences, etc. 

RHODE ISLAND, 1904— The present condition of the movement 
in this state is very much the same that it was a year a%o, 
only that the law having passed abolishing districts the consolidation 
of the schools is going on with more or less freedom 
in different sections. 

I am glad to report that the movement is apparently meeting 
with public favor and I trust it will continue. 

SOUTH DAKOTA — So far as this department has been able 
to learn, the work attained in such schools has been superior to 
the single district system and has been a saving to the people 
of about one-fourth. The attendance has also been better. Especially 
is this true of students of the higher grades. 

1904 

The movement toward consolidation and centralization of 
schools is becoming more popular in this state. However, the </seg>



            <seg id="p339">
241 

CONSOLIDATION OF 8CHOOLS 

experiment has been tried only in a few instances, and is not yet 
thoroughly established in public favor. 

TEXAS— Very little has been done in this state in the way 
of consolidating rural schools. There are perhaps one or two 
counties which hare during the past year to some extent tried 
the consolidation plan, but these few cases have not been sufficient 
for a test. I have in public addresses and in letters from 
the department encouraged the consolidation of schools, f hope 
Texas will soon appreciate the advantages of the consolidation 
plan. 

UTAH — In my recommendations to the last legislature, I 
suggested that all school districts in a county be united in one, 
and that one be governed and controlled by a competent board 
of education consisting of five, seven or nine members, according 
to the class of the county. I said but a few words in regard to 
the matter, simply stating that in my opinion such consolidation 
would aid materially in unifying and strengthening our present 
school system. A bill thus to provide for the consolidation of 
the school districts was presented to the legislature, but it failed 
to pass. Consolidation is being affected in many of our counties, 
however, On a smaller scale. The central school is steadily increasing 
in numbers. Again, Utah's rural districts are somewhat 
different from the rural districts of most states. Towns have 
sprung up at the mouths of canon streams. There the people 
live, while the farms are from one to ten miles from their homes. 

VERMONT — Vermont is making some progress in the matter 
of consolidation of rural schools. The hilly nature of the state 
is a very grave difficulty in the extension of this movement. The 
people of Vermont are always conservative and make assured, 
though moderate, progress. 

WASHINGTON, 1904— Our law in regard to consolidation 
of school districts is comparatively new, and not much has yet 
been done along that line. The results, however, in so far as 
the consolidation is concerned, seem to have been good, and the 
consolidation of weak districts is a matter which I encourage. 

WYOMING — The community of Wheatland, in the county </seg>

of Laramie, of this state, requested my opinion last winter as to 
whether or not, under the law, they would be permitted to consolidate 
several of the schools and to furnish transportation for 
pupils. I looked into the law and rendered an opinion to the effect 
that I believed they would be warranted in consolidating, providing, 
of course, they were able so to decide. Upon my suggestions 
or opinion they decided to consolidate, and I understand now 
the same is in operation, but can give you no information as 
to whether successful or not. From my knowledge of the locality 
referred to I am of the opinion that consolidation would 
be more successful there than in most localities. In numerous 
portions of this state I do not believe consolidation advisable 
and the reasons are obvious.

The Situation in Nebraska 

ADAMS COUNTY, 1904— The consolidation of rural school 
districts has been agitated in different parts of the county, and 
it has many earnest supporters, but these are in every case in 
th&lt; minority; so nothing has yet been accomplished in this 
countv. 

W. A. JULIAN. 

BANNER COUNTY, 1903— During the past school year the 
number of school districts has been reduced from 38 to 34, by 
uniting to each of two districts adjoining districts, and to a third 
one two other districts. In the latter case the consolidated district 
(No. 8) comprises 30 sections *)f land, with a census of 12 
children of school age. The' tax levy, enrollmient and average 
daily attendance are practically unaffected, but the term of school 
is longer. Free transportation is not provided. 

District No. 5, two districts united, includes 21 sections, with </seg>

            <seg id="p353">
253 

OOHBOLrDATION OF SCHOOLS 

a school census of 34. Conditions are similar to those in No. 8, 
and the chief advantage appears to be in a larger, better school. 

Eistrict No. 7, two districts united, includes 34 sections, with a 
ol census of 19. Conditions are similar to those in No. 8 
No. 5, but with a slight increase in enrollment. 

MRS. W. E. HEARD. 

BOX BUTTE COUNTY, 1903—1 have worked for the consolidation 
of a number of districts during the past year, but without 
success, although the plan to form 4 districts from 7 is still being 
agitated, and we hope to succeed before October 1, 1903, 
after all concerned understand the situation better than at present. 

J. W. BAUMGARDNER. 

1904 

The work of consolidation was started in this county last 
winter by uniting districts Nos. 39 and 16, making a district 
composed of 92 1 sections of land, with the population near the 
center. A new school house has recently been finished within 
easy reach of the pupils. The census is 33. Six months of school 
will be held this year instead of four, and an increase of $5.00 
per month will be made in the teacher's salary. 

I districts Nos. 24 and 9 hare also been consolidated. A new 
iooI house was built this summer at a cost of $500, and it is 
11 furnished and provided with text books. There are 21 
ldren in this district, a six months' school will be held instead 
three as has been usual in both districts for years, and a raise 
$5.00 a month will be made in the teacher's salary. 

EZonsolidation has been a success in this county, and we hope 
see the good work go on this coming year. 

LEORA S. RUSTIN. 

BROWN COUNTY, 1903-Owing- to the sparsely settled territory 
we cannot bring about consolidation of districts to any 
extent at present, but in the more thickly settled parts I think 
an attempt would be successful if there were some means of meet* 
ing the citizens in a systematic way.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

1904 

There is but a small part of this county in which it would 
do any good at all to consolidate the school districts. The 
southern portion of the county is not so very thickly settled, 
and in order to get enough pupils together to have an ordinary 
school, we must make districts that contain from 50 to 80 sections. 
In the northern part of the county the canons along the 
streams make it so far for the pupils to go that it is impossible 
to make a consolidated district that would be practicable. 

C. B. GOODSPEED. 

EUFFALO COUNTY, 1903—1 shall make an effort for the 
solidation of two groups of school districts this summer. 1 
e not irfet with any encouragement in my efforts in the past. 

1904 

The boundaries of school districts in Buffalo county art practically 
as they were a year ago. No consolidation of districts 
has been effected. The subject has been discussed in season 
and out of season and the sentiment in its favor is steadily 
increasing. 

T. N. HARTZELL. 

EURT COUNTY, 1903— We have no centralized schools in 
county. I have published an article on this subject in sevof 
our county papers. The plan meets with both favor and 

1904 

IVe have not taken any definite steps in Burt county toward 
isolidation. I have talked centralization to many patrons, 
I find that sections of the county would consider the plan 
a favorable way. Two years ago I presented this subject at 
Farmters' Institute. Have given articles on centralization to 
press and have distributed your pamphlets sent from the 
te department. We hope to hold patrons' meetings in the

COH8OLIDATIOH OF SCHOOLS 

BUTLER COUNTY, 1903 — I have tried two places in the 
¦county, but the main objection given by the patrons is the greater 
cost of running a consolidated district.* 

1904 

No effort has been made during the past year to consolidate 
school districts in this county. Two years ago consolidation was 
tried in two places. One of these comprised a whole township, 
five school districts. The districts farthest away from the central 
point where the school house was to be erected signed th? 
petition unanimously, while two districts adjoining the central 
district filed a remonstrance before the petition reached me. 
Some old feuds amongst the patrons was the only cause. 

Elext year I will try to persuade patrons to discontinue one 
:rict and add the dismembered parts to adjoining districts, 
ather district will be urged to close school and send children 
adjoining districts and pay tuition from school funds. We 
d to enlarge districts having village schools. 

JOS. C. HRUSHKA. 

CEDAR COUNTY, 1903— Four Districts were united about 
two years ago, forming district No. 84, which has 28 sections 
and a school population of 169. The district still has four school 
houses and a teacher for each one, as the people have thus far 
refused to vote bonds for the central school house. 

A. E. WARD. 

EJUMING COUNTY, 1904— Two mass meetings were held last 
»r by interested patrons and myself to discuss the consolidan 
of four of our rural school districts. Some were strongly 
favor of the measure, while others were strongly opposed to it 
:ause of an increase in expenses for building and for the transrtation 
of pupils. 

At two of our county conventions of district boards the subject 
was discussed mostly for the purpose of commencing thought 
upon the matter, and thus opening the way for action in this 
direction as a solution to the rural school problem. 

I have frequently spoken with school officers privately upon </seg>

the subject. 1 find that most of them think it is a new thing, 
too expensive, too far for pupils to travel, and they do not see 
why others are so anxious to want them to love the farm so much 
and to remain in the country. 

Since the county cannot be said to suffer from many small 
school districts that are weak financially, the people generally 
do not favor consolidation, and thus far no district is transporting 
its pupils to an adjoining district to be instructed there nor 
are any districts now contemplating consolidation. 

J. A. STAHL. 

DAWES COUNTY, 1903— An adjoining district has been consolidated 
with district No. 25, forming 18 sections with a school 
population of 30. This consolidation was effected April 1, 1903, 
and only one teacher will be necessary for the school. Last 
year the two districts levied 15 and 12 mills respectively, the 
enrollment in the two schools was 20 and the average daily attendance 
was 12. 

Euring my term of office twelve districts have been consolid 
in Dawes county. There has nearly always been opposiat 
the time but later satisfaction has resulted. 

Earing 1 the past year back taxes have been paid up in many of 
districts giving a surplus of funds which has kept several dis:s 
from consolidating that would have done so if they had 
l short. Transportation has never been tried. 

H. L. FISHER. 

1904 

Consolidation is not making rapid progress in Dawes county. 
The same objections, depreciation of real estate, and the distance 
children would be compelled to go, are advanced invariably. 
Public transportation is especially distasteful. 

T. S. SMITH. 

DEUEL COUNTY, 1904— In our sand hill region an adjoining 
district has been consolidated with district No. 5&gt;, making 
a very large district in the northern end of the county. A new

are well satisfied with the results, and say that although they have 
much farther to send their children to school the benefit they receive 
more than repays themi. They pay this year $50 per month 
for teacher's services, and are talking of putting in a second 
teacher next year. 

I have been talking consolidation in different parts of the 
county. I do not know what the results will be. Educational 
affairs generally, I think, are on a much better basis than they 
were a few years ago. The county is wealthier, providing more 
ample support for the schools, frame buildings are taking the 
place of old sod structures, and the spirit of the people is one of 
wide-awake advancement. 

C. ESTELLA GOODWIN 

FILLMORE COUNTY, 1904— Some effort has been made to 
awaken interest in the subject of consolidation, but apparently 
nothing has been accomplished as we have no centralized rural 
school. 

LEWIS GOODRICH. 

FRANKLIN COUNTY, 1904— There has been little movement 
toward consolidation in this county, as there are but few 
small districts. There are, however, a few cases where it would 
be beneficial to consolidate. 

ED M. SHORT. 

FRONTIER COUNTY, 1903— District No. 32 was discontinued 
last fall and its territory attached to No. 98, forming i 
district of 18 sections with 23 pupils of school age. Only one 
teacher will be necessary. 

Eistrict No. 18 has been discontinued and attached to District 
80, except one quarter section which goes to the May wood 
¦ict. 

About five years ago a district comprising six sections was attached 
to the Curtis district. This consolidation has proven 
most unsatisfactory. There are at present two families residing in 
the portion annexed, six and six and one-half miles from school. 
They could drive to school, but are unwilling to do so. To 
furnish transportation would cost more than the income derived </seg>

CONSOLIDATION OF SCHOOLS 

from their portion of the district. If separated from the Curtis 
district their income would scarcely maintain the required amount 
of school. For two years a school has been held for them, four 
months this year, three months last year, paid for in part by the 
Curtis district and in part by the parents. Both teachers were 
beginners. The work was very ordinary, but the pupils' attendance 
was perfect. This case is a sample "problem." 

1904 

In the last few years the plan of consolidation of districts 
has grown in favor with our people, but the local conditions are 
such that its practical realization makes slow progress. Three 
districts have been discontinued, and their territory attached 
to adjacent districts. In each case there has been a faction decidedly 
opposed to the change and a year at least of strife and 
ill-will. But the marked improvement in size of school, length 
of term, financial condition, and especially the lower tax levy 
are doing much to reconcile the discordant elements ; and I believe 
as the years go by these people will find the new plan 
increasingly satisfactory. 

rere are very few places in this county, however, where even 
schools can be advantageously combined at present. The 
very small schools are in sparsely settled districts, consisting 
mostly of rough grazing land traversed by deep canons. The 
roads are circuitous and difficult. In passing from one district 
to the next a few days ago I had eight wire gates to deal with. 
I do not wonder that parents are unwilling to send young children 
to drive over such roads, while to hire a driver would cost more 
than to hire a teacher. These small schools are expensive and 
unsatisfactory, but as yet no other plan seems practicable. The 
districts are already so large that a considerable number of our 
pupils are exempt from the compulsory attendance law on account 
of distance and some are practically deprived of school 
privileges. 

There are two or three places where township graded schools 
might be successfully maintained, and I believe the time will </seg>

method of providing for the education of their children. 

MRS. CLARA L. DOBSOX. 

FURNAS COUNTY, 1904— No consolidation has been effected 
in this county, but district No. 69 has been annexed to 
district No. 2. District No. 25 has been paying tuition and sending 
their children to district No. 30 (the Wilsonville school). 
District No. 53 sent their pupils to district No. 4&lt;&gt;. District No. 
102 has become dormant and will this year be annexed to districts 
Nos. 87 and 59. 

F. G. DOWNING. 

\RFIELD COUNTY, 1904— Owing to sparsely settled territory, 
nothing has been done with consolidation of districts. 
Patrons are more anxious for division of districts. However. I 
am very much interested in the subject and hope I may be able 
to accomplish something along this line. 

GRACE E. McCLI.M ANS 

GOSPER COUNTY, 1904— Consolidation of school districts 
in this county is not making very great progress. The main 
objection seems to be the distance from the school house, and 
when one talks transportation to them they won't listen a 
moment. Two years ago school district No. 22 and school district 
No. 2G consolidated. They are now circulating a petition 
to form a new district from the eastern part of this consolidated 
district. 

F. W. MONTGOMERY, 

GRANT COUNTY, 1901— We have only six organized schools 
in Grant county and they are far apart. This year district No. i 
sends all its pupils to Hyannis (district No. 1), and gets a nine 
months' school for less than $100. There is only one district 
in the county that has a six months' school ; all others have eight 
and nine months. There will be a strong effort made this year 
to consolidate this whole county into two districts," the Hyannis 
and Whitman districts.

HALL COUNTY, 1904 — Progress toward consolidation in 

Hall county has been rather slow. Some efforts have been made 

in three localities. A small district east of the Doniphan school 

district has been asked to join Doniphan, but the proposition 

meets the approval of but few in the country districts. The 

Doniphan district has two school houses, one of which is two and 

one-half miles west of town. Twice recently the officers brought 

up at annual meeting the proposition to close the school and 
transport the children to town. The people from the country 

hool location opposed it so vigorously that it has never been 

forced to a vote. 

lest of Wood River an effort was made to organize a nev 

rict out of a part of three old ones. This failed. They then 

d at the last annual meeting on the proposition to call a 

special meeting to discuss the proposition of organizing a town-

Atlanta, Neb., April 13, 1903. 

Superintendent U. C. Breithaupt : 

Your letter of April 2nd has been received ; in reply will say 
that our experience of sending our pupils to adjoining schools 
has been satisfactory the past year. The pupils received seven 
months' schooling. One boy that attended school in Atlanta 
rrtissed only one day out of seven months. The cost of tuition is 
$41.50. One month's school in our own district would cost nearly 
that much. 

Oscar Lonn. 

1 believe several districts will follow this plan next year. 

U. C. BREITHAUPT. 

1904 

During the past year four districts sent their pupils to adjoining 
districts, paying their tuition. Total expense for district 
No. 63 was $45 ; for district No. 71, $35 ; district No. 37, $130 ; 
district No. 48, $105. All the pupils had the benefit of school 
eight months, and most of them attended graded schools. If 
they had employed teachers in their home districts, six months 
would have been the limit, and the expense would have been 
at least $200 in each of the above districts. This proposition of, 
sending to adjoining districts is meeting with favor, as it is 
better understood by the people of this county. 

P. P. BENTLEY. 

HAYES COUNTY, 1903— Three districts have been discontinued 
during the past year, and their territory united to two 
others. The new district No. 63 consists of 28 sections, with- a 
school census of 40. One teacher is required instead of two, 
the tax levy has been reduced from 25 to 15 mills, and the enrollment 
increased from 30 to 38 pupils. 

t District No. 25, formed of three united districts, comprises 
sections, with a school census of 56. The number of teachers 
necessary has been reduced from three to one, and the former insufficient 
levy of 25 mills to 20 mills; this would have been reduced 
still further were it not for old debts. When these are paid </seg>

JAMES O'CONNELL. 

HOOKER COUNTY, 1903— Districts Nos. 1 and 3 have been 
consolidated with No. 2, and we are also uniting with No. 2 
all unorganized territory, but this is a matter that has not been 
entirely accomplished, and we have not had any school under 
the new plan.* The consolidated district comprises 1"&gt; townships 
(540 sections), with a school census of 125. Two teachers will 
be employed the ensuing year, instead of three as heretofore. 

*Note — I believe Hooker county and several other counties 
in Nebraska might with profit be consolidated into one schooi 
district, the School District of County, with a board of 
six members, one central school carrying high school work, and 
as many outlying rural schools as might be necessary. — \Y. K. 
Fowler. 

1904 

All Hooker county, 24 by 30 1-3 miles, is now consolidated into 
three and one-half school districts. Small school houses have 
been built where there are settlements, as the distance to Mullen 
is too great. We have not tried the free transfer wagon, — 
ranches are too far apart. This is practically the first year of con- 

solidation in this county, and by all appearances at present it 
is going to prove successful.

JEFFERSON COUNTY, 1904— In 1902 districts Nos. 45 and 
32 united. They built a two-roomed house and now run two 
wagons. The work is better graded, the pupils in better condition 
and the people in the district better satisfied. No one 
would go back to the separate districts. I can not give data on 
the financial side of the question, but understand that it is about 
tsame as before. I know the teachers are better paid than in

KEITH COUNTY, 1903— Districts Nos. 12 and 43 were united

from 2 to 8 pupils. 

kin this county we have 08 districts. It seems to me that these 
ould be consolidated so as to make 29. Last year I published 
o articles on this subject without effect, as it seems every voter 
wants a school house within a half mile of his house. Considering 
the conditions in this county, it would, in my judgment, be 
better to divide the county into three districts, one in the east. 
one in the west and one in the center. Build three school house? 
large enough and teach all grades from the primary to the 
twelfth, also erect dormitories and boarding houses for the pupils, 
appoint matrons to care for them and not allow any pupil to attend 
under eight years of age. The same funds that run our present 
system would support the above. There would be no tardiness, 
no days absent, no dread of blizzards and no wet feet. 

I shall be glad at any time to support anything in the line 
of consolidation. </seg>

District No. 90, with Yerdcl in one corner, has a rural school

will be abolished. This would lower the tax and secure tx

BTATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

1904 

Several districts of Lancaster county are too large for all to 
receive school privileges without transportation and too small 
for public transportation in the regulation style. In these districts 
directors are jealous of the boundary lines and watching for 
a chance for consolidation with graded school privileges, with 
little progress. 

The Camp Creek school, district No. 23, is a progressive district, 
and contracted in July, 1903, for school privileges in the 
Waverly schools. After the usual changes of occupants on rented 
farms last spring the number to be transported made the distances 
greater and the load heavier. Yet the advantages of 
graded schools were so great that the plan has been put in operation 
for the present school year. There are mqany districts more 
favorably situated for transportation, but this district is unusually 
progressive. Complaints in- this district against the 
plan ceased almost entirely as soon as patrons had actual experience 
with it. Delicate children are better cared for. 

O. R. BOWMAN. 

LINCOLN COUNTY, 1904— The number of districts in this 
county has been reduced in the past two years from 113 to 106. 
Our people are awakening to the fact that where consolidation 
has been made it not only improves the school, lowers the 
tax rate, but raises the value of real estate. Most of our vil'ages 
having outside schools are transporting the pupils at the expense 
of the district, thus giving the pupils the advantages of the graded 
school. I am confident the good work will continue in this 
county. 

O. W. NEALE. 

LOGAN COUNTY, 1904— To my knowledge this subject has 
never been brought before the people but once, and that at a 
public gathering. At that time it received but very little encouragement. 
Since my appointment I find some of the school officers 
quite favorably impressed and studying the subject with interest. 
I think it would give us better schools for the same money. I </seg>

have asked for space in the county paper to bring arguments 
for and against it before the patrons of our schools. 

MRS. A. C. KIRBY. 

McPHERSON COUNTY, 1903— Our schools are so isolated 
that consolidation is not practical. School houses are built where 
the settlements are. There are children in the county who have 
no school privileges, on account of distances from the school 
houses and not enough deeded land or other property with which 
to run a school. There were two private or subscription schools 
in the county this past year, and some families moved to towns 
in adjoining counties for the purpose of sending their children to 
school. Some districts have two school houses, and in one 
3, the Lemley district) school was taught in each school building 
at different times and some of the pupils were able to attend at 
both schoolhouses, thereby receiving nine months' schooling. 
Two-thirds of the county is yet unorganized into school districts 

MRS. BLANCHE E. CLINE. 

1904 

I think the schools of this county could be consolidated into 
one district with great profit, as there are some children without 
school privileges on account of being so far from school. It 
would also tend to equalize the taxation. 

MRS. FLORA FARROW. 

EADISON COUNTY, 1904— Absolutely nothing has been 
in the county since your last report. In several cases I 
urged that weak districts transport their pupils to adjoining 
icts, but in every case I have failed to effect the end. 

Ehere are only three or four cases in the county where condation 
is at all practicable in my judgement.

two sections in the county where it may be accomplished within 
the next two years. Many of the residents in these sections are 
actively interested and are lending their voice and aid in every 
way. In one locality the object is to unite five districts, and in 
the other seven. I am preparing data now to send to each member 
of these communities in regard to consolidation and free 
transportation. We are very hopeful of great improvement in 
the schools of Nemaha countv. 

GEO. D. CARRINGTON, JR. 

OTOE COUNTY, 1904— Sshool districts Nos. 14. 15 and 10 
were united with Nebraska City school district some years ago 
Transportation is provided for the pupils of these districts by 
two wagons which travel over a route about six miles in length 
for each wagon. School district No. 9. one and one-half miles 
north of Syracuse, has contracted with district No. 27, (Syracuse 
school district), for the coming year and are transporting the 
pupils in this district. I think in time this district wil unite with 
the above named district. Quite a number of our people are talking 
consolidation and the sentiment in favor of the proposition 
is getting stronger. 

R. C. KING. 

F»AWNEE COUNTY, 1903— We have a number of small dis:ts 
in Pawnee county which I think could, with advantage

it especially adapted and intend to discuss it in our county school 
journal. I hope we may have consolidated schools in the not far 
distant future.

PERKINS COUNTY, 100:5— District No. 82 was annexed to 
No. T, forming a district of 36 sections, with a school population 
of 2:&gt; and one teacher, although formerly but one was required 
as instruction in a neighboring district had been provided U

A. SOFTLEY. 

PHELPS COUNTY. 1904— District No. "il took advantai; 
the law providing for the instruction of pupils in a neighboring 
district last year and was so well pleased that it will do the same 
again this year. District No. 1 transported its pupils two years 
ago and was well pleased for the time being, as so few pupils 
Ee in the district. At present they are having school in their 
i district, as the census and enrollment is so much larger. 

E. E. LARSON 

PIERCE COUNTY, 1904— No consolidation has been effected 
in this county. Xo. 43 — the McLean school — tried to get tinrounding 
districts interested last spring, but failed to accomplish 
anything. I am certain that Pierce county is not ready for "consolidation." 


FRANK PILGER. 

PLATTE COUNTY, 1903— In 1900 district No. 2? was united 
with district No. 76 (the Monroe school) forming a new district 
of about ten square miles, with a sehool census of 195, requiring 
three teachers where previously three had been employed. There 
is one wagon route about three and one-half miles in length for 
eighteen children. The levy last year was 25 mills. The enrollment 
last year was 143 and the average daily attendant: </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

Before consolidation the enrollment was 20 and 82 in the two 
districts, a total of 102, and the average daily attendance was 
63. But the town of Monroe has grown considerably since the 
consolidation was effected. 

L. H. LEAVY. 

1904 

The prospect of consolidating more of our schools than reported 
last year seems out of the question at present. There is some 
agitation on this subject in a few districts, but none of the districts 
in question have decided to act. Consolidation would meet 
with excellent results in certain districts and we anticipate that 
at some future time these districts will avail themselves of the 
privileges of this law. 

L. H. LEAVY. 

POLK COUNTY, 1904— In Polk county there has been no 
toward consolidation of districts, but the tide has been running 
toward the division of districts. The result is, we have a number 
of districts in the county that can not have nine months of school 
and pay the average wages without running in debt. As the 
small district tide is now ebbing, I believe that it will only be a 
few years until Polk county will have fewer districts, and none 
which can not maintain a good school. Within the last year, in 
two townships, there has been some agitation over consolidation 
and a marked advancement made in public opinion in favor of 
consolidation. 

D. C. COLE. 

RED WILLOW COUNTY, 1903— We have been making 
some progress in consolidation. District No. 59, with a valuation 
r i,216, and census of eight pupils has been annexed to district 
6, the village of Lebanon. District No. 40, with a valuation 
of $6,455, census of nineteen pupils, has been annexed to district 
No. 70, the village of Bartley. Others are talking consolidation

I report, but some districts are taking advantage of the 
ons of section 4c, subdivision 5. Last year district No. •*&gt;•• 
tracted with district No. 17 (McCook) for the instruction of 
pupils, and also contracted for their transportation to and 
n school. That the plan was highly satisfactory is proved by 
fact that during this summer, the school house with all other 
x&gt;l property was disposed of. and the same plan decided upon 
this year. Two other districts, Nos. 56 and 76, are expecting 
lo the same. 

»ist year school districts Nos. 29, 73 and 77 contracted with 
ining districts, and this year Nos. 73, 77 and 30 will follow 
same plan. 

Two adjoining districts, Nos. 62 and 85, each voted but four 
months' school. They have hired the same teacher for both 
districts and the children from both districts will attend each 
school four months, thus receiving eight months of schooling. 

FLORA B. QUICK. 

JUCHARDSON COUNTY, 1903— No consolidation is reted 
but districts Nos. 12 and 36 have closed their schools and 
itracted with No. 37 (the Humboldt school) under the proions 
of section 4c, subdivision 5, for the instruction of their

length and carries eight pupils. All patrons and pupils are 
11 pleased with the plan. I think several districts will make 
lilar contracts next year. 

GEO. CROCKER. 

1904 

The conditions stated above in our districts Nos. 12 and 36 
still exist, the patrons and pupils are very well pleased. Their 
school facilities are very much better and their school taxes 
are less. During the past year district No. 48 has contracted 
with district No. 56 (the Falls City school) and our district Xo 
7 has contracted with district No. 76 (the Stella school). This 
district No. 7 maintains a wagon route about five miles in length 
Patrons and pupils in these districts are well pleased wih the 
plan. The idea of consolidation is growing rapidly.

the people live so far apart. A conveyance would have to

C. L. HOPPER. 

STANTON COUNTY, 1904— District No. 17 is paying three 
dollars per pupil for each twenty days' attendance for transportation 
to a neighboring school. Because of the few children in 
the district, the patrons feel that they can pay for the transportation 
cheaper than they can conduct a first class school in their

to stimulate attendance.

districts in several parts of the county during the past year, but 
failed to accomplish it in every instance. The majority of the 
farmers seem to be afraid that it is only a fad and will not work 
out satisfactorily. They need to be educated along these lines. 
Their argument now is that the town schools wish to build up 
their schools at the expense of the country schools. I believe 
consolidation is a good thing and, in time, we will have it in 
Thayer county.

ALTA B. JONES. 

WASHINGTON COUNTY, 1904— In this county there is no 
need of consolidation so far as finances are concerned, as every 
district can pay good wages without making taxes burdensome. 
There are several districts in which the enrollment is too small 
to enable a teacher to do good work. In this instance I believe 
it would be well to consolidate, thereby securing more interesting 
work and better results at a less expense per capita. 

A. L. COOK. 

YORK COUNTY, 1903 — We tried to effect consolidation in 
Arborville township two years ago — that is, we held two meeting 
— but the people were afraid of it and we quit. Two or three 
of our smaller towns are' doing some planning but no definite 
steps have been taken. The town districts want to have surrounding 
districts unite and keep the school in town. I believe 
that it can be done — in time.

tionsolidation has been talked of in this county and, under

the villages, looking forward to uniting their districts,

8TATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

These statistics are taken from the annual report of the county 
superintendents of Nebraska for the school year 1900-1901. They 
show that the small schools are greater in number than most of 
us knew. There are 489 schools with an average daily attendance 
of five or less; 1,841 with ten or less; 3,528 with fifteen or less; 
4,??1 with twenty or less. There are about 6,300 strictly rural 
school districts in Nebraska. This makes nearly three-fourths 
of our rural schools in each of which is an average daily attendance 
too small for vigorous, interesting and profitable work, 
either educationally and socially or financially. No time need 
be sent in rehearsing these facts. No school can claim conditions 
for good work if it have less than twenty-five pupils; yet there 
are 4,771 rural schools in Nebraska in operation with an average 
daily attendance ranging from one to twenty pupils. I believe 
we are all ready to unite on this proposition — the pupils 
in the small rural schools must be collected into larger and better 
schools with better teachers, better paid. "It does not matter 
how much we deplore the condition which makes consolidation 
of schools necessary, the fact remains that it is the only rational 
solution of the question that has been offered." 

The Emerson Consolidated School District, 1903 

This consolidated school district was formed, by petition, in 
the spring of 1902, uniting district No. 7 of Thurston county 
with fractional district No. 61 of Dakota and Dixon counties. 
The consolidated district consists of 23 sections in Thurston 
county, 5 1-2 sections in Dixon county and 1 7-8 sections in 
Dakota county. 

fid district No. 7 of Thurston county contained three school 
ses poorly located. These were moved to new locations 
two new school buildings were erected. No bonds were 
ed nor was any extra tax levy necessary for this purpose. 

{?he tax levy in old district No. 7 of Thurston county had been 
mills for a number of years. The tax levy in district No. 61 
ore the consolidation had been 25 mills for two years, or since 
number of saloons in Emerson had been reduced. The tax 
y in the new consolidated district No. 61 is now 25 mills, and </seg>

            <seg id="p385">

three saloons pay $500 license each. The real estate in Thurston 
county, being Indian reservation land, is not taxable. The 
valuations on personal property are much higher in Thurston 
county than in Dakota and Dixon counties, or, at any rate, more 
personal property is assessed in Thurston county than in the 
other counties. A shortage of nearly $1,000 existed for the past 
school year, owing to the large expenditures for buildings and 
new books. If the tax levy is kept at 25 mills, the revenue for 
next year will be amply sufficient. 

We have one central school building, including a high school 
at Emerson, and five rural school houses. In all these schools 
we have uniformity of text books and course of study. No work 
above the eighth grade is permitted in any of the rural schools. 
All high school work is done in the central building at Emerson. 
The superintendent visits the rural schools once each month, 
and all teachers are required to meet with the superintendent 
once each month. 

e. h. McMillan. 

EMERSON, 1904— The consolidated school district of Emerson, 
Nebraska, was formed, by petition, in the spring of 1902 
Originally the Emerson school district, No. 61. included fractional 
districts in Dixon and Dakota counties, as the county line between 
these counties runs down the main street. In 1902 a strip 
of Indian reservation land (one mile wide and three miles long) 
in Dixon county, adjoining district No. 61 was added and a new 
schol house built at the west end of the district. Also district 
No. 7 of Thurston county, which contained three school houses, 
was added to district No. 61. Two of the school houses were 
moved to new locations and another new one built. The consolidated 
district now includes 23 sections of land in Thurston 
county, 5 1-2 sections in Dixon county and 1 7-8 sections in 
Dakota county. As the land in the original district No. 7 of 
Thurston county was Indian land and not taxable, it was difficult 
to raise sufficient funds with the maximum tax levy of 28 mills. 
The tax levy in the Emerson district previous to consolidation 
had been 23 mills for some time. The tax levy for the consoli- </seg>

            <seg id="p386">
280 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S KEPOBT 

dated district has been 25 mills and will be the same this vear. 

On account of the extra expenditure on account of moving the 
school houses, building the new ones, and furnishing text books 
and equipment, there was a shortage the first year of about 
0.' Now. however, after two years, we have on hand at the 
beginning of the year $1,500, while our funds in the near future 
will be largely increased by taxes from Indian heirship lands 
which are now being sold. These lands become taxable as soon 
as they pass out of the hands of the Indians. On the whole thg 
outlook for consolidated district No. (!1 is a very promising one 
and the patrons seem to be heartily in favor of the plan. We have 
one central high school building in Emerson, where six teachers 
are employed, and the five rural school houses before mentioned. 
The whole system is looked after by a superintendent, and a 
uniform course of study is followed. The rural schools complete 
the eight grades, after which pupils are admitted to the high 
school. The superintendent visits the rural school once a 
month, and all teachers meet with the superintendent once a 
month. At present our schools are very much crowded, but in 
the near future a commodious high school building will accommodate 
the rapidly increasing attendance.

The Powell Consolidated School District, 1903 

Two school districts were consolidated at Powell, in Jefferson 
county, Nebraska, in the spring of 1902. The consolidated district 
comprises ten and eleven-sixteenths square miles. During 
the school year 1902-1903 about thirty children were transported 
at an expense of $198 for the nine months. The total enrollment 
was 87 pupils, with an average attendance of 51. The total number 
of children of school age was 90. During the last year before 
consolidation the total enrollment in the two districts was 
64, with an average attendance of 43. Under consolidation there 
were fewer cases of tardiness and more regular attendance. The 
cost of maintenance during the first year under consolidation 
was somewhat increased, but the teachers' salaries were raised </seg>

in every respect. County Superintendent F. A. Carmony and 
Principal C. VV. Samms both speak of the plan in the hi; 
terms and say it is a success in every particplar. 

The Maxwell Consolidated School District 

Before the year 1902 the Maxwell school district in Lin 
ounty contained two ungraded schools several miles apart, 
ccount of the increasing population, it was seen that an&gt; 
chool house would soon be necessary. This would make 
chool houses in the district, with three ungraded school?. 
ill some of the pupils would be a few miles from school. R; 
ian do this, it was decided that the old school houses shoal 
old, a house with two comfortable rooms should be built 
le center of the district, and a graded school should be mainained. 
Something of a village had sprung up at Maxwell st . 
'he new school house was located there. At the same school 
eeting (1902) at which a court house was voted, it \\ 
lat the district should furnish transportation to pupils of th&gt; 
ict who did not live near the new school hor 

At first one man was hired to furnish his own wagon run! I 
o transport the pupils to and from the school boose. Bui 
was unsatisfactory because some of the pupils must be ha 
everal miles in order to pass the homes of the others. An 
any pupils hauled by one team, with very poor roads, made 
ress slow and uncertain, and very disagreeable in cold or st&lt; 
eather. Then in 1903 two drivers wore hired. They tra\ 
le routes now used. One of the routes is nine miles Ion;; 
ansports the most distant pupils about four miles. The i 
oute is about seven miles long and transports the farthest \&lt; 
&gt;out three miles. The drivers furnished their own wagon- 

Eims and were paid $30 and $25 respectively. Considerable 
ading had now been done on the roads and these two routes 
:re much more satisfactorv than the one had been. 

But some of the most considerate patrons of the school tho 
they noticed an opportunity for further improvement, for </seg>

            <seg id="p390">
282 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S KEl'OKT 

wagons furnished by the drivers were sometimes uncomfortable, 
and the pupils were more or less exposed to the weather. At the 
next school meeting (1904) it was decided that the district should 
furnish transportation wagons which should be used and cared 
for by the drivers, but should be the permanent property of thedistrict. 
The board then purchased two strong and comfortably 
barge wagons or "carry-all" at a cost of about $150 each. (See 
illustration.) Drivers and teams were hired at an expense of 
$45 a month, — a decrease of $10 per month from the wages paid 
last year. 

»Thus far this plan has been entirely satisfactory to the teach-5, 
the pupils, the board of education, and the patrons of the 
school. The drivers are paid to be prompt, and the pupils thus 
transported arrive on time. The wagons are well covered and 
comfortable, and there is no cause for worry about storms or 
accidents. The district thus united makes a graded school with 
an enrollment of 86 pupils. In our district, it was a choice between 
this and three ungraded schools. We have chosen this 
method, and are entirely satisfied with our choice.

shall be a part of the regularly prescribed course of the State 
Normal School or Schools, and students in regular attendance 
and pursuing and completing these studies in a satisfactory 
manner shall be granted a certificate to this effect, signed by the 
conductor of the Junior Normal School and countersigned by 
the state superintendent, which certificate shall entitle the holder 
to proper credit at the State Normal School or Scho 

Appropriation 

Sec. 5. That there shall be and there hereby is appropr; 
out of any moneys in the state treasury and not otherwise appropriated 
the sum of twelve thousand ($12,000.00) dollars for 
the purpose of establishing and maintaining said Junior Normal 
Schools. 

Reasons for Such Schools 

The Junior Normal Schools are for those who cannot afford 
to take a complete course elsewhere. Each fall we have in the 
schools of this state over 2,500 new, inexperienced teachers. Of 
the 9,000 teachers employed every year, but 5.5 per cent are graduates 
of a college or university; but 40 per cent have a high 
school education or its equivalent ; 29 per cent receive less than a 
three years' high school education, and 15 per cent have no 
school training. These figures show that less than 16 per cent 
have anything like professional training.

tend one of these schools for the entire term, or some other school 
for an equal period. 

I hose teachers who attend the full term of ten weeks, and 
j manifest a desire to be profited in methods, in scolarship. 
in increased love for the work, should be given proper credit 
the examination by their respective county superintendents, 
srefore, I recommend that all teachers who attend the full 
n and who make good use of every opportunity offered by the 
aols be excused from examination in every branch with a 
de of 80 or above, and in addition thereto that a credit of 5 
cent on the general average be given to every such teacher. 

Further, every teacher who attends any one of these schools 
for the full term of ten weeks will be worth at least $10 per 
month more to her school. I urge upon school officers then 
only simple justice when I say that they should pay higher salaries 
to those teachers who thus prepare for their work than to 
the indifferent teachers who do not make such preparation 
There is no way to have better schools unless we have better 
teachers. Let the teachers prepare for their work. Let school 
officers pay the highest wages the funds of the district will permit 
for the best qualified teacher available. In this way, and 
in this way only, can we exalt our schools. 

The Course of Study 

In explanation of the statement made in Section 4 of House 
Roll No. 100, relative to the course of study, I desire to 
that classes will be organized in all the subjects required for 
first, second and third grade county certificates, especial emphasis 
being given to the common branches. The science and 
art of school government will receive special attention and will 
be treated in a common sense, practical manner. 

One of the leading features in each of these Junior Normals 
will be a model school, conducted by a primary teacher abreasv 
the times in educational thought and practice. By Model School, 
it is meant to have the work demonstrated by classes of children 
in the first, second and third grades in reading, numbers and </seg>

            <seg id="p395">
287 


language. The other features of the Model School will con 
instruction in methods, busy work, nature study, etc. It will be 
a Model School in fact as well as in name — a school in \jhich 
the young teacher may have the benefit of actual exercise in the 
business of instruction under the direction of a model teacher. 

k Teachers should plan to take three or four academic stu 
voting the remainder of their time to professional training in 
the Model School and in the science and art of teaching and the 
science and art of school government. To know the matter to be 
taught, and to know it thoroughly, are of themselves, though 
itial, not all that is required. There is a peculiar art of 
teaching. The details of this branch are inexhaustible, but it is 
hoped that the most important principles may be brought within 
such a compass as to afford material benefit to those who 
even the short term of ten weeks in one of these schools. The 
best method of governing a school — that is of exercising such a 
tral influence in it as is most favorable to the improvement of 
pupils — will form a very important part of the course designed 
to qualify teachers for their signal calling. How much is 
implied in the words, "to govern a school !" The instru 
in this branch will, therefore, dwell on the government of the 
youth as of paramount importance, as that part of the teacher's 
duty which demands the rarest union of qualities, which 
tries the temper, and, when faithfully and judiciously perfor 
tmost important and far reaching in its results. "Give me the 
ild whose heart has embraced without violence the gentle love 
of obedience, in whom the sprightliness of youth has not encroached 
on deference for authority, and I would rather ha\ -e 
him for my son, though at the age of twelve he should have his 
alphabet to learn, than be compelled to struggle with the caprice 
of a self-willed, obstinate youth, whose bosom has become a 
viper's nest of the unamiable passions, although in early attainments 
he may be the wonder of the day." 

The Instructors 

ro discrimination has been made in the selection of the faculty 
the several schools. In each school the instructors are </seg>

            <seg id="p396">
288 


and women of scolarship, experience, integrity, — men and women 
of well-known and approved educational opinions. They are 
among the ablest school men and momen of the state. They are 
acquainted with the public school system ; with the needs of the 
public schools and especially the needs of the rural schools 
They know the needs of the hour and the demands of the future 
They are men and women of heart power as well as brain power 
Each instructor is peculiarly fitted for the work he is to do : 
peculiarly fitted for the school to which he has been assigned. 

Tuition and Entrance Requirements 

These Junior Normal Schools will bo absolutely free to all 
teachers and prospective teachers of Nebraska. Not even an 
institute fee can be charged. Attendants must be "fourteen 
years of age, of good moral character, and of good physical 
health, " who "have a fair knowledge of the common school 
branches such as may be obtained in the country schools or in 
the lower eight grades of well organized city schools." 

Reduced Railroad Rates 

The railroads made a rate of one and one-third fare for 
round trip on the certificate plan for certain dates. Tea 
should not fail to take receipts when they purchase their tic 
This will entitle them to return at a one-third fare. Other 
they will have to pay full fare both ways. Tickets will h&lt; 
at this rate, the "going" dates limited to June 0. 7 and 8, and August 
fl and 10, good returning on or before August 17, 
Dates for Valentine will be one week later. 

Special Features 

A conference hour will be held each day of the L crm to 
teachers an opportunity to receive special help from their instructors 
on perplexing problems, questions, etc., except on 
certain days when this hour will be given over to the county 
superintendents to discuss with their own teachers matte 
special interest and importance relative to the work in th

done at each of the places where the Junior Normal Schools are 
to be held. 

The last week of the Junior Normal School will be the Union 
Normal Institute for those counties incorporated under this law 
Let it be kept in mind by all concerned that no tuition will be 
charged those who attend any of the Junior Normal Schools or 
any of the Union Normal Institutes connected with them. Teachers 
who attend the Union Normal Institute should be excused 
from attendance at the institute held in the home county. 

If any institute be held in the home county let it be before 
the beginning of the Junior Normal or after its close. This 
plan would give the Junior Normal Schools a clear field and a fair 
test. If every county superintendent in the territory of I 
schools do their duty by them, we shall make the greatest adficement 
in the professional training of teachers ever recorded 
a single year's work in the history of the state. 

Loyal Support Assured 

The attendance at these schools depends almost entirely upon 
the attitude of the county superintendents, and we are pleased 
to announce that loyal support is assured from this source, as 
the following extracts from letters now on file with this department 
prove : 

SUPT. A. SOFTLEY, Perkins Countv 

"I am thinking of advising the teachers and school boards of 
this county to make their contracts before the Junior Normal 
at North Platte begins. I think also that it would make a material 
increase in the size of our delegation there if the contracts 
E contain a proviso that teachers attend the Junior Normal 
the full term or nearly so. If you favor the idea I shall 
ich board two contracts with the advice to use them as 

soon as possible." 

I favor such stipulation in the teacher's contract ; provided, 
school officers will pay a salary commensurate with such preparation. 
I believe teachers stand ready to meet such terms 
when there is a tenure of office and a salary guaranteed which </seg>

will warrant such expense and such preparation on their part 

SUPT. ESTELLA M. DANIELS, Brown County: 

"If higher wages, as a result of better preparation, wen 
sured, I am confident that more than half the teachers of Brown 
county would attend the entire term of ten weeks. I am counting 
on at least twenty-five of my teachers to attend the entire 
term, and full attendance during the institute week." 

"It is my desire to do all that I can towards making the Junior 
Normal at McCook a success. I shall use our papers to a 
this school in a large attendance from Dundy county.". 

"I shall do my best for the success of the Valentine Junior 
Normal School. I am perfectly willing that the expense of a 
lecture course for Rock county teachers at Valentine be paid out 
of the institute fund of this county." 

MRS. W. E. HEARD, Supt. Banner County : 
"I am elated over the passage of House Roll No. 100. I shall 
use every effort possible to secure a good attendance from this 

county 

nothing but professional training. I shall advise all my teache 
who possibly can to attend the Junior Normal at McCook." 

SUPT. IDA M. KIMBERLING, Chase County 

"There will be quite a number of my teachers who will attend 
at McCook. I want all who can to take advantage of it. " 

"I am glad the Junior Normal bill has become a law. It is what 
we need in Western Nebraska. I will do all in my power to make 
the school at Alliance a success."

nearly every one with whom I have spoken concerning it are 
much in favor of it. I like the plan to do away with the county 
institute unless there be some who cannot attend at Alliance." 

SUPT. H. L. FISHER, Dawes Countv : 

"You can depend on my hearty co-operation in the work for the 
Junior Normal. I believe as suggested that it is better to do 
away with the county institute.' 

SUPT. H. R. DELLIXGER, Grant County: 

"You may incorporate Grant county with the Junior Nor 
School at Alliance." 

SUPT. WALTER R. KENT, Sheridan Countv 

"I wish you to incorporate my county with the Junior Normal 
at Alliance under the Union Normal Institute law. I am trying 
to induce the great majority of my teachers to go to Alliance, 
and I hope to succeed." 

SUPT. C. P. CHAMBERS, Cheyenne Countv: 

"I think no locality has more need of such a school than that 

tributary to Holdrege. In case you deem it best to locate one of

power to get as many of my teachers to attend the entire time

will spend two days at each school, and each will give two addresses 
on questions of peculiar interest to teachers. 

An effort is being made to secure the Slayton Jubilee Singers 
or some first class musical attraction for one entertainment at 
each school during the last week of the term, and we hope tc 
be able to make this announcement in due time. 

Free Text Books 

Arrangement have been made whereby teachers in attendance 
at these schools will be furnished all necessary text books 
free. This is an item of considerable importance to teachers in 
cutting down expenses. However, teachers should bring with 
them whatever text books and reference books they may have at 
their command. Such books will be of good service to their owners 
many times. 

A Check on Agents 

No agent or firm will be allowed to annoy teachers by tr 
to take their orders for educational journals, helps, etc., in or 
around the school building, without special permission of the 
principal of the school. In no instance will exhibits of such supplies 
be tolerated in or around the school building. If teachers 
want supplies they may order them through their county superintendent, 
instructor, local dealer, or order for themselves through 
the mail. This action is taken to protect teachers from overzealous 
agents, and to give to teachers the advantage of all discounts. 
The only exception we make to this rule is for The Nebraska 
teacher. We believe every teacher in the state should 
subscribe for this paper. Authorized representatives of the The 
Nebraska Teacher will be given a limited opportunity to present 
their terms and clubbing rates at each Junior Normal. 

In Conclusion 

In conclusion let me impress this thought. The schools are 
in our hands. We are responsible for their character. Each of 
us has a work to do that can be done by no other. The burden 
is upon us all, and we may bear it bravely or shift it to other </seg>

Resolutions 

Adopted by the Students at the Alliance Junior Normal School. 

Whereas, We, the teachers of Dawes, Box Butte, Grant, Sheri- 

dan, Sioux, Banner, Hooker, Scotts Bluff, Kimball and Chey- 

enne counties, having derived great benefit from the Alliance 

Junior Normal, do hereby adopt the following resolutions : 
We desire to express our appreciation and gratitude : 
First — To the state department for the aid given in support 

of the Alliance Junior Normal and for the lecture course. 
Second — To W. H. Bartz, to whose management and busines 

ability we attribute much of the success of the Normal, and to 

and S. H. Martin, whose zeal in their work and whose example 

have been a great inspiration to u 

t 

Third — To County Superintendents Baumgardner, Fisher, Par- 

sons, Kent, Dellinger, Mrs. W. E. Heard and Misses Agnes 

Lackev and Alice Wilkenson. 

Fourth — To the citizens of Alliance for the kindness extended 

us socially ; to the ministers for their interest in us, and the rail- 

roads for the rates granted. 

Fifth — Whereas, We feel that the wealth of Northwestern Ne- 

braska is greater according to the population than that of Eastern 
Nebraska and the teachers of this part of the state need normal 
training, therefore we desire a permanent Normal in Northwest- 

ern Nebraska. 

K Sixth — Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be given 
ch superintendent for publication in their respective counties. 
To the Teachers and School Officers of Western Nebraska : 

Resolutions adopted by the superintendents of Box Butte, 
Banner, Dawes, Cheyenne, Kimball, Sheridan, Scotts Bluff, 
t Grant and Hooker counties in session at the Junior Normal

onal ability amoung our teachers we, the superintendent 

of the above mentioned counties, resolve : 

That in compliance with the recommendations of State Su 

perintendeitf: Fowler, we will maintain a reasonable standard 

of qualification and refuse to issue certificates to those who fall 

below such standard merely to supply the demand for teachers. 
That there will be no transfer of grades below 90 per cent, 
except for those who have done satisfactory work for at 

eight weeks in an accredited Normal within the year. 

That we believe that no one should begin teaching without 

first having had at least eight weeks of normal training. 
That in districts where the taxes are not sufficient to pay sal- 

aries commensurate with the qualifications required, or where 

lively interest cannot be maintained on account of the small 

number of pupils, we recommend that these districts take ad- 

vantage of the consolidation or contract law when the locatioi 

of the districts make it practicable. We further recommend 

that when neither of these laws is practicable the same 

qualified teacher be engaged to teach short terms of school 

adjoining districts so that pupils in those districts may attend 

a good school for as long a term as possible. 

That as the law does not recognize a permit, every person 

should hold a certificate in force before contracting for or be 

ginning a school. 

That requests for permits or more than two third grade certi- 

ficates will not be considered. 

That school boards should consider professional spirit, 

thorougness of preparation, and strong scolarship in the teacher 

and pay salary in accordance therewith. 

That these resolutions be printed and a copy be sent to each 

teacher and school officer in the counties above mentioned and 
that they be published in the local papers.

fields : that we appreciate the untiring efforts of Superintendent 
G. H. Thomas and the citizens of McCook for the many kindnesses 
they have shown; that we appreciate the efforts of the 
instructors, lecturers, speakers, and all who have assisted in 
making this institution a success; that more than ever as w 
forth from this school to take up the duties of our profession, 
we appreciate the board principles of Christian education and 
the difficult and ceaseless labor devolving upon every person 
entering the strenuous life of a teacher. 

Resolved further, That as we separate, we do so with a firm 
resolve that we shall put forth every effort to place oursehi s 
upon the highest plane of educational workers that we may approach 
a true professional standard. We believe, first, in giving 
to our pupils the elements of a strong English education and. 
second, in teaching them the worth and meaning of honesty, 
integrity, uprightness and courtesy in all their associations with 
playmates, schoolmates, teachers and parents: third, that we 
inculcate into their lives the true essence of patriotic citizenship : 
fourth, that we believe in the intense value of higher education, 
and that we shall encourage in every possible manner the pupils 
I our charge to pursue their education to the utmost limit. We 
lieve, further, that every true teacher should pursue fa 

her work earnestly and systematically, and that he or she should 
spend at least one hour each day in study of approved educational 
magazines and standard pedagogical works, and that he 
or she should spend also a few hours each week in culture study. 
We also believe that no teacher can afford to teach without making 
a most thorough preparation for her daily work. 

And finally, we commend the work of the McCook Junior Normal 
School to every active teacher in its district, and recomrnd 
to the various county superintendents that they extend 
ir heartiest and most loyal co-operation in making the session 
1904 the greatest possible success, and that they join their in- </seg>

Endorsements 

PRIX. W. H. BARTZ, Alliance 

The Junior Normal School at Alliance filled a long felt want, 
and was much appreciated by those wishing to prepare for greater 
proficiency in the teaching profession ; it placed a summer school 
within a more reasonable radius than had hitherto been the 
case ; it afforded the teachers an opportunity to measure their 
qualifications, one with the other, as. to their knowledge of the 
different subjects, and at the same time infused new pedagogical 
life ; it produced greater uniformity in the grading of certificates 
in the different counties ; it granted to a large number, that 
heretofore had meager privileges along that line, an opportunity 
for secondary instruction ; it added a general stimulus to the 
cause of education in parts of the state where such stimulus was 
much needed ; it was a pronounced success both financially and 
in point of interest and work accomplished and, if expressions 
of satisfaction from the student body be a criterion, the session 
of 1904 will be more largely attended than was the session of 
1903. I but voice the sentiment of all interested when I state 
that the Normal was a glowing success. 

PRIX. J. F. CONNER, Holdrege 

The Holdrege Junior Normal School accomplished the purposes 
intended more fully than I thought possible for the first 
session. Although the interval between the passage of the law 
and the opening of the schools was very brief, yet a careful 
organization was effected, and a corps of instructors secured, each 
of whom was unusually well flitted for the work assigned him. 
From the first day the fact was emphasized that it was a Normal 
School rather than an institute, that the gain to each student 
would be in direct ratio to the effort put forth in the preparation 
of each lesson. I have never seen in any summer school such 
careful daily preparation of lessons assigned. The one aim kept 
constantly in view was to prepare the student to teach. All of 
the work was strictly professional, though most of it was also 
academic. The aim of every recitation was to give the student </seg>

            <seg id="p425">
311 



a teaching knowledge of the subjects studied. Besi 

in the subjects to be taught, in our school, there was also a very 
valuable course given in school management and another in 
pedagogy and aso a skillfully conducted model school to exemplify 
methods of instruction in all grades, from the first to the 
fourth. The Junior Normals fill most admirably a need that has 
been long felt in Western Nebraska. If made a permanent part 
of our schol system they are destined to become vital forces in 
the advancement of the cause of education. 

RIN. GEO. H. THOMAS, McCook: 

There has long been need for further systematic professional 

training of rural school teachers, and the Junior Normal Schools 
most nearly of all plans yet devised provide the means. Their 
success this summer, and the heartiness with which the teachers 
have availed themselves of their advantages, amply justify the 
wisdom and foresight of those who conceived their establishment 
and who carried the plans into execution. The idea of the k 

is splendid, but it needs to have more active co-operation of all 
county superintendents, whose teachers are directly benefiin-&lt;l 
by their presence and attendance. Where a system of country 
schools can be helped to such a degree as they, can be by better 

and more skillfully trained teachers, the managers of this rural 
teaching force cannot afford to be ambitious to conduct an ineffectual 
one week's institute, but rather must yield heartiest 
assistance to the building up of one central and well-conducted 
Normal. Then, besides, a county institute can scarcely be successful 
without the inspiration of numbers. In Hitchcock and 
Dundy counties this summer it was the intention of each superintendent 
to hold an institute, but the plan had to be abandoned 
simply because a majority of the teachers desired to attend s 
good Normal School, and so many went that there were too 
left to hold an institute satisfactorily. The cost of a Junior Normal 
School to the counties is less, the session is long enough to 
be beneficial, and the results achieved are obviouslv substantial. 

It will promote the good will with which the Junior Normal </seg>

PEKINTENDENT 8 REPORT 

&gt;ol idea has been received by the teachers if some more definite 
conception of what a Junior Normal School credit stands 
for can be set forth. The Junior Normal School credit should 
sent one step toward the acquirement of a professional life 
ucate, and the work the teachers will do this winter in their 
schools should be given some recognition in the way of credit 
to the same end. A plan of this kind, worked out in detail, wil! 
afford all teachers opportunity to realize in a tangible way upon 
their school attendance, and will lead them later, as it must, 
to a brief course in one of the state Normal Schools. 

rne of the most helpful features of the summer session was 
model training school, providing methods of instruction for 
primary grades. There is a demand for such a model school 
for intermediate grades, and I would recommend that one be 
Eblished. In order to achieve this end with the appropriaavailable, 
the regular academic work could be carried on 
i one less instructor. 

I wish especially to commend the work and the enthusiasm 
of the instructors who assisted at this school. Each was earnest 

in every endeavor, cordial in co-operation, and zealus to promote 
a greater efficiency among those who came here for help. 
The high standard of music instruction should by all means be 
tained, because it is clear that it is the music which smooths 
the way for concentrated study. I think, however, that a simpler 
grade of music, more within the range of average voices, should 
be purchased for the concert and chorus rehearsals. 

I cannot close this report without returning thanks to the 
members of the local committee, Miss Rache Berry, Mr. J. H. 
lett, Mr. C. H. Meeker and Mr. S. B. McLean, for their helpful 
and unfailing willingness to assist in the entertainment of 
the teachers, and without whose help the McCook school could 
not have been made so successful. My thanks are also due the 
state department of education for frequent counsel and willing 
assistance </seg>

PRIN. W. H. GARDNKR, North Platte : 

The work at North Platte was characteristic of the peopl 

of the western part of the state, being almost without exc; 

earnest and careful, and the teachers in attendance hard worV 

ing and enthusiastic in all that they undertook. The county s 

perintendents of the territory embraced by the North Plat 

Junior Normal gave much assistance to make the Normal a sv 

cess. Especial mention should be made of the excellent wot 

and Supt. Tressler of Keith county. The work done was accon 

ing to the directions of the state superintendent and the princip 

of the State Normal School. Credits for entering the State No 

mal Schools were given to more than a hundred, who had dor 

acceptable work for the required time. I cannot but belie\ 

that the work done at the North Platte Junior Normal by 

faithful instructors with their experience and energy will t 

great value to the schools of the counties of that part of t\ 

state, through the better scholarship and the professional 

gained in the schol work and through the series of entertainmen 

given during the term of the school. The people of North Platt 

especially the board of education, the ministers and the music 

talent of the city, did much to add to the pleasure 

ro 

of the school. The interest shown by all interested i 

Ik 

was such as to make the school a success and to call for a 

c&gt;: 

tinuance of it at North Platte 

The legislature and the state department should be commend* 
for establishing these shcools in the western part of the 
where they are so much needed and so much appreciated.

of the students who attended these Junior Normals could have 
reached in any other way. Some would have lacked the 
is, many more would have lacked the courage to go to the 
era part of the state to attend school. Of course we do not 
claim that the management of these schools has been perfect; 
but this undoubtedly will be improved from year to year. Perhaps 
less attention will be given to method and more to matter. 
are firm believers in method but when we attempt to precede 
matter with method our time is worse than wasted. We believe 
that instructors, county superintendents and all who have the 
I of the Junior Normal at heart will do well to act on the 
principle that a student who enters without sufficient knowledge 
to entitle her to a fair second grade certificate has no time for 
method except such as she must acquire from the instructor's 
manner of teaching the different subjects. 

r prophesy that the Junior Normal has come to stay. It 
stay unless something better comes in its stead and we 
not when anything better can come. 

1". J. W. BAUMGARDNER, Box Butte County 

Kunior Normal at Alliance was a grand success, affording 
&gt;rtunity whereby our teachers could and did receive 
training for their wark. The school was remarkable for 
the interest and enthusiasm on the part of the teachers and instructors. 
The exchange of ideas between teachers of several 
counties was very beneficial, creating greater professional spirit 
among them. The examination taken by all the teachers and 
graded by the same instructors, was a step forward in the matter 
of uniform grading of teachers for the counties concerned. The 
establishment of the Normal School here materially increased 
our supply of teachers, inducing more of our young people to 
make teaching their profession.

have expressed themselves as well pleased with the resultof 
the teachers in Western Nebraska can not save enough n 
in a year to attend a full school year — they could not be si 
from the schools if they did. The Junior Normal solves the problem 
of advancing our teachers while they are in the work. 
Junior Normal has more individuality than a summer term in 

(regular school. A summer term is usually looked upon as : 
:ondary affair. The Junior Normal School is the school of Um 
rality, and thus gives more inspiration to the teachers trnr 
y other school yet established for the summer. The teacher;

I At least ninety per cent of the teachers who attended th 
nior Normal during the summer would not have been in - 
y where else. The inspiration received from the study pur 
ed at these schools will inspire many to take a higher cours 

A large percentage of the teachers of Western Nebraska 
suing a systematic course of study and training during the &lt; 
mer months will certainly produce rapid advancement in 
schools of this locality. 

Relative to the value and usefulness of Junior Normal Scl: 
I will state that I was present only two days at the Alliance 
Junior Normal School. I found the school well patronized — 
teachers, pupils and county superintendents very earnest and 
enthusiastic in their work and there is no doubt that the school 
did a large amount of good for the western part of the state. 
I am well satisfied that money expended for Junior Normal 
Schools in Western Nebraska is casting bread upon the wa

the best. They are, as the state superintendent said, "Each

fully to better those in attendance in their work for the future. 
Those who attended will surely enter the schools with much 
more confidence and a desire to do much better work than before, 
and I am sure their work will be better, not only for the 
knowledge they have gained, but for the association with other 
teachers, as well as for the quiet example of their instructors, 
who have proven themselves whole-souled men and women. 

My one regret is that so few teachers from our county were 
in attendance the full term. Many from the different counties 
who were present during the institute week only were sorry 
that they had not been there during the nine preceding weeks. 
The enrollment for next year will certainly be much larger. 

And now I want to thank the state superintendent and those 
who have supported him for their earnest effort to establish 
these schools, the establishment of which has made it possible 
for the teachers to attend a Normal School near at home. This 
means a great deal to many. Much praise is due Mr. W. 11. 
Bartz and J. W. Baumgardner, who have worked unceasingly 
in behalf of the Alliance Junior Normal. 

SUPT. AGNES LACKEY, Scotts Bluff County : 
The Junior Normal School held at Alliance this year wa 

as far as this county is concerned. The number at 

nearly equaled the number of teachers required for the county. 

Perhaps the best effect of the Normal is that many who attended 

have become dissatisfied with their present 

ments and are 

mined to go on. A number are planning now to take next 

years work. Another valuable feature of this school for us is 

that the beginning teacher gets in touch with the school wor 

of the state, after listening: to addresses and talks of those from 

the different parts and associating for a lor 

o manv 

c 

others having a common aim. Students go with a definite end 

in view, — that of preparing for the next term of school. They 

return with an entirely different idea of the Greatness of their 

work. They find out that teaching means planning am

Instructors received the confidence and respect of every teacher. 
Lectures and entertainments were well patronized by the public. 
The prevailing sentiment of teachers and public was that the 
Junior Normal here should be made permanent. 

The Junior Normal is no longer an experiment: it has 
successful work among the educational forces of Western Nebraska. 
We can never go back to the one or two weeks' institut! 
until we have State Normals easily accessible to all the teach. 
of Western Nebraska. 

SUPT. EUGENE S. DUTCHER, Red Willow County 

Previous to last year, most of the persons who entered the 
profession of teaching in this county did so without any special 
training. In many instances they have not completed the high 
school course. These inexperienced, unprepared teachers cannot, 
with few exceptions, no matter how zealous, painstaking 
and earnest they are, produce the desired results. The Union 
Normal Institute at Culbertson did great things, but the Junior 
Normal, because of its greater length of time and more permanent 
character, is capable of still greater results. 

Very few teachers take up their work this year without having 
had several, and many of them ten, weeks' drill in preparation 
for their duties. This means a vast improvement in their teaching 
ability, and whatever value this improvement is to the children 
of the school must determine our estimate of the Junior Normal. 

SUPT. CLARA L. DOBSON, Frontier County 

The benefits of the Junior Normal School plan are already* 
apparent in Frontier county. About one-fourth of our teachers 
were in attendance. A dozen of these were successful teachers 
who appreciated the advantages to be gained, went with definite 
aims, and for the most part found the work well adapted 
to their needs. These speak in the highest terms of the excellent 
instruction afforded, and the efficient management of 
the schools. 

Most of those who went from our county had had little or no

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

rhythmics, note and rote singing, phrasing and dynamics, finding; 
the pitch, monotones, conducting, ear training, elementary harmony 
and part singing. The music course will consist of fifty 
lessons in the most practical work that can be given, and any 
one who can sing the scale can learn to be an independent singer 
in that time. 

Other Subjects. — Other classes will be organized to meet the 
needs of those attending the school. For special work to be 
planned in advance of the opening of the school address the 
principal of the school which you will attend. 

Reduced Railroad Rates 

The railroads grant a rate of one fare and one-third on the 
certificate plan for all the Junior Normal Schools. It is necessary 
to take a receipt from the agent from whom you purchase 
your ticket when coming to any one of these schools in order to 
be entitled to one-third fare returning home. If you come over 
two or more railroads you must take a receipt every time 
purchase a ticket. Each and every receipt must be signed by 
the principal of the school you attend. Tickets will be good for 
return up to and including August 23, 1904. 

Tuition 

Tuition is free. The county superintendents have agreed 
tpay one dollar for each teacher in attendance from their reective 
counties to cover the incidental expenses. 

One dollar will be charged each person enrolled for a lecture 
course ticket, with a promise to refund in whole or in part if the 
receipts from the county institute funds and local patronage 
permit. Some county superintendents have already agreed to 
pay the dollar lecture course fee for their teachers. This 
capital plan. We recommend it to all county superintendents. 

Entrance Requirements 

The entrance requirements are that one must be at least fourtenn 
years of age, of good moral character and of good physical 
health, and must have a fair knowledge of the common school </seg>

branches, such as may be obtained in the country school or 
the lower eight grades of a well organized town or city school. 

Free Text Books 

Arrangements have been made whereby teachers in attendance 
at these schools will be furnished all necessary text books free. 
This is an item of considerable importance to teachers in cutting 
down expenses. At some of the Junior Normal Schools 
teachers may be required to give some kind of a guaranty that 
the books will be returned in good condition. This requirement 
must be made on account of the hard usage and loss of books 
at one or two schools last year. Teachers should bring with 
them whatever text books and reference books they may have 
at their command. Such books will be of good service to their 
owners many times. 

Union Normal Institute 

The last week of the Junior Normal Schools will be the Union 
Normal Institute for the various counties in the territory of these 
schools. It is planned to make this week especially strong in 
enthusiastic, inspirational, professional work. Teachers who 
attend this Union Normal Institute should be excused from attendance 
at the institute held in the home county, and the county 
superintendent will undoubtedly be glad to grant such an excuse 
if application is made to him before his home institute is 
held. And teachers in attendance during the full term of the 
Junior Normal School should certainly be excused from attendance 
at the home institute. 

The Record Last Year 

The success of the five Junior Normals at Alliance, Holdr 
McCook, North Platte and Valentine last year was phenomenal. 
Over 1,100 students were enrolled in the five schools. A new 
world was revealed to hundreds of teachers and prospective 
teachers in these western counties. Many county superintendents 
have testified to the best work during the present school 
year ever accomplished in their schools as a direct result from 
the training received at the Junior Normal Schols. </seg>

            <seg id="p450">

8TATE SUPERINTENDENT^ REPORT 

In addition to the state's appropriation of $6,000 for the salary 
of the twenty-five instructors, nearly $2,500 was obtained 
from local donations, lecture course tickets, and the pro rata 
shave of the counties incorporated under the Union Normal Institute 
law. This money was expended for lecture talent, art 
exhibit, incidental expenses and extra institute instructors. 

The hearty support given to these schools by the county superintendents, 
the splendid attendance on the part of the teachthe 
liberal patronage and generous donations from every 
city where a Junior Normal School was located, and the excellent 
service rendered the state by principals and instructors 
made a record filled with credit and honor. 

The Work This Year 

We are assured hearty co-operation on the part of county 
superintendents and the public again this year. Many teachers 
who attended last year will return for further preparation. 
findreds of beginners will come to receive their first lessons 
professional training. 

fThe instructors are all men and women of unqualified scholarip, 
successful experience, rare common sense, and irreproachable 
character. The course of study will offer far greater advantages 
than it did last year. The lecture course is far superior 
to that of last summer. Every number on the list is a star attraction. 
We are confident, therefore, of greater and better 
things from these schools the coming term than were obtained 
at their first session. We have profited by our experience. In 
the fullness of time we may hope for a more permanent feature 
in this work, but let us hold fast to that which is good and press 
on to better things in tlip *f 11 tn rp </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPOET 

Endorsements 

PRIN. W. H. BARTZ, Alliance 

The best instruction that can be given by the best teachers 
to the pupils of our common schools is none to good for them, 
but when we contemplate the fact that often it is difficult for a 
rural school district to secure even a third grade teacher, a girl 
of sixteen or seventeen years of age, who has a very rudimentary 
knowledge of a few text books, and who has made no preparation 
for teaching, the condition is appalling. 

Irhe Junior Normals in the western part of the state for the 
d years past have, in a measure, helped to better this condition, 
1 I have received numerous applications from rural school 
irds for teachers that had attended the Junior Normal at 
iance, thus proving that the rural districts realize the benefits 
ived from attendance at these Normals. Since 'there are no 
te institutions in the western part of the state, it should be 
bounden duty of our state legislature to continue these State 
lior Normals to such time when the existing conditions, as 
fards preparation for teaching, shall be obviated. A disconuance 
of the Junior Normals would be a manifest retrogresn 
in the cause of education in the western part of the state. 

All visitors to the Junior Normal uniformly remarked the 
earnestness, enthusiasm and diligence of the young people in 
attendance, and the fact that the average daily attendance of 
the second year exceeded that of the first year is ev idence of the 
Normal's efficiency and popularity. 

PRIN. A. A. REED, Holdrege : 

The Junior Normal School idea is one of the most valuable 
educational features of our state. It has brought within reach 
of hundreds of teachers a training that would otherwise have 
been impossible, and has carried the benefits to thousands of 
children in Western Nebraska. It has done more than any 
other one thing to emphasize in the minds of teachers and patrons 
the importance of trained teachers. It has hastened the coming 
of the day when no one will be allowed to experiment upon the </seg>

            <seg id="p465">
343 


children of our state who has not had a reasonable amount of 
professional training. 

Ijome measure of the value of a plan can be made by the 
te of those who have tried it, as they have counted its worth 
them. Nearly half those attending at Holdrege this year were 
attendance last year. Those who were present longest were 
¦ most enthusiastic friends of the Junior Normal idea. 

I^n impressive feature of the school was the class of students 
ending. Especially was this true the second year. Practically 
were actual teachers, either those of experience, who were 
:ious to improve themselves in their work, or those intending 
teach the coming year. The success of a summer school is 
quently hindered by the presence of young people trying to 
ke up deficiencies in academic work, and so having no prosional 
spirit. This class was conspicuously absent. On the 
ler hand, there was an intensity of purpose and a professional 
erest that impressed the faculty and the visitors alike. 

1"he first year there was some interruption of the movement 
the work by the presence of those who did not understand 
plan of the school, and who came for a short period only, 
the second year the county superintendents and the teachers 
I come to realize that this was not profitable, and very few 
:red who did not expect to remain a reasonable time. The 
3;e number remaining long enough to receive the Normal 
100I certificate was evidence of a better understanding of the 
¦poses. The following resolution adopted unanimously by 
students of the Holdrege Junior State Normal School, ex:sses 
the attitude of the entire student body : 

"Realizing the great benefit that has come to the schools of 
Western Nebraska from the Junior Normal movement, we extend 
to the legislature of our state our heartiest approval of their 
action in establishing the same, and we ask that the plan be 
continued."

f expectations of its friends : this year it was superb, for it had 
enemies. The attendance was larger, the enthusiasm finer, 
and the appreciation of the purpose of the school was more pronounced. 
The rural, village and city school teachers of this part 
of the state realize the vital help such an institution is in their 
midst, and they applaud the wisdom and foresight of its founders 
and plead for its maintenance. 

I trust that the mebers of the approaching twenty-ninth session 
of the state legislature, influenced by the good reports from 
the Junior Normal Schools and by the helpfulness this appropriation 
of $12,000 has been to the educational interests of the 
state, will continue the plan and increase the amount of money 
to be made available for Junior Normal School purposes. 

f\ glance at the table of attendance shows such great irreguity 
that a wish is suggested that attendance by certain grades 
teachers may be made compulsory for a stated period as a condition 
for certification. Then this attendance at the Junior Normal 
School, together with the practice and experience gained in 
their own "schools, should cou- as credit at the State Normal 
School, with the end in view ol « tting a higher grade certificate. 

One of the most delightful features of the summer session 
was the entertainment course, every number being of unusual 
worth to hear. And not least in pleasing qualities was the presentation 
of the operatic cantata, ''Queen Esther," in full costume, 
by the members of the music class, assisted by outside 
soloists, under the skillful direction of Mr. C. H. Miller. It is 
rare that the people of any community have opportunity to attend 
such an artistic performance. 

Pe McCook Junior Normal School was peculiarly fortunate 
year in the personnel of its faculty. All were men and 
women conscientious in the discharge of duty, loyal in work, 
and congenial in association. 

The closing session on Friday afternoon, August 19, was made 
Enorable by the presence of yourself, your able deputy, Mr.

IK McCook as the place to speak your farewell to the. Junior 
mal School Teachers of Nebraska ; and it was fit that 
aid, for, in common with the nine thousand public school 
hers in the state, we of the southwest portion place high value 
n your services in the cause of education. I trust that the 
ior Normal Schools will endure as a monument of your - 
and foresight and as a reminder of the very best admim 
of the department of public instruction we have erei 

In closing this report I wish to express my grateful appr. 
tion to the members of the local committee, Miss Rache Berry, 
Mr. J. H. Bennett, Mr. S. B. McLean and Mr. A. Barnett for their 
willing helpfulness to assist in the entertainment of the teachers. 

PRIN. W. H. GARDNER, North Platte : 

The Junior Normal School work of the second year gives good 
evidence of the wisdom of the establishment of this school. The 
increase in earnestness of the teachers in their work and the 
growth of the professional spirit as well as a considerable advance 
in the scholarship are all evidences of the success of the 
Junior Normal idea. 

These schools have given nearly one thousand teacher 
Nebraska some help and some inspiration that they would not 
have been able to receive were it not for the establishment of 
the Junior Normal. 

I If the members of the legislature are guided in miking approiations 
for the coming two years by thi benefit the statt 
:eive by having better schools through teachers with better 
lining, a liberal appropriation will be m ide for not onh 
ming the Junior Normals but for increasing the number and 
ding to their efficiency. 

PRIN. R. H. WATSON, Valentine: 

To my mind the Junior Normal is the most potent factor ever 
introduced into the educational problem in Nebraska. I cannot 
conceive of any other plan by which the country schools of the 
rn part of the state could have been benefiited so much with 
the expenditure of an equal amount of money. </seg>

STATS SUPERINTENDENT'S EEPOET 

The Junior Normal stands alone. What it may evolve into 
in the future we can not tell ; but at present there is nothing to 
take its place. It should be continued for at least two more 
years. In my twenty-eight years of school work, I have never 
seen such a change of sentiment with reference to educational 
matters in the same length of time as there has been in Western 
Nebraska during the past year. Young teachers come to the 
Normal for a few weeks review with no thought of anything 
further and go away with a determination to enter college at 
the very first opportunity. Hence not only the schools of Western 
Nebraska will be improved, but, if the Junior Normal is continued, 
within a few years the State Normals and the private 
colleges of Eeastern Nebraska will be filled to overflowing. 

We have fine young persons in our High School now who 
came to Valentine last summer to review. They will spend 
from two to three years in school before teaching again. They 
are from fifteen to seventy-five miles out in the country. They 
never would have gotten the inspiration but for the Junior Normal. 
Many others are planning to go to school next year. 

8UPT. LEORA RUSTIN, Box Butte County: 

The western teacher who for years has been loboring against 
the adverse circumstances arising from incompetency, realizing 
that success will not come to one content to remain at a stand 
still, yet unable owing to the low wages and great distance from 
good schools to seek self-improvement, welcomed the long desired 
opportunity when it came in the way of Junior Normal 
Schools for Nebraska. 

This opportunity was eagerly embraced by the teachers of 
Box Butte county, who were faithful in attendance, and as a 
result the outlook for the school year was never more promising. 
The teachers have a better knowledge of the subjects to be 
taught, making their instruction no longer timid but strong and 
convincing. Through their work in the training school they have 
learned what to teach and the best method of teaching. They 
have gone to their school hopeful, with a definite purpose in

and have made a general increase in salaries. The establishment 
of the Junior Normals was one of the best investments ever made 
by the state, and if continued will bring forth great and lasting 
good to the teachers and school children of Western Xebr 

SUPT. JOHN BORKY, Sioux Countv 

The value of the Junior Normal Schools cannot be over 
mated. Many young teachers whose talents are bright but have 
not the means or opportunity to attend some Normal wcr 
hidden in the background, for the want of Normal training to 
make them masters of their chosen profession. These Junior 
Normal Schools supply this want. They give the teachers, who 
bear the hardships of the west, an opportunity to improve the 
schools in which thev teach. 

Their appreciation of these Junior Normal Schools is ah 
by their attendance and the self-sacrifice they made in attending. 
I hope to see the legislature make the Junior Normal Schools a 
permanent feature of the west, for the good of our beloved state. 

SUPT. FRANCES E. KNOX, Cheyenne County : 

Twenty-four of Cheyenne county's teachers attendtd Junior 
Normal, either at Alliance or North Platte. Twenty -three of 
these returned with an awakened interest in child training. They 
also gave more lucid and rational papers on the various branches 
upon which they wrote. One, who had always seemed sordid 
and selfish, pleased me by her broadened view of her calling. 
One who had failed completely last spring in three of her required 
studies modestly but triumphantly gave excellent papers 
upon them when she made the second trial. Three young girls 
from a rural eighth grade, misled by their high markings, ambitious 
to teach and encouraged by their teachers to do so, returned 
humbler and wiser, assured that there is much left to 
learn before they can instruct other children. In twenty-three 
cases improvement was marked in every way and I cannot but 
feel that twenty-four of our teachers are broader, better and more 
capable because of these inexpensive schools. Seven of our teachers 
went farther away to longer established schools, and probably </seg>

that would have been the limit of the number who would have 
had the opportunity of summer training had it not been for the 
Junior Normal at our own door. As an educator I hope for the 
permanent establishment of these schools. 

SUPT. B. K. BUSHEE, Kimball County: 

Kimball county did not take advantage of the Junior Normal 
at Alliance this year to any great extent owing to the peculiar 
conditions that exist here. Our teachers are nearly all nonresidents 
and we have to import a new supply every fall. Consequently 
we have no teachers to send to the Normal. My 
opinion is that they are all right and should be continued. The 
few teachers from Kimball county that have attended at Alliance 
the past two years are loud in their praise of the school. 

SUPT. 1EXNIE E. CARTON, Hooker Countv : 

I consider the Junior Normal Schools a grand opportunity 
for teachers to secure a better education at a small cost and 
nearer their own homes. I know the Junior Normal has helped 
me in securing more efficient teachers for the schools of Hooker 
county. The only disadvantage I see is in giving teachers their 
preference in attending or not. There should be a law compelling 
every teacher to be in attendance the entire term. 

SUPT. E. E. LARSON, Phleps County: 

Relative to the Junior Normal I desire to say it was an unquestioned 
success in every respect. Although our enrollment 
was not quite as large as last year we had more students who 
attended the required time of eight weeks or more to secure them 
their normal certificates. This proves that our teachers are look 
ing forward to a full course at one of the State Normals, hence 
are desirous of obtaining the credits received by staying the full 
term. 

The Junior Normal is now looked upon as a permanent factor 
in our educational system. The teachers have learned that a 
definite amount of work can be done at the Normal if the full 
term is used. The inexperienced teacher can here secure the professional 
training and academic instruction she otherwise would </seg>

sible for every teacher to attend. 

Being established by the state and partly supported by it. 
they will always excel the Normals established by one or more 
counties as more funds are available, making it possible If 
cure the very best instructors, first class talent for the lecture 
course and suitable material for a model school and a course 
in music. 

Realizing this and noticing the general improvement in the 
instruction and government of the schools throughout the county, 
a result of the work done at the Normal, I am convinced the ! 
lature, at its next session, can not do otherwise than re-establish 
the Junior Normal. The teachers expect it and the public in 
general demand it. • 

SUPT. ED M. SHORT, Franklin County 

I do not see how the same amount of money could be 8| 
in any other way with so great advantage to the teachers and 
hence to the pupils of the western part of the state. I am stn 
in favor of the continuance of the Junior Normals. 

SUPT. P. P. BENTLEY, Harlan County: 

The Junior Normal stands in high favor in Harlan con 
Many of our school officers would not contract unless the U 
held a Junior Normal certificate. Tn the matter of expense alone 
we favor the Normal. During the years lSWi, 1900 and 1901, we 
paid for county institute expenses, two weeks each. 
The next three years the expenses for Junior Normal, ten « 
each, was $600.00. 

The systematic course laid out for ten weeks, the able C 
of instructors, the lecture course, taking up a line of work 
completing , — all of which the Junior Normal gives us. car.

especially those whose scolarship was already good so that they 
were able to spend their time in learning how to teach. Some. 
of course, were there to eke out their limited knowledge of the 
common branches to the passing point for a third grade certificate. 
To measure the Junior Normals by the work such persons 
will be able to do would be very unfair ;' but even these have 
higher ideals, and will teach and govern their schools more sucully 
for having attended good schools and associated with 
good teachers for a few weeks. 

I "he attendance from this county at Peru and the other Normals

Sl'PT. FLORA B. QUICK, Red Willow Countv 

My present opinion of the value and usefulness of the Junior 
Normal Schools is best expressed in an earnest wish for their 
permanent establishment. I believe that these schools during 
the summer months are just what we need at the present time, 
since the great majority of our teachers must teach during the 
school year and cannot afford to spend more than the summer 
months in preparation for their work. 

I Over seventy five per cent of tbe teacht ra in our schools 
is year attended the McCook Junior Normal at least three 
?eks. others attended four, five or six weeks, while a goodly 
imber were in attendance during the entire term. They go into 
eir schools with higher ideals of the work to be accomplished 
d with a broader view of life in every way. 

I While the Junior Normal Schools afford most excellent oprtunities 
for academic training, they are also^ the means of 
inging within the possible reach of the teachers some of the 
st things in lectures, reading and music. Then again there </seg>

            <seg id="p475">

is inspiration to be gained from contact with others engaged 
in the same work, and from seeing and listening to the leading 
educators of our own and other states. And all these things 
should be taken into consideration in estimating the value and 
usefulness of the Junior Normal Schools. 

SUPT. C. ESTELLA GOODWIN, Dundy County : 

In Dundy county as well as in the neighboring counties within 
reach of the Junior Normal Schools, the majority of the teachers 
are young and inexperienced, unable financially to take the 
time for a regular professional course. They are just getting 
widely awakened to the benefits of the Junior Normals, and, ambitious 
to better their conditions, and are desirous of seeing the 
schools continued. Ten weeks' professional training for our 
teachers who are compelled by necessity to teach the remaining 
part of the year, is a benefit we should not let slip away from us. 
The association which these schools afford, that of teachers 
from other counties, the instructors and others prominent in 
educational circles, is an advantage our teachers do not other 
get. The entertainment course provided during the 
are an education in themselves. 

KThe teachers who attended from this county during the 
ssion of the Junior Normal are enthusiastic and are planning 
to attend next year provided we have the Junior Normals again. 
The sentiment from this county is, — long continue the Junior 
State Normals ! 

SUPT. O. \V. NEALE, Lincoln County: 

The great need of the teachers of Western Nebraska is to raise 
their scholarship for more efficient work. It has been clearl 
monstrated that the Junior Normal Schools have been a g 
factor in raising the standing of our teachers, both intellectually 
and pedagogically. Of the 125 village and country teachi • 
this county in the years 1902 and 1903 but IT had any normal 
training whatever. 

The attendance at the North Platte Junior Normal 1 
from this county was 147, of this number 87 taught in the village </seg>

and country schools of this county. The attendance this year 
from this county was Ki2 ; of this number 114 go out into our village 
and country schools. Thus you see a great per cent of our 
teachers have some normal training that they otherwise would 
not have received, and to the 48 prospective teachers, this school 
will be of inestimable value. I would like to emphasize the value 
of the model school work of these schools. In this work our 
teachers were directed to a new text book, — the child. The 
result has been the raising of the standard of the profession 
with a general raise in wages. I certainly hope these schools 
will be made permanent institutions. 

SUPT LOIELLA M. BERNHARD, Deuel County: 

I visited the Junior Normal School at North Watte twice 
during its 1P&lt;&gt;4 session and found the instructors doing excellent 
work with an interested and enthusiastic lot of students. The 
model school work given was very helpful and as each year a 
large per cent of our teachers are inexperienced, this feature of 
the Junior Normal is a very important one : the inexperienced 
learn to teach, the experienced learn better methods and gather 
many valuable suggestions. 

It is to be hoped that these Junior Normals will become pernent. 
They make attendance at a summer school possible to 
arge number who are unable to go to any of the numerous 
rmals or good schools farther east. In Western Nebraska a 
Eje majority of our teachers must teach in rural schools ; sales 
are small, terms are short, and with board to pay and other 
essary expenses to meet, a teacher has left only a small 
ount to expend in attending a summer school. These Junior 
rnial Schools benefit not only a large number of teachers, but 
ough them better methods, higher motives and a broader 
ication reach the many hundred children whose only education 
• life is received in our rural schools. 

The Junior Normal School is all right. The greatest need of 
the average teacher is a general review of the elementary prin-

ciples in common branches and the best method of imparting the 
same to pupils. This the Junior Normal gives. Some of our 
teachers teaching on third grade certificates last year attended 
the North Platte Junior Normal this summer and all hold good, 
high second grade certificates for this year. Graduates of the 
higher granches become rusty in the branches they are compelled 
to teach. With these reviews and the efficient help given I consider 
a ten weeks' normal course, conducted as they are at present, 
of more practical benefit in teaching than a year at high 

I find Normal sudents very thorough. 

SUPT. ETTA BROWN, Cherry countv 

We are now beginning to see the results of our Junior Normals. 
Several in attendance now realize the necessity for a better 
education and instead of teaching will enter the high school. 
One father called on me today and said. "I realize that my ffirls 
have not the education they need and I pledge you that I will 
never ask you or any other superintendent to issue them a certificate 
until they attend school. The older one saved some 
money last year and will save more this year. She will be able 
to pay her way and I will assist the younger." 

Et the opening of the Normal I anticipated trouble on account 
he number of unqualified girls who expressed their intenof 
teaching. I felt their disappointment and that of their 
parents at their failure after the summer's expense. One by one 
these gave up the idea of trying this year, but all remained in 
till the close and I have heard no one express regret for having 
attended. I talked to them at the beginning and told them that 
attendance did not insure them a certificate, — it was what they 
were able to accomplish. 

From a Member of the Legislature, Twenty-Eighth Session : 

Last August it was my fortune to accompany our deputy state 
superintendent of public instruction, Mr. McBrien, upon a tour 
of Nebraska, visiting in turn each of the so-called Junior Normals 
and observing so far as I had opportunity the conditions of </seg>

I 

the schools, the nature and efficiency of the work done by their 
instructors, and the practical benefits possible to the teachers 
enrolled as pupils of these institutions. Incidentally I endeavored 
to glean all the accurate information I could as to the sentiment 
of the people of the west regarding these schools, their 
usefulness, and the presumed necessity for their further existence. 

A generation ago I was a teacher in the public schools of 
Otoe county and continued in the service some fifteen years. 
Subsequently as a member of the school board and a patron of 
the schools I kept in touch with our educational interests. When 
in the last legislature I served as secretary of the Public School 
Committee, and Superintendents Fowler and McBrien in their 
personal missionary work amongst the House members earnestly 
and persistently pressed upon our attention the urgent need of 
the west for some aid to the professional trianing of its teaching 
force, I could not but be interested in their unvarnished statement 
of conditions and their demand for legislative relief. My experience 
as a teacher of "ye olden tyme" rendered their arguments 
nuanswerable, and I became one of the active advouates of the 
"extravagant" appropriation of $12,000 for the establishment, 
equipment and running expenses of these temporary temples of 
learning in the farther west. Nor do I think, with the results 
of my observation and inquiry fresh upon me, either my county 
or the state will hold the legislature guilty of excessive liberality 
in this regard and require excuse or apology therefor. 

The trip was indeed a week of the "strenuous life" and a revelation 
of the past progress of Nebraska, its present prosperity, 
and possibilities for the future along educational as well as material 
lines, astonishing even to one who had witnessed the redemption 
of the state from its supposed condition of wilderness, 
and who had some small part in the reclaimation of its river 
counties from native sterility to active fertility. 

We visited in turn Valentine, Alliance, North Platte, Holdrege 
and McCook, inspected the Junior Normal School at each of 
places, and found them all in active operation, making the </seg>

ich had been accomplished in the elevat 

ideals, the creation of interest in the work, and an appreci 

of the responsibilities of true teaching as well as of the pri- 

nt 

ire of normal professional training for tho&gt; 

who desired to become teachers worthy of the name. 

In reviewing the observations and experiences of the 

I am led to believe that, under existing conditions, the Ju 

Normals are peculiarly well adapted to the educational i 

)f those sections of the great west in which these schools are 
established, and that the necessity and demand for them will 

jntinue to exist for at least some years to come. A country 
hich by reason of its nature is pre-eminently adapted to grazing 

principal industry, of vast distances, with few rail; 

and towns at long intervals, its ranges sparsely settled and with 

lonely and isolated country school houses, must depend la 

n&gt; its own people, the product of its own schools, to supph 

own teache 

The number of qualified and professionally trained tear' 
yearly graduated from the State University, the Normal Sdi 
and our larger High Schools is sadly insufficient to fill even the 
more attractive positions of the better settled eastern and central 
counties of the state. Some time must yet elapse before tin 
school at Kearney will begin to furnish its quota of pro 
educated and accredited teachers, and, even then, the demand will 
be largely in excess of the supply. Amongst the enrolled 

dents at the Junior Normals were a number of ladies to whom 
these institutions afford the only available opportunities 
coming in personal contact with advanced ideas and modern 
methods of practical education. Some of them had possibly 
served as teachers for years and, while appreciating the </seg>

            <seg id="p482">

ages and indeed necessities of normal training, while actively 
engaged they were unable to take such training. But the Junior 
Normals, within a reasonable distance of their school houses, 
with their minimum of expense and maximum of much needed 
instruction, in session too at the vacation period, and each with 
its faculty of enthusiastic experts, were to them almost a gift 
of the gods. 

I found in the west a well developed interest in school matters 
and a belief in the highest possible standard of education for its 
average citizenship in the country as well as in the town, and 
to this end all classes and conditions of men seemed to agree 
that the work of the Junior Normals had warmed their interest 
into positive enthusiasm, aroused professional pride and ambition 
in many of the teachers, and brought large returns to them, 
their schools, and the state, for the amount of capital exeprimentally 
invested. Messrs. Fowler and McBrien, with the ladies 
and gentlemen associated with them as co-workers, are to be 
congratulated on the deserved success achieved by them unitedly. 
The west has set its seal of approval upon these schools and 
their work, and the universal desire prevailed that they should 
be continued so long as present necessity exists. "Long live the 
Junior Normals" wrote Principal Crabtree in his circular letter 
to these institutions just before they closed, and his sentiment 
certainly finds a hearty response from those who understand the 
educational difficulties and disadvantages of the common schools 
of the west and are interested in their progress and success.

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS 

Antelope County 

Every country school in Antelope county is graded as closely 
as possible, according to suggestions in the State Course of 
Study. The State Course has been officially adopted by the 
districts, and as a further aid to systematic work, a uniform list 
of text books is used throughout the county. During the past 
two years the superintendent has prepared test questions on all 
subjects for all grades below the Ninth. These questions are 
issued monthly. Certificate of Perfect Attendance are used as 
a stimulus to prompt and regular attendance. Report Cards for 
all students are furnished from the office. The reports fully 
advise every parent of the progress, attendance, punctuality and 
deportment of each pupil at the close of the month. The Eighth 
grade examination in every district (town and country) for admission 
to the High school, is conducted by the superintendent. 

Graduating exercises for all Eighth graders who passed the 
examination satisfactorily were held at Neligh during the In- 

stitute. Deputy Superintendent J. L. McBrien delivered an excellent 
address before the class and members of the Institute.

Banner County 

Although the county is thinly settled, the school attendance 
is good, the average number of months of school is increasing, 
and the schools of Banner county are making rapid progress. 
District indebtedness is steadily decreasing, hence teachers' 
salaries are increasing. 

Ehe patrons of our schools are exacting in their demands 
the best possible work on the part of the teachers. They 
/ide quite liberally all necessary apparatus for carrying ford 
the work of the schools. 

Ehe teachers are alive to everything that tends to better them 
es for the work of their profession. They are studying am 
king, not merely reading. 

In our annual Teachers' Institute, men and women of much 
training and experience have been employed as instructors. The 
work of the Institute consisted largely in discussing the principles 
upon which all good teaching rests. The result was quite satisfactory, 
the teachers expressing themselves as being well pleaded 
with the new plan. 

The State Course of Study is quite closely followed in most 
of our schools. 

We have no State Reading Circle organization, but will endeavor 
to do some work along that line. 

I The teachers all take at least one educational paper and some 
Ice more than one. 

While much remains to be done, yet we think much '.'•as already 
been accomplished, and our prospects in school work are bright.

COUNTY AND OITT SCHOOLS 

Boone County 

We are beginning the year 1904-1905 with much to encourage 
¦us. Our schools are all supplied with teachers ; our patrons are 
prosperous ; most of our property is in good repair ; more money 
will be expended this year for public education than ever before : 
harmony largely prevails among the people and we look for improvements 
along several lines. 

The Summer School that has been held at Albion for the past 
fifteen years was abandoned this year for the first time. This 
step was taken with the belief that our teachers could find better 
facilities for improvement in the established schools, with but 
little extra expense, than in a temporary summer school with 
limited means and over-worked instructors. The result of the 
change was very satisfactory ; fully twenty per cent of our teachers 
attended established summer schools, and several are now 
planning to take courses in some of our best schools. 

The professional spirit of our teachers is good. One hundred 
¦out of one hundred and six are enrolled in the Reading Circle, 
which is divided into four sections that meet monthly in the 
towns of Cedar Rapids, St. Edward, Petersburg and Albion. 
The meetings held thus far have been well attended. 

Two general teache'rs' meetings for the county have been planned 
to meet this year at Albion. These meetings have been held 
with growing interest and success for the past several years. 
This year we will make these general meetings a continuation 
of the Reading Circle work by using certain topics as subjects 
for special preparation. 

All of our third grade teachers are working to secure second 
grade certificates and quite a number of those holding second 
grades are preparing for first. We have a few, however, who have 
held second grades for ten years, that are contented to remain 
where they are with no apparent effort to improve. 

There has never been any concerted movement toward placing 
libraries in our rural schools. In several districts, however, the 
teachers by various plans divised by themselves have secured </seg>

I'aries. We believe there will be no general movement looking 
the placing of libraries in our schools until we are aided by 
islative enactment. 

!U' have in our coutry districts boys and girls that have 
shed the common school course, who are unable at present 
extend their education in schools away from home. We 
e a movement started to organize agricultural classes, debatsocieties 
and like organizations in several localities by the 
an of two or more districts. Such a movement we hope will 
i to elevate and inform the boys and girls in the districts 
:cted as well as bring about closer relations between the 
ies and the school. 

Viewed from our ideals we have much to discourage us in 
Boone county ; but in the light of experience, with past progress 
and present conditions in view, we have much that lends encouragement.

{rhere has been marked progress in educational matters in this

ing the Junior Normal at Alliance. The school boards are willing 
to give the Normal teachers the highest wages the district 
can afford. 

The quarterly examinations, the Eighth Grade examina' 
and the Normal training for the teachers have made great improvement 
in our schools, increased the interest of the school 
patrons, and opened to us a brighter future in educational work. 

MRS. LKORA RUSTIN. 

Boyd County 

The condition of school matters in all details in Boyd county 
may be spoken of as being progressive. The land comprising 
the district territory is now nearly all taxable. This strengthens 
conditions very much financially, by making it possible to hold 
more months of school and to pay better wages to teachers. 
The county is organized into four sections for the convenience 
of teachers and school officers in attending meetings. Five 
teachers' meetings and two school board meetings are held in 
each section during the year. At these meetings the discuof 
law points, the use of our uniform course of study which 
use in all our schools, improved methods of teaching, and all 
matters which tend to advance our schools to the very front are 
taken up and handled vigorously. 

Through the columns of "The Boyd County Schools" much is 
said and done to enthuse, encourage and stengthen our teachers, 
and to awaken our school boards to action in their part of the 
work. We have a system of monthly reports which just fitnew 
county course of study and furnishes such general information 
as is needed. 

A movement to establish school libraries and maintain them 
is on foot. Our teachers are uniformly reading and studying 
Sabin's Common Sense Didactics and reciting and discuthe 
same at our teachers' meetings. Soon this work will be 
completed and we will then take up Geographic Influences in 
American History. A strong co-operative spirit prevails among 
the teachers, and a disposition to press forward and upward </seg>

is clearly apparent on all sides. Boyd has become famous as an

C. A. MANVILLE. 

Buffalo County 

There is a steady improvement in the general condition of 
educational affairs in Buffalo countv. 

It seems to me that there is a marked improvement in the efficiency 
of the teachers. They are eager to avail themselves of 
every opportunity to increase that efficiency, the Association 
Meetings and Institute are more largely attended. Nearly ever] 
one is a subscriber to an educational journal. The classification 
registers show care and study in the grading of the pupils. The 
work outlined by the Nebraska Reading Circle is more closely 
and thoroughly studied, although the number of books sold 
does not equal the number of "Principles of Agriculture" disposed 
of. 

This office supplies report cards, so that the parents may be 
advised of the proficiency and advancement of their children. 
Cie use of the perfect attendance certificates, also furnished by 
is office, has been surprisingly helpful in securing better and 
more regular attendance. While many of the teachers have 
»:n unable to follow the State Course of Study very closely, 
las proved to be of great assistance in systematizing the work, 
the schools. We confidently expect that the number of pupils 
who will secure diplomas for completing the Eighth Grade will 
be largely increased this year. 

The superintendents and principals of the city and town 
graded schools, and there are none better, and their assistants 
work in harmony with the county superintendent and the rural 
teachers. 

The school rooms are better supplied with apparatus than ever 
before. The members of the school boards listen to suggestions 
for the betterment of their schools. The buildings are in more 
perfect repair. The grounds receive more attention. Text books </seg>

ctive schools there was a lack of systematic endeavor in 
the county. No two teachers were working along: the same lino. 
Continuity of the school work was broken and often teachers 
simply filled positions for a term or a year, having no definiteaim 
in view, and pupils were in the habit of goitng to school 
not knowing that something was to be done and "that something" 
in a given time. 

Eo say the least this condition of affairs was discouraging 
it has been my purpose to work out a general system for 
schools of our county that we might better concentrate our 
es and get more lasting and satisfactory results. 

I An inspection of the school conditions of the county revealed 
e fact that one of the first steps in this direction must be 
liformity of text books. With the assistance of teachers, board 
embers and patrons who were interested in the welfare of our 
hools this change was effected. Since the adoption the unirni 
list has been introduced into the schools very rapidly and 
e plan is meeting with approval everywhere. The advantages 
this movement cannot be seen in a day. One of the first steps 
grow from it was the publishing of a county course of study 
tended to point out briefly the work for each year and to supple:nt 
the state cour 

Xo one thing accomplished in the last two years has brought 
more good to the rural schools than the adoption of the county 
course. With the uniform list its use is possible. Teachers' 
ideas on gradation have been unified and our pupils are uniformly 
graded and advanced from year to year as perfect as rural conditions 
will permit. 

During the last summer a supplementary course in reading 
and numbers was published for the teachers of Burt and Cum ing 
counties. This course gives briefly a basis for the work in 
these subjects for the primary and first year and its use during 
the last few months has proven highly satisfactory. 

Questions for review based on the Burt County Course are sent 
to the teachers quarterly. They are of a suggestive nature and </seg>

            <seg id="p493">
367 


are intended to cover the work as definitely outlined by the 
county course. 

This year I have planned a blank for quarterly reports from 
the rural schools. These, if properly made, will keep the office 
in close touch with the schools. Nearly all of these have been 
made for the first quarter of the present year. 

The introduction of system into our work has enabled me to 
be of greater assistance to the teacher and the school.- It is not 
our intention to curtail the effectiveness of the teacher or to 
destroy her originality. I believe in the utmost freedom and the 
teacher may follow our plans with her own methods and devices 
untouched. 

Material has been secured for the schools that would a 
the teacher, making her efforts easier and more resultful. Wt 
have placed in the schools the State Course of Study, Illinois 
Course. County Course, Course in Reading and Numbers, Model 
Daily Program, Blank for Daily Program, Button System, Manuals 
for the various subjects, Class Record Books. Report i 
and other forms furnished by the state. 

It is not always possible to visit the schools just when the 
teacher may need help and for this reason I have sent forms 
to teachers on which to indicate the subjects and the part in the 
same in which they have trouble and wish help. Many teachers 
take advantage of this and I think the plan will work well. 

Our teaching force is strong. They are well equipped educationally. 
All have the equivalent of High School education 
and a great majority have had College or Normal training. Our 
city superintendents are thoroughly prepared for their respective 
positions and the schools under ilieir management have 
gressed. 

Pupils form the rural schools feel that they have as much 
opportunity in the country districts as those in town. They 
understand that they may advance regularly in the rural s 
and that they should have as an object the completion &lt;• 
course as prescribed for this district. Eighth Grade examinations 
have been given and many pupils from both cou </seg>

town have profited by these tests. The examinations have been 
rigid and weak students have returned to complete their work 
in the proper way. As a result of these tests many pupils are 
now in our High Schools who, otherwise, might never have completed 
the country course. 

The County Teachers' Association hold three general meetings 
yearly. Prominent educators from all parts of the state 
have been present at these sessions and our teachers show the 
result of this contact with the leaders of the profession. The 
Reading Circles meet in the five towns of the county five times 
during the year. I am confident that we have the work in better 
form this year than ever before. The Reading Circle Booklet 
gives dates of meetings, programs and other information relative 
to the work. For a small fee teachers have an opportunity to 
read five books and they retain one copy at the close of the year. 

The school boards of the county were permanently organized 
two years ago and have held an annual meeting each year. This 
year we will hold two meetings, one on each side of the county, 
that members may attend more conveniently, thus enabling us 
to come in contact with a greater number of patrons and school 
officers. These meetings have been very well attended and are 
the means of great good to the schools. People before listless 
to the best interests of their schools are now loyal and active 
supporters of every good educational movement. 

Nothing pleases me more than to note the improvement in 
our buildings and grounds. Many boards have improved things 
with repairs, paint and cleaning. Several new buildings, modernly 
built, well planned, heated and lighted, have been erected. 
Old furnishings have been removed and the newer and better 
have taken their place. Fences have been built and outbuildings 
have been put in good condition. But a few school houses remain 
in a dilapidated state and these will not last long. 

Burt county has not increased the number of school districts 
and nearly all are of very good size and of sufficient valuation 
to run good schools without a burdensome tax. These districts 
are in excellent financial condition, having a balance in the 
treasury and no indebtedness. </seg>

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS 

i'he last Institute was held jointly with Cuming county. Funds 
re consolidated, thus allowing the best instruction, lecture taland 
equipment. Teachers from both counties were more 
n satisfied and have indicated a desire to meet in joint ses-1 
again. This meeting has demonstrated the practicability 
such a plan and is the beginning, I trust, of many more in 
future. 

It has been my wish to bring the office closely in touch 
with the schools. For it is by this means that good is to come to 
both. One of the most discouraging things to the average county 
superintendent is a lack of time to do what "his hands find to do." 
Work as persistently as he will and the longer he remains the 
greater his responsibility and duties become. A competent 
deputy should assist him. Office work could then be carried on 
in a business-like way and one would feel some pride and satisfaction 
in the expedient discharge of his duties. If the people 
of the rural districts knew what this would do for the country 
schools they would rise up and demand it and I trust that they 
will grant this needed assistance in the near future. We should 
have more simple and accurate records of the work accomplished 
in the rural schools. — records that will assist a new teacher in 
the accurate gradation of a school without the usual term of 
"experimenting." The outlook for Burt county in affairs educaitonal 
is bright. Patrons and teachers want only the best und 
are willing to sacrifice time and money to get it. With this prevailing 
spirit it is a pleasure to labor for her people and her 
schools.

Cedar County 

peak the sentiments of all the people interested in education 
in Cedar county when I say that our schools are doing stronger 
work today than ever before. This is evidenced by the greater 
care and diligence exercised by the school boards in selecting 


teachers whose success is no longer a mere matter of experiment 
but an established fact; by the increasing wage paid to rural 
teachers (it being an average of $42.50 for the school year ending 
last July and approximately $45.00 per month for the present 
school year) ; and by the fact that practically all the schools of 
"the county have employed their teachers "for the entire school 
year. 

Systematic effort is being made in every school to follow the 
State Course of Study. Teachers have been provided with copies 
of the course and have been urgently requested to carry out its 
suggestions in the classification and work of the schools. I may 
say that all our teachers have arranged their daily programs on 
the three or four group plan, showing both recitation and study 
periods together with the time therefor, and have the same written 
in large script and hung in conspicuous places before their 
schools. 

Interesting and enthusiastic teachers' meetings have been the

Chase County 

The educational spirit of the Chase county schools is good, 
as may be seen by the interest taken in the Teachers' Institutes 
and the work accomplished in the school room. 

Nearly every teacher in the rural schools of the county is folving 
the Nebraske Course of Study intelligently in classifying 
and grading her school. 

Many of the schools have small libraries and others are making 
an effort in the same direction. The patrons as well as students 
are filled with inspiration in this work. 

Teachers' wages have risen perceptibly this school year and we 
are in hopes that as the standard of qualification rises each teacher 
may receive the compensation which she deservedly earn&gt; 
number of the teachers are taking the Reading Circle work this 
year and feel they are being repaid for their efforts. A number 
of the districts have contracted with neighboring districts for instruction 
of their pupils, as it is found to be a much cheaper wav 
to furnish instruction where the number of pupils is small. 

The people, generally speaking, are much interested in having 
good schools, and we think we are justified in saying that our 
progress, while not all we have desired, is a source of incouragement 
to all who are interested in the cause of education.

In January, 1902, I found that almost all the teachers in charge

ot a school depends mostly upon the teacher, and, hence the adficement 
of popular education in a county upon all the teachtherein, 
I have tried not only to maintain but also, if possible, 
raise the standard of the teaching force. It is a pleasure to 
state that more than eighty-five per cent of our rural teachers, 
during the past three years, are high school graduates, and that 
many of them have made further preparation by attending school 
at Wayne, Fremont, Bellevue, Grand Island, Lincoln and Peru ; 
that all those who did not graduate did attend a normal school. </seg>

during the same period, employed nine graduates of the University 
of Nebraska, while the rest of the city teachers held state certificates 
or county first grade ones. Teachers are attending normal 
schools more and more. There has been an increase in 
scholarship and professional training for teaching, a closer watch 
in the selection of teachers, which has had something to do 
with the increase in teachers' wa&lt;jes. and this chain of things 
aided greatly in bringing about the desired end, namely, larger 
school benefits to the pupils. 

Other means affecting the teaching force and bearing upon 
the end mentioned were the following: Institutes. Teachers' 
Association, local teachers' meetings for Reading Circle work, 
school visitation, circular letters, use of newspapers and d 
bution to teachers of the Course of Study, Teachers' School ! 
Library Price Lists, etc. 

In the teachers' opinion and mine, the Joint Institute held at 
Oakland for Burt and Cuming counties was more profitable to 
our teachers than were either of the two preceding Institutes held 
for Cuming alone. An Institute in this county is most beneficial 
if professional, not academic. 

Near the close of each school year, the Teachers tion 
meets for a day's program. And for the convenience of the teachers, 
the Association has the county divided into five local sections. 
Each section holds six local meetings from September to 
at intervals of five weeks, for study and recitation upon the 
Reading Circle books recommended by the State Board. The 
county superintendent attends all local meetings, conductwork 
in one of the two books, assisted by the city superintendent 
in the other, and gives out questions on the lession for the 
meeting. A record of attendance and recitation is kept bv the 
superintendent, and credit given when the teacher takes examination. 
A year ago this county held third rank in the state on Reading 
Circle work, and received third prize, a twenty-fire dollar 
teachers' library. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT 8 REPORT 

By recruiting too frequently, the teaching force is kept from 
becoming real strong. 

The school officers manifest their interest in schools. Over 
twenty thousand dollars have been expended during the past 
two years to build additions to the Wisner and the West Point 
school buildings. In a rural district enough work in remodeling 
the school house was done to justify the statement that is it equal 
to a new building. In the Webork district near Pender, they have 
built an addition to the school house, opened a new room, and 
employed two teachers. This is the first rural school in the 
county in charge of a principal and assistant. The school officers 
throughout the county, generally, have done a great deal in repairing 
roofs, floors, walls, in painting and papering, in putting 
up large bells, in furnishing pupils' supplies, and have in a few 
cases burned all their school books and bought new ones in districts 
afflicted with smallpox. The total amount of salaries voted 
and paid annually to the officers of our seventy-four rural districts 
is about fifteen hundred dollars, or, approximately one and onehalf 
times the amount paid for pupils' text books. The reluctance 
to serve on school boards is noticeable in some places, but 
it is not serious. At the hands of school officers there is room for 
improvement in buildings and grounds. 

1^ county convention of rural school officers was called in 
rch. 1903, an organization effected, and at the following meetin 
June this association adopted a constitution and by-laws, 
Nebraska Course of study, rules and regulations, and recomnded 
a list of the best text books with a view to county unimity 
in time. The plan is working well. The officers' assotion 
meets on the first Saturday in June each year, and may and 
;s meet also at other times. The conventions are well attended. 
sea by able men, discussions, exchanges of ideas, resoluns, 
etc., result in added benefits to the schools. This 
tion with its conventions is undoubtedly permanent in this 
unty. It is a new and helpful factor in advancing the schools.

schools was i 1 at two of the officers' conventions, and two </seg>

STATK SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

Custer County 

The general conditions in Custer county are without doubt 
improving in a degree commensurate with the advancement of 
other interests of the county. Among the first improvements 
to be noted is the beneficent effect of the new revenue law on 
district valuations. Under the old system of valuations it waa 
difficult in many instances to levy enough tax to support the 
school in a satisfactory manner. — it was even more difficult to 
float a sufficient bond to build a frame school house. The willingness 
of the people in this respect was not at fault in the least if 
we may judge by the private contributions to school houses and 
the attempts to vote more than the twenty-five mills levy. The 
new revenue law increased the district valuations at least fifty 
per cent in Custer county and in some cases more than this. 
Whatever may be the defects of the new law relative to revenue, 
there was a sore need of it in school districts in this county. In 
order to give the voters at the annual district meetings some basis 
upon which to base their levies for the year, the complete valuation 
of each district was compiled under the direction of this 
office and sent to the directors before the annual meeting. 

I duster county has been favored with successful Teachers' Intutes 
for the past several years. During the last two years we 
ie had a three weeks' session each year under the very best inuctors 
of the state. The session of 1904 we believe was nearly 
! largest county Institute in the state, having a bona fide enlment 
of two hundred and forty. The interest in the extended 
.sions may be seen by the fact that as many as one hundred and 
fhty teachers attended the full three weeks ; more than two 
ndred the two weeks. There are, we believe, not more than 
dozen teachers in the county who did not attend Institute 
mewhere during the year. 

We have adopted and are using the Illinois Course of Study 
in the county this year. Based strictly on the course we send out 
&lt;-ach month written review questions to all schools of the county. </seg>

the large number doing the Reading Circle work. 

A scarcity of teachers this fall made it necessary to issue a 
number of third grade certificates. Salaries average higher than 
formerly, yet we have several districts paying only thirty 
lars per month, and there are three districts where the teachers 
receive only twenty-five dollars. Districts paying less than 
thirty-five dollars per month found it difficult to procure am 
third grade teachers, that is those with third grade certify 

This county has for several years been favored with excellent 
Institutes and the school work has been greatly advanced thereby.

were 117 teachers enrolled and nearly all of those who did not 
attend our Institute had attended summer schools or wen

trict. It is last but not least, for it has built the first mo 
rural school house in the county. This new school houproperly 
lighted and ventilated and is heated with a furnas. 

The schools are fairly well equipped with maps, globes and 
other apparatus, but there remains much room for improvement. 
A few have school libraries. Some of them are well sek 
while others are almost worthless affairs purchased of ag 
at ridiculous prices. 

Our worst handicap is too many small schools, and still t 
is a cry for more new districts. Other districts chop their s 
year into so many terms and change teachers so often that their 
money is almost wasted. A movement is on "foot to consol 
sereval adjoining districts with the Newcastle district. So many 
of the pupils from these districts attend the Newcastle school 
now that the move seems to be a good one. 

We have no school board organization but an attempt will 
be made to organize one this year. On account of this there has 
been no official odoption of the State Course of Study, though 
it is recommended and most of the teachers follow it. 

Eighth grade examinations were given last spring. While we 

had but a short time to start the work, thirty-three passed the 

lation and received diplomas. Several of the schools had 

very good commencement exercises. The majority of these 
graduates are in the High schools this fall. 

For the year ending 1903, our average attendance was 54 per 
cent of the enrollment. Last year it was increased to 57 per cent. 
This year we are using Certificates of Perfect Attendance and 
Reports to Parents and hope for a greater increase. 

)tir teachers will compare favorably with those of other 
r.ties. Only 16 of our 11-t have had no experience, while all 

nit five of the sixteen have had normal school training. The

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

The county is divided into three sections for the Reading 
Circle work. Each section has five meetings in addition to the 
two county meetings, which are held, one in the fall and one in 
the spring. Every teacher in the county is expected to do the 
Reading Circle work and all seem to be making every possible 
effort to meet the requirement. The principals of the town 
schools are rendering valuable assistance in this work. 

Kn general our patrons are appreciative and earnestly desire 
&gt;d schools. Some few still want the cheapest teacher that can 
had, but they are in the minority. My plea is first for good 
chers ; then good pay for the good teachers. 

A. V. TEED. 

Dodge County 

The school work in Dodge county, for the past two years, 
as a whole has been very satisfactory. While there is yet room 
for much improvement, the interest that is being manifested by 
pupils, parents and teachers is very encouraging. When we 
have the proper school spirit aroused the question of attendance 
will be solved. 

Ifhe Compulsory Attendance Law has been a benefit in some 
tances, yet I feel that the good accomplished has not been 
proportion to the work required in trying to enforce it. An 
5rt is being made to have the school officers appoint a truant 
cer. This, I think, will be an effective means of enforcing the 
&gt;visions of this law. A meeting of the school board mem¦s 
has been called, and I hope from a multiplicity of counsel 
:re will come wisdom. We have found the Certificates of Pert 
attendance to be of great value in securing regular attendee. 
These are marks of honor worth striving for and they have 
ne more to make a perfect school record than the truant officers 
ve done. 

It is a source of regret that so many of our experienced teachers 
are leaving the work. Two years ago we hand 11 inexperienced 
teachers, last year 14 and this year 26. There are but

Douglas County 

Since my report to you two years ago, Douglas county has 
made a few improvements in the way of school buildings. Dundee, 
with a school population of 200, has built a new house 
costing nearly $20,000. Benson has made an addition of four 
rooms and is now employing nine teachers. Florence has made 
improvements and added to her corps of teachers. Valley has 
also added to her corps of teachers, thus enabling these schools 
to do better work than in former years. There have been many 
improvements in the country districts : school boards have 
worked to make the school houses more attractive, the school 

grounds cleaner and the outbuildings better and neater 

Libraries have been put in nearly all of our schools by and 
through the efforts of the teachers, parents and children. 

Our teachers, as a whole, are becoming better fitted for their 
work, and all have attended Normal schools. Several of this 
number hold professional certificates, others, two year state 
certificates. 

County uniformity of text books has proven a success and with 
the use of our county course of study, our teachers are better able 
to grade their schools and to do more thorough and systematic 
work. 

Eighth grade examinations are given at the close of each school 
year by the county superintendent. Last year one hundred 
thirty Eighth grade pupils took the examinations and about 
sixty per cent made the passing grade. 

KThe Reading Circle work has been carried on quite systematily 
for several years past, all our teachers doing the work, 
most of them carefully and thoroughly. 

Most of our school boards have employed our county truant 
officer, paying him a salary of $75.00 per month, each district paying 
its proportionate share, based on the number of children in 
the several districts. </seg>

the credit is usually due to our faithful, energetic teachers.

Within the last two years there have been built seven new

three frame and two sod. 

We have never had a better corps of teachers'or entered upon 
the duties of a new school year with brighter prospects for a 
pleasant and profitable year. We had an excellent Institute and 
all teachers showed their appreciation by attending. Our attendance 
was far above the average of previous years and we had 
the largest enrollment the county has ever known. 

A Teachers' Reading Circle was organized October 1, with 
twenty-nine members. We hope to enroll all teachers. 

Teachers' salaries have been increased in the last two years. 
Two years ago only a very few teachers were paid $30.00. At 
present quite a number receive $35.00, some $30.00 and only a 
verv few $25.00. 

The county will furnish Report Cards to the schools this year 
for the first time. We hope to have Eighth grade graduation 
exercises.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

Circle work for the present year. The county is divided into 
five local sections, each of which holds monthly meetings. Reports 
received from the local secretaries for meetings held in 
September, October and November show good attendance and 
much interest in the work. 

h Three-fourths of the districts in the county have school libra:s 
of some kind, some having very good ones. Five districts 
have started good libraries since the. beginning of the present 
term. 

All but two districts furnish text books to pupils. About 
three-fourths of the districts of the county are well supplied with

supplies. 

r r e have a school board organization in the county which 
held one meeting; another meeting will be held next winter. 

I believe that school affairs are in as healthy a condition in 
Cireeley county as in the average county in Nebraska. We have 
our problems here as elsewhere. The greatest of these is the 
securing of more competent teachers. This same problem &lt;. 
in every county with whose conditions I am acquainted. I think 
the legislature should pass some measures along this line next 
winter. A minimum age of eighteen years should be established. 
Teachers should be required to attend a State Normal, or some 
other institution endorsed by the state superintendent for a period 
of at least two years. Graduates from the Eleventh and Twelfth 
grades should be required to attend a Normal School at least one 
before taking up the work of teaching. This would assure 
more mature minds and more competent teachers. It is true 
that it would cost the teachers considerable time and money thus 
to fit themselves, but the patrons of the public schools would 
gladly raise the salaries of the teachers who had thus prepared 
themselves. </seg>

NTT AHD CITT SCHOOLS 

Hall County 

For the year 1903 a shortage of teachers, which was conunon 
in the western states, left Hall county with fourteen short at the 
beginning of the school term, and compelled us to keep several 
schools closed from one to six weeks. In making an effort to 
supply the demands it was impossible to keep the standards as 
high as in the few years previous. This year the supply 
somewhat greater than the demand, and in consequence, the 
standard of scholarship was again raised and eleven more applicants 
for certificates failed this year than last. Few complaints 
of the teacher's work have been registered so far this year, 
and everything points to a splendid year's work. 

Every teacher who is teaching now attended Institute, or a 
summer school, or Junior Normal. The teachers of Hall county 
have fully realized that the eastern counties of the state have 
done much toward raising the efficiency of our Nebraska educational 
system, and are making heroic efforts to keep Hali county 
up toward the top of the list. In proof of this allow me to slate 
that each year a much larger per cent of our teachers are taking 
advantage of summer normals, and many more are also dropping 
out of the work for a year or two to take special training 
their work. We have a better average of attendance at our Institutes, 
and the results in Reading Circle work are much more 
satisfactory each year. 

The general average of the school term has increased some 
year for the last four years, and the salaries paid teachers 
been raised quite a little, and will very likely remain so, for the 
public is justified with the increase. It is not as much, how 
as in some other counties. 

Ehe indebtedness of the school districts is nearly all \v 
a feeling is quite general that the school houses should be in 
better condition, and in many districts the old buildings are being 
replaced by new ones.

rural school, and this inspiration is leading many more to take 
up higher school work. 

Hall county school workers give much of the credit for our 
present progress to our energetic state superintendent, Mr. W. i\. 
Fowler. We wish to give credit to whom credit is due and he 
has left nothing undone that he could do for the advancement of 
education in Nebraska. 

Harlan County 

We report, progress. We have organized seven Reading 
Circles, each under the supervision of a competent manager. 
Meetings are held semi-monthly. We are following the line of 
work laid out by the Nebraska Teachers' Reading Circle. The 
outlook is encouraging. Over 70 per cent of our teachers are 
taking the work. 

District libraries are receiving due attention. Many teacher^ 
have secured funds for a library by giving entertainments. Three 
districts, at the opening of the present term, furnished fund 
a library. 

Eighth grade examinations are meeting with popular favor. 
Last May !&lt;2 pupils took the examination, 42 passed. Appropriate 
graduating exercises were held at the county seat. The 
expenses are paid by the county board out of the gener?! fund. 

School officers are taking a better interest in school work. 
This year gives us longer terms and better wages. More attention 
is being giv«"-r to the care of the school buildings, grounds 
and text books. 

The Junior Normal has proved to be of great practical value 
to our teachers. Only 10 per cent of those who are teaching 
in this county are beginners, and nearly all these had the benefit 
of the Junior Normal. 

Three districts voted no school, and send their pupils to adjoining 
districts. Several othr- districts will probably do the' same 
next year. We have planned for two County Associations during 
the year.

Hooker County 

The schools of Hooker county are progressing rapidly. We 

have a corps of better teachers, and better wages are paid 

throughout the countv. All but one school is in session at this 

time, and the teachers in each of them have had professional 

training to some extent. Some have taken advantage of the 

Junior Normals, while others attended summer Normals in 

Eastern Nebraska 

We are getting ready to begin the State Reading Circle work 

and each teacher seems to be very desirous of following the 

work and of making her school work more effective and bene- 

ficial by this means. 

We have not a single "third grade" teacher in the county, but 

have three teachers with two year state certificates. 

Certificates of Perfect Attendance are being used through- 

out the county and we hope by this method to do away with much 

of the tardiness and absence. Monthly Reports to parents are 

furnished each teacher. These reports fully advise the perent 

of his child's progress and standing at the end of each month. 
We have better school buildings than ever before, better books 

and appliances (in general), and better work is expected by teachers 
than ever before in Hooker countv. 

We have some undesirable conditions to combat but we hope 
to eliminate them entirelv this vear. 

Phe population of our county is increasing rapidly : some good 

people coming in to help us educationally, and some old residents 

"who have been a help for a number of years past. In conch: 
permit Hooker county to thank the state department of public 
instruction for the inspiration received from the administration 
the past two years, and may we ever keep stepping forward 
in the interests of the rising generation — now ours to guide. </seg>

r&gt; superintendent's report 

Johnson County 

The educational spirit of Johnson county is in a most wholesome 
condition. The patrons, as a rule, are interested in their 
schools. The school boards are demanding better teachers and 
are paying better wages. The teachers are meeting this demand 
for better work, with its better pay, by making special preparation, 
many taking extra training at our Normal Schools. Many 
of our teachers are Normal graduates, while many others who 
are not graduates, have had one or two years' Normal training 

The rural schools are well classified and graded ; still there 
is room for improvement. 

The teachers are following the State Course of Study as closely 
as local conditions will permit. Test questions are sent each 
quarter to all the schools. This has a tendency to make teachers 
follow more closely the State Course. 

Many pupils complete the course of study as outlined for 
country schools, are graduated, and receive a diploma from the 
county superintendent. Most of these pupils enter one of our 
High schools. 

Our Teachers' Institute for 1904 was one of the largest and 
most enthusiastic ever held in the county. 

Many of our schools have small libraries. Others are being 
added. 

Financially speaking, the various districts are in excellent condition, 
but four of the seventy-nine have any bonded indebtedness. 

Several new school houses have been built. Tecumseh is 
putting up a fine $17,000 High school building. Crab Orchard 
is building a good four roomed building. All the teachers are 
working in harmony with the county superintendent. The prospects 
for the future are bright, and I am sure that with so efficient 
a body of teachers, all working to the same end, constant progress 
will be made.

MRS. OLIVE W. TRL-E 

Kearney County 

Concerning the general condition of the schools of Kearney 

county I am pleased to make the following statements : 
First. That our schools are gradually coming up to the higher 

standard of more thorough and more systematic work, which I 

anticipated a few years ago. 

Second. They are better equipped with the proper apparatus 

and with standard texts than they have ever been before. 
Third. Our teachers are more and more basing their work 

upon professional standards. The majority of them are doing 

their utmost in Conscientiously carrying out their work, with 

the Course of Studv as a basis. In connection with our Stat 

Course each teacher uses a supplementary aid, the Revised lllinoi 

rse of Studv. Our schools have this vear more teacher 

who have had professional training than we have ever had. and 

already we are noting marked improvement as to results. Each 

marks an advance in our teachers' wages. Xo teacher re 

ss than $:J3.00 per month in our county, while TO per cent 

of them receive $40.00 or more per month. Our Reading Circles 

are receiving a fair portion of the time and interest of our 

teachers. 

fourth. Our school officers have an organization and endeavor 
ork unitedly in the performance of their duties. The r 
of this is of inestimable value. They have adopted a uniform 
tern of text books, which is only one of many important measures 
ado] them. I believe our school officers are becoming </seg>

y teacher enrolled in this work. We have meetings once a 
th which are well attended. 

ibout one-half of our teachers have had professional training, 
the Junior Normal has been the means to this end. This year 
have a number of young teachers who have never had Normal 
ning but I think a majority of these will attend some good 
doI next summer. 

K believe that Kimball county ranks well with the western 
nties of the state, and we expect, through constant effort, 
nake our schools better next year. 

B. K. BUSHEE 

Knox County 

The people of Knox county are expecting better prepared teachers 
and are willing to pay bettef salaries. Those who have had a 
good Normal training are in demand, and many of our teachers 
spend the summer months in some Normal school. 

There has been quite a tendency to grade the rural schools, 
the State Course of Study being used. Many people, however, 
are too anxious to have their children promoted, not realizing 
that promotion without the proper amount of progress is demoralizing 
to any school. The teachers, in some cases, are apt 
ork to satisfy the public sentiment, instead of working to 
attain a sound educational system. 

The patrons of the schools are ready to devote more time and 
money to secure an education for their children, the teachers are 
better prepared, and it is safe to predict an improvement in educational 
work during the coming year.

colleges and universities, and several besides these have professional 
life certificates. Many are taking studies in one of the 
universities, in some correspondence school, in the business college,

drawing, music and elocution. 

Two inferences may be correctly drawn from these f;i 
Teachers do not remain long in a place, and there is less unity 
of interests than in most counties. If they are good, progre 
teachers, they are taking higher work with a view to promotion. 
If not good, boards are likely to ask them to change. So 
whole they do not stay as long in a place, read as many teachers' 
papers, or do their Reading Circle work as unitedly, as in some 
other counties. Yet they are certainly a superior teaching force. 

Institute was held in 1904 in conjunction with the Lincoln 
city Institute. Drawing was carried separately for the benefit 
of country teachers. A round table conference was held

It has been the custom among the people in the western part 

of the county to move to some near town during the winter to 

give the children schooling, but since the establishing of Junior 

Normal Schools the teachers have taken so much more int

custom is being abandoned. Two of the districts are so enthus 

iastic that they have school in private houses, boarding the 

teacher and many of the smaller pupils. 

MRS. FLORA FARROW. 

Nemaha County 

The schools of Nemaha county are greatly favored by re. 
of the location, within its bounds, of the State Normal School 
at Peru. Out of the ninety-three teachers, — exclusive of the 
Auburn city teachers, — sixty-six have attended Normal school 
one or more terms. The scholarship of the teachers is high, 
they are progressive, energetic and do real teaching. The av. 
wages paid are a little more than $36.00. </seg>


            <seg id="p540">
406 

Thete was a considerable raise this year and it is safe to predict 
that the average wages will be at least $40.00 next year. 

We have seven Teachers' Associations during the year, five 
local associations at the various towns, and two general associations 
at Auburn. We place on the program at these meetings 
the best talent obtainable. The purpose of our association 
is not to afford a place where the teacher may learn "to speak"' 
in public or parley for an hour over some threadbare subject, 
but to afford a means for getting more information and inspiration 
relative to teaching. 

We have a prescribed course of professional work. Nearly 
every teacher has enrolled in the Reading Circle. Meetings of 
the Reading Circle are held at Auburn, Brock, Johnson and 
Nemaha. 

The people of Nemaha county are actively interested in education. 
There are two places where we expect to have large 
centralized schools and free transportation of pupils in the near 
future. There are some leading spirits in those communities 
who are advocating enthusiastically "school consolidation." 

The directors respond promptly to calls for supplies. Good 
text books are furnished and the school property is kept in good 
repair. In forty-two districts since school began (six weeks 
ago), I found nearly every school house newly painted and 
papered, curtains usually furnished, and the condition of the 
outbuildings comparatively good. We are "making war" against 
the marking and cutting of school property and writing of profane 
and obscene language in the outhouses. 

The Nemaha county teachers and pupils take pride in keeping 
the schoolrooms neat and clean. Oil is used in sweeping 
and no dust is allowed to be one day old. The compulsory education 
law is enforced. A very small percentage of the children 
between the ages of seven and fifteen years are not in school. 
A school column is conducted in two of the leading county 
weekly papers by the county superintendent. A paper reaches 
each teacher. This saves the publication of a county bulletin 
and at the same time reaches nearly every family in the county </seg>

the exception that they are more closely organized and have 
become more permanently a part of our school system. They 
are as follows : County Teachers' Association, which meets 
twice each year ; seven local Reading Circle organizations, which 
meet quarterly or oftener if they desire ; a County School Board 
Association, which meets at least once each year, oftener if 
necessity demands more counsel ; the State Course of Study has 
been adopted ; uniform text books have been placed in the 
schools ; rules and regulations for better and more uniform government 
of schools have been adopted ; quarterly examinations 
are held in all the schools ; the School Messenger, a monthly 
county paper, is sustained by the united support of officers and 

("he influence of systematic plans of work with children is 
y great. Of all classes they take the greatest pride in knowthe 
details of school organization and just what relation 
y sustain to their surroundings. This pride or self-respect 
itilized as much as possible to encourage and deepen their 
ires for a higher and better education. 

iV good school spirit generally prevails among parents. Patron 
i other educational meeting have been held at accessible points 
the county, and have had a good influence in bringing about 
operative conditions in school work, yet in this there is much 
&gt;m for improvement.

The County Teachers' Association holds six meetings dr.

meeting is centrally located we have had as high as ninety 
teachers enrolled at one meeting, some of them driving twentfive

county last spring and, so far as we have been able to find out, 
all of them are attending some higher school or are back reviewing 
the work this year. 

There is a far better outlook for good work in the county 
this year than has existed in the past. The spirit of the teachers 
is good and the principals of the various schools of the county 
are all lending a helping hand and are always willing to do anything 
in their power toward the advancement of the schools.

Phelps County 

The schools of Phelps county during the past two years have 
made splendid progress. The school officers are taking more 
interest in the welfare of the schools, seeing that up-to-date text 
books, maps and blackboards are secured, and suitable furniture 
placed in the school room. 

The placing of libraries in the schools, through the efforts of 
teachers and pupils is one of the encouraging features of our 
school work. Basket socials and oyster suppers are given to 
secure funds for the libraries. About sixty per cent of our schools 
have libraries, ranging in size from a few to over a hundred 
volumes. 

The Junior Normal held here has been a factor in placing a 
better grade of teachers in our schools; more than ninety-five 
per cent of our teaching force has spent some time at the Normal, 
and several the full time of both terms it has been in session

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

This year we have adopted for Reading Circle work Common 
Sense Didactics and Geographic Influences in American History. 

rir Teachers' Associations are well attended. Meetings are 
at four different places monthly. 

L School Officers' Association was organized last March. Its 
ings arc quarterly. 

All the rural school houses are frame, and only four of them 
can be said to be in bad condition. 

Eeachers' wages have been raised some during the past year, 
se in the rural schools receive from $30 to $50 per month. 

The first Eighth grade examination ever held in this county 
was conducted at four points last May. Twenty-six pupils were 
examined, of which number six received common school diplomas. 
We are expecting at least one hundred pupils to take the 
examination next spring. 

Every school in the county excepting the schools at Plainview 
and Pierce is using Monthly Reports to Parents and Perfect Attendance 
Certificates. These supplies are furnished by the 
county. 

EJost of the districts are voting longer terms of school and no 
:rict has voted less than six months. Fifty-six families have 
en advantage of the transfer law. 

E"he compulsory attendance law is being enforced. Most 
ool directors do not like to enforce this law upon their neighbors, 
and for this reason, I believe we should have a county 
truant officer. 

I am making an effort to revive interest in the teaching of 
spelling, reading and practical arithmetic. 

Many of our teachers have only a country or village school 
education. They are simply teaching until they can get a more 
desirable position.

Platte County 

The schools of this county are moving along in the educati 
procession with a safe and conservative stride. Our 
while not very rapid, is in the right direction. 

Since our last report nearly all our school buildings have 
shared in the general improvement, which has been going on in 
nearly every school district in the county. The district without 
suitable grounds, outbuildings, books and other school paraphernalia 
is certainly an exception. 

f\s a rule, our school officers, teachers and patrons take j 
this spirit of improvement, and a firendly rivalry is goi: 
e which shall have the best. The general interest in • 
cation is good, there being little demand for the enforcement ot 
the compulsory law. The transfer law is quite popular, ju« 
from the number that avail themselves of its privileges. 

Old and obsolete text books are being discarded and r. 
purchased from a recommended list. This practically j 
county uniformity, without being bound to purchase 
books for a series of years. The introduction of school libr. 
is going on gradually. 

Drawing, music and agriculture are receiving their shar 
attention. Interest in Association Meetings, County Inst: 
md Reading Circle work is all we could reasonably ex: 

Last but not least, if we can judge the moral tone of 
schools by the number of cases demanding discipline, we 
safe in saying that morality and its attending virtues are receiving 
due consideration at the hands of our teachers. 

R/hile there is room for much more advancement 
hole, the schools are in a very satisfactory condition and si 
marked growth since our last report.

Richardson County 

The schools of Richardson county seem to be making gradual 
progress. Our greatest drawback is lack of liberality on the 
part of taxpayers. We have many strong friends of education, 
but some of our taxpayers think so much of the dollar that I 
ve they would actually take their chidlren's part out of the 
state apportionment and put it in their pockets, and I am 
afraid that "if it were left to a vote of the people we would I 
no High schools at all." This class of people is constantly fighting 
for a short term, small levy, cheap teacher and no books. 
are making an effort now to educate this class by holding 
school officers' and patrons meetings in town and country districts 
throughout the county. On account of this stingy element, 
we are actually afraid, as yet, to try to form a School 
Officers' Organization. 

¦ut most of our teachers are conscientious, hard-working 
ng people, doing the very best they can. Nearly all our </seg>

teachers have had some Normal training. Year before la- 

of our teachers attended the State Normal, and our county ranked 
second in point of attendance. Last year we tied for third place. 

Last year we ranked second in number of subscribers to The 

Nebraska Teacher. 

fwo years ago we established a teachers' professional library 

We have ten town schools in our county. These books are di- 

vided into ten division libraries. The principal of each school 

is a division librarian and has charge of one division library. 
Each principal conducts a Reading Circle class for the teach- 

ers in his vicinity, which meets every other Friday evening 

Nearly every teacher is doing the Reading Circle work. Our 

texts this year are : Common Sense Didactics. The Nebr 

Teacher and the Pathfinder. Teachers who do the Reading 

cle work acceptably are successful in the school room, attend 

teachers' meetings, show a professional spirit and have grades 

eraging at least 85 per cent have their certificates rci 

without examination. 

Our Teachers' Association meets twice a year — in th 

and in the spring. For the Friday evening meeting in the fall 

we have some noted lecturer : in the spring the annual debate 
of the Richardson county High schools. 

Our Institutes are usually held the third week in August, and 

are academic, professional and inspirational. Permanent features 

are : Art exhibit, a class in picture study, an exhibit of school 

work, a teachers' reception and spelling contest, and orthoepy and 

mental arithmetic are emphasized. The enrollment this year was 

164, 14 more than any previous enrollment. 

Richardson count}' has 104 school districts, with High schools 

in eight of them. Our schools require 152 teachers, hence, in 

one sense, we have 152 schools. Last year just one hundred of 

these changed teachers. This year 83 changed teachers. This is 

a nice improvement, but still we have too many changes. We 

have 2? beginners this year. 

Two years ago 35 of our schools had libraries. New 98 have </seg>

dictionaries last summer.

official organ of the County Educational Department and 
the Richardson County Teachers" Association. We have one 
page in this paper each week. Hence, we now have 52 issues 
instead of 9, and the Educational Department reaches not only 
teachers and school officers, but patrons and the general public 
as well. 

Teachers' wages are increasing. Two years ago the average 
for men was $46.13, women $35.32; last year men $.*&gt;&lt;&gt;. &lt;"&gt;4, women 
• \ ; a total increase of $ in the county for teachers" 

wages. 

We have uniformity of text beeks in about 90 per cent of our 
schools. It is hard to have the compulsory attendance law enforced. 
We have two new frame school houses this year and tinlast 
log school house has disappeared. Four of our districts have 
contracted for instruction in neighboring districts : two are running 
wagons. Our High schools have a County Athletic 
ciation which holds one meet each spring. 

Eate Course of Study is followed. The work is arra: 
uarters, teachers reporting to the county superintendent at 
lose of each quarter. Blanks for these reports are furnitie 
county, and also Pupils' Report Cards to parents. Each 
ter test questions are sent out by the county superintendent. 

_;hth grade examinations are held each spring. Year before 
; passed the examination. This last spring 136 were granted 
diplomas. Eighth grade graduation exercises are held in some 
of our towns and country districts. Fifty-one graduated from 
the high schools last year. The county superindent keq 
record of Eighth grade and High school graduates, in special 

books for that purpose.

STT AND CITY SCHOOLS 

Rock County 

Rock county has 67 school districts, seven of which are joint 
districts with Brown, Holt and Keya Paha counties. A few of the 
districts have no school population, hence no school. Thi&gt; 
dition will soon pass away, as nearly all of the government land 
has recently been homesteaded. 

A new frame school house has taken the place of the las* 
school house in the countv. 

School officers are beginning to see the need of more and 1 • 
supplies for the schools. A number of districts have bought 
two or three complete sets of books. Most of the districts in the 
county have small school libraries, all of which have been be 
with the proceeds obtained from public entertainments given by 
teachers and pupils. Most of such libraries are read with i 
ure and profit by both pupil and patron. I am sure that K 
and home are brought much closer together by means of the 
libraries. 

Poor wages and cupid are constantly robbing us of man 
our very best teachers. Teachers' wages are much higher than 
formerly, but not high enough to keep the enterprising school 
boards of richer counties from taking away some of our 
promising teachers. 

In proportion to the valuation, this countv pays as mod 
ny county in the state for the support of its schools. 

The Reading Circle becomes more popular each year. N&lt; 
ill the teachers have enrolled and will do the work this 3 
The work is conducted on the correspondence method. 

Not believing in county uniformity of text books no efforts 
along that line have been made. I believe that the Cour- 
Study should be based upon the subject and not upon any uniform 
list of text books. 

Special attention has been given to the care of text books. 
Monday of each week is inspection day. On that day the teacher 
is expected to examine all text books. 

Each year more teachers try to qualify themselves better for 
iheir chosen work.

Saunders County 

tince my report two years ago, the schools of Saunders county 
e been steadily moving with an upward tendency. I somces 
think we superintendents get in so much of a hurry to sec 
lgs move, that we "get ahead of the spirit of the schools and 
reby lose the power of the moving procession. Anxiety and 
husiasm are good, but before it will have the desired effect 
teachers, as a body, must imbibe a certain amount of it and 
p in close touch with the spirit of the superintendent. 

I am glad to report, however, that Saunders county is, upon 
the whole, in a very prosperous condition, and while some features 
of the work are not just what we would have them, we are 
glad to report harmonious work so far as the superintendent and 
teachers are concerned. 

A larger per cent of the beginners are better cfualified to teach 
this year than ever before ; most of whom are either High school 
graduates, or those with Normal school training. Of the twentysix 
beginners in this county, twenty are graduates from High 
schools, two have had Normal school training and but three have 
had neither. This is certainly an improvement over the past, 
and encouraging to one looking for better qualifications among 
aching force in the county. 

[chool officers are, generaly speaking, ready to respond to rests 
of the superintendent excepting on points like the Comsory 
Attendance Law, and perhaps they are not to be criticised 
that point. 

The county is divided into eight educational sections, and leaders 
appointed for each section, whose duty it is to look after the 
matter of arranging for meetings in their respective localities. </seg>

The Reading Circle work, and the Association work have I

Scotts Bluff County 

.lucational interests of Scotts liluff county are in . 

lent condition. While the county is not densely populated and 

the number of schools is not great, a very active interest is taken 

in educational matters. At least seventy-rive per cent of the 

teachers have had more or less Normal training. Quite a rivalry 

exists among the rural districts in seeing which can maintain 

the best school. The same is true among the High school 

tricts. 

The maintenance of that the bv 

structors obtainable be employed, and the employment of good 

teachers requires that the salaries paid be as good as those paid 

elsewhere. Male teachers in the rural districts are receiving from 

$50 to $T5 per month; female teachers from $35 to $50, according 

to their experience and professional ability. 

Considerable time and effort are being expended in trying to 

secure uniformity of text books. Attention is being given to a 

somewhat uniform daily program for the rural schools. Ele- 

mentary agriculture has been introduced as a regular branch

and patrons evince an active interest in this new subject. The 
Countv Teachers' Association and Reading Circle has met once 
this vear. Nearly all teachers were present, and the interest taken 
very gratifying. This work is not divided into sections but 
a general meeting is held at each of the towns in the county 
in regular order, the first being held at the county seat. The 
day of sod school houses is nearly over in this section of the 
state, only one being still in use in this county. With good soil 
and excellent means for irrigation the county is rapidly assuming 
the appearance of the wealthiest agricultural sections of the

twenty-five dollar teacher will be but a memory of the past. 

FRANK P. JOHNSON. 

Seward County 

Probably the surest index that the schools of Seward county 
are growing more efficient is the fact that school boards generally 
want the best teachers for their respective schools. While we 
believe our corps of teachers compare favorably with those of 
neighboring counties, yet the demand for good, strong teachers 
is increasing, and school boards are willing and glad to pay good 
salaries for teachers than can be recommended. To meet this 
demand for better teachers, we have found it necessary to license 
only those applicants who can pass a second grade teacher's 
examination. 

fur teachers were never more interested in Reading Circle 
&lt;. Practically all do creditable work in this line and our 
ols are much benefited thereby. Our county is divided into 
lany Reading Circle sections as we have towns and villages, 
work is uniform throughout the county, being outlined by 
county superintendent, and carried out by the various sec* 
managers. The success of our Reading Circle must be attributed 
largely to the interest in the work taken by all our principals, 
and to the assistance given them by our best and most 
progressive teachers. We find that the Reading Circle does 
more for the si. id advancement in professional fitness </seg>

Sheridan County 

Material conditions in Sheridan county are graduall} 

proving. People here are no longer limited to cattle rai 

but have found out that with the application of scientific methods 

of farming they are reasonably sure of reaping a harvest. 
Now instead of sowing oats and reaping Russian thistles, they 

plant potatoes and reap dollars. 

These improved financial conditions have resulted in better 

times for the schools. Property valuations are higher, taxes are 

paid promptly, and the 25 mill levies, made necc 


hard times, are maintained excepting where a ami 

duces plenty of revenue. Districts once compelled to 

warrants, now pay cash. School officers and patrons are taking 

a more lively interest in school affairs. They are providing bet 

ter equipments for their schools in the way of text books and 

apparatus. With a gradual increase in salaries comes a corres 

ponding demand for better trained teachers. The theacher 

¦nding to this demand by seeking every opportunity be 

to prepare themselves for their work. During the summer we 

a six weeks' Normal Institute. Sixty-one teachers were 

enrolled and by their earnest application to work showed how 
much they appreciated the opportunity. Besides these, twelve 
were enrolled in the Junior Normals, four in the State Normal, 
one in the Fremont Normal, two in the Wayne Normal, one in 
the Grand Island Normal and a few attended the State or the 
leyan University or Institute in other counties. Only a very 

small number were not engaged in summer school work. 
We have a County Teachers' Organization which holds four 

sessions this year, one in each of the principal towns, viz : Hay 
Springs, Rushville, Gordon and Lakeside. The first meeting will 
be at Gordon, and at this meeting we expect to perfect our Read- 

ing Circle plans for the year. 

While we are encouraged over the progress that has been 

made, there is still much to be done.

REPORT 

Stanton County 

During the last two years the interest in the county in : 
of improved educational conditions is quite marked and ii" 
able. Parents are more anxious and willing to give their children 
the best possible chances to secure perfect attendance at school — 
sparing them from home when many were needed to help with 
the home duties and at times when the home could illy afford 
to allow such attendance. More interest has been manifested 
in the kind of teachers secured by districts and as a result a 

higher grade of teachers has been obtained. The people hav&lt; 
to pay higher wages to secure the better teaching talent, and 
have willingly made this increase in the hope of giving the 
better educational opportunities to their children— the coming 

men and women of Stanton count v. 

The improved teaching force has stimulated the children 

to better attendance and awakened them to more earm 

in the pursuit of their studies. In the three years just cl 

the following is a statement of the total days attended by all 

pupils, showing the gains made in the last two years : 
11-2, 1T4,8O6 days. 
1902-3, 178,599 days, 3,?83 days gain. 
3-4, 203,198 days, 24,599 days gain. 
In the above statistics there is room for thought and rea 

to be found. With careless, indifferent teachers gains are n&lt; 

made. Pupils go to school well when things at school are interesting 
and when the home sentiment is the right kind. 

all schools made gains last year, but many of them did as the 

above figures testify. 

Another condition by which we can measure the growth 

Kper home sentiment is in the interest taken in the general 
earance and improvement of the school houses and gror 

Groves have been started on nearly all our school grounds and 

during the past summer vacation more school houses have 

painted inside and outside and repaired than during any fiv 

- previously. .Nothing could so present to our vision this </seg>

sentiment of pride in better school conditions than does the interest 
manifested in this improvement. 

VV. 11. HYLAND. 

Thayer County 

School work is moving along very nicely in this county. We 

have made advancement in several lines during the pas: 

years. The School Officers' Association is a strong organization 

in this county and is accomplishing much good. 1 believ 

Association has done more to arouse an interest in our pub 

schools than any one other thing we have done for yew. The 

result has been that we are paying better wages to our teacher 

are increasing the length of the term gradually, and are demand- 

ing real teachers for our schools. 

fhe uniformity of text books has also been the means of 

proving our schools. Fully eighty per cent of the schoi i 

this county are now using all or part of the books recomiru 

by the committee. Aside from getting better books into ¦ 

hands of the pupil, this plan, we believe, will save hundre 

dollars to the tax payers. Agriculture has been adde 

course of study and will be taught in all the schools in the county 

this year. 

Our teachers are feeling the need of a professional training 

more and more each vear and manv of them attend the (lift

Three new school building have been erected during the past

according to modern plans. New and up-to-date furniture has 
also been placed in several of the schools to take the place of 
the old, uncomfortable seats.

Thomas County 

Thomas county is one of the unfortunate counties where no 
High schools exist. However, the few schools of this county 
are progressive. Teachers' salaries are on the increase and some 
districts have voted a longer term of school. 

Last March we were favored by a Teachers' Association, when 
it was our privilege to have Deputy State Superintendent Mc- 
Brien with us. Patrons showed much interest in this meeting. 
Uniformity of text books has been adopted. Four pupils successfully 
passed the Eighth grade examinations last year. 

We have adopted for our Reading Circle work Common Sense 
Didactics and Geographic Influences in American History. One 
school library was established last year. One new frame school 
house has been erected the past year. 

k\Ye are looking forward to a three days' Teachers Meeting in 
avember. We hope the time is near at hand when Thomas 
county can support a High school.

Wayne County 

Wayne county has an area of only 444 square miles wit: 
school districts, many of them smaller than they should be for 
the best results. There seems to be a popular idea among the 
people of the county that there should be a school house for 
every four sections of land, regardless of the ability of the district 
to maintain a good school. I am not in sympathy with this 
notion, but find it very hard to change. 

As we have a Normal school located in the city of Wayne, 
nearly all of the teachers have had more or less Normal training. 
Many of them are graduates of this school, while many others </seg>

Kdred dollars were raised in various ways by teachers and 
ils in twenty-two districts last year for the benefit of school 
iries. 

I ill of our county teachers are enrolled in the Reading Circle. 
: have held one meeting this year and the work promises to 
very helpful to our teachers. A teacher who does not faithy 
do the work will not have any part of his certificate renewed 
en it expires. Our local Reading Circle meetings are held 
five different places in the county making it convenient for 
h teacher in the county to attend the meetings. 

Our schools are following the State Course of Study as closely 
as conditions will permit. 

Ebout twenty-five per cent of our teachers attended the State 
mal and other good summer schools the past summer, thus 
ng the educational standard in this county. 

K^ot many school houses have been built in the past two years 
a large number of the school houses have been repainted 
papered during the past summer. 

Nothing ever attempted in this county has done more to stimulate 
pupils to earnest effort than having county Eighth 
grade examinations. In 1903 we held our first county examination. 
Forty-two successfully passed the examination and received 
common school diplomas at the county Eighth grade 
promotion exercises in June of that year. In 1904 forty-one pupils 
completed the common school course. Nearly all of these 
pupils are in High schools or colleges. 

Eeachers salaries have risen perceptibly this school year. All 
hers of experience are getting at least forty dollars per month 
a few are receiving forty-five and fifty dollars per month. 

E'e are using Monthly Report Cards furnished from the county 
:rintendent's office, by means of which parents are regularly 
rmed in regard to the progress of their children. 

The people of the county are much interested in the schools, 
and lend us their hearty co-operation in the work.

York County. 

The scholastic progress in York county during the last biennium 
has been mainly along three lines. 

1 . Progressional progress of the teachers. This has been \ 
marked even though the professional interest and attainment 
wore up to a high standard two years ago. In the work of the 
Reading Circle for 1M8-'O4 there was but one teacher in the 
county who did absolutely nothing. At the Institute of 
there were one hundred fifty-two enrolled when only one hundred 
thirty-nine teachers were needed in the county. Again, in the 
l!»04 Institute, there were one hundred forty enrollments while 
there were at leat twenty who were away, — either in other Institutes 
or in a Summer School. The instructors have frequently 
remarked the enthusiastic attention as well as the avidity with 
which York county teachers make notes of whatever is import- 
K. Best of all. in my visiting, I have found these same Institute 
ps and hints being worked out in the school rooms. Then as 
nal proof of professional advance, I offer the fact that during 
the biennium there have been twenty-three first grade certificates 
issued and that, during the present year, we have a class of 
twenty-five who are making a systematic review of the first 
grade branches preparatory to the spring examinati 

E Increase in attendance. The Compulsory attendance law 
had the desired effect. The children are sent to school more 
ilarly and for longer periods. The gain in total number of

These figures are for the public schools alone and have no ! 
ing on the °ight private schools \\ ith an enrollment of nine hundred 
seventy-eight pupils. The most of these would other 
be in public school and the total would be even higher than it is. 

t'S. The progress in the matter of salaries. Many of the teachs 
have been retained at substantial advances in salary, whili; 
:mv other districts have raised the salaries to attract better 
ichers. We look for a further increase next vear. 

Taking all in all, we have good reasons to feel proud of the 
work in York county. The County Teachers' Association, the </seg>

Reading Circle and the County School Officers' Association have 
all been in active operation. The library spirit has been abroad in 
the land and the: schools that have not done something 
towards this end during the past year. Some raised as 
much as thirty-five dollars to invest. The library of the County 
Teachers' Association has been enlarged and classified and cata¦d 
on the card system. It now contains 'four hundred forty 
f them professional, though the reference library 
and there is some fiction. The librarian's record shows 
hundred eighty-one books were circulated during the 
.r. A movement to distribute the better class of n 
- among the schools has done much to encourage the d 
to read. 

Esix High schools, our Girls' Academy and our College are 
i wonderful work in the encouragement of our eighth grade 
ites to go on and obtain a higher education. There were 
one hundred twenty-one of these graduates in 1904, and we look 
forward to a large class in 1906. 

Pring the past year we have held spelling contests and the 
hool Declamatory Contest. These do a great 
:o engender school feeling and are a permanent feature with 
The county educational paper, The Public School, is now 
in its third year, so its life seems pretty well assured. 

Kniformity of text books has been operative during the last 
e years and, while it is not yet absolute, having been adopted 
for gradual change, it is a highly successful measure. 

E, ith a good record behind us and a promising future before, 
feel that labor in the educational field in York county is not 
ppreciated and cannot be counted thrown away.

Albion 

Rhe public schools of Albion are thoroughly organized and 
1 equipped. Thirteen teachers are employed and solid educational 
work is accomplished in the twelve grades. Nine years 
are required to complete the work below the High school — one 
year being devoted to kindergarten work. Music is taught in 
all the grades and supervised by an experienced music teacher 
who meets the grades each day. Good singers are developed and 
our churches have excellent choirs as a result. Attention and 
interest determine the music grade on the pupils's report card. 

Albion is a town of churches and well regulated homes. As 
a result our young men are upright and well behaved, and pupils 
are easily managed at school. There is very little cigarette 
smoking in town, — practically none among High school boys. 
We have no saloons and the business men and citizens stand as 
a unite for a high standard in municipal management and social 
conduct. All influences tending to develop the best in life are 
working together in Albion. 

Last year our enrollment was 640. It will be about the same 
this year. The High school enrollment is now 115. This number 
will advance to 125 before the year closes— a large number 
compared with towns even larger than Albion. 

Botany, chemistry and physics constitute our science department. 
The study of chemistry has been placed on a good working 
basis during the past year. An excellent laboratory is maintained 
and seniors, during the year, perform all the experiments 
given in Nicholson &amp; A very 's manual. 

Itfuch interest is taken in athletics, especially baseball and 
.ketball. The girls have two basketball teams. Football has 
:n allowed to die a natural death. Athletics are strictly conlied 
by the superintendent and all objectionable features elimi:ed. 
An excellent baseball ground and an athletic field have 
:n made by our High school boys on vacant lots near the 
iooI house,— lots rented for the purpose. Ungentlemanly con:t 
is punished by exclusion from the grounds for the remainder 
the season. 

Last year the graduating class numbered fourteen ; this year </seg>

it will be eighteen ; next year at least twenty-two, and the year 
following thirty-five. We believe our schools are progressing 
because our pupils show a good, strong, educational spirit. 

GEORGE E. KINDLER. 

Alliance 

Since the report made two years ago the Alliance schools 
have continued to increase in the number in attendance, and it 
is to be hoped that the quality of instruction nas kept pace with 
the other growth. 

The Emerson building, a fine ward building of brick, containing 
four large, well-ventilated rooms with ample halls and cloak 
rooms, was completed this summer at a cost of a little more than 
$10,000. There are now regularly employed in the schools nineteen 
teachers, though one is for supply work only. During the 
last year by funds from school entertainments there have been 
added to the school library one hundred seventy-five volumes, 
but most of these are books for pupils ranging from eight to 
fifteen years, a few for teachers, and a set of new International 
Encyclopaedia. 

The school has no fad unless it might be said that attention 
to punctuality and regularity of attendance be called such, but 
equal stress upon all lines of work is the desire of the administration. 


The High school in the last two years has advanced from an 
enrollment of fifty-five to ninety, and with a slight increase in 
attendance, it is purposed to make the High school course somewhat 
more elastic by adding additional instructors.

Auburn 

The schools of the city of Auburn have had a healthy growth 
from their organization to the present time, and are now in a very 
prosperous condition. The eight hundred pupils are housed in

rooms, and one temporary frame structure of one room. Plans </seg>

COUNTY AND CITY SCHOOLS 

have been drawn for an addition to the High school building 
to cost $10,000, and another six-room building for the grade 
schools to cost about the same amount. This fall fire escapes 
have been added to all the buildings, Antioch and Athens schools 
have been papered throughout, about $80.00 worth of sectional 
bookcases have been provided for the High school library, new 
furnaces put in the High school building and a number of other 
material improvements made. We have a good reference library, 
including the new International Encyclopaedia. Our school 
board follows the policy of generous appropriations for necessary 
equipment. 

We have but one Course of Study in the High school, with 
several optional studies in the Eleventh and Twelfth grades. 
Three years of foreign language are required, two of them being 
Latin. 

Of the five teachers in the High school, including the superintendent 
who has three classes, three are graduates of our 
State University, one of the Kansas University, and one of our 
State Normal School. A number of the grade teachers are Normal 
School graduates and others have attended school there. 

There is a cadet company of forty-six members in the High 
school under competent instruction. One credit is given for two 
years' drill. A credit is also given for satisfactory piano lessons 
under a qualified teacher if seventy-two are taken during the High 
school course. These credits are in addition to the thirty required 
for graduation. 

A flourishing literary society of over one hundred members 
is an important adjunct of the High school. Prizes are annually 
awarded to the best debaters. Debating and athletic contests are 
held with neighboring schools with credit to ourselves. This 
year great interest has been shown by both girls and boys in 
basketball. It has taken the place of football in our schools. 
We have an annual inter-class field meet in the spring, which 
creates great enthusiasm and class spirit. We believe that athletic 
sports keep many boys in school who would otherwise drop 
out. The enrollment today of 166 in the High school compared 
with 770 in all schools is a very satisfactory ratio.

8TATK SDFEB'INTENDKNt'b REPORT 

Beatrice 

Iince the publication of the last Biennial Report, the Beatrice 
x»ls have grown in enrollment, number of teachers, and we 
ik in efficiency also. With a board of education composed of 
i and women who are very much alive to the needs of a 
wing school and who are liberal in supporting a progressive 
cational policy, Beatrice boys and girls ought to have as 
&gt;d opportunities as can be enjoyed anywhere. 

Within the past two years there has been a liberal increase in 
salaries all along the line ; five of the buildings have been equipped 
with pendent globes; six compound microscopes have been purchased, 
making a total of seventeen for the High school and one 
for the grades ; there has been a revival in spelling and mental 
arithmetic, and the buildings and grounds have been repaired 
and beautified in many ways. 

IFhe ranks of the Gage county school teachers are recruited 
a large measure from our High school graduates, fifteen out 
the forty graduates last year having entered the teaching prosion. 
To give prospective teachers some training for the work, 
formal class of methods is conducted in the High school by 
: superintendent and the principal of the High school, a class 
en to seniors only. A course is also offered them in agriculture, 
i all seniors have an opportunity to review the common 
inches. 

I To meet the growing demand for business training, a comercial 
course has been added to the High school curriculum, 
nis course is the equivalent in hours and strength of the other 
curses. The commercial studies offered are commercial arithetic, 
civics, commercial geography, commercial law, book:eping 
and political economy. 

I The Crabtree Forensic club is doing splendid work and its 
embers are deriving untold benefit from the drill in debating 
d parliamentary law. 

Best of all, the High school is growing in size all the time. 
The number of students this year is a few over three hundred </seg>

and if the interest of the Eighth graders continues, in a year or 
two the High school will enroll four hundred. 

The very atmosphere in Beatrice encourages and stimulates 
pupils and teachers to their best efforts.

Central City 

Central City made extensive school improvements the past 
summer. A large addition was built to the Central building, 
making two new school rooms, a large assembly room and a 
library room. The building was also thoroughly renovated, new 
paper and paint applied, and a steam heating plant installed. 

tA program clock has been placed in the High school which 
tomatically signals the close of the periods in each recitation 
room. The assembly room is a beautiful, light, airy room in 
which all the advantages of pleasant surroundings contribute to 
successful work. 

Central City people are justly proud of their commodious, 
up-to-date High school building. Few places can boast of as 
handsome grounds as those belonging to Central City's school 
buildings ; fine trees and well kept lawns indicate the importance 
attached to attractive surroundings. The lawns are kept mowed 
the entire summer, watered when necessary, and are things of 
beauty noted by every passerby. The cultural effect of beautiful 
surroundings seems to be overlooked in many places, but Central 
City is making it count strongly in the education of her children. 

Another teacher has been added to the corps this year, the 
sentiment of the board being that the best work cannot be secured 
in over-crowded rooms. Few boards are more liberal and 
thoughtful in providing for the needs of their schools than that 
of Central City. The laboratory equipment is excellent, and a 
good beginning has been made for a working reference library, 
which is being constantly increased. In making the addition 
to the building a fine library room was provided, opening from 
the assembly room by large sliding doors. This will be fitted up 
with ample shelving, reading tables, etc., supplied with papers </seg>

and magazines as well as books, and made to do practical service 
as an adjunct to the regular work. 

Grades required for passing have been raised, and when a 
student is not keeping up to the standard parents are promptly 
notified, and transfer to lower grade speedily follows, unless 
marked improvement is shown. 

Central City contributes many students to the higher institutions, 
the ambition to go to college being strongly shown in 
the High school.

Columbus 

An efficient school board composed of business and professional 
men ; a strong and harmonious teaching corps ; pleasant 
school rooms, well equipped ; funds with which to provide all 
the necessaries and some of the luxuries, and an excellent school 
spirit have continually conspired toward the betterment of our 
schools. The board, determined and progressive, has been liberal 
in its support. They favor the plan of securing the best teachers 
possible and of supplying them generously with facilities 
for their work. They have spared neither time nor personal 
effort, and the committee work has been thoroughly organized 
and effective. The teaching force is competent. Practically 
fifty per cent of our grade teachers have pursued courses in, 
or are graduates of, the Cook County Normal, the Chicago University 
School of Education or the State Normal School of Nebraska. 
Another twenty per cent are college graduates or college 
trained, while all have had excellent Normal training for 
their work. Our buildings are kept in good repair, are pleasant, 
well lighted and supplied with numerous pictures. Music is 
taught in all the grades. Drawing is taught under the direction 
of a special teacher. The fundamental subjects are given special 
prominence in the grades. 

The High school is well provided with laboratories and apparatus 
and offers three courses ; English-manual training, classical, 
German-manual training. Manual training was introduced a 
/ear ago. The shop is fitted up with the best possible equipment </seg>

in individual benches and tools. Four periods each week are 
given to shop work and one period to mechanical drawing 
proper proportion of intellectual and mental work is provided. 
The work in manual training is laboratory training and holds 
equal rank with other studies. For girls a course in free hand 
drawing and applied design is offered. This work is given in the 
Ninth grade. It is proposed to add lathe work the present year. 
Our present Ninth grade numbers more boys than girls. 

The prospects for the future are highly encouraging 

\Y. M. KERN. 

Crete. 

During the past two years special attention has has been 
given to English, both in the grades and the High school. The 
aim is to acquire a mastery of the English language that will 
enable the pupil to express his thoughts clearly either orally 
or in writing. With this in view more time and effort is devoted 
to reading than formerly. Three or four books are read 
now in the lower grades, where one was read three years ago. 
The vocabulary of pupils is thus enriched and nothing that is 
of real value in visualization or effect is lost. 

" Orthography in connection with reading and as a separate 
study receives due attention, and as a result poor spelling 
is no longer reputable. In the High school, careful study of 
English masterpieces acquaints the pupil with some of the 
best things in our literature but the overstrained, forced interpretation 
of obscure passages is not encouraged. Much emphasis 
is placed upon accurate oral recitations, thus developing the 
power of ready speech so much needed in the daily life of the 
vast majority. 

The not book system in connection with history, by which 
pupils are supposed to do a large amount of source work, proved 
to be such a source of fraud that it has been discarded. All 
alternation of subjects, i. e., history three times each week alternating 
with something else twice a week, has proved its 
weakness and is no longer in use. 

More attention is now given to the individuality of pupils. </seg>

8TATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

The slow are not forced along, the quick not held back and all 
are helped to feel that rush and scramble to get into a higher 
grade before they are prepared for it is an injury. 

Regular examinations are not known. Written or oral tests 
or reviews occur at the option of the teacher and generally without 
any announcement to the pupil. Promotions may occur at 
any time but mostly at the close of the year and are based on 
the knowledge of the teacher as to the fitness of the pupil to 
advance. In cases of doubt as to the qualifications of a pupil 
a decision by the superintendent is required. 

Arithmetic in the grades has received more careful and systematic 
treatment with a correspondingly better result. The one 
year of Greek has been dropped from the High school course 
as it did not seem just to patrons to pay for something that was 
of use to only a very small number of pupils. 

Effort is made to train all pupils to look upon school as a 
place for work — pleasant work — but work, and to believe that 
work is honorable and the surest road to happiness and comfort. 
This together with a fair growth towards self-government has 
brought about a spirit of co-operation between pupils and teachers 
that reduces discipline to a minimum. 

Iecognizing the evils resulting frpm football, physically, mentand 
morally, it is no longer encouraged. Basketball for boys 
girls, track athletics, a military company, a brass band, a 
iting society and glee club furnish at present all the incidental 
ures necessary for the extra vitality of youth. That hard 
k does not drive our boys from the High school is shown 
the fact that for a few years past the number of boys in 
ndance has not been less than forty per cent of the entire 
)llment. The present Twelfth grade contains eleven boys 
elevn girls, the Eleventh grade eighteen boys and fifteen

deem it wise to have both sexes represented in our board ; we 
therefore have two ladies and four gentlemen. We believe somewhat 
in the principle that a woman's refinement begins where a 
man's leaves off. 

Education and citizenship do not consist merely in what a 
person may know in cold facts, but these aided by the touch of 
refinement raise the standard of citizenship. Taking the above 
view of things, the board of education spent hundreds of dollars 
during the past summer in improvement, t such as painting 
all the buildings and papering and cleaning up rooms. 

For the past four years the school administration has given 
much attention to a High school lecture course, in which all 
school pupils of the district could get their tickets, covering the 
entire course of five numbers, for fifty cents. By pursuing this 
plan nearly all of our pupils have heard many of the best orators 
and lecturers of the country. This year the course is not under 
the management of the High school, but our energies will be 
turned to entertainments, the proceeds of which will be turned 
either into a library fund or for the benefit of our laboratorv. 

A large number of our graduates are either attending college 
or the State University, and a number of the present junior and 
senior classes expect to continue their education after they finish 
their High school course. 

Nature study in the grades this year will consist of the study 
of birds.

Fairbury 

The completion of a new modern ten-room school building 
marks an epoch in the educational progress of Fairbury. The 
work has been badly crippled for several years owing to th&lt; 
of various rooms in different parts of the city — mere expedients 
to accommodate the ever inceasing school population. The heating 
and lighting as well as ventilation were very unsatisfactory 
under such conditions and the proper grading and classification 
difficult. Last year the attendance increased so much that it 
was found necessary to employ another teacher. The same thing </seg>

Erred the current year and now sixteen teachers are employed 
e grades below the High school department, to care for over 
:hildren. 

Besides the new building there are three good substantial 
brick buildings in use, all of which have been thoroughly overhauled 
and refitted, papered and painted and furnished with slate 
blackboards, except four rooms, and with single desks, except 
three rooms. 

The attendance in the High school has more than kept pace 
with the increased facilities. The enrollment this year will exceed 
180 by the second semester. Classes have grown so large 
as to make it necessary to handle them in sections, requiring more 
hours' teaching of each member of the faculty. In fact recitations 
begin at 8 a. m. and continue till 12 o'clock noon, with 
a two-hour session in the afternoon. 

The board of education realize that a good High school is desirable 
and that it can be good only in proportion as the work 
of the grades is good, and that the Seventh and Eighth grades 
need the best teaching talent, next to the beginners, in the entire 
system. The requirements for teachers in these grades are 
therefore the same as for the High school, and these teachers 
are given first .consideration in filling vacancies in the High 
school. 

An excellent school spirit prevails throughout the city and 
board and teachers are working earnestly to the end that the 
community may realize value received for the money invested 
in the work of educating its children.

Falls City 

The Falls City public sehools are in a posperous condition 
as is shown by the interest patrons and citizens take in the 
schools. There is a growing sentiment that nothing that can 
be obtained is too good for the children. This spirit is created by

the mental, moral, physical and social upbuilding of the childwho 
attend the public schools. 

The increased interest in the High school is shown by the 
increased number of boys who attend. There are twice as many 
boys in the High school as there were four years ago. Then 
there were four girls to one boy ; now the number of girls is 
but twice as large as the number of boys. 

East year twenty-three persons from Falls City were attending 
itutions of higher learning and a number more have been 
ed to that list this year. 

While a great deal may be left to be desired we feel that all 
in all the schools are passing through a very prosperous period.

During the past two years patrons' meetings have been held 
and have exercised a good influence for the success of the schools. 
These meetings have been addressed by Dr. Chas. Fordyce, 
Superintendent J. L. McBrien and other leading school men 
of the state. 

Each year the High school manges a lecture course, which 
brings to Friend some of the best talent on the lecture platform. 

Ei the present equipment and the generous spirit of the 
of education and citizens we should make a decided imient 
in the efficiency of our work.

Geneva 

Fhe educational spirit in this community has been up to the 
al high standard but the schools have increased in size, especially 
in the upper grades, so- that the efficiency has been rather 
below the proper standard on account of needed room and more 
teachers. 

In the early fall of 1904 the citzens voted $30,000.00 bonds 
for a new school house, which amount with the $5,000.00 already 
on hand will build and equip one of the best school buildings in 
the state for a town of this size. 

E'he High schol enrollment in the past two years has inised 
from about 75 to 120 and will be larger still next year 
h the new school house. 

This year the board of education raised all the teachers' salaries 
five dollars a month and employed an additional teacher in 
the grades. The board of education is particularly sensible in 
allowing plenty of books and apparatus for the school. 

Be school and community take a lively interest in school 
tics, declamatory contests, debating, and lecture courses.

every year with very little effort. Considerable money has been 
expended lately for reference books, such as encyclopaedias and 
history books. 

fame little difficulty was experienced in enforcing the Comiory 
Attendance law, but the board of education took a firm 
id and turned the whole law on in full force, without any 
r ering. As a result we now have practically no trouble in 
enforcement. 

The number of non-resident pupils is increasing every year, 
especially in the High school. As a rule we find that the Eighth 
grade graduates from the country schools are a very desirable 
class of students and do the work nicely. While they do not 
have the symmetry of development that the graded school pupils 
have they make up for it in initiative and potential force. 

Altogether general school conditions are very satisfactory considering 
the circumstances under which we have been working. 

Harvard 

En glancing over our work since the last report, nothing seems 
give promise of more interest to the educational forces of the 
te than our experience with '"transportation of pupils." 

(Harvard school district is six miles square. The Central builder 
is located in town, near the center of the district. In each 
rner of the district is a one-room building. The grades in these 
yard" schools cover the same work that is done in town through 

the eight grades. 

I About eighty per cent of the children living on farms near these 
hools attend the "ward" schools, the remaining twenty pet 
nt driving to the Central school in town. Choice between the 
arest school and Central is optional with the patrons. Near the 
iddle of the last school year, as the attendance at the Northeast 
hool was less than ten pupils, the board decided to close the 
hool and transport the pupils to town. A man was found who 
ould furnish a team and closed conveyance and make two trips 

tily for $40.00 per month. The plan was operated during the 
mainder of the year. Ordinarily the pupils farthest away

reached the school thirty minutes after leaving home. Of course 
such an innovation was productive of much duscussion among 
taxpayers and patrons. 

This year the board has placed a teacher in the school. Some 
of the patrons in the corner in question were so impressed by 
the progress made by their children in the larger classes in town 
that they have provided them with conveyances and have them 
drive to the Central school. 

In my judgment the reasons for abandoning the plan are: 
(1) It is out of the ordinary, perhaps appearing to some to be 
a fad. (2) Other parts of the district seemed likely to demand 
the same privileges, and with present facilities we could not 
accommodate all at the Central school. Another building would 
be necessary. 

If we were to transport all our pupils, it is likely that the expense 
of conducting the school would be somewhat increased ; 
and it is probably needless to add the efficiency of our system 
would be greatly enhanced. 

D. D. MILES. 

Hastings 

The total enrollment during the year 1903-4 was 2,210, an increase 
of forty over the preceding year. During the past five 
years there has been an increase of 685 in the enrollment. The 
attendance during the past year has not been as good as we had 
hoped it would be, on account of sickness of various kinds. 

We hope in the near future to offer at least a short course in 
manual training. We believe that manual training will have a 
tendency to keep in school a number of boys who will otherwise 
lose their interest in school work. This work, we believe, has 
other practical values. It will have a tendency to teach that 
work with the hands is honorable ; and that he whose hands 
are skilled in fashioning useful or beautiful things is as valuable 
to a community as he who is skilled in the fashioning of phrases 
or in any other line of work or profession. 

The work in the Eighth grade for several years past has 
seemed somewhat difficult. One reason that might be given why </seg>

such conditions pievailed there was the over-crowded condition 
in the High school and ,in consequence, it was impossible to have 
the beginning Latin in the High school where it properly belongs. 
Arrangements have now been made whereby the beginning 
Latin, and all other High school studies will be in their 
proper place. The Eighth grade will, in the future, be in the new 
High school building. The change in the location of the grac'e 
is made for several reasons, one of the principal of which is that 
the students of the Eighth grade being located in the same building 
with the High school will naturally be in closer touch with 
the High school work than they would otherwise be. And since 
we are convinced that one combined Eighth grade will do more 
efficient work than can. be done by having an Eighth grade in 
each of the ward buildings, the location of this grade in the new 
High school building is a proposition of fairness to all on account 
of the central location. Everything being considered we 
are of the opinion that this change of location of the Eighth 
grade will have a tendency to keep in schol a number of students 
who might have a tendency to drop out if they were less favorably 
situated with reference to location and surroundings. 

The fact is everywhere being recognized that the physical 
development is as essential as that of the mental and that unless 
some special arrangements are provided for the assistance of the 
physical training of the students in our schools that part of their 
education is far more likely to be neglected than that of their 
mental training. In all well regulated schools, whether they be 
Colleges or High schools, the matter of physical training is given 
proper attention, and as we desire that our new High school 
building shall be equal to th&amp; best in the equipment in this line, 
there has been arranged a large room in the basement which we 
hope will be fitted up, in the near future, as a gymnasium.

The Havelock schools have been growing so rapidly that they

have eleven teachers in addition to the superintendent. The 
schools are very much overcrowded and more room will soon be 
provided. Plans have been drawn for the erection of a new building 
and the work will be undertaken in the very near future. 

Eavelock is an industrial city. The people are all a hard workclass 
and take much interest in the schools. The salaries of 
hers have been raised in all the grades. The school has long 
led a school library. This need is now being met and we are 
ing good use of that most important help, the school library.

Hebron 

iivery member of the board of education and the patrons of 
Hebron public schools have manifested a very strong desire 
build up a strong system of education. To accomplish this, 
expense, consistent with proper economy, has been spared to 
rease the facilities of the schools. Eleven teachers are em&gt;yed 
and two buildings occupied. 

i\'e aim to make the pupils as efficient in the common branches 
their age and mental development will allow before they are 
mitted to leave the Eighth grade. To test this, we insist on 
:ry pupil passing a rigid final examination of all Eighth grade 
inches. All pupils who do not grade well in this must remain 
the grade another year, even though the averages of the 
ides obtained and reported to the parents every six weeks is 
fh enough for promotion. This plan does much to raise the 
ciency of those who enter the High school. 

t Pupils may graduate from our High school when they have 
:ured thirty-two points credit. Promotions are by subjects 
ther than by years, as in the grades below. Considerable option 
allowed the pupils in regard to subjects taken up. As the 
urse is arranged at present, pupils may graduate with three 
ars,' with two years', or with no Latin. Those who do not 
ke the Latin may take a more thorough course in bookkeeping, 
ithmentic, science and rhetoric, while those who do carry the </seg>

ttin may elect some of these common branches in the last year 
their course. 

The time element in the development of the pupil's mind is 
considered in arranging the studies. For six years the plan of 
taking algebra one half year, then dropping it and taking geometry 
the same length of time, to be followed, in turn, by another 
half year of algebra and so on until both subjects are completed 
has been thoroughly tested. The result, when contrasted 
with the old plan of completing one subject before taking up another 
is surprising. 

We think, on the whole, we have reason to be proud of our 
discipline and of the friendly spirit of co-operation manifested 
by our pupils, and of the fact that during late years as many 
boys as girls have graduated from our schools. It is worthy of 
note, too, that a large percentage of them have continued their 
studies in higher institutions of learning. 

Music is taught in all the grades under the direction of a 
special instructor.

Holdrege 

Holdrege is the center of an energetic and thrifty population, 
largely Swedish, which takes great interest in educational affairs. 
This, together with the work done by conscientious, well equipped 
teachers, accounts for the excellent condition of the school at 
present. Nothing seems to have been done for show, and deformities, 
sometimes called fads or hobbies, are lacking. The pupils 
take school life seriously and most oj them appear to like to 
work. The discipline in grades and High school is excellent. 

The High school has a library of well selected books which 
are constantly within reach of the students. The Eighth grade 
also has a library of its own. New compound microscopes and 
chemical apparatus have been added this year and the laboratory 
will soon be located in a larger and more suitable room. A o 
of study giving forty points has been adopted by the board. 
Thirty-two credits are required for graduation, four of which

Kearney 

The schools of Kearney are pleasantly situated. They occupy 
six well built brick and stone buildings, with a High school and 
a central school embracing all grades from the first to the eighth. 
A four-room building is located in each of the four wards of the 
city in which are all the grades from first to seventh inclusive. 
The central building occupies a tract of land embracing six and, 
one-fourth acres seeded to blue grass and clover and surrounded 
by beautiful shade trees. All building have well kept lawns 
and an abundance of shade trees. We are striving to make the 
schools the most pleasant place in the community. Aside from 
the beautiful lawns and shade trees, the buildings are kept neat 
and clean within. Six janitors are employed by the year to care 
for the property. Windows, blackboards, floors, stairs and hallways 
are kept perfectly clean and attractive. An effort is being 
made to supply suitable decorations for the school rooms. We 
have carefully selected and well framed pictures in each room. 
A school room should be as clean and as attractive as a home. 

Our High school enrolls from one hundred eighty to two 
hundred students. During the first month of the present year </seg>

we enrolled thirty-pine non-residents. We charge no tuition, 
but accord the non-resident pupils the same privileges in tuition, 
books and equipment we do the resident. The common school 
branches are so arranged that students receive a thorough review 
in them during the four years of High school work. In 
the senior year has been instituted a class called Senior Reviews. 
This class spends one-half year in reviewing spelling, arithmetic, 
geography, history and grammar. All our High school teachers 
are University graduates. A uniformed military company is 
maintained. This company drills two hours each week and affords 
a splendid discipline for those who take it. This work is 
not compulsory, but from forty to fifty students enroll in the 
company each year. Two courses are offered, — a Latin and an 
English course. An equivalent of twenty-eight university credits 
is required for graduation. Last year we graduated a class of 
thirty, — twelve boys, eighteen girls. 

I\ splendid professional spirit is shown among the teachers. 
I are inthusiastic and each is making a careful study of her 
•rk. The Nebraska State Reading Circle course comes in 
¦ its share of the teachers' time ; besides which, each teacher 
working out some particular line in her profession and strivl 
to excel in that line, and the results of this spirit are manifest, 
e require in selecting teachers that they should kave some proisional 
training. Of the grade teachers, ten are students of the 
ite Normal ; several have attended private Normals, and some 
ve taken a course at the University. 

In order to make education complete, the hands must be 
trained to consummate the plans formulated by the mind. To 
this end, we have established the basis of industrial training, 
and the laboratories come in for their share of attention in every 
part of the schools. Sewing, weaving, drawing, modeling, sketching, 
carving, etc., have been worked into the course of study, 
thus laying the basis for an industrial education. 

The board of education believe in a thorough equipment 
and in holding teachers responsible for effective work. They are

Lexington 

E'he Lexington schools have had but two superintendents in 
:een years. During that time the schools have been steadily 
wing. One of the chief distinctions the schools claim is the 
influence that has been started that keeps so many of the boys 
in school until they have completed the High school course. 
One boy was graduated in 1891. Total number of boys who have 
completed the course is ninety-nine. During the same time 142 
girls were graduated. 

The High school at the present writing has seventy-nine boys 
and 108 girls who are earnest pupils. The teachers in the entire 
school are well trained, earnest, deserving instructors who have 
the confidence of the patrons of the school. The school board are 
the busy business men of the town, who meet regularly once a 
month and often call extra meetings to look after the general interest 
of the school. 

The school has but one course of study which is deemed for 
the best interest of the four years' High school work. A pupil 
may make twenty-eight credits for the University and receive 
one-fourth year's review work in the twelfth grade. Or he can 
get twenty-six points and one-half year's review. 

The school spirit is exceptionally good in Lexington. Whatever 
the school undertakes along the line of entertainments the 
town heartily co-operates in. 

The town is built up of energetic, well educated business 
men. The schools have attracted many from the surrounding 
vicinity to make Lexington their home so that their children 
might have the advantage of a good High school education. 

Each year has added something to the school which keeps it 
out of the ruts. This year we adopted the Ward method of </seg>

reading in the lower grades and introduced more kindergarten 
work in the first grade. Military drill has been made a part 
of the regular school work. Two companies have been organized 
and battalion drill will be a part of the work. Each pupil will 
take one hour's drill per week. Other pupils who desire will drill 
two extra hours per week. 

We have graduates in the State University, Wesleyan, Bellevue, 
State Normal at Peru, Fremont Normal, and several have 
taken special work at various business colleges. This speaks well 
for the school. 

The above is given as a brief statement of the scope and 
aim of the Lexington school which has higher ideals to reach and 
better citizens to furnish.

Minden 

The course of study in the grades of the Minden schools covers 
the usual work of eight years. While no special emphasis is 
placed upon any one subject, yet careful attention is given at 
present to reading, arithmetic and language. 

A good text in spelling is used and efficiency in this subject 
has been increased. We have no special teacher in music, but 
the general demand for instructors in this branch is increasing. 

Quite an amount of industrial work is being done in the 
primary and lower grades. In the High school two courses are 
in operation. The preparatory fits students to enter college, 
and besides the usual work in other branches offers four years 
of Latin and two years of German as an elective. Three years 
of Latin are required and the tendency to complete the four years 
in this subject is increasing. The academic course is designed 
more for those who intend to teach. It contains more electives. 
Latin, however, must be carried two years. Students who take 
German must continue this subject two years. 

The standard for graduation in either course was raised this 
year to thirty points by additional English being given in the 
tenth and twelfth grades. There are two commodious and well 
equipped laboratories, modern in plan, for work in the sciences. </seg>

Attention is given to rhetoricals in the grades and in the 
High school. A debating society is organized each year and contests 
held with other High schools. Minden has always taken 
an active interest in school athletics, basket and baseball being 
the principal games played. 

A carefully selected library is maintained for the use of the 
entire school. It contains a number of pedagogical works for the 
benefit of the teachers. Additions are made from year to year 
to meet the demands. Funds were raised for this purpose by 
the pupils, assisted by the liberality of the board. 

The board of education is made up of professional and business 
men of successful experience. These men are deeply interested 
in the welfare of the school, careful in the selection of 
teachers, and liberal in providing the necessities for maintaining 
a good school. 

E&gt;y wise management they were enabled to pay this year all 
bonded indebtedness, besides making extensive repairs,

A good school interest prevails in Minden, as well as an excellent 
spirit of harmony among the teachers.

Nebraska City 

I Nebraska City is one of the oldest and most conservative towns 
the state. It grows in wealth and population slowly but surely 
:h year. Its people are strong believers in and warm suprters 
of the public schools. Twelve grades of work are carid. 
The total enrollment averages 1,600, of which as a rule 
&gt;m 175 to 200 are enrolled in the High school. This being 
factory town, the High school is not as large as the school 
pulation would warrant, many going to work in the factories 
er completing the Eighth grade. Many of the graduates rern 
to take additional work and a large contingent each year 
e seeking admission to the State University and other higher 
stitutions of learning. 

In Nebraska City school standards have been high for many </seg>

years. The aim of the present administration is to maintain 
the same high ideals. With this end in view thorough, wellbalanced 
work is done in all the grades. The course of study 
has been modified from time to time to admit that which is best 
in modern educational thought and methods. 

»The teaching force consists of thirty-six teachers, including the 
perintendent. Thirty are employed in the grades and six 
the High school. The teaching force is an unusually strong 
one for a city of this size, nearly all being teachers of several 
ye*ars' experience. The board of education has pursued a liberal 
policy with the teachers, whose tenure of office is secure if they 
perform their duty well. The board recognizing the difficulty 
of securing teachers with proper training have established a 
training school for such of the High school graduates as wish 
to teach. These young people are required to spend a half day 
of each school day of the year in the schools under the direction 
and oversight of experienced teachers. They are required to 
hear classes, draft programs, etc. They are also required to 
take some post graduate work in the High school, to read selected 
works in the teachers' library, and to take work in elementary 
psychology as applied to teaching. Monthly teachers' meetings 
are held at which school problems and other educational matters 
are discussed. 

There are eight school buildings in the city. The High school 
building, while not pretentious in appearance, is commodious 
and well kept. There are excellent facilities offered for good 
work in chemistry, physics, botany, physiology and physical 
geography. The departmental plan of carrying on work is largely 
followed. The High school has a library of about 500 volumes 
and the city public library is situated within a half block of the 
High school. Thus there are excellent opportunities at hand for 
following out the work on broad lines. The teachers in the main 
have a college education or its equivalent. Three courses are 
offered, including music, which is under the charge of a competent 
musical supervisor. The elements of music are taught 
in all the grades. Careful attention is given to both the quality </seg>

N. SINCLAIR. 

Norfolk 

Since my last report, two years ago, I am pleased to state that 
the excellent school spirit manifested by patrons, pupils and 
teachers, has suffered no abatement. Pride in the efficiency and 
principle of public education has become characteristic of the 
people of this city. 

The excellent equipment, fine school houses and good teachers 
are but the reflection of the keen interest the citizenship of our 
city has for our schools. 

Since my last report the bonded and floating indebtedness 
has been materially dimished, and the salaries of the teachers 
and janitors increased about ten per cent. 

The principal change in the course of study has been the introduction 
of music throughout the grades and High school. 
The results are most gratifying, judging by the interest the 
pupils and patrons take in the subject, and by the progress made. 

Our High school continues to grow in numbers, and we believe 
in serious interest. We have been in no way affected by the 
adverse decision of the supreme court in the case of the Free 
Attendance High school law. 

The chief of police of the city has been employed as truant 
officer and his help has been valuable at times, to stimulate the 
persons interested. The law seems to be working satisfactorily. 

A law that I should like to see enacted by our next legislature 
is one defining the authority of school teachers and officers over 
pupils on the way to and from school.

Ord 

The city of Ord has had a steady growth during my four 
years of supervision of its schools. The present season has seen 
the erection of several business houses and about fifty residences. 
The school has had a steady growth, many non-residents beiiig 
enrolled and graduated. The High school has no football team, 
although basketball and baseball are indulged in to a limited extent. 
Instead of athletics considerable attention has been devoted 
to rhetoricals and debates. Every one of the 100 High school 

Eents, debates before the High school each year. Annual des 
have been held with York, Grand Island, Albion, Central 
, Aurora and others. 

(;re has been less than a dozen cases of tardiness in the High 
1 for the entire three years and none the first two months 
s year, and a decreased number in the grades. At the same 
an increase in the average attendance has been noticed, 
ecial effort has been made to encourage our students to 
i the higher institutions of learning. Three years ago I 
'e none of the Universities contained students from Ord. 
then our students have been enrolled in the University of 
aska; Baptist College, Bellevue ; Wesleyan ; York; State 
Normal, etc. 

The common branches are thoroughly emphasized and the 

Eighth grade has been especially strong the last year and this. 
Ord has a population of 2,000. There are twelve grades and 
eleven teachers in the schools. Graduates of 1902, five boys and 
five girls ; 1903, six boys and six girls ; 1904, nine boys and six 
eirls.

The library has been increased about 500 volumes in the past

above has been made possible because of a good loyal school 
spirit, the womans' club, a strong board of education, and the

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S EEPOET 

Plattsmouth 

During the past two years we have been improving our teaching 
force by electing only those who have had several years 
successful experience in the grades to which they are assigned 
or normal training. Wherever possible we have secured those 
having both qualifications. Teachers have been required to attend 
some institute each year. Professional work is carried 
throughout the school year. Beginning this year teachers will 
be required to attend occasionally some Norman school during 
their vacation in order to keep in touch with modern methods 
and catch the enthusiasm of twentieth century educators. 

Two years ago our High school force consisted of two experienced 
and three inexperienced teachers. Today there is but 
one of the latter class and she is a specialist in her department. 
We have very few non-resident students, yet our High school 
enrollment exceeds 175 each year. The class of 1904 consisted 
of eleven boys and twenty-one girls while the present senior class 
shows fourteen boys and nineteen girls. Our High school students 
are prepared for the freshman class of the University, but 
realizing the public school prepares more students for life than for 
college, we make strong the teachers' review during the senior 
year. The wisdom of such a course is being proved as our students 
go before the county superintendent and take their places 
in the rural schools of the country. In all modesty we claim 
we have as thoroughly organized and as well disciplined a High 
school as can be found in the state. 

It would be difficult to find a board of education who take 
a keener interest in all that pertains to the upbuilding of the 
schools. It is a rare thing to have a member absent from the 
regular meeting. They seem to vie with each other in seeing 
who can do the most for the schools with the means at hand. 
Nepotism is unheard of in their deliberations. During the present 
summer over three thousand dollars w,ere expended in remodeling 
the old Central building and in painting and calciming 
every room in the city.

the opening of next year will have an entirely new list for the 
grades. 

i Relieving that the duties of the superintendent are more exsive 
than attending to business and disciplinary matters we 
i r e been systematizing and unifying the work by a careful 
"sonal supervision of the actual school work and by introduc&gt; 
quarterly grade meetings. At the meetings the teachers are 
:ed to take part along specific lines and the work of the quarter 
critically discussed. 

Looking forward, it seems as though our desire to enrich our 
course of study by the introduction of drawing and music is 
in a fair way of being gratified. It is possible that both may be 
introduced next year under a competent supervisor.

Ponca 

School conditions in Ponca during recent years have been 
characterized by steady and substantial improvement. There has 
been a general increase in the wages paid to teachers and an 
increasing degree of care in their selection. Indications point 
to a much smaller number of changes in the teaching force from 
year to year in the future than has been the case in the past. 
The course of study has been carefully revised, and a very complete 
equipment of text and supplementary books provided. 
Within the past year over $140.00 has been spent for pictures 
for school room decoration. In addition to this a considerable 
sum is to be spent this year for the same purpose. About $300.00 
has been spent in the last three years for library books. Each 
room above the first grade has its own library. A thoroughly 
equipped laboratory for the use of the High school science 
classes has been provided. There is a gradual increase in the 
number of teachers employed owing to a slow but steady increase 
in the enrollment and to a desire to do better work by 
keeping rooms from being overcrowded. The steady increase </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT 

in the High school enrollment and in the number that finish the 
course each year are noteworthy facts. The number of tuition 
pupils from the rural districts grows each year. There is a 
constantly increasing interest in higher education on the part 
of the High school pupils. At the present time the High school 
is represented through its graduates in seven institutions of 
higher learning. As may be inferred from the foregoing facts 
there is an excellent school spirit in the town. The general 
upward movement of recent years has received steady and cordial 
support. For its breadth of view and for its liberal and 
sympathetic attitude toward the school the board of education 
is deserving of high praise. 

Feachers' meetings are held every two weeks. Pupils in the 
les take part in rhetorical work once each month ; those in 
High school once e.very three weeks. A considerable amount 
of debating is included in the High school literary work. The 
grades from the first to the fifth inclusive have outdoor reo 
except during the winter months. A beginning is made in industrial 
work in the lower grades. In the primary grades reading is 
emphasized. An effort is made to have the work in English 
strong in each of the twelve grades. The High school carries 
but one course of study. English is carried five times per week 
entirely through each of the four years of this course.

Red Cloud 

Considerable new apparatus has been placed in the school 
during the past two years. Much improvement has been made 
in the science department. New maps, pendant globes, and 
material for supplementary work for the little ones have been 
added to the grades. A healthy school spirit prevails and we 
are pleased to note that the Red Cloud boys remain in school 
longer than in most of the neighboring towns. Seven boys and 
t girls were graduated last spring. The senior class this year 
ibers five boys and six girls. Nearly fifty per cent of our </seg>

ninth grade are boys, while both the seventh and eighth grades 
of the school enroll more boys than girls. 

The greatest improvement since the last report has been the 
improvement in morals and manners on and around the school 
grounds and in the halls and class rooms. The teachers and 
superintendent are particularly pleased with the orderly, businesslike 
demeanor of students and with their earnest application to 
work. 

The city teachers are doing good work in the city reading circle 
this year. The work in pedagogy is a careful study of Radestock's 
Habit in Education. The general culture work of the 
circle is a study of some of the famous artists of the present 
centurv. 

E:neral teachers' meetings are held the first Monday of each

St. Paul 

The condition of the St. Paul city schools is up to the standard 
of education in Nebraska. Many things contribute to their 
strength and efficiency. While perhaps none of these things 
are peculiar to St. Paul, it may be interesting to others to know 
what has helped us in building up a strong school. 

frhe board of education of St. Paul probably has, in length 
service, the oldest secretary in the state. Mr. N. J. Paul is 
at serving his twelfth consecutive term. He has always taken 
leep interest in the schools and, from his long service, knows 
ich of their history, growth, and present working. The board 
made up of successful business and professional men. Two 
mbers have but recently left active work in school superinidence. 


In selecting teachers for the grades the policy is to choose </seg>

only graduates from the Sate Normal or some institution of equal 
rank. A still higher standard is set for the High school. 

The teachers of all grades meet in the superintendent's office 
every Monday evening at four o'clock. This we regard as best 
because it interferes least with the teachers' work. The weekly 
teachers' meeting we regard as an important element in keeping 
the general working of the school unified and in maintaining 
professional spirit and enthusiasm. 

In the early part of the year a day was set apart as "Patrons' 
Day." In the afternoon an exhibit of pupils' work was held 
in the various departments. This was largely attended by the 
parents. The interest it awakened in the parents and the enthusiasm 
it aroused in the pupils made it a most profitable 
undertaking. In the evening an entertainment in which all grades 
were represented was given at the opera house. This served a 
double purpose of adding to the public interest, and putting more 
than fifty dollars into the library. 

In the High school a short bi-weekly program of music and 
addresses make a pleasant feature. This takes about half an hour 
at the usual time for opening exercises. Three or four numbers 
are furnished partly by outside talent, partly by members of the 
High school or the grades. In addition to this the High school 
literary clubs give programs every three weeks. 

Our schools are making a very satisfactory growth in numbers. 
We are trying to keep pace with equipment. Next summer 
will see the erection of a new building to make room for the 
increasing attendance, and to relieve the crowded condition 
of the rooms now in use.

Schuyler 

The school district of Schuyler is divided into three wards 
with a school house in each. In the east ward is a three room 
frame school building accommodating three grades. In the north 
ward is a four room frame building accommodating six grades. 
In the west ward is a thirty thousand dollar brick and stone building. 
This contains eight grades as well as the high school. 
The building is steam heated, ventilated by a gravity system, </seg>

            <seg id="p599">

and is electric lighted for evening gatherings. All the buildings 
are in execellent repair. The west ward building has insufficient 
grounds, but in the other wards the grounds are ample. 

The school has eight grades below the High School, including 
eight and one-half years' work. The semi-annual promotion system 
is used, and pupils are admitted to the High school twice 
a year. 

The salary of teachers depends on the grade taught and on the 
length of service. Salaries in the grades run from $42.50 to $•' 
per month. In the election of teachers only those applicants 
are considered who have had satisfactory Normal training or 
successful experience in other graded schools. 

re High school has two courses, Latin and English, each 
years in length. There is good equipment for science work 
and a fair library. The school takes much interest in baseball 
and in declamation. 

The graduating essay or oration is made a feature in the 
English work. Many of the alumni have taken college degrees, 
some with high honors. There is a large alumni association. 

The board of education is composed of conservative business 
men. As a result the financial condition of the district is excellent. 
The levy of taxes has been so cut that the new revenue 
law will not increase taxes in Schuyler so far as the schools are 
concerned. For the last two years the superintendent has also 
been secretary of the board. The arrangement seems to be very 
satisfactory. 

E. B. SHERMAN. 

Seward 

Among the events of the year in Seward, the building and 
equipping of a new High school building is foremost. Until this 
year the work in all grades below the fifth had been carried on in 
small one room houses scattered about the city. With the new 
building all grades are now concentrated in the two large stractuers. 


No bonds were needed to raise the $13,000 required for the 
construction work and the building is entirely paid for. 

Our work in the grades leads up to a strong English course </seg>

in the High school. Two years of Latin are offered to those 
who desire it. 

Music is taught throughout the schools by a competent special 
instructor who devotes the entire school day to the work. 

I "he teaching force is almost entirely local and has been kept 
to a high plane by the board. 

Twenty per cent of the pupils are in the High school and 
fifteen per cent of the High school pupils are from the surrounding 
towns and country.

South Omaha 

fhe South Omaha schools are still trying to keep pace with 
growth of the city. The last census shows 6,600 pupils of 
k&gt;1 age in the city. Last year 4,906 were enrolled in the city 
&gt;ols, about 600 were found in the three parochial schools, and 
iv of the remainder were distributed among the various industrial 
establishments. 

The schools start the present year with a marked increase in 
enrollment. Just thirty teachers have been added to the force 
during the past three years. Most of the existing buildings 
have been greatly enlarged. In our last report we expressed a 
hope that a new High school might be supplied; it is now our 
privilege to record the fulfillment of that desire. 

The new High school building, which is almost ready for occupancy, 
is in point of size, beauty, and convenience surpassed 
by few buildings in the west. In addition to its twenty-five rooms 
adapted to the various departments, there are rooms for the 
board of education, the superintendent ,the principal, a ladies' 
reception room, a girls' room, and, nestled in between the rear 
wings, out of the way, and at comparatively little expense, an 
elegant bowl shaped auditorium which seats with opera chairs </seg>

one thousand persons. This means much to our High school 
and to the school interests of our entire city. 

The class of 1904 have already set the pace in class loyalty 
by completing arrangements for presenting to the new High 
school, for the main hallway, a beautiful, large statue of Minerva. 

The course of study for the entire schools has been revised and 
printed in compact form. The spiral system has vanished, and 
the resulting benefits are already apparent. 

The four years' work in the High school has been grouped under 
five distinct courses, due consideration having been giver. 
to the relative values of electives and assigned studies. 

The pupils throughout the city are largely interested in their 
work, — Healthful study inside, and vigorous athletics outside. 

A serious case of discipline is almost a matter of ancient 
tory, and we are willing that it should remain so. We favor selfgovernmen 
— by the pupil if possible — by some one else if necessary 
; and the success of the former will be in proportion to the 
certainty of the latter. 

Sutton 

The Sutton schools are in excellent condition. Many improvements 
have been made within the past two years. New desks 
have been added and old ones stained and varnished ; the walls 
have been tinted and the woodwork painted ; cement walks have 
been constructed and the lawn beautified. 

Members of the board of education have been frequent interested 
visitors, and patrons have shown an appreciative concern 
in the work being done. Conditions both within and without the 
school have been almost ideal. 

* Since our last report two art exhibitions have been held and as 
result a number of good pictures have been placed upon the 
walls. Over one hundred volumes have been added to the 
library and the systematic use of library books, briefly outlined in 
our last report, has proven very successful in aiding school 
work along different lines. By a card system now in use the

teacher knows just what each pupil is doing in library reading 
and study. Among the books added during the past year are 
about fifty volumes treating of picture study and nature study. 
These have not only served the purpose well for which they 
were written, but have furnished some excellent material for 
language work. The Prang drawing system was introduced two 
years ago and this year the Prang course in "Art Education" has 
been put in, greatly to the delight of both teacher and pupil. A 
genuine spirit for good work prevails from primary to High 
school. For September of the present school year the average 
attendance and punctuality was above 98 per cent, with teachers^ 
reports showing from ten to fifteen days without absence or 
tardiness. Spelling, arithmetic, English and writing have been 
strengthened in all the grades. 

No energy or time has been wasted in seeking publicity, teacher 
and pupil alike content in the belief that work well done brings 
its own reward. 

E. CLIPPINGER. 

Tecumseh 

During the past two years our energies have been concentrated 
on getting more room in order to relieve the wretchedly crowded 
condition. As a result a commodious, substantial building will 
be ready for use before January, 1905. It will contain the High 
school and grammar school. Our school plant will now not only 
provide for present needs, but allow for a 30 per cent growth. 
Instead of being scattered all over town, it will all stand on the 
same lot and be heated by the same plant. 

In the last two years our principal advancement in school work 
has been in the line of nature study. We discovered that before 
there could be much progress made, the teachers must know 
the subject themselves. For two years we have made this the 
special object of study in our Reading Circle. We directed our 
study first to birds, and as a result we have not only derived 
Seat enjoyment and profit ourselves, but have found how easy 
is to direct the attention of a whole community to a practical </seg>

subject if one is only sufficiently interested and instructed in it 
himself to take the lead. 

Five years' freedom from saloons has told its tale in the general 
tone of the town. mention this because we deem it 
most vital to the general cause of education. The tastes and 
ideals of the people have made evident advancement. More I 
dwellings are being constructed and good walks and lawns ha\e 
replaced the old dilapidated saloon appearance. Five years ago 

some of the best people in town told us that a good lecture c&gt; 
was a positive impossibility. This winter we have a course of 
five numbers costing us over $500. Its financial success is more 
than assured, already. This tells its own tale to those who have 
had experience. Our commencement exercises consist of orations 
by the class, usually lasting about two hours. Last spring every 
seat was sold in the first half hour after opening the board. 

There is still much to do, but we feel that good fruit is resulting 
from the persistent efforts of those laboring in the great cause.

Wahoo 

During the past two years there has been a steady growth 
along all lines in the schools. Two new teachers have been added 
to the corps, one modern four room brick building has been 
erected, a High school gymnasium has been opened, the cc 
of stud)' has been improved, and the standard of teaching and 
scholarship raised. Our schools carry twelve grades of work, 
have fifteen teachers, and enroll about TOO, of which 100 are in the 

High school. About twenty non-resident pupils are in attendance, 
many having been refused admittance the first of the year 
owing to the crowded condition in the High school. 

The aim of the school is to continue conservative, well-balanced 

Frk in all grades. The essentials of the common branches 
constantly emphasized with such additional work in music, 
drawing, and nature study as is consistent with a thorough culture 
education. Special emphasis has been placed on reading, </seg>

penmanship, spelling, and arithmetic. During the past year 
spelling contests were held in all grades above the fifth. A 
decided improvement in spelling in all grades resulted. 

Special work is offered for students capable of doing more 
than the required work, such as parliamentary law, commercial 
law, advanced bookkeeping and business practice, newspaper 
reporting, and advanced composition. Special training is also 
given students who enter the teaching profession upon graduating 
from the High school. A well equipped science laboratory, a 
general circulating library, and briefer reference libraries in 
science, history, and literature are maintained in the schools. 

Fhe board of education has stood loyally back of its teachers, 
has given them every possible personal and professional encouragement 
to do the best work. The teachers have all been 
encouraged to attend summer training schools or otherwise to 
improve themselves in sturdy, professional work, and travel. The 
teachers co-operate heartily and voluntarily with the county 
superintendent in attending Reading Circle sections and county 
associations, in addition to the regular bi-monthly teachers' 
meetings held in the office of the city superintendent. 

Eimong our special school activities are athletics, joint dees, 
and special musical and literary work. All forms of legitimate 
school athletics are encouraged under competent trainers. 
Special musical and literary programs are given in all departments 
during the year. A "Junior Jubilee," a "Senior Frolic,' 
and "An evening with the Eighth Grades" are among some of 
these special programs. A High school lyceum is organized in 
connection with the school and the literary activities of the High 
school are largely carried on in that organization under careful 
supervision. The society hold evening sessions offering social as 
well as literary advantages. 

For two years the teachers of the city schools have promoted 
an educational entertainment course. The course is under the 
direct control of President F. E. Way of the board of education, </seg>

There are at present three brick buildings devoted to school 
purposes in our city; the Central or High school building, the 
North Ward building, and the West Ward building. The n-&gt;\v 
West Ward building is a source of pride to all citizens and patrons 
of our schools. The building was opened with elaborate 
dedicatory exercises on the afternoon of September 5th, of this 
year, Judge Slama of the board of education giving the dedicatory 
address. The building is a handsome two story structure, 
built .of pressed brick, and containing four well-lighted school 
rooms, a principal's room, two spacious hallways, and commodious 
furnace room and basement. A low pressure steam heating 
plant is installed, and the rooms are ventilated by the latest 
improved method. The furniture is all new and up-to-date. 
The building is practically a model four room building for an\ 
city. The cost was approximately $10,000 and in voting the 
bonds for the erection of the building anly thirty-seven votes 
were cast against the proposed bonds. This additional room 
greatly relieves the crowded condition of the other buildings, 
thus offering greatly increased facilities for school work.

»The enrollment is too large for the teaching force, there being 
the grades an average of more than fifty to each teacher. A 
noticeable feature of the enrollment is the large proportion of 
boys. In the High school as many boys as girls are enrolled ; the 
ninth grade having more than twice as many boys as girls. The 
punctuality and regularity of attendance is also noteworthy. 

The school spirit is good, patrons and pupils being interested 
and striving for improvement. The order and the character of 
the school work has shown a decided improvement since the first 
of the year. 

A lecture course of four numbers will be given during the 
year, the proceeds to go to the school library, which already consists 
of nearly four hundred volumes. 

There is the proper harmony and spirit of fellowship among 
the teachers, who show great interest in their work. Desire for 
self-improvement and for improvement of the schools marks 
our teachers. 

Revision of the course of study and an increased teaching force 
are among the contemplated improvements.

West Point 

A few changes in the way of improvements have been made in 
the West Point schools since the last report. The past two years 
have been prosperous ones for our educational system. One of 
the evidences of this prosperity, as well as the spirit of progress, 
is the large, fourteen thousand dollar addition to our High school. 
This has been in demand for a number of years, as the old quarters 
for the High school were inadequate to accommodate the 
number of pupils attending, as well as inefficient in the way of 
lighting and ventilation. The new structure is modeled after 
the most improved methods, and will be occupied about January 
1st, 1905.

ture of our schools.. One room in the addition has been designed 
for this special work. 

We have an excellent High school library of 600 volumes, 
as well as one in the grammar department of 300 volumes. 
This has all been purchased through the efforts of* the schools 
in giving entertainments and by collections on Library day. 
The reading of good books is one of the notable features of the 
grammar room pupils. In addition to enlarging the High school 
library and establishing one in the grades, a number of pictures 
have been purchased for each and every department, so that 
the rooms are well supplied with pictures from the hands of 
the best artists. 

Among our special school activities are athletics .and special 
literary and musical programs. 

Basketball, tennis and indoor exercises are under the direction 
of special instructors and trainers. A gymnasium room is partially 
fitted up and it is expected will be self-sustaining. Frequent 
contests in field sports with neighboring schools have greatly 
added to school interest and enthusiasm. The friendly rivalry 
existing between the two literary societies of the High school 
has greatly contributed to the rhetorical work, and through this 
means the pupils are ably trained to take part in the declamatory 
contests in districts and state. 

The aim of our schools is to do conservative, well-balanced 
work in all the grades. The essentials from the common branches 
are all duly emphasized, and the board is liberal in supplying 
material used in the aids and devices of the latest and 
methods. After leaving the grades and entering the High school, 
the pupils are permitted to choose between the Latin and the 
German course, or they may elect two years from each language. 
Electives in other branches are also permitted, and are only limited 
by the number of recitations the teaching corps is able to 
handle. 

The conservative but permanent progress of our schools is 
no doubt due to the long tenure of positions held by the majority 
of the teachers. Three-fourths of our teaching force have been </seg>

a careful and efficient board of education, who manifest great interest 
in all that pertains to educational work, is the real strength 
and foundation of our progress and improvement. We have 
reason to believe that our improvement in the next few years 
will be greater than in the past.

York 

The last two years have been a period of considerable growth 
in our schools. The increase in the attendance has been almost 
twenty per cent. 

The High school, with an enrollment of 200 pupils, has five 
efficient teachers who do department work. No teacher can be 
elected to hold a position in our High school who does not have 
at least one year's experience and who has not had a college 
education in an institution of recognized standing. 

The High school offers two courses — classical and Germanscientific. 
Each of the courses requires four years for completion. 

A new building is just being completed for the accommodation 
of the High school. The chief features of the building are a 
large assembly room with a capacity for seating 275 pupils, 
a gymnasium forty-five by sixty feet, chemical and physical laboratories, 
and shower and locker rooms for girls and boys. In 
addition to these, there are recitation rooms nicely equipped with 
modern furniture, and a library adjoining the assembly room. 
The whole building, including the old portion, contains thirty 
rooms in addition to some small ones. For the purpose of heating 
and ventilating we have installed what is known as the combination 
furnace blast system, giving almost perfect conditions 
for exercise of the intellectual powers. 

A new departure has been made by organizing the seventh 
and eighth grades into a grammar school. This school is placed 
in charge of a principal and two assistants. Special recitation 
rooms are provided for the teachers who do, in a large part, </seg>

department work. We aim to secure college trained teachers, 
or their equivalent, for this work. 

The minimum requirements for grade teachers are that they 
have one year's experience and, in addition to a four years' High 
school course, one year of college training. 

The great aim of the work at the present time is to increase 
the efficiency of the pupil in the common branches. Kindred 
subjects are indulged in only for the purpose of aiding the main 
line of work.

The University of Nebraska 

This institution continues in a prosperous condition. Its 
growth is steady, its discipline kind but firm, its standards increasingly 
high, and its teaching force, in the branches most 
important to the highest intelligence of the state, larger and 
larger. The chief expansion of its teaching staff since our last 
report has been in the direction of agriculture and the mechanic 
arts, departments in which the state's demand as attested by 
the number of pupils, is greatest. Professors of branches relating 
to agriculture have by their publications and their conduct 
of classes in summer schools exerted much valuable influence 
in launching the teaching of agriculture and nature study in the 
common schols. A new department of instruction, that of Institutional 
History, has just been created and George E. Howard, 
formerly professor of history here, has been recalled and placed 
in charge of the new work. The courses in Forestry, now in 
operation over a year, are proving quite popular, the likelihood 
being that demand for training in this important branch will increase 
in the near future, especially through the operation of the 
afforestation policy adopted by the National government, which 
has already begun to bear fruit within the borders of our state. 

Pursuant to an act of the last legislature, the University has 
purchased and opened at North Platte a large estate composed of 
partly irrigable but mostly non-irrigable land, arable and pasture, 
where experiments will be tried calculated to throw helpful 
light on agricultural and pastoral problems in the semi-arid 
portions of the state. 

A fact of much interest is the closer approach witnessed in 
recent years between the University and the High schools of 
the state. It has long been the theory that the University was 
an integral part of the state's educational system, its cap and 
crown, joining on to the High school, as grades thirteen, fourteen, 
fifteen and sixteen, just as the High school, composed of grades 
nine, ten, eleven and twelve, joins on to the grades below. But 
this theory did not very completely fit the facts so long as full 
High school graduates from fully accredited schools, owing to </seg>

the specialty of many requirements for entering the University, 
often found their qualifications not of the right kind, and were obliged 
to either wait and prepare on a number of required subjects 
beyond those they had already mastered, or else to enter burdened 
with conditions, to be worked off by studying extra time, 
Of late, this cause of friction has happily been in the main annulled 
by increase in the number and proportion of the nonspecified 
items of requirement. There is reason to hope that in 
a few years it will be possible for any graduate of an accredited 
High school providing four years of work, to enter the University 
without condition, irrespective of the special branches which 
such pupil may have pursued. 

The important function of High school inspection, having 
fallen from the able hands of Mr. J. W. Crabtree, recently elected 
principal of the State Normal School at Peru, has been placed in 
charge of Professor T. Morey Hodgman. Prof. Hodgman has 
entered upon his duties with a zeal and assiduity which, it is 
believed, assure his success. 

For the year ending June, 1902, the attendance at the University 
in all departments was 2,289 ; during 1902-3 it rose to 2,560, 
and for the year ending with June, 1904, the figure was 2,513. 
Registration for this year is as yet incomplete, but it will probably 
not fall below 2,600. 

At the University farm a dairy barn has been erected at a 
cost of $11,000, a horticultural building at a cost of $8,000, and 
shops costing 11,020. A new academic building, containing class 
rooms, offices, and library, is now in process of construction at 
the farm, its cost to be $60,000. 

On the University campus thorough repairs amounting to new 
construction have just been completed in the chemical laboratory, 
the entire interior having been remodeled and supplied with 
modern apparatus for laboratory work, the whole costing $21,000. 
A new physics building is nearing completion, the cost of which 
will be $75,000. A new administration building costing $40,000 
will soon be in progress of construction.

State Normal School at Peru 

The State Normal School at Peru had its beginning in a special 
act of the first state legislature held in June, 1867, at which 
time a proposition was accepted from the trustees of the Mount 
t:rnon College, and a small appropriation made for establishing 
State Normal School. The new school opened October 24, 
67, with sixty-five students in attendance, and with a faculty 
consisting of three or four members. From this small beginning 
it has grown steadily for more than one-third of a century ; 
from the 05 students in the first year of its history, there were enrolled 
last year 830 students, representing 65 of the 90 counties 
of the state. 

Pit was the design of the founders to make the Normal School 
part of our public school system, and the purpose for which it 
was established is set forth by the statutes in the following 
words : "The exclusive purpose of this school is the training and 
instruction of persons, both female and male, in the arts of teaching 
and managing schools, and in the principles and practice of 
the various branches of learning taught in our public schools." 
That the Normal School has discharged this important function 
(¦• best shown by the records of the institution, from which it may 
e seen that more than 7,500 men and women have been prepared 
here for better service in the schools of Nebraska. It is gratifying 
to note the increasing demand made upon the school for 
trained teachers. Most of the class of 1904 were elected to good 
positions soon after graduation, many receiving principalships 
and high school positions. 

It will be observed by examining the statistical summary below 
that there was an increase in attendance of 120 in 1903- 

l!'"l over the previous year. The year of 1904-1905 opens with 
a still further increase, the greated difference being shown in the 
Junior class, which is nearly twice as large as the class of last </seg>

J. W. CRABTREE, Principal. 

rcipal Clark's Report to the Board of Education of the State 
Normal Schools, July 15, 1904 

It is the purpose of this final report to review briefly the work 
of the past four years; to present in convenient form an exhibit 
of the condition of the funds, with an analysis of the expenditures 
in the present biennium : and to direct your attention to such 
matters of improvement as demand consideration at this time. 
It is thought that the recapitulation of the various improvements 
made may bring into view the lines of advance in the life of the 
school, and thus prepare for a more just estimate of the possibilities 
of future progress. The detailed analyses of expenditures 
from the various funds show the inadequacy of the appropriations 
for maintenance of the growing school and provide 
the members of the board proper data for an intelligent pnof 
the claims of the school before the coming legislature. No 
recommendations will be made for any action at this time that 
can be left for consideration at a future meeting ; but it is hoped 
that it will be found convenient to make such inspection of the 
buildings and grounds as will prepare for a proper consideration 
of recommendations which the incoming principal may wish to 
make at your next meeting. At the close of my term of service, 
July 31, I will turn over to my successor all the funds and other 
property of the school for which as principal I am now responsible, 
taking his acknowledgement for the same. I will also file 
with him any supplementary report that I wish to make with the 
board at that time. 

Growth of School — The progress of the school in the last four 
years has been very gratifying, and I gladly avail rrr 
of this opportunity to present a general summary of the more 
salient points. Much that is most valuable in the growth of an 
institution cannot, however, be formally expressed, but must be </seg>

felt in intimate contact with the life itself. I must content my 
self with noting some of the outer forms in which the growth 
of the school has manifested itself, hoping that the living forces 
producing these changes may be recognized in their results. I 
wish to disclaim any intention to arrogate to myself all credit 
for having brought about these improvements ; my suggestions 
and recommendations have received careful consideration and 
cordial support from my co-workers in the faculty and the board 
of education. It has been my privilege to participate in the 
active life of the school in this period of its greatest development, 
and I rejoice with all friends of the school in the improvements 
that have been made. 

The improvements may be grouped under a few main heading- 
Library, Faculty. Administration, Material Equipment, Text 
Books, Summer School, Course of Study, and Recognition in the 
State. 

The Library — In comparison with that of four years ago, the 
library of today is practically a new library. From an unorganized 
and uncatalogued collection of books accessible to the students 
but a few hours a day it has developed into a well-organized 
reference library with study rooms open all day long until 
o'clock at night. Instead of one librarian giving but part of her 
time to the work, there are now three librarians directing and 
assisting students in their use of the books. A fine card catalogue 
lias rendered available a wealth of rich educative materials before 
unknown to teachers and students. New stacks have been 
added, providing a place for a large number of books that were 
Ed up in out-of-the-way-places, inaccessible to students and 
:hers; and another large reading room has been fitted up, 
i increased facilities for systematic study. The total number 
volumes has been increased in this period more than thirty 
cent, with a more equitable apportionment of books among 
different departments. Special attention has been given to 
fessional books, until todoy this library is unsurpassed in 
collection of helpful works on teaching for Normal School 
lents. The librarv of the Nebraska State Normal School </seg>


            <seg id="p619">
483 

ranks among the first Normal School libraries in America, not 
only in quality and quantity of its books but also in their usableness. 


The Faculty — It is difficult to describe the changes by which 
the faculty has evolved from a group of temporarily employed 
persons interested only in their particular duties into an organized 
corps of co-workers united in a common cause. The importance 
of the change from temporary hiring to permanent civil service 
appointment cannot be realized without an intimate personal contact 
with the school under the two systems of employing teachers. 
The improvement in the attitude of the teachers toward the 
continued progress of the school is very marked. In the tirsi 
year the paying of salaries monthly replaced the irrational 
quarterly system ; and the adoption last year of an equitable 
salary schedule with provisions for increase of compensation for 
continued service has put a new spirit of permanency into the 
relations of the teachers to the school. The number of instructors 
has been increased to meet the demands of the growing work, 
thus permitting a better organization and distribution of the 
matter of instruction. In the choice of instructors, beginning 
with the important changes made three years ago, care has 
taken, to nominate only such persons as would prove constructive 
forces in the general work of the school : and w&gt; 
a pride in the fact that the faculty of the Nebraska State Ne 
School is not surpassed by that of other Normal Schools of like 
equipment. The gradual development of this faculty from unrelated 
workers in the separate field to active participants in 
all that pertains to the advance of the school has been secured 
through systematically conducted faculty meetings. The faculty 
are growing more and more to be an earnest body of co-workers, 
each studying not only his own subject of instruction but also 
the general plan of organization of the work throughout the entire 
school. 

Administration — A very important development in the matter 
of administration is the installing of a complete system of financial 
records. When I took charge of the school four years ago </seg>

            <seg id="p620">
484 

STATE BETIRIICTBNDKNt'b REPORT 

it was impossible from the records found to determine the condition 
of the various funds, so that I had to obtain the balances 
from the state auditor's books for the opening of a new set of 
books. Today I am able to show through a comparatively simple 
system of bookkeeping and the efficient work of the bookkeeper 
not only the present condition of all appropriation and cash funds 
but also to show in detail the financial history of the institution. 
I regard the adding of a registrar and accountant to the office 
force as a permanent improvement of greatest value to the school. 
For the first time in the history of the school a complete permanent 
system of student grade records is possible. The inauguration 
of the committee system of registering and classifying 
students is another very important advance in the administration 
of the affairs of the school. The advertising is more complete 
and effective, though seriously hampered by inadequate 
appropriation. Ten thousand Summer School announcements 
were distributed directly to those interested last spring, and catalogues 
are being mailed daily to prospective students. 

Material Equipment — In the care and improvement of the 
buildings and grounds there was so much that needed to be done, 
under such unyielding limitations of funds. The heating and 
lighting plant has been reconstructed, with a new dynamo and 
switch-board, and a complete wiring of the main building. A 
new boiler was put in and one of the old ones re-set. A green 
house has been built as an auxiliary to the biological department. 
A temporary physical culture and music room has replaced the 
old lumber room and printing office. Bath rooms and toilet 
rooms have been equipped on each floor of the ladies' dormitory. 
The campus has been enlarged and improved, and brick sidewalks 
have replaced the old board walks. An ice house has been built 
and drinking fountains have been placed in the main school building. 
A system of sewerage has been put in, and the sanitary 
conditions of the Model School rooms have been improved. 
Needed repairs have been made everywhere throughout the building, 
and thousands of feet of new flooring have replaced the long 
neglected floors. New desks and blackboards have been placed </seg>

            <seg id="p621">

in many of the school rooms. An athletic field has been provided, 
and all gymnastic and athletic sports have been placed under 
management of committees. A convenient office has been fitted 
up for the records of the school ; and a new chapel is now in the 
process of erection. All of these material changes and many 
more of minor character are but manifestations of the developing 
inner life of the school. 

Text Books — When I came to the head of the school four years 
ago, I found much dissatisfaction and criticism in the matter of 
text books. It was charged, unjustly I think, in the public press 
throughout the state that the teachers in the State Normal 
School were adding to their own incomes by furnishing books 
to their pupils. The truth of the matter was that members of 
the faculty had sought to protect their pupils from expensive outlays 
for books by ordering such books as they needed in their own 
classes directly from the publishers and selling them to the students 
at the invoice price plus the cost of transportation. To free 
the teachers from unjust accusation I caused all buying of text 
books by the faculty to be stopped and endeavored to secure better 
rates through the local dealers. But this was not satisfactory. 
In a state where text books are furnished free in the public 
schools, this would never remove the cause of complaint; it 
was evident that some approach must be made to free books. 
We now have a completely equipped text book library, whose 
books are rented to the students at the merely nominal charge 
of ten cents for each book for a term of twelve weeks. This 
small rental charge makes the library more than self-sustaining ; 
and when the fund is free from the paying of the salary of the 
text book librarian, which on account of the condition of our 
salary fund has been paid from it during the last year, it will 
slowly reimburse the regular library fund for the money temporarily 
drawn from it. No improvement in the school has given 
more satisfaction to the student body than providing cheap text 
books. Before these books were furnished for renting each student 
was compelled to pay from ten to fifteen dollars a year for 
the books required in his classes; he now pays from $1.20 to $1.50 </seg>

            <seg id="p622">
486 

STATE 8UPIKINTEHDKNT'8 REPORT 

for the same equipment of books. It means, in fact, a saving of 
from ten to twelve dollars a year for each student ; or it may be 
estimated that there was saved to the students attending the 
school in the last year an aggregate sum of more than five thousand 
dollars. 

Summer School — While a summer school was attempted at 
several times in the previous conduct of the school, it has remained 
for the last three years to establish a Summer School 
to meet the conditions in Nebraska within the possibilities of 
the present equipment and the present teaching force. On account 
of the dissatisfaction of both teachers and students with 
the twelve weeks' summer terms of five or six years ago, it was 
thought best four years ago to offer the teachers of the state 
a high class three weeks' Professional Institute, following the 
regular school year of thirty-nine weeks. This Insitiute, in which 
no credits could be made was attended by about 120 teachers, 
who expressed themselves as well satisfied with the work ; but 
they asked that some arrangement be made by which their study 
should count toward the completion of the regular course of 
study in the school. This arrangement evidently did not meet 
the demands and it was decided the following year to provide 
a six weeks' Summer School in which credits could be made. 
This plan has proved successful, the attendance growing larger 
each year. In the term just closed 473 students were enrolled, 
representing the most ambitious and progressive teachers of the 
state ; and the State Normal Summer School is now an established 
fact in Nebraska's educational system. This summer term promises 
to prove a most excellent method of increasing the attendance 
in the regular school year. 

Course of Instruction — The instruction offered by the school 
has been completely reorganized, giving a stronger and more 
practical curriculm. The many "special courses" into which the 
curriculum was formerly divided have given place to a compactly 
organized course of study with provision for elective 
specialization. The "Kindergarten Course," which four years 
ago led to no professional recognition beyond an elaborately en- </seg>

graved diploma, now leads to the regular diploma and life certificate 
upon a course of study equivalent in its requirements to 
the regular course. More thorough work is required in all the 
common granches. special increase having been made in English, 
reading, drawing, music and penmanship. Recognition has 
been given to debating in the regular curriculum, and all forms 
of entertainments and lecture course work are of a higher class. 
The amount of professional instruction has been increased threefold, 
both in the complete course and in the shorter training 
course. Instead of teaching nine or ten weeks in the Practice 
School without previous preparation, the Seniors now teach 
throughout the entire year, preceded by a strong term of observation 
in the Junior year. The instruction in the training course 
has been similarly reorganized. A critical review study of all 
the common branches is required of all candidates for the Elementary 
Certificate, and the professional work extends throughout 
the year. The Model School has been reorganized with a viewto 
making it a first class public school instead of a mere laboratory 
for practicing apprentices. The result has been not only 
better life for the children but also far better training for the 
student teachers. The preliminary steps have been taken for incorporating 
manual training into the regular work of the school ; 
and all forms of physical culture are receiving increased attention. 
A very gratifying element in all this improvement in the matter 
and method of instruction is the growing interest which all members 
of the faculty take in every proposed advance. 

Standing in the State — As a natural resultpfthishealthygrowtli 
of the school, has come its better recognition throughout the 
state. There is a rapidly increasing demand for our trained teach- 
School boards and superintendents make direct application 
to the school for teachers, stating what they want and accepting 
the candidatei/fcelected by the school. Along with this prevailing 
respect for the school among school authorities and partly as a result 
of it, is a growing feeling among ambitious teachers that 
it is advantageous to be a graduate of the State Normal School. 
There has been a steadily increasing attendance of the better class </seg>

of students. The total enrollment in the last year was 830, an 
increase of fifteen per cent over the enrollment of the previous 
year; and the correspondence indicates that the attendance next 
year will be still larger. It is very gratifying to know that the 
school stands higher today in the estimation of the people of 
Nebraska fhan ever before in its history. I have had repeated 
evidence of this in the personal letters from school boards, prominent 
teachers, and prospective students. 

In closing this, my final report, to the board of education I 
desire to express again my appreciation of the encouragement 
and support that have been given me by members ot the board 
of education in my efforts to improve the State Normal School. 
I shall always rejoice in the success of the school. 

Respectfully submitted, 

W. A. CLARK, Principal. 

Nebraska Institution for Feeble Minded Youth, Beatrice 

This institution was established by law to furnish the means of 
education to that portion of the youth of the state not provided 
for in any of its educational institutions. See Sections 1 and 2. 
Chapter 52, Session Laws of Nebraska, 1885. 

For this purpose school rooms are provided and furnished 
with separate apparatus and an efficient corps of teachers maintained. 


It is intended that each child admitted shall receive such degree 
of education as his enfeebled capabilities will permit, the 
training given being on moral, mental, physical and manual lines. 

Where mental deficiency exists, there exists also in most 
cases a deviation from the average normal, moral and physical 
standards, and much time, patience and perseverance must be 
devoted to the improvement and correction of these deviations, 
and go hand in hand with the training and arousing of the 
mental faculties. 

It is not expected that any degree of what is known as higher 
education can be attained, but any progress, be it ever so little, 
is beneficial and will tend to lessen the burden of care and </seg>

responsibility after the school age is passed, thus making each 
individual not only helpful to himself, but useful to others. 
To reach this object manual training is early introduced into the 
curriculum of all modern progressive institutions for feeble minded 
children. 

Our method of instruction is based upon a modification of the 
kindergarten idea as taught by Froebel. Our school children 
are classified much as are the children in the lower grades of the 
common schools, with a regular progression from the lower to 
the higher, although much specialized effort must be made by 
the teacher for each individual. 

No pupil is in the school room more than one-half of each day, 
the rest of the day being devoted to manual or industrial training, 
physical drill and out-of-door recreation, thus securing 
healthy change and variety. 

In deciding upon the school exercises, we bear in mind the 
natural limitations of our pupils. Lessing says : "Education 
can only develop and form, not create." We do not create a 
faculty, but we "draw out" what may not be evident at first, but, 
nevertheless, is there, and it is a question how much development 
is possible in each case. 

As a class the feeble minded have dull perceptions, feeble 
powers of attention, weak will power, uncertain memory and 
defective judgment. It is useless to attempt to arouse these dormant 
faculties by forcing upon them the abstract truths of readymade 
knowledge. The child must be made to do, to see, to 
touch, to observe, to remember and think. 

We utilize to the fullest extent the varied and attractive occupations 
and busy work which are so important a part of the 
modern graphic methods of instruction for normal children. Object 
teaching in its broadest sense is a prominent feature in our 
educational scheme. 

In the lower grades the pupils are taught form and color by 
means of sphere, cube and cylinder, sticks, blocks, pictures, 
flowers, etc., to cut and paste, to perforate and sew, to form 
strokes on slate and blackboard preparatory to writing, to disttn- </seg>

guish one object from two, to articulate distinctly, to speak words, 
phrases and sentences, to sing simple songs by ear, or form habits 
of attention and obedience, to obey commands, to keep time in 
marching, to keep step. In the higher grades the pupils are 
taught to read and write, to know something of arithmetic, 
geography, language, history and physiology, the value of money, 
to tell time, to do free-hand drawing and crayon work, letter 
writing and fancy needle work. 

Nearly all our pupils receive daily systematic physical training. 
Mental awakening generally follows as a direct result of 
increased physical development. The pupil must be closely attentive 
; he must quickly hear and understand ; he must promptly 
execute the command. It is a mental as well as a physical drill. 

Vocal music is taught in classes, and chorus singing comprises 
most of the work accomplished in this line. Our band, 
organized about three years ago, is doing well. Those capable 
are taught to read music by note. 

Certain daily duties are assigned to each boy and girl, anil 
these duties are changed often enough to make each child familiar 
with different kinds of work. 

The boys take great interest in both farm and garden. They 
plow, harrow and cultivate, weed, hoe and rake. Some assist 
the carpenter and engineer, while others do work of various kinds 
in kitchen, laundry and ward. 

The girls do much of the sewing, mending and darning for 
our large household. They are taught to wash dishes, make 
beds, wash windows, clean and polish floors, sweep, dust, wash 
and iron. 

Our Sabbath devotional exercises have been both interesting 
and instructive. In the morning at 9 o'clock the entire school 
assembles for Sunday school, and in the afternoon at 3 :30 for 
an hour's devotion, which is made as non-sectarian as possible. 
The services are led by clergymen from town. 

As the work progresses in wisdom and righteousness we may 
hope that the education of all children, both normal and abnormal, 
may be upon one plane, the right of every human being </seg>

\. JOHNSON, M. D., Superintendent. 

Nebraska School for the Deaf, Omaha 

The Nebraska school for the deaf receives from all districts 
of the state of Nebraska such children as by reason of partial 
or total loss of hearing can not be successfully taught in the 
public schools of the state. 

The school buildings and grounds have been much improved 
in the past two years by substantial repairs. Floors, walls and 
ceilings in halls and dormitories have been renewed in the main 
building and large boys' cottage. All floors, where possible, 
are finished with granite varnish and kept bright and clean by 
polishing with paraffine. This adds greatly to the sanitary completeness 
of our institution. 

During the time we have had charge of the school — now nearly 
four years — we have not had a single death in our institution 
with an average yearly attendance of over one hundred and 
seventy-five pupils. 

The literary department of our school has advanced rapidly 
under the reorganization and methods adopted three years ago. 

Our pupils are bright, intelligent boys and girls. Some can 
talk and read lips remarkably well, and all can write and communicate 
easily with any one who understands the manual alphabet. 
In this connection I would beg to suggest that in all 
public schools the one hand manual alphabet be taught or 
just enough to acquaint every one with its use so that our pupils 
in going out into the world can meet more people who can spell 
to them by use of the manual alphabet. This is no great task. 
Any pupil in our public schools above the fourth grade can 
master the twenty-seven characters of the alphabet of the deaf 
in one hour, and numerals, up to one hundred, may be acquired 
in an equally short time. By giving a short exercise, say twenty 
minutes each week, in the use of finger spelling in our public 
schools, a mass of people would soon find it easy and convenient </seg>

to converse with the educated deaf. Alphatbet cards may be obtained 
by applying to our school, at any time. 

During the present summer we have sent two classes to exhibit 
the work of our school at the World's Fair in St. Louis. Each 
class remained at the exposition a month demonstrating methods 
in vogue in our school and acquainting the public to some extent 
with the fact that our deaf people, when educated, are intelligent 
and as capable of earning their own support as speaking 
people ; and need only friendly courtesy from artisans and tradesmen 
to match results. 

The booths where these classes recited were daily surrounded 
by crowds of interested spectators. Besides these classes, we sent 
school work from both the literary and industrial departments 
of our school. Upon our exhibit as a whole our schoo — the Nebraska 
School for the Deaf — was awarded a gold medal prize. 

A National College for the deaf is located in Washington, 
D. C, and it is the ambition of every deaf graduate from state 
schools to enter this college. It is supported by appropriations 
by the federal government as our institution is by the state. 
It is open to deaf pupils from every state in the union, but only 
to those who are able to pass a rigid test or examination and are 
able to maintain a certain standard of progress and deportment. 
Hitherto this state has had few representatives in this college. 
Indeed the college authorities held our school in light esteem. 
In September, 1903, we sent four of our graduates to this college 
in Washington and the president of the college, Dr. E. M. 
Gallaudet, and his faculty have complimented us highly on the 
thoroughly prepared and well behaved students from Nebraska. 
We are now preparing another class for entrance next fall. We 
can not but feel encouraged that our methods are correct. Our 
teachers and helpers are earnest workers selected because of 
their training or fitness for this work. The industrial and domestic 
departments are in excellent condition. Character building 
as well as the intellectual development of each pupil is looked 
after. On the whole, our school is in good standing, though </seg>

tThe work of this school has not materially changed during 
past two years. Our pupils carry on the work of the public 
doIs from the primary grades through the High school. Of 
rse some variation from the usual methods of the school room 
lade, though not so much as is often supposed. 

Our reading is done by the touch, from matter printed in relief, 
so that our books are very bulky ; the Bible in raised print takes 
up as much space as a good sized library in the ordinary seeing 
print. 

Iuring the past year a special effort has been made to bring 
purpose of the school before the people. The general notion 
lat this institution is an asylum for unfortunate blind people. 
le think of it as a home for the helpless, while many others 
not know of its existence. A considerable number of our

each place an exhibition of the work accomplished in the

care of buildings and grounds ; raise vegetables, etc., etc. For 
such work they get a credit on their bills. Ten or a dozen students 
could not or would not come because either we could not 
give them the work they desired or because we could not promise 
them the amount necessary. The former president, who has 
been so long identified with the college, Rev. D. R. Kerr, D. D., 
accepted a call elsewhere, making it necessary for the vice-president 
to step in and take his place. Dr. Stevenson has had a most 
kindly reception from faculty and students and everything moves 
on pleasantly.

Cotner University, Bethany 

rner University has enjoyed a healthy growth during the 
1903-1904 and has opened the session of 1904-1905 with 
an increased attendance over any other year in its history. The 
institution is out of debt and is raising a fund to improve the 
property. Several hundred trees were added last year to its already 
beautiful campus and grounds. The faculty, consisting of 
sixteen in the college of arts and its related departments, is composed 
of experienced teachers who have, in most cases, spent 
some' time in specializing upon the subjects assigned to them. 
The student body is composed of young men and women of excellent 
ability and character, coming from various states as well 
as from Nebraska. 

RThe building of the Omaha, Lincoln and Beatrice inter-urban 
ctric line through Bethany (one block north of the campus) 
will largely improve the facilities for connection with not only 
Lincoln but other points tribuatry to the school. The suburb 
is rapidly growing. Several buildings have been erected during 
the past year and the prospects of the educational home of Cotner 
are bright. In every way the outlook is encouraging.

very favorable conditions. It has 330 students in the classical 
department and 160 in the medical. A law school was opened in 
October with twenty-three in attendance. The classes of the 
law school are held in the north wing of the medical college, 
pending the completion of a special building which is now in 
course of erection on 18th street, opposite the city hall and court 
house. We are much pleased with the character and quality 
of our students in all departments. Earnest and conscientious 
work is being done. Four courses of lectures in university extension 
work are given at night, between November 1, li&gt;04, and May 
1. 1905, by four professors of the university. They cover logic, 
oratory, ethics, psychology and theodicy. Though these lectures 
are intended mainly for the students of medicine and law, who 
may attend them without charge, others interested in these 
branches may take the whole course, comprising two lectures 
each week for twenty-four weeks, on payment of the nominal 
price of five dollars for the entire course. Another of the university 
professors gives a course of lectures in the medical department 
on moral principles and medical practice. 

I regret very much that circumstances compel us to counte

A work entitled "A Systematic Study of the Christian Religion,"

especially difficult problems on the border land between ethics 
and religion, and thereby create a healthy public sentiment that 
will uphold the highest ideals in our magnificent public school 
svstem. 

r'he past two years have been among the best in the history 
Doane College. The enrollment for the year that has just 
closed was 213 ; in college 111 ; in academy 69 ; in school of music 
and musical organizations, counting none twice, 111; in the department 
of art 10. The last graduating class numbered 19, the 
largest class the college has graduated. 

According to the good old custom, eleven of them presented 
on the commencement stage orations and essays, — thoughtful 
and well expressed. Twelve had taken the classical course, four 
the scientific, three the literary. 

Seven of these graduates received a state teacher's certificate. 

The right to confer a state teacher's certificate dates from 
August 16, 1902. In consequence of this cordial recognition on 
the part of the state superintendent, in accord with recent legislative 
enactments, an increasing number of carefully trained 
college men and women are entering the teachers' profession 
and raising educational standards. 

Within the last two years the music department has been 
greatly enlarged and strengthened. The total number enrolled 
was 199. Other commencements have witnessed to music of 
a high order but at the last, Mendelsshon's Oratorio of Elijah, 
enlisting nearly seventy voices and instruments, surpassed all 
former musical achievements. 

At the beginning of the present year rooms were fitted up with 
writing desks and counters, in which book-keeping is taught 
in a very practical way and special attention is given to typewriting 
and stenography. Because of the crowded rooms the 
college trustees are seriously facing the problem of more buildings. 
Two are greatly needed, a chapel with closely connected 
music rooms and a science hall. The college now has five buildings. 
It has a permanent fund of $168,000 and property, all 
told, amounting to nearly $300,000. 

The college is closely associated with four academies in the

four corners of the state, which are doing excellent work. It 
also stands in very friendly relations to half a dozen denominational 
colleges in the state. These colleges, representing different 
denominations, issue a joint scholarship to all the high schools 
in Nebraska, offering a scholarship having a value of $100 good 
for each of four years, to the high school graduate that takes 
highest rank in scholarship. In these various ways educational 
co-operation is seen to have a large place and educational interests, 
public and private, are being advanced. 

D. B. PERRY. President. 

Grand Island College, Grand Island 

The progress made by Grand Island College during the past 
two years has been in two general directions. 

II) The Material Direction. Several gifts of considerable 
have come, without solicitation, to the institution. A gentle-1 
in Illinois gave to the school $10,000 to meet its accumulated 
ibtedness, All debts are now paid. A gentleman in Iowa 
le a bequest of $10,000 to increase the endowment funds of the 
ege. The endowment funds now amount to $80,000. \ 
tleman in Omaha, moved by his interest in Christian eduon, 
sent for the president of the college and placed in his 
ds $14,000 to assist in building a much needed dormitory. 
I dormitory is now in process of construction. It will accomdate 
one hundred and ten girls, and will have all the coniences 
of a first class hotel. 

Certain citizens of Grand Island have made generous contributions 
towards the library. The alumni have adopted the 
library as the object of their beneficence. Friends of education 
abroad have made generous contributions of books, and especially 
bound volumes of magazines. The library now numbers 
about six thousand volumes. 

t Generous gifts have been made to increase the scientific apratus, 
to equip the gymnasiums, to provide additional pianos 
r the music rooms, and to prepare an athletic field. In addi&gt;n, 
contributions to the amount of $6,000 were made to assist </seg>

            <seg id="p634">

in meeting the current expenses of the college and to extend 
the campus. 

(2) The Educational Direction. There are now in attendance 
hundred students pursuing literary studies. Of these fiftyfour 
are in college classes, and the 'rest are found in academic, 
normal and business classes. 

The faculty now numbers thirteen. It has been the effort 
of the management not only to secure first class instructors 
but to organize the work of the several departments in such a 
way that the teachers will have an opportunity to grow in 
teaching power. 

Last Thanksgiving day the state superintendent of public instruction 
recognized Grand Island College as being qualified to 
grant professional life certificates to teach. The department of 
pedagogy is under the supervision of a trained specialist. A good 
many students are inclined to elect the pedagogical course. An 
effort is now being made to lead the students to apply sound 
pedagogical methods to Sunday school instruction. 

The college courses have been arranged and enlarged thai 
the students who wish to take the first two years of an engineering 
course, or a medical course, can do so in this institution. 

rhe quality of work done in this college may be indicated 
the fact that of the two students from Grand Island Col! 
who took the examination for the Rhodes' scholarship, both 
passed. Not more than fifty per cent from any other institution 
passed successful!}' the same examination. 

&lt; ir'and Island College is now twelve years of age. Its alumni 
are not yet numerous, but nearly all of them are filling responsible 
positions. In the lines of teaching, preaching and business 
they have made marked progress.

enrollment at present date is thirty per cent larger than at this 
time last year. 

The faculty consists of twelve professors and instructors, four 
of whom are ladies. A new dormitory is contemplated during the 
present year. This building will cost in the neighborhood of

year of its school work. It enrolled forty students during its 
first year, and at the close of its second year it graduated four 
young women. Since the last commencement, June 8, 1904, it 
has enrolled about seven hundred and thirty students, its graduates 
from all departments at that time numbering one hundred

of the academy and the college of liberal arts for graduation 
and for degrees are those fixed by the University Senate of the 
Methodist Episcopal church. The school of education is kept 
up to the requirements of the school laws of Nebraska. During 
the year extensive improvements have been made upon the buildings 
and grounds, and a new building was opened at the commencement 
of this school year, which is used jointly by the conservatory 
of music and the school of education. Physical culture </seg>

from the literary course, 3 ; from the advanced normal course, 
from the elementary normal course, 2 ; from the German 
irse, 2 ; from the Scandinavian course, 3 ; from the course in 
inography, 1. Total 19. 

I'inancially the year was fairly prosperous, the income exiing 
the repairs and running expenses by about $1,300. The 
&gt;me from tuition and other fees from students was about 
,000. It is only fair to say that the gain the past year should 
credited to our industries, especially to the farm and health 
i factory. The value of grounds and buildings is estimated 
11 50,000. Amount raised for reduction of debts on the institui, 
$53,229.32. The annual charge for tuition, including fees and 
dentals, is $44.75. The average annual living expenses in 
College Home, including room, board, lodging, laundry, etc., 
bout $100. 

An important feature of Union College is its efforts in behalf 
of industrial education. The means of industrial instruction 
are three : — 

1. The students residing in the College Home, more than 
one hundred in number, are required to perform one hour's </seg>

STATE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS 

"domestic work" per day as part of their tuition. This labor 
is done in connection with the buildings and campus, under the 
direction of a competent foreman. It is changed as often as 
once a month, so as to give the students practice in all kinds of 
domestic work. 

2. Industrial classes are maintained. These consist of bookkeeping, 
horticulture, gardening, blacksmithing, carpentry, cooking, 
domestic science, electrical engineering, floriculture, sewing, 
dressmaking, Mexican drawn work, hydrotherapy, propagation 
of plants, printing, steam engineering, tailoring, etc. These 
classes are conducted by the regular teachers and employes. 
There is no tuition. Much of the work is practice, some of it is 
theoretical, — text book work. These classes are open to all 
students. Seventy-five or more are now voluntarily attending 

3. General labor is carried on. On the farm of 200 acres, in 
the garden and orchards, in the broom shop, bakery, tailor shop, 
printing office, etc., is much general work, which students perform 
in part payment of expenses. Probably twenty-five students 
are working from three to five hours per day in these enterprises. 


The moral influences are good. Tobacco and liquo; :re unknown 
among the students. Disorderly conduct is exceedingly 
rare. We have an excellent class of tudents, and are trying to do 
earnest and thorough work.

ent. 333 : scientific department, 64 ; music department, 22 ; 
elocution department, 19 ; business department, 297 ; shorthand 
department, 39. The college has a regular faculty of fourteen 
and employs additional instructors during the summer session. 
The following regular courses of study are maintained : Preparatory, 
professional teachers', scientific, classical, music, elocution, 
business, shorthand. In addition to these courses the 
following are given each term : For those desiring to prepare 
for any grade of certificates, didactic, literary courses for teachers, 
business course for teachers, vocal music course for teachers, 
physical culture course. Each line of work has its special 
department, special teachers and special facilities. The model 
school is in connection with the ward school of the city schools 
and is continued during the summer session of the Normal. 
Mrs. M. A. Philips, the principal of the school, continues as 
supervisor and principal through this session. In this way, the 
members of our graduating classes have excellent advantages 
for observation and practice school work. 

The library has increased to 2,500 volumes of well selected 
reference books and books for general reading. The Y. W. C. A. 
and the Y. M. C. A. each has a library of its own for the members. 


The science department is well supplied with apparatus ; about 
$M0 was expended last year in additions and improvements in 
this department. Most of the science work is done in the laboratory. 


Two strong literary societies, weekly debating classes, parliamentary 
law classes and lecture courses are maintained throughout 
the year in order that our students may have every advantage 
along these lines. 

A healthier, happier, busier lot f students cannot be found 
than those in this college. These three characteristics — health, 
happiness, work — have been marked features of the N. N. C.

Report of the Inspector of High Schools. 

To the Chancellor and Board of Regents of the University oi 

Nebraska and to the State Superintendent of Public Instruc- 

tion. 

Permit me in making my fourth biennial report to review 
briefly the work of the past seven years, and to call your attention 
to the policy that has been observed. The work of inspection 
formerly done by members of the faculty was placed in the 
hands of an inspector in 1897. The members of the faculty were 
anxious to have an inspector for the reason that they had neither 
the time nor the desire to inspect schools in addition to their 
other work. Public school men insisted on having this work 
done by one person in order to have a more uniform standard of 
inspection. The very pleasant relations that had existed between 
the University and the public schools a few years before 
were giving way to friction in many places. 

Chancellor Canfield had pleased the people of the state wit'.r 
the doctrine that the University was a part of the public school 
system and that as it contained the last four of the sixteen years' 
course, its work should be adjusted to the grades below. The 
idea commened itself to public school men and gained their 
enthusiastic support for the University. This interest in the 
University continued for a time but finally, observing that no 
essential changes had been made by the faculty in Univ.. 
courses or in entrance requirements carrying out the public 
school policy announced over the state by Chancellor Canfield 
and his successor, school men began to question the sinceritv 
of the University in this matter and to find fault with the method 
of dealing with the schools. 

At the time of the appointment of the inspector fully half of </seg>

the leading superintendents of the state were in a more or less 
rebellious state of mind towards the University. The condition 
was considered alarming by those who understood and appreciated 
fully the situation. The University had lost the confidence 
of a number of the leading educators to such a degree that it was 
not certain that complete harmony with the High schools could 
be brought about. There were men who were friendly to the 
University as an institution who had taken offense at what was 
termed University domination and University dictation. These 
men, some of them our own University graduates, claimed that 
University professors, though knowing nothing of High school 
conditions, assumed to dictate what subjects should be taught 
in the schools, how much time should be given to each subject, 
how much ground should be covered in that time, and the way 
in which the subject should be taught. 

It was claimed that impractical directions had been sent to the 
board of education by members of the faculty which had proved 
embarrassing to the superintendent. There is but little doubt 
that certain departments had been over-insistent on having their 
subjects taught in a particular way even to the point of refusing 
to allow credit for work done in any other way. But that was 
far from being the real policy of the University. In many instances 
what was meant only as a suggestion was taken by the 
schools as a demand. The inspector was told by the chancellor 
and the regents to make a careful study of the situation and to 
apply his own solution for the difficulties, striving to harmonize 
the University and the High schools and weld the two parts 
into one system of schools in actual work, as well as theory. The 
action of the faculty soon after this, in conforming entrance requirements 
more nearly to what was actually done in the High 
schools rather than to what was required for entrance to other 
colleges, was an important step, important because it carried 
out the relation that ought to exist between the two parts of the 

system and important in that it was positive proof that the 
University had confidence in the High schools and in the work </seg>

            <seg id="p641">
505 


of superintendents and principals in planning their courses of 
study. 

The policy of the inspector and of the chancellors of the 
University during this time has been to bring about a closer 
organic connection between the University and the other public 
schools and to bring about a better understanding between the 
professors and superintendents. We have taken the view that 
the University is a part of the public school system and can only 
advance as it takes the rest of the system with it. Just as the 
University pulls away from its connections below by entrance 
requirements, so far it fails in performing the mission for which 
it was established and for which it is maintained. If the High 
schools cannot come up to the University, it must go down to 
the High schools and draw them up and with them the grades 
below the High school. It cannot exist as an endowed institution 
usually does for the exceptionally gifted, exceptionally 
trained, or the exceptionally rich. It must meet the schools 
and serve all who come up through them. The University has 
on several occasions taken action increasing the minimum entrance 
requirements so as not to admit students below the Freshman 
year. Each time the pressure has come either from school 
men or from members of the legislature forcing the rule into 
disuse. No such rule can be effective until conditions in the 

state warrant it. 

The standard which must be observed in accrediting schools 
is based on the same principle, that of accommodating the schools 
o fthe state. To school men in the eastern part of the state 
and possibly to many professors the present standard seems low, 
but it can be raised scarcely any without breaking the connections 
between the University and the best schools in certain portions 
of the state. If the minimum number of points for an accredited 
school should be increased by three or four points, Crawford, 
Chadron, and Valentine, all good schools, would be forced off 
the list of accredited schools and the boys and girls of the entire </seg>

            <seg id="p642">
506 

BTATB 8DPKRINTKNDBNT''i KKHOKT 

northwest portion of the state left with no way or reaching the 
University except through private schools. 

The present standard permits High schools carrying three full 
years of High school work in a satisfactory manner to have a 
place on the list. There has been some discussion as to the 
advisability of limiting the list to four year High schools. Under 
no circumstances should that be done. The effect would be disastrous. 
It would increase the number of top-heavy courses of 
study and thus weaken the work of the schools. Better accredit 
three year schools and devise some way of influencing 
fully half the schools now carrying four years to carry only 
three. Such a step would show marked improvement in the 
attainments of pupils coming to the University from smaller 
High schools. 

The matter of dropping a school from the accredited list has 
proved so serious that schools having accidentally dropped below 
minimum requirements, have often been given one or even two 
years in which to bring their work up to the required standard. 
The effect of dropping a school from the list is much the same 
on the school as that of expelling a boy from school is on the boy. 
In almost every instance dropping a school from the list has left 
it not only without the uplifting influence that comes from a 
connection with higher institutions but entirely wanting in local 
interest and pride. Just as a school should be required to maintain 
a satisfactory standard for two or three years before being 
placed on the list, so should it be given ample time in which to 
recover from any temporary set-back. 

The experience of the past seven years shows the wisdom of 
making suggestions to schools as suggestions rather than to 
put the same in the form of directions. The relations between 
flie schools and the department of inspection have become such 
that practically every suggestion or recommendation of the inspector 
is acted upon favorably by the superintendent and the 
board of education. There is a degree of harmony between the 
University and its accredited schools that exists in no other state. </seg>

            <seg id="p643">
STATE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS 

507 

This gives the University an opportunity to become more and 
more a factor in increasing the efficiency of the public schools. 

The change of entrance requirements brings a great many 
worthy High school graduates to this institution who other 
would go elsewhere. Practically every subject taught in the 
High school counts on entrance requirements. The intention 
was to include every subject that ought to be in a High school 
course of study. The requirement of twenty-eight points was 
made so as to require four years' work for entrance to the Freshman 
year. The change also recognizes the elective principle 
in the High school. 

It is less than a step from the present system of entrance requirements 
to that of accepting a good four years' High school 
course as full entrance to the University. Just as there are \ cry 
few restrictions placed on the selection of subjects that lead to 
the bachelor's degree, so should there be few restrictions placed 
on High schools as to what should be in the course of study. 
It is perfectly safe to leave this whole matter with the scli 
except as modifications are made as a result of suggestions 
the inspector. When the required work in Latin was decn 
from four years to two, it was feared that Latin would 
ground in the public schools, but quite the opposite has been true. 
More Latin and better Latin is taught in the High schools than 
was taught before the change. The High schools of the - 
are in safe hands and the more fully superintendents and principals 
are trusted by the University the better it is for both University 
and High schools. 

Why not accept as full entrance a four years' course in 
good High school that contains the seventeen points now 1 
as required points? Then why not accept a three years' High 
school course in a like manner as entrance to within about 
twenty-eight hours (University hours) of full entrance 
record of subjects completed in the High school could be !¦ 
in the pass book as now to aid in registration but not to be 
sidered of special importance in the matter of entrance. That 
would simplify entrance still further. Ft would .1 </seg>

the necessity of a great deal of unnecessary estimating and 
evaluating of credits except in the case of the few who come with 
a part of their preparation from one school and a part from another. 
Even in the exceptional cases, it would usually be just 
as safe to reduce to the basis of years as to reduce to the basis of 
subjects and points. 

High schools have had a remarkable development during recent 
years. The growth has been so general over the state that even 
the University has not been aware of the actual gain from year 
to year. In comparing the work in our High schools with those 
of neighboring states, schools in Nebraska towns having a population 
of 2,000 are stronger as a rule than the schools of towns 
in other states having a population of 3,000 or 3,500. In most 
other states now and then a school stands out but in this state 
the schools are uniformly good. This is because the schools are 
in close touch not only with the University but with each other, 
and because of the extraordinary enterprise on the part of the 
men in charge of the public schools of the state.

Announcement of Result 

The result of the examinations will be made known as 
soon as the committee inspects the manuscripts, which will 
require perhaps about one month. 

Requirements 

Section 5, Subdivision 9, of the School Laws of Nebraska 
specifies the branches required for a professional certificate. 
Applicants who hold a first grade certificate granted in this 
state, will be required to take the examination in the additional 
branches only (see program above). Provided, 
however, that if the applicant's papers indicate a lack of 
scholarship in the elementary branches, the application will 
be rejected. The statutes make no provision for electives. 
Grades from any other source will not be recognized. 

I Applicants must also furnish satisfactory evidence of 
gh character and successful experience in school work, 
jstimonials from persons competent to judge of such 
atters will be required. 

Percentages 

Professional ceritficates will not contain numerical standings 
in the different branches, but a grade of at least 80 
per cent, will be required. 

Professional Certificates Without Examination 

Requirements 

In order to receive a professional certificate without examination 
an applicant must show : 

1. A diploma from a "college or university of good 
standing. ' '

525 


3. Evidence of good moral character and of three years' 
successful experience in high school work in Nebraska. 

By a ruling of the state department, "a college or university 
of good standing" is held to mean one whose course 
of study covers four years of work beyond the ordinary 
high school course. No other diplomas will be accepted 
except upon ample evidence of the requisite additional 
scholarship. (Sec. 4, Subdiv. 9, School Laws.) 

From The Nebraska State Normal School 

Any graduate of the higher course, who shall, tiftei 
graduation, teach two annual terms of schoo.1 of not 
than six months each, or their equivalent, and shall produce 
a certificate of good moral conduct and satisfactory discharge 
of professional duties from the board or boards of 
directors of the district or districts in which the applicant 
taught, countersigned by the county superintendent of the 
proper county or counties shall be entitled to receive an additional 
diploma, good for life. . (Sec. 10, Subdiv. 13 School 
Laws.) 

From Other State Normal Schools 

(See Sec. 1, Sub. 9, School Law.) A diploma from a state 
normal school in another state, when approved by the 
State Superintendent of this state, secures to its holder the 
same rights and privileges in Nebraska as are guaranteed 
under it in the state in which it was issued. 

The applicant must present : 

1. A state normal diploma which grants to the holder 
the right to teach without examination in the state in which 
it is given. 

'2. A. first grade county certificate issued in Nebraska.

except as a matter of record and convenience. .1// 
other certificates, including county, and two-year and three 
year state certificates, must be registered in the office of the 
county superintendent of the county in which the holder 
shall teach, and for such registration he shall pay I \'&lt; 
one dollar, which shall go to the institute fund of such 
county. 

Xo life certificate or normal diploma whatever is valid in 
this State after the holder has allowed three years to lapse 
without following some educational pursuit, unless such diploma 
or certificate has been subsequently endorsed by the 
acting State Superintendent. 

Before endorsing professional cerificates of life diplomas 
which have lapsed, the State Superintendent will 
make strict inquiry relative to the present scholarship, ability 
and probable success of the applicant; otherwise, the 
provision of the law requiring such endorsement would be 
a meaningless form. There must be clear and explicit evidence 
of such qualifications as will in all probability enable 
the person applying to do full credit in the future to the 
certificate or diploma endorsed. Testimonials are required

Suggestions to Candidates 

The following brief statements relative to the scope and 
character of the examinations in the different subjects and 
the preparation required are submitted by the committee. 
They will be found suggestive to those who expect to take 
the state examinations. 

(¦viifral Suggestions 

{So particular text-books will be followed in any subject. 
iv good, modern treatment of the subject will meet the 
juirements. The tests of scholarship will aim, however, 
follow the most approved recent educational thought. 

E'he aim will be to test the applicant's power and his 
wledge of principles. It is a mistake in preparing for 
an examination to crowd the memory with facts and names 
which are retained only until the ordeal of examination has 
been passed. 

While the examiners expect answers as full and elaborate 
as the time allows, it does not by any means follow that the 
value of the answer is commensurate with its length. A liberal 
discount will be made for long, padded paragraphs, the 
whole thought content of which might be condensed into a 
few words. An examination is intended to test the candidate's 
ability to seize upon and 'present clearly the essential 
points of the topic or discussion assigned. 

The neatness of manuscript, knowledge of English grammar, 
and of English composition as shown by papers in all 
subjects will be considered in grading papers. 

E; is intended to make the tests searching and thorough, 
ough not long nor exhaustive. We believe the ambitious 
hers of the state will not be satisfied with examinations </seg>

OUR ILiI.il STRATI( )NS. 

fThe illustrations in this report are fairly representative 
the general appearance and condition of school buildi 
in Nebraska. However, many of the new school build 
erected during the calendar years of 1903 and 1904 are here 
pictured as well as a few of the oddest types in the state 
but a careful scrutiny of all the illustrations with a study 
of statistical table Xo. 6 for the school year ending July. 
1903, or table No. 20 for the school year ending July. 1904, 
will assist one in forming a correct impression of the actual 
material school conditions in Nebraska. Both tin 
and the sod schoolhouses are fast disappearing from the 
prairies of Nebraska. Although our illustrations are believed 
to be fairly representative, they are not all used us 
models for school buildings. In general, however, the school 
buildings erected during the past few years are far superior 
to those of eight and twelve years ago. Nowadays school 
architects and boards of education pay more attention to 
the arrangement of school rooms, their lighting, lieating. 
ventilation and seating, as well as the arrangement of 
closets, halls and cloakrooms, stairways, and exits, than 
formerly. 

The Sutherland Srhoolhouse 

r'his district schoolhouse is located about five miles 
Blair in district No. 20 of Washington county. It 
Sected during the same year as the new Blair high 
hool building from plans by the same architect. 

Kin the perspective we see the north side with six windows. 
id the western! with the entrance in the southwest coiner. 
The pupils face an unbroken east wall, with the strong, even 
light of the north entering from the left, and two smaller 
windows above the blackboard in the rear. Fresh air enters 
through a grating in the foundation wall near the s* 
and is carried by a galvanized iron duct below the floor to 
an opening below the stove, where it is warmed and distributed. 
The foul air passes out through the registu

above. The inlet and the outlet of the air are regulated by 
dampers. There are two rows of blackboard slats across 
the front wall, the upper one for the use of the teacher for 
copies, drills, etc. The teacher, from her natural position 
in the front of the room, may watch the pupils at the blackboard 
in the rear of the room and inspect their work, and at 
the same time "oversee" those at work in their seats. The 
wardrobe extends along the south side, is lighted by four 
Sdows placed high in the wall, and is furnished with sixty 
ble schoolhouse hooks, each with a numbered metal tag. 

Fig. 1, a Model Plan, is the floor plan of this schoolhouse. 

Had the building been located on one of the three other 
corners formed by the intersection of the roads the entrance 
might have been in the southeast corner of the building instead 
of the southwest, and the pupils, after passing through 
the wardrobe, would then enter the rear of the schoolroom, 
and visitors would enter the front of the room from the 
entrance. The sunlight enters this schoolroom in the afternoon 
above the heads of the pupils. A door or window near 
the east end of the wardrobe, in the southeast corner of 
the building, would permit the early morning sunlight to 
stream across the schoolroom through the inner door. But 
this building, though not perfect, is the best country schoolhouse 
in Washington county, and, we belive, in many Nebraska 
counties. It is substantial in construction and beautiful 
in interior finish. 

Since its completion at least two other rural schoolhousc&lt; 
have been erected in Washington county on the same general 
plan, and many more in other parts of the state. 

District School No. 51. Hamilton County 

This beautiful schoolhouse was erected in the summer of 
1902 at a cost of $1400 for building and equipment. As may 
be seen at a glance, the plan of the building is almost identical 
with that of the Sutherland schoolhouse. In the foreground 
of the picture is Miss Alice Rowley's school.

building is very similar to that of the Sutherland schoolhouse 
although the exterior view differs somewhat. In the 
foreground of the picture is the Otto school, as it is called, 
with the teacher, Miss Mame Bradley, and County Supt. 

This handsome brick schooIhoUM was erected in the summer 
of 1901 at a cost of about $1200. It is one of the 1 
rural schoolhouses in Fillmore county. Like the Sutherland 
schoolhouse, it is scientifically lighted and correctly 
ventilated. The pupils face an unbroken east wall, with a 
natural slate blackboard extending from corner to corner. 
The windows in the west wall in the rear of the room, which 
is shown in the illustration, are set high enough to provide 
another blackboard the entire length of that end of the room. 
Along the north side of the building are four long windows 
reaching to the cornice above, and these with the high windows 
in the west wall furnish enough light even on the darkest 
days. This north wall with windows is not shown in 
the illustration. The schoolroom proper is 34 i 24 
with a 12 foot ceiling. The cloakroom is 16 x 7 feet, and the 
vestibule is 8 feet square. 

KThis school house was recently erected at a cose of about 
000. Its interior is similiar in plan to that of the Sutherad 
schoolhouse. 

District School \&lt;i. 53, Pierce County 

The district was organized in 18D± It has never b 
bonded and has never been in debt. CoL Charles W. 
Worker has been director since the organization of th&lt; 
triot, and for several years past his daughter. Miss ( 'on 
a teacher of many years' experience in rural and gr. 
schools, has been in charge. The yard is fenced with woven 
wire and is seeded to blue grass. There is a good barn, a 
flag and flag staff, a cement walk around the porch, and the

Ere been set out by the teacher, the director and pupils on 
bor Days during the past seven or eight years without 
any cost to the district. The walls within are neatly pepered. 
painted and decorated. The school is a veritable sehool- 

fschoolhouses were the only sod schoolhouses 
the county at the close of the last report in .Tuly, li&gt;&lt; &gt;4. 
and the one in district No. 5 has since been replaced by a 
frame building. Some of the best students in Dandy county 
have come out of the old sod schoolhonse in district No. 11, 
and the school there ranks as one of the best in the county. 

Old S&lt;k1 Schoolhouse, District No. 74, Sherman Comity 

This district, commonly known as the Hollister school, 
organized in 1899, and the building was practically the 
last sod schoolhouse in Sherman county where there have 
been five new schoolhouses recently erected, including the 
one in district No. 74. besides one brick schoolhouse about 
four miles from the countv se;it. 

District School No. 1». Frontier County 

Ri cariosity in the shape of a school building was erectmt 
IS'rJ at a cost of $1"). It is not a representative 
house and never was. It was replaced in the summer 
1 by a good frame schoolhouse. Tt contained homefurniture, 
a small wooden blackboard, no apparatus, 
ive and system of ventilation through chinks in the wall. 
There was a door in one side and a window in each of the 
other sides. Nearly all the school districts in Frontier 
county have good frame buildings, old-fashioned perhaps. 
but commodious enough and well furnished. There is only 
one log schoolhouse in existence in that county at present, 
and it is well built and properly furnished.

is modern and the blackboard a natural slate. The 
building is heated with a furnace and ventilated. It con

The Smead system of heating anil ventilating is in use. The 
building contains eight rooms which have been neatly paper 
ed and decorated, as may be easily seen by the interior 
views, which were taken presumably on or just before Patron's 
Daw 

This school building was erected in 1896 at a cost of 
$14,000, including heating apparatus. There are six large 
well lighted rooms and a recitation room. The building is 
heated by means of hot air, with good ventilation. A large 
furnace heats the two east rooms and two smaller funi 
heat the four rooms on the west and the recitation room. 
In the center of the building directly between the other furnaces 
is a cylindrical furnace for heating the halls and furnishing 
the chilnren a place to warm their feet when the 
weather is very cold. The building is also furnished with 
six large, airy cloakrooms. All the schoolrooms are lighted 
from the left and rear.

This schoolhouse was built in 1901 of the finest homemade 
vitrified brick, with blue flint stone trimmings, also h 
grown, and well finished wood work. All the equipment and 
the furniture are quite modern. The building complete 
cost about $12,000. It contains an office, a labratory, a 
tation room, and seven schoolrooms, all well arranged and 
correctlv lighted. The natural slate blackboard

of the neatest, handsomest, most substantial, most convenient 
and commodious buildings in any village the size of 
Table Rock anywhere in the state of Nebraska. 

Xoii-Kesident Pupils, Aurora High School 

In this illustration are the thirty-four non-resident pupils 
who were in attendance at the Aurora high school on Thursday, 
December 17, 1903. Five were absent that day. 

Ki'imanl Public Schoolhouses 

ErVashington county is certainly highly blessed in the 
tter of good schoolhouses. Besides the high school building 
at Blair, erected in 1900 at a cost of nearly $40,000 including 
equipment, there is the model four-room frame 
school building at Fort Calhoun, erected in 1901 at a cost 
of about $6,000, an illustration of which appears elsewhere 
in this report, and the floor plans and description of the 
plans and the building appear in the Seventeenth Biennial 
Report of this department and in district No. 20 of that 
county is the Sutherland schoolhouse, which has been used 
model for many schoolhouses in different parts of the 
state, including at least two others in Washington county. 

In 1903 the village of Kennard, also in Washington county, 
removed its two old one-story frame schoolhouses and 
ted in their stead a beautiful, modern, four-room frame 
schoolhouse very similar in style of architecture, floor plans 
and finish to the new school building at Fort Calhoun. The 
bulling probably cost l&gt;etween $5,000 and $6,000. It contains 
four schoolrooms and an office. It is the only school 
building in Kennard and accommodates the ten grades 
tere . When Arlington erects its new schoolhouse, which 
probably will in the near future, it will be safe to say that 
other county in Nebraska surpasses Washington county 
n the excellence of its school buildings.

lege buildings. The recitation building contains the oAoaa, 
the chapel, eleven class rooms, and seven music rooms; nd 
the dormitory is one of four buildings used for that purpose, 
which are heated with hot water and lighted with 
electricity. 

Bewartf High School 

The new Seward high school building was erected in 
1904 at a cost of about $13,000. The old high school buiiding 
will probably be used for graded school porposi 

Hastings High School 

The new high school building at Hastings is one of the 
finest in the state. Tt will probably cost in exe 
$f)0.()O(&gt;. It is a massive structure with large stone columns 
M) mid decorated, as may be easily seen by the interior view 
and other heavy trimmings. This high school building will 
undoubtedly equal or surpass all other high schools in the 
state in beauty and convenience of arrangement. The old 
Hastings high school building will probably l&gt;e used for 
graded school purposes. It is admirably located and adapted 
for eighth grade pupils. 

Blair High School 

8 This building was erected during the school year 
00 at a cost of nearly $40,000, including the amount expanded 
for site, sidewalks, heating apparatus, and some 
new furniture. "Without these necessary accessories the 
building cost in excess of $30,000. An excellent ile&gt;. 
tion of this building may be found in the Seventeenth Riennial 
Report of this department, pages 349-352. 

South Omaha High School 

The new high school building in South &lt; hnaha now about 
ready for occupancy has been erected at a cost of nearly 
$75,000. There is an auditorium which will seat 1,000, and 
the builning has been provided with all the modern conveniences, 
large classrooms, fine labratories. rest rooms. </seg>

Kaiiimry High School 

This is one of the l&gt;est of the new high school buildi 
iu Nebraska. The plans were drawn by Mr. John Latenser. 
and the building was dedicated with appropriate exeiv 
on the evening of November 18, l!&gt;04. The building eost 
approximately $30,000. 

This illustration is made from the drawing of the arehiof 
the new state normal school building at Kearney. 
as it is to be when completed. The building now under proof 
construction there does not include the two ends or 
wings. Certain modifications from the original sketch and 
plans have become necessary, and it is a difficult matter to 
get a correct idea at the present time of the appearance the 
new building will present when complete. Elsewhere in 
this report there appear illustrations made from photographs 
taken during the construction of the building. The 
part of the building now in course of construction will probably 
be completed in the spring or early summer of 1905. 

&lt;'Ii;i|k-I KuildinK at IViu 

ri'he legislature of L903 appropriated $43,500 with which 
construct a chapel building for the state normal school 
at Peru. Plans were prepared by Mr. Geo. A. Berlinghof 
of Beatrice, and the building was begun late in the year 
1903. It will be completed early in 1905. The basement 
will be used as a gymnasium and the main part of the building 
as an auditorium, seating nearly 900 persons on the 
main floor and 900 or 400 in a gallery which extends ;i 
the rear of the room. 

Kijilnli Grade Graduating Classes 

&lt; )ne of the several principal factors in the improvement 
of conditions in the rural schools is the plan of final examinations 
and graduating or closing exercises for the pupils 
of the country who complete the common school cours* 
eighth grade or year of school work. Certift E the

completion of this work are granted giving fin;il grades 

either of examinations or based partly on examinations and 
partly on class work, entitling the holder t&lt;&gt; admission to 

any high school in the county without further examination. 

But the idea of completion of the eighth grade or 
should be emphasized rather than admission to the ninth 

grade or year (high school.) The subjects for this gradna 

tion should include all the common school branches, with 
ia! emphasis on the pupil's knowledge and use of the 

iish language. The examination should be condui 

and the exercises held under the direction of the countv 

superintendent. The degree of favor with which this plan 

has been adopted and successfully carried out by many

including heating plant. The building is of red pivbrick 
and contains four schoolrooms and an office on the 
first floor and three schoolrooms, a labratory and ¦ reeil ition

Cherry County District Schools 

Cherry county has all kinds of schoolhouses, stone, brick, 
frame, log, and sod. The report of the county superintendent 
for 1904 shows a total of 64 schoolhouses, 49 of- which 
were frame, 8 sod, 5 log, 1 stone, and 1 brick. In 1901 there 
were 40 frame schoolhouses in Cherry county, 10 sod, 5 log.

ruoture, with beautiful scenic surroundings. The school 
house in district No. 74 was built during the year 1904. ami

This institution was founded in 1883 by the Nebraska 
Conference of the Lutheran Augustana Synod of Nortli 
America. On the school campus are four buildings, the 
tild brick," erected in 1883, for twenty years the main 
ilding and now used as a dormitory for men; East Hall, 
erected in 1885, also a men's dormitory; Ladies' Hall, erected 
in 1892, serving the double purpose of dining hall ami 
ladies' dormitory; and the main building, erected in 1

is equipped with the best of furniture and apparatus. 

IMattsmnnth Central School 

The illustration shows the old central or high Bcb 
building at Plattsmouth as remodeled by John La tenser, 
architect, of Omaha. Those familiar with the .old high 
school building with its heavy high tower, fourth story ami 
hip roof, all of which have been removed, will hardly n 
nize the illustration. The main entrance was removed from 
the second story to the first, the front steps and landing removed, 
and additional stairs within provided. Interior 
windows furnish much- needed light and ventilation for the 
rooms of the lower story. The cost of remodeling and repairing 
was about $2,200.

chairs and the small desks beyond are for the use of the 
little ones of the primary grades who were brought in and 
taught by the primary instructor for the benefit of the students 
in the normal school, who sit in the tiers of chair 
the right. This gives our inexperienced teachers an opportunity 
to view the workings of the school as actually 
ried on by an experienced, successful teacher.

This is a rural graded school where two teachers are employed. 
It is located in one of the most thickly settled portions 
of eastern Nebraska and is known as the Weborg

This is a model four-room frame school building erein 
1901 at a cost of about $6,000. Besides the four schoolrooms 
it contains an office. It is the only school building 
in Calhoun and accommodates the eleven grades there. The 
building is properly heated and ventilated by the hot air 
system. The schoolrooms are lighted from the left and 
rear. During the past year a new school building was erected 
at Kennard in the same county as Calhoun from plans 
practically the same as those of the Calhoun school building, 
drawn by the same architect. Illustrations of the old 
and new school buildings at Kennard appear elsewhere in 
this report. 

Morse Bluff Public School 

This three-room school building was erected several 
years ago at a cost of $3,750. Morse Bluff is in district

the main building of the new state normal school at K 
ney. The first photograph was taken late in September, 
1904, and the second one about December 1, 1904. The 
second illustration shows the shape of the blocks of 
crete stone used in the construction of the building. 

We present also an excellent illustration of the building 
} iresented to the state by the city of Kearney for use 
dormitory. This building was known as the Green 
race Flats, and consisted of six flats, each twenty-five feet 
in width. These flats have been repaired and remodeled 
for domitory purposes. 

This building was erected in 1903 at a cost of nearly 
$15,000. It is well constructed and modern in equipment, 
style and finish. There is a large assembly room and a 
recitation room for the high school, and six schoolrooms for 
the grades. The building also contains an office for the 
principal which is well furnished. 

Omaha High School 

( hnaha, the metropolis of Nebraska, very naturally boasts 
of the finest high school building in the state. The 
wing only of the new building is now completed at ;i 
of about $190,000. It was dedicated Saturday, February 
1, 1902, and on the following Monday morning the Omaha 
high school moved into its new commodious quarters. This 
wing contains about thirty rooms, including eighteen i 
rooms, two study rooms, labratories, library, gymnasium, 
office rooms, etc. In place of cloak rooms, 540 double locken 
are provided in the halls, and there are also 12 toilet 
rooms, four on each floor. The building is solid and substantial 
in construction, artistic in exterior appearance, 
beautiful in interior finish, and constructed of the 
material throu shout.
