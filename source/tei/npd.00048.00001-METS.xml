            <seg id="p008">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL State of Nebraska, Legal Department. Lincoln, Nebraska, January 6, 1921. To the Honorable Samuel R. McKelvie, Governor of the State of Nebraska, Lincoln. Sir: Pursuant to law I am herewith submitting a report of my acts and doings as Attorney General covering the period from January 9, 1919, to January 6, 1921. The various doings of this department are sketched in the fol - lowing report according to the general field of work covered : Department of Justice Act For several years last past the affairs of the State's legal department (The Attorney General's Office) were in a more or less choatic condition, seemed to lack a plan of organi - zation, and to be incapable of functioning in an efficient manner. Under the statutes as they then existed, state officers and state departments were permitted to hire spe - cial counsel for their own benefit whenever they saw fit, and at the same time the state was spending a large amount of money for the upkeep of an Attorney General's office with four assistants. The result of this was that when - ever friction occurred between any of the other depart - ments and the Attorney General's office, the other depart - ments hired special counsel often without the slightest need for them, and frequently in obvious violation of sound l </seg>
            <seg id="p009">&gt; 2 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL principles of law, thus resulting in thousands of dollars of claims for legal services being put before the legisla - ture each year by lawyers, who had been employed by the various departments. At the same time this practice com - pletely made impossible any system in the handling of the State's legal business. No one was responsible for the conduct of the State's legal affairs, and frequently cases were lost because the special counsel neglected their duties, or because of conflict between such special counsel and the Attorney General's office. To eliminate these thou - sands of dollars of useless expenditures, and to put some plan into operation, which would centralize the State's legal business, and make someone responsible for its en - tire conduct, I drew a Department of Justice Act. This law, Chapter 205 of the Laws of 1919, provides for the formation of a complete state legal department of which the Attorney General shall be the head and in control, and for which he shall be responsible. This department handles all the legal business of every kind and nature, in which the State is interested or is a party. The different depart - ments of the State Government are forbidden to hire spec - ial counsel, except upon the written permission of the At - torney General or the Governor. The Attorney General's office is given the same power in each county that the County Attorney has, a thing which has long been needed, so that when local officials do not perform their duties, there is someone who can perform them. Under the working of the foregoing Act, it has so far been found unnecessary for any of the departments to hire special counsel. We are working in the utmost harmony with all of them. We have created a department, which consists of nine lawyers, all of whose offices are grouped, and who are therefore in close touch with each other's activities. This has resulted in a great saving of money and an extremely efficient system of trying cases. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 3 Appropriations The present administration received the following ap- propriations : Salaries $ 35,000.00 Incidentals 2,500.00 General Prosecutions 50,000.00 Costs and Judgment Fund .... 18,000.00 Total $105,500.00 We have an unexpended balance in the above funds: Salaries $ 1,066.62 Incidentals 202.97 General Prosecutions 25,020.63 Costs and Judgment Fund ."),450.98 Total $ 31,741.20 The above statements show a marked saving despite the fact that the office has been more than doubled, and de- spite the fact that no money has been paid by other de- partments for special counsel. There will be no deficiency claims this term. Supreme Court Work Under the law it is the duty of the Attorney General to prosecute and defend all eases in which the State is a party in the Supreme Court. A large number are criminal cases, all appealed after conviction in the lower courts. These cases are tried by us partially on the record of the lower court and some of the cases reach us with a fatal error already in the record. Despite this we point to the following results Number of cases won 64 Number of cases reversed 20 Number of cases pending 18 </seg>
            <seg id="p011">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 4 We might mention that each of the above cases required the writing and printing of a brief in support of our posi - tion. Advisory Work It is our duty to act as advisory counsel to every single branch and department of the State Government. The work involved in handling these matters is amazing to one unacquainted with it. We are also charged with advising County Attorneys in regard to criminal matters and mat - ters affecting public revenue. In pursuance of these duties we have given thus far during the biennium 3,500 formal opinions to these departments and officers, besides literal - ly hundreds of letters of an advisory nature. Public Utilities Most of the public utilities in Nebraska during the pres - ent administration have been under the control of the United States Government, and therefore have not been subject to the regulation of or control by the State. We did, however, conduct one proceeding — an injunction against the putting into effect of an order known as the Burleson system of Telephone Rates — which injunction we kept in force for several months, making what has been estimated by telephone men a saving of approximately $200,000.00 to the people of the State. Professional Standards We have taken a most decided stand in favor of the en - forcement of the highest possible professional standards in the State. We are now conducting disbarment proceed - ings against lawyers guilty of illegal practices. We have debarred from practice medical and dental practitioners, who did not have legal qualifications and credentials and have done everything in our power to enforce the highest standards of professional ethics. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 5 Fraudulent Stock Promotions In our capacity as advisor to all of the State Depart - ments, we have kept one man employed with the Bureau of Securities, to supervise the sale of stock and bonds and other securities in the State. We have helped weed out under the "Blue Sky" law literally millions of bad securi - ties, which might otherwise have been sold to Nebraska citizens. We have prosecuted agents for selling these securities without the proper authority, and we are now starting a campaign of investigation into the conduct of the corporate affairs of several other companies, who were licensed to sell their stock by the preceding administra - tions, but who have violated the terms of their licenses and wrecked their companies. Irrigation Litigation The various questions arising out of the rights of Ne - braska citizens to use the water of the Platte and Republi - can Rivers for irrigation purposes are matters which necessitate the most serious attention of thi.* department. The right of the various states to control the water supply of interstate streams is a question which is so far undeter - mined by the Supreme Court of the United States. Ne - braska has a case pending entitled the Western Irrigation District vs. Riverside Irrigation District in the Federal Court at Denver, Colorado. The purpose of this litiga - tion is to test the right of the State of Colorado to de - crease the flowage of the South Platte River across the Nebraska state line. The identical problem presented by this litigation is presented in the case of State of Wyo - ming vs. State of Colorado, now pending in the Supreme Court of the United States. This matter was first pre - sented to the Supreme Court of the United States in 1915 and the case has been ordered to be reargued twice, and is now set for hearing in October, 1921. If the Supreme Court of the United States should sustain the contention of the State of Wyoming in this litigation, then the State </seg>
            <seg id="p013">6 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL of Nebraska may anticipate extensive litigation against the State of Colorado to compel the State of Colorado and various irrigation companies to permit an unobstructed flow of the Platte River across the state line. The legal department is keeping in touch with this litigation, and is working in connection with a committee appointed by the Nebraska Irrigation Association. I have not up to the present time thought it advisable to test Nebraska's right until the Wyoming controversy is settled, inasmuch as they raise the identical issue, but subsequently to that time extensive litigation may be anticipated, if it is de - termined by the Supreme Court that these interstate streams must be let flow unimpaired. Prohibition We have taken a most decided stand for the enforce - ment of the State Prohibition Act. Through most of my administration, we have had two or three men attached to the Department, who have been giving their entire time assisting County Attorneys in handling difficult cases under the Liquor Laws. In pursuance of this policy, ire have conducted approximately five hundred prosecutions under the Liquor Laus, in the great majority of which we have secured convictions. At the time of the coming into effect of Federal Prohibition, threats were made by the Federal authorities for Nebraska that they expected to issue permits to druggists and doctors to sell and pre - scribe liquor. This is permissible under the Federal Law, but in direct violation of the State Law. This depart - ment communicated with the Federal officers in Washing - ton, notably Mr. Roper, Commissioner of Internal Reve - nue. We secured a change in instructions to the Federal officers in this State and were thereby enabled to keep the State Law in force. Lately w^ have joined with twenty - three other states in employing Mr. Charles E. Hughes of New York to represent Nebraska in the Supreme Court of the United States, i.in\ all of the litigation which is necessary to sustain the Federal Prohibition Amendment. </seg>
            <seg id="p014">7 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL We have at all times co-operated with Mr. Gus A. Hyers of the State Law Enforcement Division in the investiga - tion and prosecution of cases involving both the liquor laws and the laws in regard to the stealing of automo - biles. Banking and Insurance The Attorney General's office is the advisor to both of these tremendously important departments. We have given an endless amount of time and energy to the bank - ing department in its supervision and control of banks. In this period of inflation and speculation, the problems confronting the department are complicated, and a wrong solution of them is disastrous. We share in the Bank - ing Department's pride in the fact that, except where a bank has been looted by embezzlement or crime, we have so guided their affairs that there have been no failures. In the cases where there has been failure owing to crime, we have apprehended the embezzlers and are conducting vigorous prosecutions of them. Americanization The last session of our legislature passed a thorough - going Americanization program, in which it declared Eng - lish to be the official language of the State, forbade the teaching of any other language to young children, abol - ished the foreign language school for young children, stopped foreign language public meetings, and raised ma - terially the educational standards of the State. These laws, notably the "Siman Act," it was our duty to sus - tain and defend, and I am glad to report that the Su - preme Court recently sustained the entire program in almost exact accordance with the interpretations which we had earlier printed and distributed. We have had numerous complaints and inquiries involving these acts, and have stood squarely and firmly for an absolute com - pliance with their every particular. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">8 REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Radical Activities We have given a vast amount of time towards various Red organizations of the country. We have in our office detailed reports of the membership names, purposes, and all of the information about these various organizations, and have conducted such a general campaign against them in Nebraska, that it is now a common saying among their members, "That Nebraska is a good place to let alone." We have laws in Nebraska which prohibit the use of tiie Red Flag, and are proud to say we have en - forced them. Legislative Recommendations Immediately following this report are set forth copies of four letters, which have been sent from time to time to the Governor, covering important phases of prospec - tive legislation and embodied in these letters are the sug - gestions of this department for the enactment of legisla - tive measures calculated to remedy the evils therein set forth. Conclusion I think I may say in all fairness that during the last year and a half the Attorney General's office has had" more perplexing problems and more unpleasant affairs to handle than ever before in the history of the State. The times are unsettled, the public mind inflamed and easily centered upon any seeming misconduct of public officials or private citizens. It has been our duty to un - ravel a great many complicated situations, and to take a firm stand on a host of occasions. We have pushed vigorously and fearlessly all of the matters which have come to our attention without regard to high or low, rich or poor, friend or foe. The principle upon which we aim to operate is expressed in the old motto: "Hew to the line, let the chips fall where they will." CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General. </seg>

            <seg id="p018">Honorable Samuel R. McKelvie, Governor of Nebraska, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. SUBJECT: Blue Sky Law Dear Governor: An adequate system for the control of the sale of securities is to my mind the most necessary step for our next legislature to take, and there is no field of law en - forcement which is fraught with more difficulties. I have carefully watched the work of the present Bureau of Securities. They ought to be very highly complimented on the good they have accomplished. They have weeded out and kept from sale in this state literal - ly millions of dollars of bad stocks and bonds. I think they rank well with the Securities Commissions of other states. I know they have denied dozens of companies who have had permits in other states. The chief charge that is made against them is that they have been slow and that a great many securities have been sold which the Bureau did not approve. The answer to both of these criticisms, I want to say on be - half of the Bureau, is that their equipment is inadequate both as to money and as to size of office force. After acting as counsel to this Bureau for two years, there is no doubt in my mind that a properly equipped Securities Bureau to handle the mass of corporate business in this state ought to comprise at least seventy-five people. If Blue Sky legislation is to succeed, we must realize that some of these people must be high-priced employees. The state cannot afford to put its $150 a month accountants against $10,000 men of large corporations; the state can - not afford to rely on the ordinary system of law enforce - ment (sheriffs and county attorneys), as against the high- 11 </seg>
            <seg id="p019">12 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL salaried attorneys and salesmen of these corporate en - terprises. If the state desires to continue its Blue Sky Law, it must realize that its own equipment for investigation and law enforcement must be of as high a character as that employed 'by the corporations. I do not desire to be placed in the position of assuming to assure that the present type of Blue Sky legislation will act as a cura - tive for existing speculative evils, for it is plainly ap - parent that you cannot legislate sense into the minds of investors. You cannot make the foolish wise by means of a statute. The change in plan which is particularly vital has to do with the later stages of corporate management. We understand that the Bureau of Securities and the Blue Sky Law does nothing except investigate the preliminary organization of a company, and having determined that it is properly organized and that it has some reasonable chance of success, it is their duty to authorize it to sell its stock. That is where our present commission's powers, responsibilities and duties end; and yet, during the last two years, practically all of our bad corporate failures have come about by reason of corporate management long after the Bureau had any control over the company. The stock-buying public are inclined to blame the Bureau. As a matter of fact, they should blame corporate manage - ment. We ought to have drastic criminal statutes deal - ing with corporate directors who, for instance, issue watered stock, who declare dividends on unearned sur - plus, who declare dividends by the simple expedient of raising the book value of corporate property, who sell corporate property to themselves at cheap prices, or who vote to buy property from themselves at scandalous ficrures If the Securities Commission is to continue in exist - ence, it must have some kind of a "follow-up" procedure so that after giving a company the right to sell stock it does not merely turn it loose to be robbed froor the in- </seg>
            <seg id="p020">LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS 13 side by its officers, as it is compelled to do under our present statutes. If the state is going to give its per - mission to the sale of corporate stocks, then the state owes its citizens the obligations to keep some supervis - ory power over these companies. If the Blue Sky Law is to continue, the Bureau of Securities ought to have the same power that the Bank - ing Department and the Insurance Department have, namely, whenever a company is being grossly misman - aged, when its officers are doing everything just short of embezzling the money, the Bureau ought to have power to go into District Court, appoint a receiver and call a stockholders' meeting for the purpose of electing other officers. The Bureau does not have this power, — only the stockholder has it. The stockholder does not dare to assume the responsibility for a receivership. Officers of companies know this. If the Bureau were authorized in the name of the state to ask for receiverships, it would be the most wTiolesome club over a lot of fellows who most thoroughly belong in the penitentiary, but who, by their clever manipulations, have kept just short of the law. I believe that the section of the Blue Sky Law which authorizes the Bureau to Issue licenses to agents to sell stock ought to be repealed. These agents' licenses are most grossly abused by crooked stock salesmen. I think the state ought to retain its power to license and super - vise these agents, but I do not believe that it ought to give them any document which can be used by them as an endorsement of the state. The present agents' licenses contain in large letters the statement that the state does not guarantee the stock which they are selling, but even that does not seem to be sufficient warning. After a most careful consideration of the securities question in Nebraska, and after consultation with a great many citizens from all businesses and professions who are familiar with the way these securities have been sold during the last two years, I want to recommend and very </seg>
            <seg id="p021">14 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL strongly urge the adoption of three separate statutes which to my mind will eliminate the necessity of a Blue Sky Law and which will make the flotation of a promo - tion scheme very nearly an impossibility. First — A statute should be passed repealing the common law rules in regard to agents, making a com - pany which is selling stock the absolute guarantor of the truthfulness of everything which the agent says in the sale of the stock; whether he is telling the truth or not, whether he is exceeding his author - ity or not, a law should be so drawn that when a company sends out an agent to sell stock, the entire assets of the company are back of the truthfulness of every statement that agent makes. Some of our prominent citizens who have indulged in a little pro - motion of late, would not be so free with their en - dorsements of various enterprises if this were law. Second — We should have a statute which places the jurisdiction of all law suits brought to recover money paid for the sale of corporate stock, under a mis - representation by the agent, in the county where the sale took place. As the law now stands, if a deceit - ful stock salesman makes a sale by the use of gross fraud, misrepresentation and deceit, in Custer Coun - ty, for instance, the poor fellow who has been de - frauded must go to the principal place of business of the corporation, generally Omaha or Lincoln, to bring his suit to recover his money. That means that he never brings the suit. The expense, time and effort of instituting such a suit at a long distance from home, before a strange jury, makes it impos - sible. If, on the other hand, these companies kr yw when they sent out an agent to sell stock that they were bound by what that agent said, and that they could be sued wherever he made a false statement, and they knew that hanging over their heads all the time was the possibility of suits in every county in Nebraska, then they would not so freely indulge in </seg>
            <seg id="p022">LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS 15 promotion enterprises that were not strictly square. It would be unprofitable to promote any enterprise with the contingency of these law suits in case the matter did not work out as represented. The fore- going statute is extremely necessary for the protec - tion of the public. Third — I want to draw and strongly urge the adop - tion of a special criminal statute which makes a mis - representation in any way in the sale of stocks and bonds a felony. Our general fraud statutes are rather weak on this point. We ought to have a statute specifically relating to the sale of securities, so that these imported "high-powered" but very low moraled salesmen will find it unprofitable to engage in their deceitful occupation in Nebraska. It also ought to be made a felony to sell stock in Nebraska without a license. Especially do I want to see this crime made a felony so that we can extradite these crim - inals from their winter homes in California and Florida to which they are wont to repair after a sea - son of thievery among us. If these salesmen have hanging over their heads the possibility of extradi - tion from any point in the United States, I do not believe they will find Nebraska a profitable place in which to practice their calling. If these three statutes are adopted, to my mind they will very largely take care of the Blue Sky situation. If, in addition to these three statutes, the Blue Sky Law were amended as I have suggested, 1 think we would have Nebraska doing about all that any state can do to see that a fool and his money are not parted. Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, December 16, 1920. Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p023">16 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Honorable S. R. McKelvie, Governor, State House, Lincoln, Xebraska. SUBJECT : Board of Pardons. My dear Governor: I In connection with law enforcement work during the st two years a great many matters have come to my tention which I believe ought to be rectified by means legislation. To you, as Chief Executive, falls the re - onsibility of making recommendations to the Legisla - re. It is therefore my purpose during the next few ?eks to write several open letters, discussing several lases of state activities, along with my conclusions as what ought to be done. I shall write these letters in e spirit of the utmost friendliness and co-operation, giv - g them publicity so that they may be open to criticism d suggestion, and that we may have before the legisla - re meets, some notion of the public pulse. The first :ter will deal with the subject of pardons and paroles. i Under the provisions of Article 5, Section 13 of the w constitution, which takes effect January 1, 1921, I i a member of the Board of Pardons. Because of that sponsibility, I deem it appropriate at this time to make rtain suggestions as to the procedure that I believe the &gt;ard of Pardons ought to follow, and which procedure statutes ought to be recommended to the next session the Legislature for enactment into law. I believe that e general form of procedure to be followed by the Board ght to embrace substantially the following steps: (1) Every application for pardon, parole or com- mutation ought to be in writing. (2) When such application is filed, the Board ought to set a day certain for hearing on said ap- plication. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS 17 (3) The Board, through its Chairman, ought to be given the power to issue subpoenas for witnesses and to compel their attendance. (4) A service of the notice and day of hearing on every application for pardon, parole and commuta - tion ought to be served upon the District Judge, the County Attorney and the Sheriff of the county from which the convict came. (5) Publication of the date of hearing ought to be made for three successive weeks in a newspaper in the county where the conviction occurred. (6) The Board ought to be given authority to re - quest or to compel every District Judge and every County Attorney, and Sheriff and the Warden of the Penitentiary, to investigate and report in writing their conclusions as to what ought to be done with every such application. There have been numerous instances to my personal knowledge where County Attorneys have made oral or telephone requests recommending the release of prisoners, when I feel quite sure, as later developments show, they would not have made such requests in writing. (7) On the day set for hearing, the Board should meet and in open session review the history of the case, together with any investigations and recom - mendations they have made or may receive. (8) Any citizen ought to be given the right to ap - pear and be heard at this hearing, either for or against clemency. (9) The Board ought to be provided with a re - porter who would make a transcript of the proceed - ings at this hearing, the same as reporters make in District Court, and all of the recommendations, in - vestigations and testimonies that are considered by the Board in regard to said such application ought to be reduced to the form of a single, complete, per- </seg>
            <seg id="p025">18 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL manent record in the office of the Secretary of the Board. The Board ought to be its own judge as to what testimony it will receive. II believe that the foregoing outline of procedure for e Board will make a clean-cut, open record on ea&lt;*h se upon which the Board acts. It will give everybody e opportunity to be heard after reasonable notice, and will place upon the District Judges and County Attor - ys their fair share of the responsibility in these mat - rs. My purpose is to outline these procedural steps so at a permanent record will be made of every case after e manner of proceedings in the courts, and so that it 11 be impossible to misrepresent the doings of the Board. I In addition to the foregoing, I think we ought to have statute carrying a very heavy criminal penalty against \yone who at any time, in any place and m^iny manner, rectly or indirectly approaches or tries to approach or scuss any application with any member of ike Board at may be pending under the provisions of this Act, cept he appear at the time of the hearing and say what has to say in the presence of the reporter. This statute 11 keep the people from taking advantage of all kinds occasions to bring pressure to bear upon the members the Board, and will stop people from making recom - jndations about which they know very little. In the second place, I want to make some suggestions about the indeterminate sentence law. (1) I believe that the indeterminate sentence act ought to be repealed in so far as it applies to all crimes against the person and all attempts at crimes of violence against the person, and to all cases of robbery by force or violence. • ( v (2) I believe that it ought to be made discretion - ary with our trial judges whether they sentence a man under the terms of the indeterminate sentence law or whether they give him a definite sentence. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS 19 (3) I believe that within the terms of the indeter - minate sentence law, the trial judge ought to be al - lowed to fix both the maximum and the minimum sentence so that instead of always sentencing from one to three, or one to five, or one to twenty years, as we do at present, the Judges ought to have the power to sentence from two to five, or three to ten, or ten to twenty. This is the law in several other states and it places more responsibility upon the court. (4) I do not believe the indeterminate sentence law ought ever to apply to second offenders, whether the first offense is committed in Nebraska or else - where. (5) I believe that the statutes should declare that when a man is sentenced under the terms of the in - determinate sentence law, that the maximum of the sentence should be construed as the basic rate so that our prisoners will not feel that they have any right to a release after their minimum time, as they un - doubtedly feel at present. I have made these suggestions about the indeterminate sentence law with a good deal of hesitation. The inde - terminate sentence law is one of our most useful pieces of Social Welfare Legislation. It has been grossly mis - understood and grossly misrepresented. I realize that to repeal it would relieve the Board of Pardons of a great deal of responsibility and criticism. On the other hand, with the amendments w T hich I have outlined, I believe it will retain the possibilities of being useful for Welfare work and at the same time will fix enough responsibility upon the courts that it will make for strict law enforce - ment. I realize that there are a great many theories about the reason for punishment for crime. My own notion is that punishment for crime ought to be primarily based on the theory that the state is punishing as a substitute for the old system of private vengeance. I am heartily </seg>
            <seg id="p027">20 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL in favor of Welfare work among prisoners to a certain point, but I believe we must remember that wherever the punishment which the state meets out is not a fair sub - stitute for what private vengeance would do, the public mind will be dissatisfied with the state's procedure, and the danger of rioting is with us; in other words, welfare work must not, even though successful, be carried to the place where the punishment rendered leaves the public mind with a desire for still further vengeance. tl would be grateful if you would give these matters ar consideration in connection with your recommenda - ns for the forthcoming Legislature. Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, December 11, 1920. Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p028">LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS 21 Honorable Samuel R. McKelvie, Governor of Nebraska, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. SUBJECT: Automobile Head Lights. My dear Governor: The virtual impossibility of securing consistent en - forcement of the State law regulating the headlights on automobiles is called to our attention by the daily press notices of all sorts of accidents and deaths resulting from its non-observance. As I see it, it is impossible for the State to take any active part in the enforcement of this statute as it stands at present. We must rely purely on local officials. I do not believe that any Head Light Law, which relies on local officials, will be a success, not because they do not desire to perform their duty, but because it is impossible for them to make the proper tests and secure the proper in - spection of lights as it ought to be done. It is known to all of us that some of the so-called lens are good and some are worse than none. The best lens can be abused by the use of a high power bulb behind it. so that the fact that a car is equipped with dimmers is not in the least proof that it is not violating the statute. It, therefore, seems to me that if it is the desire of the legislature to work out any uniform policy on this matter, that it must be done through some agency which will handle the situation at its source. I suggest, therefore, that the Automobile Bureau of the Department of Public Works be constituted by law as the State agency to classify all of the so-called automobile dimmers and make a series of studies which will result in the issuance of a classified list showing what lenses comply with the law </seg>
            <seg id="p029">■ REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Ed what candle power bulb can be used with each of ?m so that it wilT comply with the law. Let this list, ?n, be placed in the hands of our peace officers. I, then would place the penalty not only on the motor - ist, but on any person who sells any automobile not equipped with the standard specified light approved by the Department of Public Works. The penalty, then, ought to run against the owner for driving the car not equipped with standard specifications regardless of wheth - er his headlights are on or not. You will notice that both of these statutes which I have suggested will stop the evil before the car gets to the ultimate owner. It will result in our dealers proper - ly equipping the cars before they leave the salesroom, and if they go forth from the salesroom properly equipped, I think we have reasonable grounds to believe that they will stay that way. It is almost impossible to let them go into the hands of the owner without any equipment and then follow the 250,000 owners to see that they all comply with the law. The system that we have at the present time is considerably like the liquor law which would permit a wholesale manufacture and sale but pro - hibit any drinking. Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS November 29, 1920. Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS 23 Honorable Samuel R. McKelvie, Governor of Nebraska, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. SUBJECT: Bureau of Investigation. My clear Governor: May I call to your attention the fact that I believe the time has arrived when Nebraska ought to establish a Bureau of Investigation in connection with the Depart - ment of Justice? You will recall that two years ago I drew, and the Legislature passed a Department of Justice Act fashioned exactly after the manner of the Federal Department of Justice. This has given us the same power in each of the counties as the County Attorneys, a power which we have used very sparingly, but which in a few instances has proven of very great value toward law enforcement. In connection with federal law enforcement, the De - partment of Justice long since found that it must have professional investigators and professional detectives con - nected with it, if it were to find the evidence and work out cases in which it was engaged, and today the United States Secret Service is one of our governmental branches in which we all take a great deal of pride. Nebraska's business has reached that stage where I believe we should have a small force of secret service men. They should not be booze hounds; they should not be policemen; they should not be sheriffs, but they should be detectives fitted for investigation work. In spite of all that I have been able to do, I find that there are certain classes of law enforcement which must be closely supervised and directed by the Attorney Gen - eral's office, namely, the Blue Sky Law, the Banking Law, </seg>
            <seg id="p031">24 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL the Insurance Law, the Anti-Trust Law, and some par - ticularly atrocious crimes of violence. It is impossible to enforce these laws without someone to procure evi - dence, to investigate conditions and to supply material upon which to base our cases. This is not legal work. It is not the business of lawyers to collect evidence in these matters. A man does not need legal training to do it and a lawyer is wasting his time when he does it. A trained investigator would be invaluable. These investigators (and I estimate that we do not need more than four or five) would be of very great as - sistance to local officers. We have demonstrated time and again that a stranger is the only man who can go into some of our towns, "get on the inside of the ring" and do efficient work. I have been employing two American Legion men for several weeks in this connection. They have returned a net profit to the state of more than $50.00 a day apiece in the fines they have collected. !In addition to the foregoing, the Bureau could main - in a Department of Identification. The Bureau could i a great deal of good in providing local officers with Btructions, with information as to means of identifica - &gt;n of criminals. Few states have such a Bureau, but e present Law Enforcement Division under Mr. Hyers is undertaken considerable volunteer work in that con - ation, and I think they have proven beyond doubt that ere ought to be some central office to which all sheriffs e welcome and from which a systematic campaign can directed. We have no such office. I believe such an ice ought to be under the direction of the Legal De - irtment just as it is in the Federal Government, because e Legal Department knows^tyhat it must have to secure nvictions and is better equipped to direct such a Bureau an any other branch of our Government. The reply ay be made that counties already have authority to hire is sort of work done. A short answer is that they don't • it. Since it has become known that I was using a uple of detectives, I have been literally deluged with </seg>
            <seg id="p032">LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS 25 requests from local officials for their assistance. These local men want to enforce the law, but they are so well known that it is impossible. I believe that each County Attorney in the state ought to be vested with the same power in other cases that he already has in connection with the enforcement of the liquor law, that is he ought to have the power whenever a crime is committed to go to that place, hold a hearing, issue subpoenas, compel the attendance of witnesses and compel them to testify for the purpose of making a rapid, systematic, formal investigation of the crime. I realize that this encroaches somewhat on the province of the Grand Jury, but the Grand Jury system is expen - sive and somewhat cumbersome. Most of the situations are not bad enough to justify the calling of a Grand Jury, whereas they do warrant a thorough investigation. I believe that a Bureau of Investigation attached to the Department of Justice with the powers outlined above will provide Nebraska with a central source of law en - forcement, of which she is verv badlv in need. Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, November 22, 1920. Attorney General. </seg>

            <seg id="p066">59 OPINIONS OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 1919-1920 Aliens No alien is permitted to vote or to hold office in Nebraska. To enlist in the militia, an alien is required to have become a full citizen of the United States, by taking out his second papers before he offers to enlist. The Employer's Liability Act extends to both resident and non-resident aliens. Non-resident aliens can only hold real property in this state for period of ten years. Mr. John P. Gavit, 576 Fifth Ave., New York, X. Y. Dear Sir: The Attorney General has your letter 6f the 26th inst, and also another of the same date, in which you submit certain inquiries. 1. Property rights of aliens are guaranteed by Article I, Paragraph 5, of the constitution of this state adopted in 1875. Section 1 of Article VII of the constitution of this state was amended at the November election of 1918, 8o that no alien is permitted to vote in this state for any office or officer. In order to entitle any person to vote in this state, he must be a natural born citizen of the United States or, if an alien, have completed his full naturalization and received his second papers thirty days prior to the date of the election at which he seeks to vote. Non-resident aliens can hold real property in this state for the period of ten years but no longer, at which time they are required to dispose of the same. Senate File 6, passed at the recent session of the legis - lature, prohibits any alien from holding office in this state. Senate File 8 passed at the same session provides that no officer shall appoint an alien to any office or posi - tion in this state. </seg>
            <seg id="p067">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL The amendment to the constitution passed at the No - vember election of 1918 modifies section 3919 of the Re - vised Statutes so that no person, even though he has de - clared his intention to become a citizen of the United States, can enlist in the militia; to enable an alien to en - list now he is required to have become a full citizen of the United States by taking out his second papers before he offers to enlist. The Employers' Liability Act extends to both resident and non-resident aliens; but by an amendment to Section 3663, passed at the recent session of the legislature, reads AS follnWft ' "Compensation under this article to alien dependents, widows, children and parents not residents of the United States shall be the same in amount as is provided in each case for residents, except that at any time within one year after the death of the injured employee the em - ployer may at his option commute all future installments of compensa - tion to be paid to such alien dependents by paying to them two-thirds of the total amount of such future installments of compensation. Alien widowers, brothers and sisters, not residents of the United States, shall not be entitled to any compensation." As above stated, aliens are absolutely prohibited from voting upon their declaration of intention to become citi - zens. The amendment to our constitution which was adopted on the 5th day of November, 1918, disfranchises all aliens who have theretofore been voting on first papers, no matter how many years they have been so voting; and no alien is entitled to take part in or participate in poli - tics in this state. We think this answers your questions fully, and will enable you to compile your laws or views as to the rights of aliens in this state. We are, Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General. By J. B. BARNES, May 28, 1919. Special Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p068">OPINIONS 61 Aliens Aliens are not prohibited from becoming employees of state institu- Board of Commissioners of State Institutions, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen: You call my attention to Senate File No. 6 which has just been passed with an emergency clause and which provides: "That it shall be unlawful for any alien to hold by appointment or otherwise, any public office or official position now existing, or that may be hereafter created under the laws of this state, and any person who shall violate the provisions of this Act shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction shall be punished by a fine not exceeding Two Hundred ($200.00) Dollars, or by imprisonment in the County jail for a period not exceeding sixty days, or both fine and imprisonment." and inquire what persons performing duties in the vari - ous state institutions under your control are amenable to its provisions. In answer to your question I will say that the law only applies to public officers and not to mere employes of state institutions. The Statute classes the following as officers: "The superintendent, steward and physicians of the Nebraska School for the Deaf; the superintendent, steward and physician of the Institu - tion for the Blind; the superintendent, steward, matron and physician of the Nebraska Institution for Feeble Minded Youth; the superintend - ent, chief-surgeon and assistants of the Nebraska Orthopedic Hospital; the superintendent, assistant physician, steward and matron of the Nebraska Hospital for the Insane; the superintendent, assistant physi - cians and steward of a hospital for the insane of Nebraska at Norfolk; the superintendent, assistants and steward of an asylum for the insane at Hastings; the commandant, adjutant, surgeon and matron of the Nebraska Soldiers' and Sailors' Home at Grand Island; the command - ant and surgeon of a branch of the Soldiers' and Sailors' Home within one mile of Milford, Nebraska; the warden, deputy warden, matron, chaplain and physician of the Penitentiary; superintendent and assist - ant superintendent of the State Industrial School; the superintendent, </seg>
            <seg id="p069">62 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL book-keeper and matron of the Girls' Industrial School at Geneva; the superintendent, matron, physician and book-keeper of the Nebraska Industrial Home at Milford, and the executive and medical officers in all state institutions which may hereafter be founded." To the above should be added such assistants, keepers and guards at the State Penitentiary as the Warden and your board may deem necessary. See Section 7308, Re - vised Statutes of 1913. Other persons than those above enumerated who per - form duties at any of the state institutions under your control should be classed as employees rather than officers and do not come under the above quoted provision of statute. In other words, the law does not bar an alien from performing duties in connection with a state institu - tion provided he does not do so as an officer but merely as an employee. Yours respectfully, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General. By GEORGE W. AYRES, February 27, 1919. Deputy Attorney General. Automobiles The County Treasurer shall pay to the state seventy-five per cent of the fees collected by him in connection with the registration of automobile licenses and the furnishing of duplicate plates and numbers therefor and for the duplication of lost plates. Fees paid for the registration of motor-vehicles as provided in Section 15, Article IV, Title VII of Chapter 190, of the Session Laws of 1919, are reduced one-half if paid after July 1. Mr. George E.

Dear Sir: You inquire whether County Treasurers are required to turn in to the state three-fourths of all money collected under the provisions of sections 15, 16, 19 </seg>
            <seg id="p070">OPINIONS 63 and 23 of House Roll No. 299, passed at the last session of the legislature, or whether they are required to turn in to the state three-fourths of the fees collected under the provisions of sections 15 and 16 and all the fees col - lected by them under the provisions of sections 19 and 23 of said act. You inquire also whether it is only the fees provided for in Section 15 of said act that are lessened by one-half if paid after July 1st, or whether the provision for one - half fee when payment is made after July 1st applies also to the fees collected under the provisions of said sections 19 and 23. I will answer your questions in the order in which they are asked: First. It is our opinion that twenty-five per cent of all fees collected by county treasurers under the provisions of any and all sections of said House Roll No. 299 is re - tained by him for the use of the road dragging fund of his county, and the other seventy-five per cent is paid over to the state; that is to say, the county treasurer is en - titled to retain for* the road dragging fund of his county twenty-five per cent of the fees collected by him in con - nection with the registration of automobile licenses and the furnishing of duplicate plates and numbers therefor and the duplication of lost plates, whether such fees are paid under the provisions of section 15, 16, 19 or 23. Second. It is also our opinion that it is only the fees provided for by section 15 that are reduced by one-half if paid after July 1st. The statute in express terms limits the provision for the fifty per cent payment to cases aris - ing under section 15 of the act. Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General. By GEORGE AV. AYRES, July 25, 1919. Deputy Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p071">64 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Automobile Fees No part of the County Road Dragging Fund or of the State Highway Fund can be legally used for the payment of additional help in the county treasurer's office. The County Treasurer is entitled to a percentage on money collected for automobile licenses. Mr. Geo. E. Johnson, Secretary, Department of Public Works, State House, City. Dear Sir: In response to your letter of February 23, the Motor Vehicle Law, Section 16, is clear in its pro - visions that the 25% of the automobile license fees re - ceived by the county shall be used by the county board for road dragging and equipment for road dragging, for strawing, claying or stable littering the roads and for no other purpose. No part of such fund can be legally used for the pay - ment of additional help in the county treasurer's office. Neither can any portion of the State Highway Fund, ob - tained from automobile licenses be used legally for any such purposes. Any additional help in the county treas - urer's office, if such be actually necessary, can be paid from the county general fund only. Section 2439 Revised Statutes, 1913, provides that the county treasurer is entitled to a percentage on all moneys collected by him. Moneys collected for automobile licenses belong in this category, and percentage so collected could be used to compensate extra help. Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General. By MASON WHEELER, February 25, 1920. Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p072">OPINIONS 65 Automobiles It is unlawful for any person under sixteen years of age, to operate a motor vehicle, even if accompanied by an older person. Miss Edith Johnson, Weeping Water, Nebraska. Dear Madam: In answer to your letter of August 8, will say that the language of the most recent law in re - gard to a minor under sixteen years, operating a motor - vehicle, reads as follows: "It shall be unlawful for any person under sixteen years of age ...to operate a motor-vehicle and any owner, dealer. or manufacturer of motor-vehicles, who permits a person under sixteen years of age to operate a motor vehicle shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be punished, as hereinafter provided for violation of the provisions of this article." There is nothing in the language of this section of the statute which makes any difference if a child is being accompanied by an older person, who can or cannot drive an automobile. Certainly, if the older person accompany - ing the child could not drive an automobile, the child would be operating it. On the other hand there might be some question as a matter of fact as to who was operat - ing the car in case the child was accompanied by an older person, who could operate it, and maintained complete supervision over the operation. In that case a court might hold that as a matter of fact the car was operated by the older person and not by the child. I do not know that the matter has ever been tried out in the court, and could not say definitely what would be their holding. My suggestion would be that the best construction to place upon the law is that the handling of a car in any way by a minor under the age of sixteen is a violation of the law. Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General. By CECIL F. LAVERTY, August 10, 1920. Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p073">66 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Banks A Guaranty Fund deposit cannot be reduced by the bank. Hon. J. E. Hart, Secretary, Department of Trade and Commerce, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of February 5th will say that 1 have examined carefully Sections 44 to 48 inclusive of Article XVI, Chapter 190 of the Session Laws of 1919, being the laws relative to the Depositor's Guar - anty Fund, and in my opinion there is no provision made for revising the Guaranty Fund deposit of any bank down - ward except in the cases of new banks which are provided for in Section 46. Section 47 is to be construed as fixing IV2 per cent of the average daily deposits as the maximum amount which a bank is required to have and 1 per cent is the minimum, but the maximum so fixed is to be construed only as ap - plying to the stopping of the 1/20 of 1 per cent levy pro - vided for in Section 46 and not as being the maximum which must be in the fund and above which may be re - mitted. The operation should be this: the fund must be equal to 1 per cent of the average daily deposits; if it falls below this, a special assessment has to be levied to bring it to the 1 per cent. From that point the 1/20 of 1 per cent levy is in force until it reaches IV2 per cent; when it has reached lVfe per cent, the 1/20 of 1 per cent levies cease, but the fund remains as it is at this point until such time as by withdrawal to meet demands caused by insolvent banks it shall be reduced below the IV2 per cent, when the 1/20 of 1 per cent levies will again be in force. But at no time and under no circumstances is there any provision for any part of the fund set aside being refunded to the bank itself. Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General. By CECIL F. LAVERTY, February 10, 1920. Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p074">OPINIONS 67 Banks Unless a bank had received its certificate giving its depositors the bene - fit of the guarantee fund before the passage and approval of Chapter 17. of the Session Laws of 1919, it cannot receive such a certificate until after two years. State Banking Board, State House, City. Dear Sirs: I am writing this as the ruling of the State Banking Board on the question of whether the ap - plications for bank charters which were pending at the time Senate File 244 passed the Senate, are to come in under the old or the new law relating to the guarantee of bank deposits. Senate File 244 provides in substance that a bank shall not be subject to any of the liabilities or receive any of the benefits from the state guarantee fund until it has been in existence and doing business for two years. The question is whether some thirty banks who had applica - tions on file at the time this bill was signed by the Gover - nor with the emergency and became a law, are to receive the benefits of the old law which gives them the guarantee fund protection or whether they will come under the new law and wait two years without the guarantee. My opinion is that they must come under the new law. My reasons are the clearly expressed language of the bill which says: "A Bank • • • which has not been granted the certificate provided for in this section prior to the passage of this act." From the face of the bill it is therefore clear that the legislature specifically cut off from either the obligations or the benefits of the guar - antee fee, banks which had not yet received a charter, even though their application may have been pending. There is nothing unusual about this ruling. It is a clear case of the statute being passed without a saving clause to protect existing causes of action and the law is pretty clear that unless there is a saving clause that the rights are to be determined under the new law. </seg>
            <seg id="p075">68 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL In addition to the legal reasons it is most fitting and necessary to obtain the full effect of this law to hold as 1 have held. The law was passed to protect the deposit - ors in banks. It was passed because of the vast number of new banks which were being formed in communities that already were being adequately served. The result of this would have been that eventually some of the banks in these communities would have had to cease operation. This loss would have come eventually upon the depositors through the guarantee fund. To permit at the last mo - ment thirty new banks to start operations under the bene - fit of the old law, in many cases under the conditions where it would be impossible to eventually succeed, would be to endanger the state guarantee fund, imperil the safe - ty of the depositors in banks protected by that fund and to defeat the purposes of the new law. It is therefore my opinion that unless a bank had re - ceived its certificate giving it the guarantee fund before this bill was passed, that it cannot receive such a certi - ficate until after two years.

Blue Sky Law Corporations organized in the State of Nebraska, prior to the enact - ment of Article XX, Title V, Chapter 190, of the Session Laws of 1919, which are not at this time selling any other stock or securi - ties and who are not increasing their capital stock, can properly amend their articles of incorporation with regard to the business of the company to be carried on, without the approval of the Bureau of Securities. A corporation organized after the passage of the act, cannot amend during the time the corporation is selling stock or other securities, without the approval of the Bureau. Messrs. Scott, Bancroft, Martin and Stephens, 134 So^ LaSalle St., Chicago, III. Attention Mr. J. E. MacLeish. Gentlemen: Replying to your letter of the 23rd in - stant with regard to our interpretation of Section 14 of Article XX, Chapter 190, 1919 Session Laws of Nebraska,. </seg>
            <seg id="p077">70 REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL would advise we have not interpreted this section to ap - ply to corporations except where they have come within the original jurisdiction of this Bureau, that is, corpora - tions organized in the state of Nebraska prior to the enactment of this particular law where said corporations are not at this time selling any other stock or securities, and where they have not and are not now increasing their capital stock, such corporations can properly amend their articles of incorporation with regard to the business of the company to be carried on, without the approval of this Bureau. However, now as to corporations organized in this state after the passage of this act, the situation is a dif - ferent one. The act contemplates the approval of this Bureau upon the incorporation of any and every company properly coming within the purview of the act. See sec - tion 2 of said act for exemptions. This being true it be - comes necessary for this Bureau in the first instance to approve articles of incorporation in order for the com - pany incorporated here to issue its original stock, and after this original authorization has been had and time elapsed thereunder and once the company has ceased sell - ing its stock, we act on the theory that an amendment of the articles of incorporation of such company need not be approved by this Bureau, unless such amendment con - templates the issuance of further stock in this state. The basis for this interpretation being that when we have approved the original incorporation and the purchasers of stock have become interested in the company and the company has ceased stock selling, that thereafter the ori - ginal stockholders who have their money invested have the right to deal with their company so far as may effect only themselves as members of the company. But should any amendment be made during the time the company is selling stock or other securities, it must have the approval of this Bureau. Now summing up the situation, our interpretation is somewhat after the fashion outlined by you as your theory </seg>

TOU VELLE, Blue Sky Law Where a company without a permit to sell securities in Nebraska through an agent, fosters business and interests investors in Nebras - ka, and induces investors to go outside of the state (or investiga - tions, and the investor purchases outside of the state or through the United States mails, the Blue Sky Law is violated. Mr. Arthur C. Thompsen, Attorney at Laic, Omaha, Xebr. My dear Mr. Thompsen: Pursuant to your recent re - quest to the attorney general and to the Bureau of Securi - ties concerning the possible violation of the Blue Sky Law, I would advise as follows : According to the information before me one Phillips entered into a contract with the general agent of the Porter Tractor Company of Des Moines, Iowa, where - under he was to sell stock of said company and for his services he was to receive a certain commission on all stock sales made; that thereafter Phillips made two trips to Edgar, Nebraska, to see a Dr. Woods of that town and to solicit his subscription in behalf of the company for a stock investment: that he described the affairs of the company minutely to the doctor and advised him how the stock was to be sold and then urged him to go to Des Moines to make an independent investigation ; that Dr..

            <seg id="p079">72 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Woods did go to Des Moines, investigated the affairs of the company, was satisfied as to the merits of the invest - ment in stock of the company and then returned to Ne - braska, at which time Phillips again saw him. That the doctor bought $25,000 worth of stock in the company; that Phillips has received part of his commission compen - sation and is now suing for the balance. It is further shown that the doctor stated he would not buy stock in the company if Phillips was to receive a commission for negotiating such sale. Assuming that the foregoing statement is a correct exposition of the facts in the case, I would draw your attention to article XX, chapter 190 of the 1919 Session Laws, and more particularly to the following sections: "Sec. 3. Permits required — Every person, before selling or nego - tiating for the sale of any securities not specially exempted from the provisions of this article, shall apply to the department for a permit in the manner hereinafter set forth." "Sec. 4. Application for permit and accompanying exhibits. — No person either as principal or through brokers or agents, shall sell or offer for sale or, by means of any advertisement circular or prospectus, or by any other form of public offering, attempt to promote the sale of any securities in this state," • • • "Sec. 17. Non-resident sellers of stock — power of attorney. — Prior to issuing or selling any stocks or securities the applicant, if a non - resident of the state, and under the supervision of this article, shall file with the department an irrevocable power of attorney making the secretary of the department the attorney in fact of the applicant and all process issued in this state against the applicant in any section (action) instituted in the county where the cause of action arose, may be served upon said attorney with same force and effect as if such applicant were a domestic company having its principal office in such county." "Sec. 23. Violation — penalty. — Any person within the purview hereof, failing to file any statement required, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be fined not more than one hundred ($100.00) dollars for each day in default. Any person refusing to submit to the examination herein provided shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall be fined not less than one hundred ($100.00) dollars. Any person selling or negotiating the sale of any stock or securities, not herein exempt, without a permit from the department as herein provided, shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor, and </seg>
            <seg id="p080">OPINIONS 73 shall be fined not less than one hundred ($100.00) dollars nor more than one thousand ($1000.00) dollars and the sale or negotiating for sale of such share of stock and each security shall constitute a sepa - rate offense." Paying particular attention to section 4 as above quoted, it seems to me and to the department that this case is squarely within the provisions of said section. You will note that the section uses the expression "at - tempt to promote the sale of any securities in this state," thus differentiating from the case where an actual sale is made. If this case does not come under this section and under this law, then apparently the state might as well refrain from any further attempt to enforce said law, because it will be a very simple matter, entirely practical and possible, for a company to promote the sale of its securities in this state through the efforts and auspices of an "unacknowledged" agent and then when it gets caught, deny the agency and attempt to portray the transaction as an innocent diversion upon the part of said agent. Really I cannot see where there is any grave question as to the jurisdiction or purview of the Blue Sky Law under the circumstances of the immediate case. Here you have the company, through its general agent, fostering this very situation by planting in this state a man who is to make it his business to interest investors in the stock of the company, and after working up interest in such investment request the investor to slip across the state line and satisfy himself as to the investment, either mak - ing his purchase while across the line or through the medium of the United States mails, thus ostensibly creat - ing a sale outside the boundaries of the state, and by - subterfuge and evasion slip through the tentacles of the law. Another point involved here is the fact that this un - acknowledged agent has received part of his compensa - tion for his illegal act, thus to all appearances estopping the general agent of the corporation from denying re - sponsibility for the act. If this unacknowledged agent </seg>
            <seg id="p081">74 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL was not the moving cause and prime factor in negotiat - ing this sale, then why compensate him? Upon what grounds can the agent for the corporation stand in court and with one breath deny responsibility for the acts of a person, and in the same breath retain and accept the fruits and benefits of the acts of this person? and encour - age him to further acts of like nature by means of re - imbursement for the present acts? As an old established principle of agency this cannot be true and the courts are fairly unanimous on this point. For instance, see the 6th volume of the 2nd Dec. Am. Dig. section 426, part 10; Vol. 21 B. C. L. sec. 99 and 104; West Texas Supply Co. v. Donavan, 182 S. W. 425; Hayward Lumber Co. v. Cox, 104 S. W. 403; Fuchs v. Standard Thermometer Co., 144 N. W. 484; Mulford v. Torrey Exploration Co., 100 Pac. 596; Hudson v. Seeley's Specialties Co., 124 Pac. 1051. We have not had time to go into this matter at any length but all I am attempting to do is to give you a general consensus of opinion on the part of this depart - ment and to inform you as to the executive interpreta - tion placed upon this law in this respect. At the present time we have a number of cases of somewhat similar character before us and we have one case in particular which we have drawn to the attention of your county at - torney, Mr. Shotwell, for the purpose of prosecution, and at a later date we expect to have this matter thoroughly briefed. As matters stand we are satisfied that if any individual or collection of individuals attempts to pro - mote the sale or negotiates the sale of any stocks or securi - ties as defined under the Blue Sky act and within the state of Nebraska without being specifically exempted from the operation of the act by virtue of the provisions thereof, or without having a permit from the Bureau of Securities, Department of Trade and Commerce, that in so promoting, negotiating or selling said securities, it is in violation of the Blue Sky Law and subject to its penal - ties. This is true regardless of the fact that any such sale was finally consummated outside of the state where in the first instance the "moving cause" for such sale </seg>
            <seg id="p082">OPINIONS 75 resides within the state and where the "moving cause" was retained for that particular purpose and where the benefits of his acts were accepted and retained by the non-resident parties. In further support of our theory see case of Thomson v. Iowa Travelling Men's Ass'n, 129 N. W. 529 (Neb.). In conclusion would advise that the Bureau of Securi - ties will be interested in receiving a statement in detail covering this transaction if you are in position to give it, as I believe a violation of the law has occurred here, and if so, appropriate action should be taken. Trusting this meets your approval, answers your in - quiry and regretting the circumstances which compel me to refrain from giving you a decisive line of authorities on this case, I am, Very truly yours, G.

Bonds When a question submitted to the voters of a village is the issuance of bonds in a certain amount, the entire issue is void if this amount is beyond the legal limit. George W. Marsh, Esq., State Auditor, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: It appears from your letter of October 7th that the village of Monroe has recently voted an $8,000 issue of lighting bonds, both the ordinance and the no - tice of election specifying the amount of bonds to be is - sued at $8,000. This amount exceeded the 10% legal limit, the amount that the village could legally vote being $4,400. The village now wishes to register the bonds to the amount of $4,400. Although there is some legal authority to the con - trary, in our opinion the entire issue is invalid. The ques- </seg>
            <seg id="p083">76 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL tion submitted to the voters was the issue of bonds in the amount of $8,000, not in an amount "not to exceed" $8,000, and this amount being beyond the legal limit, the entire issue is void. The Supreme Court has so held in the case of Reine - man v. Railroad Company, 7 Nebr. 310, and in holding an entire bond issue invalid because in excess of the legal limit said: "The proposition submitted to the electors was an entirety and indivisible. It exceeded the statutory limit and was therefore wholly unauthorized. The elec - tion was simply a void act conferring no authority what - ever upon the Board of County Commissioners to issue the bonds of the county in any amount whatever." State v. Babcock, 24 Nebr. 640, also holds an entire issue invalid because a portion was in excess of the legal limit C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. v. Babcock, 63 Nebr. 624, holds that where discretion is given to the municipal authori - ties to issue bonds not to exceed a certain amount, bonds may be issued up to the legal limit under such authority. Such was not the case in the Monroe issue, as the ordin - ance provided for a stated amount. The Supreme Court of the United States in Da vies v. Dickinson, 172 U. S. 657, and the Supreme Court of Wis - consin in McGHlivray v. School District, 112 Wise. 354, hold that only the amount issued in excess of the legal limit is invalid, and that the amount within the limit is valid. However, we are governed by the Nebraska cases and it seems that you are correct in your position of refus - ing to register any portion of the Monroe issue. Yours respectfully, CLARENCE A.

George W. Marsh, Esq., State Auditor, Lincoln, Xebr. Dear Sir: The quotation from Simonton on Municipal Bonds, Section 83, contained in your letter of November 3, reading: "When matters are submitted to the voters which the statute does not require to be submitted, in such a case the proposition as to such matters need not be followed, but may be changed at the pleasure of the board authorized to issue the bonds." while supported by the case of Yeasler v. Smith, 1 Wash. 308, sets forth a dangerous principle of. law. We have been able to find no adjudicated cases in Nebraska which support such a doctrine, and we are inclined to think that our courts would rule the other way on a similar proposi - tion. In the case of Tooky v. Omaha, 54 Neb. 370, where a municipality had authorized the issuance of bonds to purchase a site for and to construct thereon a public market, our supreme court held that such bonds could only be used for the exact purpose for which the people voted them, and could not be used for the construction of a public market upon park property already owned by the city. You will notice that this quotation is in ap - parent conflict with the previous part of the section quoted which reads: "And the proposition as accepted by the people must be followed and the provisions of the proposition as submitted and accepted cannot be changed or departed from by either the officers charged with the duty of issuing the bonds or making the subscription or by the legisla - tive body of the municipality, and in case such a change be made the issue of the bonda will be restrained."

In our judgment such a deviation from the proposition submitted to popular vote would jeopardize the legality of the bonds. Besides resting upon an unsound principle of law such a practice savors of a fraud upon the elect - orate, and well merits both legal and popular condemna - tion. Very truly yours, CLARENCE A.

Bounties If a coyote scalp is defaced, and identified to comply with Section 482, of the Revised Statutes of 11*13, so that it cannot again be pre - sented for the purpose of obtaining a bounty, the scalp may be left on the hide. Mr. W. L. Stanley, County Clerk, Central City, Nebraska. Dear Sir: We have your letter asking if it is neces - sary that you as county clerk require the scalp with two ears and face down to the nose to be separated from the hide and destroyed when coyote scalps are presented for the payment of bounty, and if you can, by slitting the ears apart and making some identification mark on the scalps, allow the scalps to be left attached to the hide of the coyote. In answer to this question we quote you Section 482 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 which reads as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p086">OPINIONS 79 "It shall be the duty of the county clerk to give such person or iprsons on receiving said scalps u certificate of the number and kind if such scalps accepted by him for bounty and deface such scalp by utting the same in two parts so as to separate the two ears, and shall ;eep a record of the number and time by him certified and destroyed." It is the contemplation of the law that these scalps when presented for bounty shall be destroyed; but we are satisfied that if the scalp is defaced and identified so that it cannot be again used or presented for purposes of obtaining a bounty, that the scalp may be left on the hide; because in some instances the parties might desire to make a robe or rug of the hide and would like to have the same defaced as little as possible.

A record must be kept in regard to every child so placed in custody. Mr. H. H. Antles, Secretary of Department of Public Wel- fare, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: This department having been asked for an opinion as to the construction of Sections 1, 2, 3 and 4 of Division 11 of Chapter 190 of the Laws of 1919, we pro - ceed to give our views of these sections. Section 1 provides: </seg>
            <seg id="p088">OPINIONS 81 "No person, other than a parent, shall place out, or give the care and custody of, any child, to any person or association, other than temporarily, unless such person shall be duly licensed by the Depart - ment of Public Welfare under such rules and regulations as said de - partment shall prescribe. The department may grant or revoke such license and make or annul rules regarding the issuance or revocation thereof." By this section it is clearly provided that no person shall give out the care and custody of any child to any person or association, unless temporarily, until duly licensed by the Department of Public Welfare. Section 2 provides as follows: "Persons or courts, charged with the care of dependent and de - linquent children, who shall place out, or give the care and custody of, any child, shall keep and preserve a record of the full name and actual or apparent age of such child, the names and residence of its parents, so far as known, and the name and residence of the person or association with whom such child is placed. If such person or as - sociation shall subsequently remove such child from the custody of the person or association with whom it was placed, the fact of such removal and disposition of such child shall be entered upon such record." This section clearly provides that a record must be made in regard to such child who has been placed in the care and custody of any person or association, and the nature of such record is clearly stated in the section quoted. Section 3 provides: "Such persons or courts shall report to the department of public welfare on the first day of each month specifying the matters and things required in the record mentioned in the next preceding section" (which is Section 2). Construing this section we find that a record of the child, its age, its name and its parents and the person or association with which the child is placed is made and given to the Department of Public Welfare. It neces - sarily follows that these reports are not to be destroyed or thrown away but are to be kept by the Department </seg>
            <seg id="p089">82 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL of Public Welfare and they should be kept so as to h available in case it is necessary to ascertain any of thosi facts, and should be given out only on the order of th&lt; court, and it is not necessary to make the same publi unless you are so ordered to make them public by somi court. The provisions of Section 4 are, in substance, that no association incorporated under the laws of any other state shall place in any family home within this state, either with or without indenture or for adoption, any child, with - out first entering into an undertaking to the Department of Public Welfare with such sureties as the Department may require, conditioned that no child having any con - tagious or incurable disease or having any deformity or being of feeble mind or vicious character, will be brought into the state by such society or its agents, and that it will receive and remove from the state any child brought therein which shall become a public charge within the period of five years. No person shall receive to be placed in a home, any child on behalf of such association which shall not have complied with the requirements of the pro - visions of this article. The evident object and purpose of this section is to prevent the placing of children from other states in the homes of persons residing in this state unless they are free from contagious and incurable dis - ease and have no deformity and are not feeble minded, or of vicious character. The requirements of this section are clear and easy to understand, and we assume that they will require no construction or interpretation.

This law is a radical departure from the previous law of our state in regard to these matters. This law was passed by the legislature after the most serious considera - tion and a great deal of time and attention had been given to its preparation. AVe are all aware that during the past several years the law of this state relating to the sale of cigarettes was repeatedly broken; repeated prosecutions were brought under the law; but owing to a pretty general public senti - ment on the matter it was very difficult to secure convic - tions. Under this new law, House Roll 297, the sale of cigarettes by licensed dealers is permitted to people over the age of twenty-one years. This law was passed by the legislature in the firm belief that by making lawful the sale to persons of older years, it would be more easy to secure convictions against dealers who sell cigarettes to minors. I am very anxious that a most strict enforcement of the law be made, and I recommend to your earnest con - sideration the immediate prosecution of any persons with - in this state who are guilty of selling or of giving away cigarettes, cigars or tobacco to persons under the age of twenty-one years. It seems to me that under this new statute which per - mits the sale of cigarettes to adults, we ought to have the united support and co-operation of all law-abiding citizens in our earnest endeavor to prevent the sale of these things to people of tender years, to whom, there seems to be little question, they prove .a mental and physical deterrent.

Dear Sir: You say that prior to the recent primary city election in the city of Kearney three men announced themselves as candidates for the office of city commis - sioners and took the necessary steps to get their names printed on the primary ballot and that at the primary elec - tion the names of other parties were written in on the ballot by the electors. You inquire whether the names thus written in are entitled to a place on the official ballot for the general city election. The question which you ask has not been passed upon directly by our supreme court and may therefore be said to be not entirely free from doubt. I am of the opinion, however, that the six names, either printed or written in on the primary ballot receiving the highest number of votes at the primary election are entitled to places on the official ballot for the general city election. Section 5293, Revised Statutes of 1913, designates certain requi - sites of the primary ballot used in the nomination of City Commissioners and says further: "In all other respects the general character of the paper ballot to be used shall be the same as authorized by the Australian Ballot Law of the State." Section 1995, Revised Statutes of 1913, which is a part of the "Australian Ballot Law" provides among other things : "A blank space shall be provided into which electors may write the name of any person for whom they wish to vote and whose name is not printed on the ballot."

Our understanding is that sometime in December, 1917, Saunders County contracted with the Central Bridge and Construction Company of Wahoo, Nebraska, for the erec - tion of bridges and culverts during the year 1918; that these bridges were built and that the total amount thereof aggregated about $75,000; that the county did not have sufficient funds on hand to pay for the same and attempted during the year 1919 to make a levy of five mills in ad - dition to the regular fifteen mill levy, without a vote of the taxpayers, under the provisions of Chapter 26 of the Laws of Nebraska for 1919, for the purpose of paying these claims; that actions were subsequently brought, two of them in fact, one in the nature of an injunction action, and the other an appeal from the decision of the Board in allowing the claim and in making the levy. The case involving the question of the validity of the levy finally reached the Supreme Court of the State of Nebraska and was decided on April 17, 1920, being the case of Beadle v. Sanders, 177 N. W., 789. In this case the Supreme Court held that the five mill levy in excess of the fifteen mills (regular levy) was void. Its further holdings in this will be subsequently considered. In the other case, upon appeal to the District Court from the decision of the County Commissioners allowing claims for work done, the court held that the claims were </seg>
            <seg id="p094">OPINIONS 87 properly allowed and sustained the holding of the Com - missioners, rendering judgment against the county in a sum of something over $50,000. That case was decided in the District Court of Saunders County on July 15, 1920. The intervening taxpayers in that case are now attempt - ing to appeal to the Supreme Court of the State of Ne - braska. Our understanding is that they have filed a bond which provides merely that they will pay the costs in the action, but that they have not filed a bond for double the amount of the judgment. We understand, further, that you are at present con - sidering the question of making the levies for the coming year, and as a basis for making those levies, desire to have certain specific questions answered, and also one other question with relation to the past illegal five mill levy, which questions are as follows: 1. Can the County Commissioners refund to the individual taxpayers, the amounts collected from them under the illegal five mill levy! 2. Can the County Commissioners levy a tax at the present time to pay the judgment and other claims now outstanding! 3. Can the judgment and other claims for previous years be paid out of the tax levy for the present year ? In answer to the first question, will say that the gen - eral rule of law is that where an illegal tax is levied and the same is paid by the individual taxpayers without pro - test at the time of payment, the individual taxpayers can - not recover the same from the county. In other words, should they bring a suit against the county to recover the amount of the taxes they have thus far paid, they would be unable to secure a judgment against the county. How - ever, should they file claims with the county board, ask - ing for refund of the taxes thus paid, and the county board allowed such claims, we do not believe that upon appeal of any other party or objection thereto by any other party, </seg>
            <seg id="p095">88 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL the court would hold that the County Commissioners ex - ceeded their authority in refunding these amounts and paying the claims so filed. The question then becomes whether the County Com - missioners can order this refund without the claims being filed by the individual taxpayers. The better form would undoubtedly be to have the individual taxpayers file their claims, but inasmuch as the County Commissioners could pay them when the claims are filed, we see no reason why the County Commissioners could not order a refund of these taxes without the claims being filed, and believe that the courts would sustain their action in this respect. In answer to the second question, will say that there are a number of points involved which must be taken into consideration. First of all, we understand that there is a contention that the appeal, which has been cited, to the Supreme Court of the State of Nebraska from the judg - ment rendered in the District Court of Saunders County against Saunders County, prevents the levying of a tax to pay this judgment until such time as finally passed upon by the Supreme Court. We cannot agree with this argument. The fact that the case is now being appealed, cannot operate in any way to prevent the County Com - missioners from exercising their lawful right to levy taxes as they see fit. The question will be subsequently con - sidered as to whether the appeal will prevent them from paying these claims and this judgment, but certainly it does not prevent them from levying a tax to meet the claims and the judgment in the future, in the event that they are sustained by the Supreme Court. The next question to be considered is the propriety of levying such a tax before the appeal has been com - pleted. The opinion of the Supreme Court in the case of Beadle v. Sanders, cited above, is of interest in this con - nection. In regard thereto, and after quoting Chapter 26 of the Laws of Nebraska for 1919, the court says : "The words 'may levy' as used In the statute mean 'must levy', thereby making the statute mandatory to a certain extent. The con- </seg>
            <seg id="p096">OPINIONS 89 tracts are validated and made the obligations of the county an* must be paid; that is, must be paid if possible to do so within constitutional limits. The county board will not be required to make a levy in excess of 15 mills of the dollar assessed valuation, but will be re - quhed to make such levy as it can. The board need not levy the full 5 mills, but must levy as much as is necessary to meet the indebted - ness, slaying within constitutional and statutory limits as herein de - fined, and at the same time must not stint any governmental function. Provision must be made for various county funds which are essential to maintenance of county government and agencies. This leaves the matter largely in the discretion of the county board, but the courts should not allow such a provision for a special tax to be wholly dis - regarded." What the court here says is that this section of the statute is mandatory in so far as it is possible to follow it; that is if it is possible for the county board to levy all of this special five mill levy, or part thereof, without stinting any governmental function, the county board must do so. As applied to your particular case, this will be the situation. If in your county, due to the increased as - sessed valuation at the present time, you can cut your other levies to ten mills, you would be permitted to make a five mill levy to pay this judgment and the claims which have heretofore been allowed. Not only would you be allowed to do so, but it would be your duty; in the lan - guage of the court, it would be mandatory upon you to do so. Jn other words, what the court says is that if you can decrease the amount levied for other county purposes and still secure enough funds to handle the remaining part of the county work, you must make the levy provided for in Chapter 26 of the Laws of 1919, or as much of it as is necessary to take up the present outstanding claims as covered by that chapter. I would particularly call your attention to the pro - visions of the above mentioned Chapter 26, Laws of 1919, because the question has arisen as to w T hether or not this levy would cover the work done in 1919 as well as the work done in 1918. The language of the statute is as fol - lows: </seg>
            <seg id="p097">90 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL "If any county has before January 1, 1919, entered into any con - tract for bridge construction or repair in excess of the amount herein permitted to be expended " You will note that this section of the statute does not say "if the work were done before January 1, 1919" but says "if the contract was entered into before that time." This would mean, then, that no matter when the work was done if the contract were made before January 1, 1919, the funds raised by this special levy could be used to pay for it. As applied to your particular situation, the con - clusion is as follows: If, without stinting your other county governmental functions, you can levy a tax under the provisions of Chapter 26, Laws of 1919, you can levy a sufficient tax to pay for all the work done upon bridges, either by way of construction or repair, which was contracted for be - fore the first day of January, 1919. To use a concrete example, let us say that you find a twelve mill levy will be sufficient for all other purposes and that a three mill levy, under this section, would be sufficient to take up all of the claims and debts due and outstanding for work contracted for before January 1, 1919. It is not only within the power of the County Commissioners to make such a levy, but it is their mandatory, legal duty. In regard to the third question, that of whether or not having the funds on hand raised by a tax levy they can pay these claims, will say that it is the opinion of this department that they can do so. One reason that a special emphasis has been laid upon Chapter 26, Laws of 1919, has been because under its provisions there would be abso - lutely no question. Its provisions specifically authorize the use of such a levy to pay previously incurred indebted - ness, and our suggestion would be that if it is possible to do so, all of these past claims be covered by this special levy. The question, however, also arises as to whether in case they cannot all be covered by this special levy, with particular reference to those which might have been con- </seg>
            <seg id="p098">OPINIONS 91 tracted for after January 1, 1919, they can be paid from the regular levy for bridge purposes, the objection being to paying obligations contracted for in the previous year out of a levy of the present year. In regard to this, al - low me to quote 10 Nebr. 361, State ex rel. Hagberg v. County Commissioners of Furnas County, in which case it was held that the relator was entitled to be paid for services rendered in the year 1879 out of the levy for 1880. We believe that there is no question but that the County Commissioners of Saunders County would be en - titled to pay these claims, even though they were con - tracted for and became due in the years 1918 and 1919, out of the levy for 1920, either under the special pro - visions of Chapter 26, Laws of 1919, or out of the gen - eral levy for bridge purposes. One other point in connection with this question has been raised, namely, whether you could pay these claims until such a time as the appeal of the case recently de - cided in the District Court of Saunders County, has been finished. In regard to this, will say that Section 8189 of the Revised Statutes of 1919 provides that "No appeal in any case shall operate as a supersedeas unless the ap - pellant or appellants shall, within twenty days next after the rendition of such judgment or decree, or the making of such final order, execute to the adverse party a bond with one or more sureties as follows: "First — When the judgment, decree or final order appealed from directs the payment of money, the bond shall be in double the amount of th2 judgment • * « We understand that the appellants have not done that in this case; that their bond does not specify any specific amount and is a bond for costs only, and that the time has gone by for the filing of this bond. We therefore hold that the appeal does not supercede the judgment of the district court; that the judgment of the district court is still in full force and effect and that the County Com - missioners have the right to pay this judgment. However, we would suggest that inasmuch as there is a possibility of said judgment being reversed, in which </seg>
            <seg id="p099">92 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL case the county would be entitled to recover back the amount which it has paid, no money be paid by the county on the judgment unless a bond is put up for the return of the money in case the judgment is reversed, and it seems to us that under the circumstances, the county would be justified in holding the money and not paying the judgment until after final determination in the Su - preme Court. We realize that this is a rather long opinion; that the facts are extensive and that our knowledge of them is not as complete as it should be. We hope that we have made no mistakes in the facts upon which we have based this opinion, and that we have succeeded in covering every question which it was desired to have answered. If we have made any mistake as to the facts, or have neglected to cover any point, if brought to our attention we will be glad to correct the same. Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General. By CECIL F. LAVERTY, August 26, 1920. Assistant Attorney General. Closed Shop The courts will not lend their aid to enforce a closed shop agreement which embraces practically all of the master plumbers and journey - man plumbers in a city. Mr. J. B. Coningham, Secretary Master Plumbers' Asso- ciation, 418 First National Bank Bldg., Omaha, Nebr. Dear Sir: Your letter of October 8th requests the advice of this department as to the legality of a blanket agreement between a labor union and an employers' as- Kiation for a closed shop; the proposed agreement be - one between the Master Plumbers' Association of </seg>
            <seg id="p100">OPINIONS 93 Omaha and the Journeyman Plumbers' Local Union Num - ber 16, under the terms of which the members of the Local Union will work for no one except the members of the Local Master Plumbers' Association, and the Master Plumbers' Association agrees to employ no one except members in good standing of the Local Journeyman's Union. There is no statute in Nebraska which specifically pro - vides that such an agreement — which we will hereafter call the "Closed Shop" — is illegal. It is questionable whether such an agreement violates Section 4017 R. S. 1913 or the provisions of Sections 4045 to 4066 R. S. 1913, these being the statutes prohibiting monopolies and re - straint of trade. Sections 4045 and 4046 are modeled upon the well-known Federal statute, the Sherman Anti-trust Law. The Supreme Court of the United States, in con - struing that statute, has held several times that labor organizations are within its purview. Gompers v. Buck Stove &amp; Range Company, 221 U. S. 418; Lowe v. Laylor (The Danbury Hatters' case), 208 U. S. 274. It will be noted that subsequently labor organizations were exempted from this statute by the Clayton Act passed on October 15, 1914. The Nebraska law does not exempt labor organizations in its statutes, however. The Nebras - ka courts have not construed this Restraint of Trade Act in respect to labor unions. In Cleland v. Anderson, 66 Neb. 252, our supreme court held that an association of retail lumber dealers designed to monopolize the lumber business in a section of the state and to prevent any lumber dealer engaging in business unless he belonged to such association was unlawful. In State v. Employers of Labor, 102 Neb. 768, our supreme court, while declin - ing to interfere by injunctive proceedings, insinuates that employers may agree between themselves to require men to work on the open shop principle, and that laborers have a right to refuse to work in an open shop, and in - sinuates further that labor unions may act so as to con - spire to restrain trade or commerce and so bring them- </seg>
            <seg id="p101">94 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL selves within the prohibition of the Restraint of Trade Statute. Cook in his work on Combinations, Monopolies and Labor Unions, page 114, speaking of closed shop agree - ments, says: "But recently the idea has been advanced that such an agreement i* unlawful as tending to create a monopoly in favor of members of unions to the exclusion of those seeking employment not members of unions, that is as tending to create an illegal restriction upon com - petition." and cites the case of Christensen v. People in 114th 111. App. 40, which bears out this conclusion. Martin, in his work on Labor Unions, paragraph 271, declares that a combination by employers embracing nearly all the con - tractors in the building trades in a large city to compel workmen to join a designated union by refusing them employment unless they did so, is void as against public policy because it operates generally upon craftsmen in the trade and imposes upon them as the penalty for re - fusing to join the union the practical impossibility of ob - taining employment at their trade and thereby gaining a livelihood. The highest appellate court in New York held, in the case of Curran v. Galen, 152 N. Y. 33, that an individual employer might lawfully agree with a labor union to em - ploy only its members, because such an agreement is not of an oppressive nature and did not operate generally throughout the community to prevent laborers from ob - taining employment and earning a livelihood, yet that such an agreement when participated in by all or by a large proportion of employers in any community became oppressive and contrary to public policy because it oper - ated generally upon craftsmen in the trade and imposed upon them as a penalty for refusing to join a local union the practical impossibility of obtaining employment. A closed shop agreement between practically all the employers and practically all the craftsmen in a building </seg>
            <seg id="p102">OPINIONS 95 trade in New York City was squarely held illegal as against public policy by the New York courts in McCord v. Thompson Starritt Company, 113 N. Y. Supp. 385. In the Danbury Hatters Case, 208 U. S. 274, the Su - preme Court of the United States held that a boycott on the part of labor unions to enforce a closed shop was un - lawful. The case of Irving v. Neal, 209 Fed. 471, sustains the same propositions. The Federal Courts in Irving v. Joint District Council, 108 Fed. 896, states the law as follows : "Will the defendants admit that employers may combine to pre - vent any employer from using union labor? May the employers agree not to sell to or contract with any one who deals with an employer who uses union labor? Either of these propositions is destructive of the right of free men to labor for or to employ the labor of anyone a laborer or employer wishes * * * If the struggle is persisted in between labor and capital, to use a contrary view, ultimately either the workman or the employers may be reduced to a condition of in - voluntary servitude." In the last case on the subject, Hitchman Coal Company v. Mitchell, 245 U. S. 229, decided in December, 1917, the Supreme Court of the United States holds that the right of laborers or craftsmen to combine and to form a union exists only where the purpose of such a union is proper and legitimate; that the right to combine is not absolute but must always be exercised with reasonable regard for the conflicting rights of others; and following this rea - soning enjoined a proposed strike calculated to enforce a closed shop agreement and to forcibly unionize by im - proper methods a coal mine in West Virginia. Our conclusion is that while the closed shop agreement you mention in the plumbing trade (and we assume that such an agreement would embrace practically all the mas - ter plumbers and journeyman plumbers in Omaha) is probably not criminal under the Nebraska statute, yet its legality is so doubtful, it is so tinged with illegality and so contrary to public policy, that at this time a law-abid - ing citizen might well hesitate to enter into it. </seg>
            <seg id="p103">96 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Certainly the courts would not lend their aid to the enforcement of such an agreement; and in all probability a boycott or strike to enforce such an agreement could be enjoined.

Compromising Indebtedness Valid outstanding floating indebtedness of counties, precincts, town - ships, towns, cities, villages and school districts, may be com - promised by these political subdivisions, as provided in Sections 36, 37, 38, 39 and 40, of the Revised Statutes of 1913. Hon. George W. Marsh, State Auditor, Lincoln, Xebraska. Dear Sir : You inquire : "Whether or not counties, precincts, townships, towns, cities, vil - lages and school districts have a right to compromise or fund their outstanding floating indebtedness, as provided in Chap. 8, Sees. 36, 37, 38, 39 and 40, of Revised Statutes of 1913." In answer to the question which you propound, I will say that in my opinion outstanding floating indebtedness, if valid, of the various classes of corporations enumerated by you may be compromised under and in conformity with the provisions of statute mentioned above. In the case of State v. Moore, 45 Neb., 13, it was held that the only indebtedness which could be compromised un - der the law then in force was bonded indebtedness: but the present statute regulating the compromise of indebted - ness which was passed in 1903 was evidently framed to meet the objections to the compromise of floating in - debtedness under the previous statute. It will be ob - served that there is no general constitutional provision </seg>
            <seg id="p104">OPINIONS 97 limiting the bonded indebtedness of the various muni - cipalities mentioned by you, although there is, I believe, a limitation upon the amount that some of them may donate to a railroad corporation, and there is a constitu - tional provision that counties may not levy in any one year more than 15 mills on the dollar of their valuation without being authorized by a vote of the electors. It follows that this question is to be viewed solely with refer - ence to statutory provisions and without any restrictions because of constitutional limitations. To illustrate : The ordinary rural school district is permitted to issue bonds up to a certain per cent of its assessed valuation for the purpose of building and furnishing a school house and providing a site therefor. This statutory provision does not in itself bar the issuance of bonds for other purposes which some other provision of statute authorizes. In the case of compromise bonds issued under the pro - visions of statute to which you refer, you will note that they are not sold on the market but are given to the hold - ers of evidences of other indebtedness against the district in exchange for warrants or bonds already held by them. There is in fact no increase in the amount of indebted - ness owed by the district or other municipal corporation when compromise bonds are exchanged for other evidences of indebtedness. "The objection that through the issue of renewal or refunding bonds a new debt is created has been repeatedly decided by the courts as not well taken for the reason that the proceeds of such bonds are used not for the purpose of adding to the indebtedness or the obliga - tions of the corporation but of paying outstanding ones which immedi - ately upon the exchange or payment become cancelled and extinguished and incapable of enforcement as corporate obligations, the only legal indebtedness existing against the public corporation as a result of the process being the new refunding or renewal bonds. Bonds issued to fund a valid indebtedness neither create any debt nor increase the debt but merely change the form of the indebtedness." Abbott Public Securi - ties, Sec. 209. "The authority may be conferred by the legislature, subject to con - stitutional limitations, upon public corporations to issue not only re - funding and renewal bonds but also to compromise and adjust their outstanding obligations and to issue in payment of the indebtedness </seg>
            <seg id="p105">98 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL thus adjusted and compromised what may be characterized by the term of 'compromise bonds'. It is generally held necessary to the legality of these securities that the debts compromised or adjusted should at least bear the character of a colorable validity. Where the legality of the old debt is not denied, the right to compromise, if con - ferred by statute, clearly exists." Abbott Public Securities, Sec. 211. The right is clear, I think, under the statute, to com - promise the valid outstanding indebtedness of counties, precincts, townships, cities, villages and school districts in the manner provided for in the sections of statute cited above. Even if such indebtedness, or some of it, should be invalid, it is a question whether the refunding bonds issued to pay same would not be collectible in the hands of innocent purchasers before maturity for value. In the case of City of Huron v. Second Ward Savings Bank, 86 Fed. 272, it is said: "A municipal corporation is estopped from defending an action by an innocent purchaser to collect its negotiable bonds which recite that they were issued for the purpose of funding the bonds, warrants, or floating debt of the corporation, either on the ground that the warrants or bonds which they were issued to satisfy were void, or that the apparent debt which they were issued to pay was fictitious." "Where an innocent purchaser buys, of others than the municipal - ity or its agents, negotiable bonds which recite that they were issued to fund the debt or obligations of the municipality, the purchaser may rest on the legal presumption that the legal method was adopted; that the issue or the bonds did not increase the debt of the municipality, and he is not required to consider or inquire concerning the question of excessive indebtedness."

Mr. Robert Tichy, Wilber, Nebraska. Dear Sir: The Attorney General has your letter of November 20th asking for some information in regard to the new re-districting law. We will start out by informing you that this depart - ment has no desire to interfere with the State Superin - tendent in matters of this kind; but as you ask us for our views of this law we give them to you, saying to you that our opinion is probably not worth any more than that of any other good lawyer. Answering your questions, we inform you that we un - derstand this new re-districting law, after the county com - mittee on re-districting fixes the tentative boundaries of the new district, 25 per cent of the electors of any such new district within forty days may file a written protest or appeal with the State Superintendent against the estab - lishment of the boundaries as fixed by the committee. If no protest is filed, it will be considered that the bound - aries as constituted by the re-districting board are fixed as such proposed new district. After such boundaries are fixed, 25 per cent of the school electors in the proposed consolidated and high school district may petition to the county superintendent for an election. It is then his duty to call an election, giving twenty days' notice of the time and place of holding the same. At such election all of the voters in the proposed new r district are entitled to vote on the question of the establishment of the same. If a majority of such votes cast in the new proposed district shall be in favor of the establishment of the same, then the county superintendent calls an election for the elec - tion of the school district officers in the new district.

In such a case, no election is required to be held. Then, in that case, the boundaries of the district as established by the re-districting committee in the first instance will be con - sidered and constituted as the boundaries of the new con - solidated high school district. We further inform you that there are no provisions in the law by which the rural territory lying outside of the original consolidated high school district can detach them - selves from such new consolidated high school district, and it is our opinion that this cannot be done until there is future legislation on the subject.

Consolidated Schools It la the duty of the board of a consolidated school district to provide transportation for rural pupils. Mr. August Gadekin, Bushnell, Nebraska. Dear Sir: We are in receipt of your letter of Decem - ber 27, reciting your troubles in your endeavor to get the school board to provide a truck for the accommodation of the pupils in your new consolidated district </seg>
            <seg id="p108">OPINIONS 101 Section 7 of Chapter 243 of the Laws of 1919 (the consolidated school district law) provides: "The board of education of every such district shall provide for the transportation over established public highways of rural pupils.

According to this section, it is the duty of the board of the consolidated district to provide for the transporta - tion. If the board declines to do so, I rather think action could be secured by mandamus proceedings, but of course there may be some reason not set forth in your letter why the board has declined to act in this matter. The board should lay aside sufficient money to provide for transportation, which is as much the duty of the board as it is to provide school houses and teachers. Very truly yours, CLARENCE A.

Constitutional Convention The compensation awarded a stenographer, reporting the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention, is purely within the discretion of the convention. Hon. A. J. Weaver, President Constitutional Convention,. Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In response to your request for an opinion as to the amount of compensation that the Convention can aw r ard to a stenographer reporting the proceedings of the Convention, we beg to advise as follows: Sec. 14 of Chap. 196, Laws of 1919, authorizing the Constitutional Convention, gives the Convention power </seg>
            <seg id="p109">102 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL "to make provisions for the publication of its proceed - ings or any part thereof; and for the securing of the copy- right of any such publication for the state." Sec. 14 provides that "the proceedings and debates of the Convention shall be made a matter of record." Chapter 275 appropriates $45,000 for the expenses of clerical help and incidental expenses of the Constitutional Convention. Under these provisions it is the duty of the Convention to provide for a stenographic report of its proceedings and debates, and the compensation to be awarded for stenographic services is a matter purely within the dis - cretion of the Convention. Our attention has been called to Section 1203 of the Revised Statutes, which provides: "When the services of a shorthand reporter shall be required in any matter other than district court work and the taking of deposi - tions, such reporter shall receive for his services not to exceed five dollars per day while engaged in the actual taking of testimony and proceedings and in addition thereto ten cents per hundred words and not more for the original long-hand copy thereof." After a very careful examination of the facts in the case you mentioned to us, as well as into the purposes and meaning of this statute, I am of the opinion that the statute is not applicable to the case in question. It will be noted under the preceding sections of the statute which provide the salary and duties of court reporters, that the reporters are given forty days within which to prepare the records of their district court work. In the case of the Constitutional Convention the reporters are given twenty-four hours or less in which to prepare the record, and in fact are under contract to furnish the copy of each day's proceedings by nine o'clock of the succeeding morning. This necessitates an altogether different class of work from that contemplated by the statute ; it necessi - tates the reporters hiring typewriter operators and spend - ing long hours at night in redictating the record of the day's proceedings. It is a much more severe strain and involves infinitely more care and labor than does the or - dinary district court work. I therefore doubt the pro- </seg>
            <seg id="p110">OPINIONS 103 priety of attempting to apply the statute when there is so much difference in the character of work done as there is in this case. In addition to that, while I do not like, ordinarily, to suggest the invalidity of a statute, it has been forcibly presented to me that this statute is prob - ably not valid. There is no question of the power of the legislature to prescribe that when one accepts a state salary that he shall devote all his time to the work and shall not engage in any other work outside of his state duties. There is also no question of the power of the legislature to prescribe the compensation which one may receive while engaged in his state duties or work neces - sarily incident thereto. But so long as the legislature have not forbidden reporters to do outside work but have left them free to do so if they see fit as long as the same does not conflict with their regular employment, I do not believe that the legislature has any right to regulate the price which may be received for those services which are specially contracted for which constitute no part of the duties of the office, which do not interfere with the duties of the office, which are of an altogether different class of work. I do not believe that this statute is such a statute as the courts would classify as "a burden of the office" of reporter. I might also suggest that in several other matters where the services of reporters have been required outside the scope of their regular duties and where they have been left free to contract at pleasure, that this statute has been ignored by state officials, and in fact in the hearing in regard to the Kirk matter, in which reporters were re - quired, that the supreme court is prepared to allow vouch - ers to the reporters in excess of the amount of the statute, which seems to me to be in substance a holding on their part that the statute is not applicable to work which is entirely outside of the normal duties of a district court reporter.

            <seg id="p111">104 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Corporations A general corporation cannot impose limitations upon the transferabil - lty of its stock in such a manner as to create a direct restriction upon its alienation. Mr. J. H. Donnelly, Chief, Bureau of Securities, State Dear Sir: Recently your Bureau submitted the follow - ing question to me for consideration, to- wit: Under the law of this state can a corporation impose limitations upon the transferability of its stock in such manner as to create a direct restriction upon its aliena - tion, for instance, can a corporation provide in its by-laws or articles that no person shall hold more than a restricted number of shares in said corporation, and a further re - striction to the effect that the stock of such corporation shall not be assignable by a stockholder to a non-stock - holder until the consent of the board of directors has been obtained to such assignment or transfer? Without rendering a detailed discussion of this ques - tion and for the purpose of only creating a general rule covering such a case I would inform you that the law of this state indicates as follows: "Section 566, part 1 of the 1913 Revised Statutes provides under the heading, "Enumeration of corporate powers," that, "Every cor - poration as such, has power: First — to have succession by its cor- porate name — " * * "Fifth: To render the interest of its stock- holders transferable" • • • "Seventh — to make by-laws "not in- consistent with any existing law, for the management of its affairs." From the above quoted sections it will be noted that a corporation shall have power to have succession by its corporate name, and this power indicates the necessity for having transferable shares, and that the holders of same should have a right to alienate or dispose of the same, and in fact this is provided for by the fifth section as quoted. Consequently the question is raised as to wheth - er or not the said fifth section creates an absolute right without independent affirmative action upon the part of </seg>
            <seg id="p112">OPINIONS 105 he corporation. I am of the opinion that it does create in absolute right and my opinion is apparently borne out &gt;y a decision of our supreme court as handed down in he case of Miller v. Farmers Milling and Elevator Com - pany, cited in 78 Nebraska, 441. In said case the court lad before it what was virtually the identical question as )reviously stated in the fore part of this opinion, and in leciding the cases the court cited the following general principles of law, stating that the transfer of stock has jeen uniformly regarded as a legitimate subject of cor- Doration legislation to enable the company to know who ire stockholders, to whom dividends are to be paid, who ire entitled to vote, et cetera, but such legislation will not tae enforced beyond what is necessary to serve those pur - poses, where its enforcement would operate as an in - fringement on the property rights of others, or as an unreasonable restraint upon the disposition of property in the stock of the corporation. The right of transfer is incidental to the ownership of shares and the stock of joint stock companies and corpora - tions formed in pursuance of legislative authority. Any by-law which unreasonably interferes with the free exer - cise of this right is void as being in restraint of trade. (See 2 Thompson, Commentaries, Law of Corporations, Sec. 2300; Angell and Ames Corporations, 11th ed. sees. 331-332; 2 Cook, Corporations, sec. 621-a; Boone, Corpora - tions, sec. 122). "In Chouteau Spring Co. v. Harris, 20 Mo. 383, the court held that the power to regulate the transfer of stock did not include the power to restrain transfers or to pre - scribe to whom they might be made, but merely to pre - scribe the formalities to be observed in making them, and that the company could not prevent a party from selling his stock, even to an insolvent person. In Bloede v. Bloede, 84 Md. 129, 34 Atl. 1127, the court held that a by-law, re - quiring a stockholder to give notice of his intention to sell, and that the other stockholders shall thereupon have the option to purchase the stock at the price named, was an invalid restraint of alienation." For other cases on </seg>
            <seg id="p113">106 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL this point see Ireland v. Globe Milling Co., 21 (R. I.) 41 Atl. 258; Morgan v. Struthers, 131 U. S. 246; McXulta v. Corn Belt Bank, 164 111. 427, 45 N. E. 954; Moore v. Bank of Commerce, 52 Mo. 377. Referring back to the case of Miller v. Farmers Mill - ing dt Elevator Co., Supra, and in deciding the question for it our court stated: "The fifth clause of that section, which purports to give a corpora - tion the power 'to render the interest of the stockholders transferable,' was not intended to make the tranaferabillty of stock dependent on some affirmative act of the corporation authorizing its transfer, but to impress the stock with that quality as a consequence of the act of incorporation. A by-law of a corporation organized under the laws of this state, which limits the number of shares which a person may hold, or forbids a transfer of stock by a stockholder to a nonstock - holder without the consent of the directors, is void as an unreasonable restriction upon the transfer of property." "A careful reading of the entire section leads us to the conclusion that the legislature thereby undertook, not only to define the general powers of the corporation, but also to enumerate certain qualities or properties which it should possess, or certain consequences which should follow the act of incorporation. It is clear that the first clause, the clause relating to succession, is to be taken as expressive of a corporate quality or property, rather than grant of power. It attaches to a corporation the instant it comes into being, and, of necessity, antedates the first corporate act. The fifth clause is complementary to the first, because, unless there could be a change in the ownership of stock, the perpetual succession of the corporation, under its cor - porate name, would be impossible. The latter clause was intended, we think, not to make the transferability of corporate stock dependent on some affirmative act of the corporation, but to impress the stock with that quality as a consequence of the act of incorporation." I believe that the above cited cases and the ensuing quotation from our supreme court definitely answer the question presented to me, and as I stated in the fore part of this opinion, I have merely attempted to set down for your guidance the broad, general rule surrounding gen - eral corporations in this state. In conclusion I would draw your attention to the fact that this particular rule as laid down does not apply to co-operative corporations. In fact co-operative corporations or associations come </seg>
            <seg id="p114">OPINIONS 107 inder a special section of the statute, and on this point would draw your attention to Section 7 of Chapter 197 f the 1919 Session Laws, wherein it is specifically stated s follows: "Membership — how determined. — A co-operative association may by is articles of association determine the conditions bf membership in he association. The membership shall not be assignable by any mem - er except with the consent of the association under rules and condi - ions to be fixed by the association, in its articles of association or y-laws." Also under Section 3 of said chapter it is provided "That the articles of association shall specify' :onditions of memberships." (4) The Accordingly, in applying the rule as stated herein it pould be well to carefully distinguish as to the character if the corporation to which the rule is to be applied. But generally speaking with regard to general corporations am satisfied that the rule as stated is complete. Respectfully submitted. G. T.

            <seg id="p115">108 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL In considering this question for your information &gt; would at first set out herein a few generalities dealing' with the character and formation of corporations. In the first place a corporation is an artificial being, invisible intangible and existing only in contemplation of law. Be ; ing the mere .creature of law, it possesses only thost properties which the charter of its creation confers upor it, either expressly, or as incidental to its very existence' (Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheat 517.) A cor poration can only be created by or under authority front; the state. It cannot be formed by mere agreement be - tween the members. A corporation being the mere crea - ture of the legislature or state, has such powers only at are expressly or impliedly conferred upon it by the char - ter or act of incorporation. To the creation or formatior of a corporation, the following things are essential: A grant of authority from the state ; acceptance of the grant, or an agreement between the' state and the corporation: an agreement between the corporators and the corpora - tion. (See Clark on the Law of Corporations, chapter II.) In organizing a corporation under the statutes a substan - tial compliance with the provisions of the statute is re - quired. In the construction of charters the intention of the legislature must be ascertained. In cases of doubt, charters are to be construed most strongly in favor of the public and against the corporation. When a corpora - tion is formed under a special act, its powers are general - ly specified in the act, and the act, together with any other laws which are binding upon it, constitute its char - ter. When formed under a general law, this law, together with the articles of association required by the law to be executed and filed by the corporators, and any other laivs of the state which are applicable to such corporations, con - stitute its charter. (See Lincoln Shoe Co. v. Sheldon, 44 This short exposition of generalities concerning the formation of corporations brings us to the proposition of membership in the corporation, or the third essential of corporate existence, that is, an agreement between the </seg>
            <seg id="p116">109 OPINIONS orporators and the corporation. Membership in a cor - &gt;oration is acquired by contract with the corporation. Phis contract in stock corporations is determined by the &gt;wnership of one or more shares of the capital stock. The capital stock of a corporation is the amount in money &gt;r property subscribed and paid in, or secured to be paid n, by the shareholders, and always remains the same un - ess changed by legislative authority. The subscription o the capital stock is ordinarily evidenced by shares of itock and in turn a share of stock in a corporation is the ight to partake, according to the amount put into the 'und representing the capital stock, of the surplus profits &gt;f the corporation, and ultimately, on its dissolution, of so much of this fund as is not liable for the debts of the •orporation. (See Clark on Law of Corporations, chap. 107). See also Mann v. Inv. Co., 70 Xeb. 454. The capi - tal stock of a corporation is the basis of its credit since the stockholders are not personally liable for its debts unless such liability is imposed by statute. Persons deal with a corporation on the faith of this fund, and, if it is. not paid in, they have a right to insist that it shall be paid in, when its payment is necessary for the satisfaction of their claims against the corporation. (See Wyman v. Bowman (Neb.) 127 Fed. 257— Sec. 4, Art. Xlb Neb. Const.). At this point attention is drawn to the fact that there is a distinct difference between the terms "capital" and "capital stock." The "capital" of a cor - poration is a broader term, and includes all the funds, securities and property of whatever kind, which the cor - poration possesses. The "capital" of a corporation may vary and fluctuate, but its "capital stock" remains in - variable unless changed by legislative authority. The common and recognized practice in incorporating companies is the ascertainment of a specified fund desig - nated as the authorized capital stock and this fund is divided into shares. The court in the case of Securities Co. v. R. R. Co. reported in 165 Fed. 948, denned a "share" in an incorporated company as follows: "A 'share' specifically is one of the whole number of equal </seg>
            <seg id="p117">110 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL parts into which the capital stock * * * is or may be* divided." See also Presnall v. Bank (Tex.) 151 S. WJ 873 ; Farrington v. Tenn. 95 U. S. 679 ; Miller v. Bank, 40 O. St. 424. The Century dictionary defines a share ae&gt; "one of the whole number of equal parts into which tha stock of a trading company is or may be divided." In other words, a share of stock in an incorporated company represents an undivided equal interest in the capital stock.. Now that we have the foregoing corporate principles in mind we can refer directly to the question at hand, and we find it amounts to this: Can a company become incor - porated under Nebraska law without a stated capital stock and without shares divided into a stated number of equal parts each having an actual stated par value f If such authority is to be had it must be found in the enabling act, to- wit : The Nebraska Statutes. This must be true for the corporation is the creature of the state and can only exercise those powers expressly given to it. In making a brief resume of the statutes of Nebraska it will be found that for the past fifty years and more under the laws of this state it has been an accepted fact that corporations should have a definite and stated amount of capital stock. This has been true not only in this state but also in fully 90% of the other states in the union. This is a feature of corporation organization that has come down for years through private corporation organi - zation. In turn and of equal age has been the require - ment that shares of stock should have an actual stated par value. The major portion of corporation law has been founded and established around these contentions, as wit - ness the various taxation statutes, the law of dividends, the law of limited liability of stockholders, the law con - cerning watered or bonus stock, the law of corporation liability, the law of stock commissions, statutes controlling corporate indebtedness and various Blue Sky laws, et cetera. As concerns the par value of stocks in this state, up until the past legislative session of 1919 the statutes required not only an actual par value, but in addition re - quired a par with certain limitations as to the amount </seg>
            <seg id="p118">OPINIONS 111 hereof. Under the 1913 statutes the par was arbitrarily &gt;laced at $100 but this was reduced in 1917 and up to 919 stood at not less than $10 par. The 1919 legislature n enacting new Blue Sky laws neglected either intention- Jly or unintentionally to include any specific provision oncerning the limitations of par, but said statutes do not ontain any authorization either expressly or by implica - ion authorizing stock of no par value, and in fact the ontrary is true, so the most that can be claimed by rea - son of the fact that the statutes do not specifically state vhat the par shall be is that the legislatures simply re- noved the stated value limitations in such fashion as to illow an authorization of stock with an unlimited express &gt;ar, but did not remove an actual par requirement. A similar situation exists in a number of jurisdictions other han Nebraska and in none of said jurisdictions will there &gt;e found a recognition of incorporating with a non-par stock. The legislature did not in any way alter the other ■stablished statutory sections formerly effected and used n connection with the old par value sections, which said other sections contain many and plain references and im - plications of the fact that an actual par is necessary in this state. If the legislature had found fit to alter such an old established procedure and one of established and recognized standing, one around which custom has builded itself, doesn't it seem a bit odd that the legislature did not specifically authorize such a change, or at least at - tempt to clear up other sections of the statute which might conflict with the new idea? It goes without proof that the legislature did not contemplate such a thing as proposed by the inquiry submitted in the fore part of this screed, and I am satisfied that the courts will never recognize such a change merely by reason of the fact that the statutes are silent upon the limitations of the par value of stocks. Such a radical departure from established cus - tom and upon such flimsy grounds is foreign to the ideas of our courts. Making reference to the statutes it will be found that the theory of no definite capital stock and no par value stock is contrary to the letter and spirit of the following sections as found in the 1913 Rev. Stat., Sees. </seg>

Throughout the existing Blue Sky law as found in Chapter 190 of the 1919 Session Laws it will be discovered that the said law plainly contemplates stock of an actual par value. The license fees provided under said law con - template a definite and stated capital stock. (See Sec. 5.) Sec. 10 of said law contemplates an actual par and uses the terms "par value." Sec. 16 provides for a commis - sion to be paid upon the "par value" of stock. This law is the last expression of the legislature dealing with cor - porations generally and with the stocks and shares of corporations. Inasmuch as the legislature has removed the limitations on the par value of stock but in many instances makes use of the terms "par" and "par value," it becomes import - ant to ascertain the meaning and legal interpretation of said terms. In the case ot People v. Miller (N. Y.) 69 N. E. 1103, the court states: "It may be conceded that the words 'par value' ordinarily are to be given the same meaning as face value when applied to bonds and stocks having a face value." In Security Trust Co. v. Ford, 75 O. St. 322, the court said: "Par value means face value, and according to Bouviers Law Dictionary the term is commonly used to indicate the face value of bonds or stocks." See also State of Illinois v. Delafield, 8 Paige (N. Y.) 527. "The term par value is commonly used to indicate the face value of bonds or stocks." See Bouviers Law Dictionary, page 2444. "The term par value is used to refer to the value of bonds, etc., means a value equal to the face of the bonds. See Village of Ft. Edward v. Fish (N. Y.) 50 N. E. 973; see also Commonwealth v. Lehigh Ave. Ry Co. (Pa.) 18 Atl. 498; Evans v. TiLlman </seg>
            <seg id="p120">113 OPINIONS (S. C.) 17 S. E. 49. "Par" is the latin word for equal. It has been adopted in the English language and con - tinues to have the same meaning. Castle v. Kapena, 5 Han. Rep. 27. "The word par is not to be confounded with the word 'similes'; it is used in opposition to it, as the expression 'magio pares sunt quam similes', implying not likeness merely, but identity." State v. Wirt County ( \Y. Va.) 59 S. E." 884. From the foregoing definitions of par and par value it will be seen that the legislature must have intended to provide and recognize stock having an actual face value or a stock with a stated par value rather than one without a par value. Following this theory and having in mind that in the part the legislature demanded a specific par value; that at the present time statutes are in force using the terms par and par value ; that some of these statutes represent the last expression of the legislature, and that the legislature has not specifically provided for corpora - tions with a non-par stock, let us refer to a recognized authority on corporation law and see what reference is made to a like situation, to-wit : Fletcher Cyc. of Cor - porations, Vol. 5, Sec. 3456. Fletcher states as follows: "The amount of money expressed as the par value of the shares is entirely a matter of statutory or charter regulation, although some par value would seem to be necessary in order to define the shares, unless there are statutes" • ♦ "which allow issuance of shares without any par value." • • * "i n Delaware and New York there have recently been enacted statutes authorizing the issuance of stock without any expressed par value. These are distinct from a well known class of statutes which allow issuance of stock of any value but require an expressed value of par, leaving it to the corporators to fix such value by the articles." • • • "The certificate of in- * corporation under both statutes is required to state certain facts as a basis for such shares. The stock certificates also must state similar facts. All such shares are equal to every other share of such stock subject to the preferences if any, of the preferred stock." From the foregoing citation it will be seen that the legislatures of the two named states have specifically au - thorized and recognized non-par stock and by enactments have provided for the same both as to its issuance and </seg>
            <seg id="p121">114 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL also as to its status when issued. Under the Delaware, law each share is valued at one hundred dollars for pur&lt; poses of incorporation and franchise taxes likewise the New York law provides specifically for organization, stock transfer and franchise taxes. In Nebraska the legislature has not provided statutes in these respects. The statutes pertaining to organization, stock transfer, stock liability, franchise taxes, et cetera, remain as enacted years ago and pertain to stock of an exp r^ss par. The past policy of this state on this question is plain and undoubted, and I cannot discover any meritorious grounds for saying that this policy has been changed at this time. The statutes of Delaware and New York as compared with Nebraska are expressions of two widely variant legisla - tive policies. The policy of Nebraska as evidenced by legislative expression, fixes an arbitrary value, designated a par value, upon each share of stock which the corpora - tion is authorized to issue. It is provided that no share of such authorized capital stock shall be sold at less than par value or above par except with the permission of the Blue Sky department and all stock must be paid for either in money, in property or in services at their actual market value. This constitutes a constant assurance to those dealing with the corporation that the corporation has re - ceived the full par value of every share of stock it has sold. The other and different policy is that evidenced by those new statutes of New York and Delaware, permitting the formation of corporations whose stock has no par value. The plan there is that the stock may be disposed of from time to time for its actual value, as fixed by the directors or stockholders. Property, patents, et cetera, may be acquired and the directors determine not only the value of the property and patents, but the value per share of the stock which is issued therefor as well. An investor or creditor has no assurance or basis of reliance in the premises. As to the investor, the doctrine of caveat emptor applies, without the customary ability to inspect and determine the value of the goods, which is the pro - tection of an ordinary purchaser in the open market. For </seg>
            <seg id="p122">OPINIONS 115 the ordinary investor possesses neither the opportunity nor the ability to make a sufficient examination of cor - porate records to determine with any degree of accuracy the present value of its stock per share; and the creditor is in much the same position. Nor has the present pur- thaser any assurance that stock of the corporation may lot be sold to another the next day at a price much be - ow that which he was compelled to pay. This latter legislative policy is plainly contrary to the Nebraska policy. Take for instance the present Blue Sky law in this state. What justification would your Bureau have for authorizing the sale of non par stock subject to such arbitrary values as the corporation might place upon it, in face of the requirements of said law? How would the Blue Sky application fee be determined? How could a par value be determined ? How could the rate of commis - sion be definitely fixed? How could the indebtedness of the corporation be limited so as to make it definite of ascertainment? How would the amount of capital stock be determined so as to comply with Sec. 572, Rev. Stat. 1913? How could the liability of stockholders be deter - mined with any degree of certainty? How would cor - porations comply with Sec. 762, Rev. Stat. of 1913 in rendering a report to the secretary of state setting out "the amount of authorized capital stock and the par value of each share?" Upon what basis would a corporation pay its occupation tax, which said tax is based upon and graduated by means of a stated^ amount of capital stock? The foregoing constitutes only a small part of the questions which would arise concerning the incorporation of a non par stock company in Nebraska and the basis for these questions is likewise the basis for saying that the policy of this state as concerns domestic corporations is plainly against the incorporation of non par stock cor - porations. Summing up this question it can be stated to be a question involving interpretation of the legislative inten - tion as evidenced by legislative enactments. The object of all interpretation and construction of statutes is to </seg>
            <seg id="p123">116 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ascertain the meaning and intention of the legislature, t( the end that the same may be enforced. This meaning and intention must be sought first of all in the language of the statute itself. For it must be presumed that tht means employed by the legislature to express its will art adequate to the purpose and do express that will correct - ly. If the language of the statute is plain and free from ambiguity, and expresses a single definite and sensible meaning, that meaning is conclusively presumed to be the meaning which the legislature intended to convey. In other words, the statute must be interpreted literally. (See Black on Interpretation of Laws, Chap. III.) The mind of the legislature is presumed to be consistent; and in case of a doubtful or ambiguous expression of its will, such a construction should be adopted as will make all the provisions of the statute consistent with each other and with the pre-existing body of the law. (See Id. Chap. 4, Sec. 42.) It is presumed that the legislature intends to impart to its enactments such a meaning as will render them operative and effective and prevent persons from eluding or defeating them. Accordingly in case of any doubt or obscurity the construction will be such as to carry out these objects. (Id. Chap. 4, Sec. 47.) Words used in a statute are to be read in the natural and ordinary sense given to them customarily by those who use the language with propriety; the approved popular meaning being given to words of common speech and the approved special meaning to technical terms or words of art, un - less there is reason to believe, from the face of the statute, that the words were intended to bear some other meaning. (Id. Chap. 5, Sec. 52.) It is presumed that the legislature does not intend to make unnecessary changes in the pre-existing body of law. The construction of a statute will therefore be such as to avoid any change in the prior laws beyond what is necessary to effect the specific purpose of the act in question. (Id. Chap 8, Sea 106.) That construction of a statute is to be favored, and must be adopted if reasonably possible, which will give meaning to every word, clause and sentence of the statute and operation and effect to every part and provision of </seg>
            <seg id="p124">OPINIONS 117 [ t. (Id. Chap. 8, Sec. 100.) And last, but not least, it is o be considered that an attempt to incorporate a non par tock corporation in Nebraska has no express statutory uthorization and is the presumption of a corporate power .nd as such is contrary to the generally accepted and well 'stablished doctrine that a corporation is the creature &gt;f the state, and as such has only those powers expressly riven by the state and such incidental powers as are di - rectly incidental and necessary to the carrying out of the )rincipal power granted. In my opinion your Bureau cannot properly recognize Nebraska corporation having non par stock for the rea- son that such an incorporation has no basis under exist - ng local law, and for the further reason that even though lot expressly prohibited by law, such incorporation is pro - libited by implication and is contrary to public policy as expressed by existing legislative enactments and as based upon statutory construction of long standing as placed thereon by the public generally and by state executives. It must be considered that all the legislature intended by its failure to enact stated limitations upon the par value of stocks is that it merely intended the granting of greater freedom in the fixing of an express par and not the removal of actual par.

A "holding" corporation is not authorized in Nebraska. J. H. Donnelly, Chief, Bureau of Securities, State House Lincoln, Xebraska. Dear Sir: As I understand your question of some days ago, you would like to be informed on the law in this state with regard to the following questions: 1. Whether or not a private corporation organized un - der Nebraska law can properly purchase and hold stock in other corporations regardless of whether or not the said latter corporations are domestic or foreign corpora - tions, and 2. Whether or not a corporation can be organized un - der Nebraska law for the primary purpose of purchasing and holding stocks and securities of other corporations. In other words, whether or not a holding company is legal under Nebraska law. Taking up the first question, I would inform you that the general rule of law in this regard is as follows : "The prevailing doctrine of this country is that one corporation cannot unless expressly authorized make a valid subscription or pur - chase the capital stock of other corporations, or otherwise become a stockholder except for the purpose of receiving payment of or security for a debt, or unless the circumstances are such that the transaction is a necessary or reasonable means of carrying out or executing the object of its incorporation."

Defining corporations for present purposes, the defini - ion handed down by Chief Justice Marshall in the ■elebrated Dartmouth College case is probably more defi - lite and concise than many others cited. Justice Marshall lefined a corporation as: "An artificial being, invisible, intangible and existing only in con - emplation of law." It is well established that no corporation can exist with - out the consent or grant of the sovereign, and the power to create corporations is one of the attributes of sovereign - ty and the legislatures of the several states, unless re - stricted by constitutional provisions, have plenary power to do so. I take it that this condition is so well estab - lished that its re-statement does not merit citation of authorities. Generally speaking, corporations are divided into two broad classifications, to-wit: Private and public corpora - tions. A corporation formed primarily for purposes of private advantages or emolument is, properly speaking, a private corporation, while corporations created for pub - lic purposes only, connected with the administration of the government, and where the whole interests and franchises are the exclusive property and domain of the government itself, are properly termed "public corporations." A corporation may exist (1) by common law, (2) by authority of the statute, (3) by charter, (4) by prescrip - tion, in nearly all the jurisdictions of the United States general laws have been enacted under which persons who comply with their provisions may become incorporated and form corporations. As a general rule the corporate </seg>
            <seg id="p127">120 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ;i statutes of the various jurisdictions usually provide (111 as to the number of persons necessary for the formation of the corporation; (2) necessary steps which must h taken in order to form a corporation; (3) the specift powers which any such corporation so formed may hav. and utilize. * As an evidence of corporation it is customary to fil. articles of incorporation setting forth the names of th' incorporators, purpose of incorporation and the power of the corporation. The charter of a corporation formei; under general law does not consist of articles of associa tion alone, but consists of such articles taken in connec tion with the law under which the organization takes place (See Lincoln Shoe Co. v. Sheldon, 44 Neb. 279; Stone Co v. Thomas (Ind.) 35 L. R. A. N\ EL, 646; Oregon Co. v Oregonian Co., 130 U. S. 1.) When the incorporation of a corporation is complete it may be said to have corporate existence and franchise. A franchise ordinarily springs from contracts between the sovereign power and private citizens made upon valuable consideration for purposes of public benefit as well as individual advantage. The kinds of business which cor - porations are authorized to carry on are powers, but not franchises, because they are rights possessed by all citi - zens who choose to engage in them without legislative grant. The only franchise which such corporations possess is the general franchise to be or exist as a corporate entity. Hence if they engage in any business not author - ized by the statute it is ultra vires, or in excess of their powers, but not a usurpation of franchises not granted. It is now the settled rule of both the English and American courts that an act of incorporation is a bargain between a company of adventurers, or the incorporators, and the public; that the rights of the corporation are such as the very terms of the statute confer, and that arty ambiguity in it must operate against the adventurers and in favor "of the public. (See 7 R. L. C. Sec. 69, p. 91.) As said by the Federal Supreme Court, the rule of con- </seg>
            <seg id="p128">OPINIONS 121 struction in this class of cases is that it shall be most strongly against the corporation. Every reasonable doubt tnust be solved adversely. Nothing is to be taken as con - ceded but what is given in unmistakable terms, or by im- plication equally clear. The affirmative must be shown; &gt;ilence is negation, and doubt is fatal to the claim. This doctrine is vital to the public welfare and is axiomatic in the supreme court. (See Northwestern Fertilizing Co. v. Hyde Park, 97 U. S. 659.) As before stated, a corporation is an artificial being reated by law for a special purpose and as such it stands on a very different footing from a natural person. (See Alby v. Billings, 35 Miss. 618.) A corporation has no natural rights or capacities such as those possessed by individuals or ordinary partnerships, and if such a power is claimed, words giving the power, or from which it is necessarily implied, must be found in the charter or it does not exist. (See Association v. Bank (111.) 64 L. R. A. 399; Davis v. R. R. Co., 131 Mass. 258; George v. R. R. Co., (Nev.) 38 Pac. 441; Blair v. Ins. Co., 10 Mo. 559.) A corporation possesses such powers and such powers only as are expressly or impliedly granted by its charter, or such as are necessary to carry into effect the powers expressly granted. To this may be added the further rule that, acts which are not within the powers so conferred are by implication prohibited, and this is true without re - gard to their beneficial nature and also aside from the question of ratification by all stockholders. (See 3 Thomp - son, Corporations, Vol. 3, sec. 2106, and cases cited there - under.) The United States supreme court has repeated - ly held the general doctrine to be that the powers of cor - porations organized under legislative statutes are such, and such only, as those statutes confer. Conceding the rule applicable to all statutes, that what is fairly implied is as much granted as what is expressed, it remains that the charter of a corporation is the measure of its powers, and that the enumeration of these powers implies the ex - clusion of all others. (See Thomas v. R. R. Co., 101 U. S. 71; Transportation Co. v. Pullman Co., 139 U. S. 24.) </seg>
            <seg id="p129">122 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL The prime rule in the construction of corporate powers is that the laws authorizing incorporation and the articles of incorporation are enabling and not restrictive, hence where the enabling act, or charter, is silent as to particu - lar powers generally this means that there is no authority to do them, unless they are incidental to the express powers granted. (See Thomas v. R. R. Co., Supra.) In the construction of corporate powers the statutory purposes will not be combined. The corporation must be formed for any one or more of the purposes specified in any one of the subdivisions of the statute, but not for two or more purposes as designated in different subdivisions. (See Ramsay v. Tod (Tex.) 69 S. W. 133.) Now, referring to the implied powers of a corporation, the New York court has stated that the grant of powers being in derrogation of common right is not to be extended by implication and that the act conferring the power must be strictly complied with. These principles are element - ary, but statutes granting these powers are not in them - selves construed so literally or so strictly as to defeat the evident purpose of the legislature. They are to receive a reasonably strict and guarded construction and the powers granted will extend no further than expressly stated or than is necessary to accomplish the general scope and purpose of the grant. If there remains a doubt as to the extent of its powers after all reasonable intend - ments in its favor, the doubt should be solved adversely to the claim of power. (See R. R. Co. v. Kip, 46 N. Y. 546.) The principle is that the powers which the corpora - tion takes by implication are restricted to the purpose for which the corporation has been created and cannot be lawfully exercised by it for different purposes. (See Shields v. Ohio, 95 U. S. 319; U. S. v. Canal Co., 1 Flip. (U. S.) 260.) The rule deduced from the cases is that if implied power to do a particular act is claimed it must be made to appear that the act done was directly and immediately appropriate to the execution of the specific powers granted </seg>
            <seg id="p130">OPINIONS 123 &gt;y the charter. It is not sufficient that it bore a slight »r remote relation to the charter powers. (See Bank v. v risk Co. (Minn.) 74 N. W. 160; People v. Gas Co., (111.) 12 N. E. 798; People v. Pullman Co., (111.) 64 L. R. A. 366; \I. E. Church v. Dixon, (111.) 52 X. E. 887.) A corporate benefit is not the test of corporate power. Some courts have lost sight of the prevailing doctrine that corporations can exercise only such powers as are express - ly conferred, or as may be taken by necessary implica - tion and have attempted to establish the converse of this proposition ; and have asserted that corporations may do any act that it is not prohibited by their charter. But such a doctrine has never obtained any foothold in this country. (See Thompson on Corporations, 3, Sec. 2118.) One of the principal instances of the ordinary and gen - eral corporation is its capital stock. The capital stock of a corporation is the fundamental property or other means contributed by the shareholders as the financial basis for the prosecution of the business of the corpora - tion. As a rule the capital stock is divided, for purposes of representation, into shares of stock. The tangible prop - erty of a corporation and the shares of stock therein are separate and distinct kinds of property, the first being the property of the artificial person, to-wit: the corpora - tion, the latter the property of the individual owner. Or - dinarily the shares of stock, or certificates of stock, are held by the individual, and as such are representative of that individual's personal interest in the corporation and represents in part his contract with the corporation, and by means of which the individual customarily exercises a voice of control in the affairs of the corporation. With this brief survey of the fundamentals of corpor - ate existence we can now again turn our attention to the first question as cited at the beginning of this discussion, to-wit, whether or not a general corporation organized under Nebraska law for primary purposes other than be - coming a holding company, can purchase and own stock in other corporations, domestic or foreign. As we have </seg>
            <seg id="p131">124 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL / seen so far, a corporation is an artificial being created by the sovereign power, which, in this instance, is the state. Accordingly it would be necessary to turn to the constitu - tion and statutes of this state as representative of the creative power of this sovereign. Starting with the constitution of this state, we find our first reference to corporations under Section 15 of Article III, which is worded as follows: "Sec. 15. (Special legislation prohibited). The legislature shall not pass local or special laws in any of the following cases, that is to say:" "Granting to any corporation, association, or individual, the right to lay down railroad tracks, or amending existing charters for such purpose. Granting to any corporation, association, or individual any special or exclusive privileges, immunity, or franchise whatever. In all other cases where a general law can be made applicable, no special law shall be enacted." Passing this provision for the moment, we find the next reference to corporations in Article XI. For the purpose of this discussion this article is not pertinent. The next reference is found in Article Xl-a, and I do not consider this article pertinent. Reference is now made to Article Xl-b, entitled "Miscellaneous Corporations," and this article in toto is as follows: "Section 1. (Incorporation* by general law.) No corporation shall be created by special law, nor its charter extended, changed, or amended, except those for charitable, educational, penal, or reformatory purposes, which are to be and remain under the patronage and control of the state, but the legislature shall provide by general laws for the organi - zation of all corporations hereafter to be created. All general laws passed pursuant to this section may be altered from time to time, or repealed. Sec. 2. (Street railroad*.) No such general law shall be passed by the legislature granting the right to construct and operate a street rail - road within any city, town, or incorporated village without first requir - ing the consent of a majority of the electors thereof. Sec. 3. ( Suits.) All corporations may sue and be sued in like cases as natural persons. Sec. 4. (Liability, ttock tubicribert.) In all cases of claims against corporations and joint stock associations, the exact amount justly due </seg>
            <seg id="p132">OPINIONS 125 I shall be first ascertained, and after the corporate property shall have &gt;een exhausted the original subscribers thereof shall be individually table to the extent of their unpaid subscription, and the liability for he unpaid subscription shall follow the stock. Sec. 5. (Elections.) The legislature shall provide by law that in ill elections for directors or managers of incorporated companies, every ■stockholder shall have the right to vote in person or proxy, for the number of shares of stock owned by him, for as many persons as there are directors or managers to be elected, or to cumulate said shares and give one candidate as many votes as the number of directors multiplied by the number of his shares of stock, shall equal, or to distribute them upon the same principle among as many candidates as he shall think fit, and such directors or managers shall not be elected in any other manner. Sec. 6. {Existing charters.) All existing charters or grants of special or exclusive privileges, under which organization shall not have taken place, or which shall not be in operation within sixty days from the time this constitution takes effect, shall thereafter have no validity or effect whatever. Sec. 7. (Banks, liability of stockholders, statements.) Every stock - holder in a banking corporation or institution shall be individually re - sponsible and liable to its creditors over and above the amount of stock by him held to an amount equal to his respective stock or shares so held, for all its liabilities accruing while he remains such stockholder, and all banking corporations shall publish quarterly statements under oath of their assets and liabilities." Paying particular attention to Section 1 of the last above quoted article, I would draw your attention to a portion of said article which to me appears pertinent to this discussion and pertinent to corporation life in this state. The portion of the article referred to is that part commencing in line 4 of the article as cited in the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, and beginning with the disjunctive "but," and reading, "but the legislature shall provide by general laws for the organization of all cor - porations hereafter to be created." To my mind a rea - sonable interpretation of this provision is to the effect that hereafter in this state corporations shall not be created by common law, nor by prescription, but instead shall be created by means of legislative act and charter, and the means of such creation shall be prescribed by the legislative body. This provision is in effect an enabling </seg>
            <seg id="p133">126 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL act, and not only an enabling act, but likewise a restric - tive one, and especially is this true when considered in the light of Article III, supra, and in view of line one of the immediate article providing against the creation of corporations by special law. Passing on for the moment and further examining the, constitution, I am unable to find any further reference to corporations. Consequently the next source of informa - tion is properly the general statutes of this state. In turn - ing to the general corporation law of this state as ex - pressed in our statutes and commencing with Section 549 of the Revised Statutes for 1913, and particularly Section 565, it is stated that: "Any number of persons may be associated and incorporated for the transaction of any lawful business including the construction of canals, railways, bridges and other works of internal improvement." The next section, to- wit, Sec. 566, is as follows: "Enumeration of corporate power*. — Every corporation, as such, has power: First — To have succession by its corporate name; Second — To sue and to be sued, to complain and defend in courts of law and equity; Third — To make and use a common seal, and alter the same at pleasure; Fourth — To hold personal estate, and all such real estate as may be necessary for the legitimate business of the corporation; Fifth — To render the interest of the stockholders transferable; Sixth — To appoint such subordinate officers and agents as the busi - ness of the corporation may require, and to allow them a suitable com - pensation therefor; Seventh — To make by-laws, not inconsistent with any existing law, for the management of its affairs." The next section, to-wit, Sec. 567, provides "Power* — in whom vetted. — The powers enumerated in the preced - ing section shall vest in every corporation in this state, whether the same be formed without, or by legislative enactment, although they may not be specified in its charter, or as articles of association." </seg>
            <seg id="p134">OPINIONS 127 i S &gt; ) I And Section 568 provides: "Articlet of incorporation — where filed. — Every corporation, previous 3 the commencement of any business, except its own organization, where ne same is not formed by legislative enactment, must adopt articles of and have them filed in the office of the secretary of state, nd recorded in a book kept for that purpose, and domestic corporations lust also file with the county clerk in the county where their head - uarters are located. Banking organizations and building and loan as - ociations must also file a copy of their articles of incorporation with he state banking board. Insurance companies, bonding companies and ill organizations under the control of the state auditor must also file copy of their articles of incorporation with the department; PROVIDED, his section shall not apply to mutual fraternal benefit societies or asso - •iations." Now, referring back to a few sections the next import - ant provision f/&gt;r the purposes of this discussion is con - tained in Section 550, which provides: "Employ meant for object of incorporation only. — No company or association incorporated under the provisions of this chapter, shall em - ploy its stock, means, assets or other property, directly or indirectly, for any other purpose whatever than to accomplish the legitimate object of its creation." There are many other sections in this particular statute relative to corporations, but they will not be cited here as 1 do not believe that they will be found pertinent to this discussion. What we are chiefly interested in here is how corporations are formed generally in this state, what powers they shall have, who may form a corporation, what evidence of incorporation is necessary and for what ob - ject the means of the incorporation may be employed, and I take it that these points are sufficiently set out in the sections as quoted. Briefly discussing these sections. I believe it will be found that the sections as quoted, as well as all other sections of this statute, are absolutely silent on the question at hand. I have been unable to find any express authority or authority by implication whereby a corporation is authorized and empowered to purchase, own and hold the stock of other corporations, domestic or foreign. I would qualify this statement by </seg>
            <seg id="p135">128 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL a statement to the effect that there are possibly thre-, exceptions wherein the statutes expressly authorize th-, holding of stock under certain restrictions as stated in thy statute. Those exceptions are with regard to trust com panies, building and loan associations, and a more recen section than found in the 1913 Revised Statutes, to-wit, the section dealing with co-operative companies as foum in Chapter 57 of the 1919 Session Laws. Referring t&lt; these particular exceptions it appears to me that sau exceptions in themselves are an indication of the fact tha the legislature did not intend that general corporation* should be authorized and empowered to hold stock in ont another by reason of the fact that the legislature has seei fit to empower such a holding in particular instances, ano at the same time has thrown around these exceptions re - strictive conditions, thus evidencing an intention to pro - tect the stock purchasing corporation from the usual evils attendant upon such purchases. Now that we have briefly considered the statutes and constitution we can properly turn to the policy of the law as developed by the courts of this state, and one of the first cases wherein our supreme court passed upon this question was in the case of Nebraska Shirt Co. v. Horton in the 3rd Unoff., also cited in 93 N. W. 225. This par - ticular case was an action brought by a trustee in bank - ruptcy of the Greater American Exposition, a corporation suing the defendant, a manufacturing corporation upon a stock subscription. The defendant pleaded that it was a manufacturing corporation organized solely for the manufacture of shirts. Commissioner Pound in handing down the decision stated: "Corporations have quite enough power without allowing them to Incorporate themselves In new companies. Unless authorized by statute, a corporation has no power to subscribe to the capital stock of another corporation, and such a subscription is not binding." (Citing cases there - after.) The next case in the development of this doctrine is the case of Bank of Commerce v. J. T. Hart, reported in </seg>
            <seg id="p136">OPINIONS 129 1 M Neb. 197. In this case the bank sued Hart on a note •xecuted and delivered by him to the bank. Hart de - ended on the ground that he had paid the bank a certain ium of money with which payment the bank had not •redited him. Hart claimed to have made the payment &gt;y the sale of certain shares of stock in an insurance com - &gt;any to the bank through its cashier. The bank replied hat the cashier was individually liable and not the bank. Commissioner Ragan, in handing down the decision, held :hat the bank did not have the power to subscribe to this stock and stated as follows: "The language employed in the banking act excludes by necessary implication the capacity to carry on any other business than that of banking and the adoption of any other methods for the prosecution of such business than those especially pointed out by the statute. The spirit of the law, as well as sound public policy, forbid these institutions from risking money entrusted to their care in doubtful speculation or enter - prises." These two cases seem to be the principal decisions handed down by our Supreme Court, and so far as I am able to ascertain the case cited in the 3rd Unoff. has be - come the accepted doctrine of this state and a contrary decision reversing this case has never been handed down. Now in support of the doctrine as laid down by our supreme court I would hereafter briefly support this par - ticular rule of law by referring to decisions of other juris - dictions, and for that purpose I would cite the following cases. For this purpose direct reference is at this point made to the rule as set forth at the beginning of this dis - cussion as taken from Thompson, Vol. 4, supra, and a further rule is developed in the majority of jurisdictions in this country to the effect that a contract of a corpora - tion to- purchase or become the owner of any portion of the capital stock of another corporation is ultra vires, unless authority to do so is clearly conferred. This rule is supported by cases of Bank v. Agency, 24 Conn. 159; Railroad Co. v. Collins, 40 Ga. 582; Dunbar v. Telephone Co., (111.) 79 N. E. 423; Hill v. Hisbet, 100 Ind. 341; McCutcheon v. Capsul Co., 71 Fed. 787; Saving Co. v. </seg>
            <seg id="p137">130 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Convent, 133 Fed. 354; and numerous other cases froir Mississippi, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, and the cast of Pearce v. Madison, 21 Howard U. S. 441. A question similar to the one proposed in this discus - sion was raised in the case of Denny Hotel Co. v. Schram reported in 6 Wash. 134. In this particular case Justice Dunbar in discussing the right of a corporation to pur - chase and hold stock in another corporation said: "A corporation cannot in the absence of express authority become an incorporator by subscribing for shares in a new corporation, nor can It do this indirectly through persons acting as its agents or tools. The right of forming a corporation is conferred by the incorporation laws only upon persons acting individually and not upon associations. This it seems to us, for manifest and manifold reasons, is in accordance with public policy." Mr. Freeman in discussing this case, and in a note found in 36 Am. State, 134, says: "Furthermore, as the holding of stock by one corporation in another naturally tends to create, or, at least, to aid and encourage, monopolies, it is not sustainable under any circumstances when it appears that the acquisition of such stock was for the purpose of obtaining the control of another corporation and thereby enabling a single corporation to possess and exercise the franchises and control the business operations of two or more corporations." "It may be said that no field of fraud has been so fertile as have been the devices through which, by means of these ancillary or absorb ing corporations, the business of the chief corporation has been conducted by, and its profits diverted to, its conspiring managers. "The abhorrence by the law of all monopolies necessarily insures its condemnation of every transaction by which one corporation seeks to obtain the control and management of another, and therefore every attempt to obtain stock in another corporation for such a purpose is unlawful." • • • "The power to purchase stock must be clear and not by implication and this too, under a rule of construction that a charter is to be strictly construed as against the power." • • • "Many cases might be cited maintaining that the power of one corporation to purchase the stock of another must be authorised by its charter or by general law, and that while this power may sometimes be incidental to some undisputed authority, its exercise may never be sustained as an Incidental power when the object is to obtain the control and manage- </seg>

It is also established law that where a statute fails to give authority to a corporation to subscribe for shares of stock of another corporation it cannot secure this power by assuming it in its articles of incorporation. (See cases last above cited and also Franklin Co. v. Leiviston Inst., 68 Me. 43; Bank v. Jones, 95 N. Y. 115; Xew Orleans Co. v. Dook Co., (La.) 26 Am. 90; Central Co. v. Railroad Co., 31 N. J.

The rule as developed by the United States Supreme Court in this respect is laid down in the case of De LaVergne Co. v. German, 175 U. S. 40, in which case the court said : "That unless express permission be given to do so it is not within the general powers of a&gt; corporation to purchase the stock of other cor - porations for the purpose of controlling their management." "As the powers of corporations, created by legislative act, are limited to such as the act expressly confers, and the enumeration of these implies the exclusion of all others, it follows that, unless express permission be given to do so, it is not within the general powers of a corporation to purchase the stock of other corporations for the purpose of controlling their management. First National Bank v. National Exchange Bank, 92 U. S. 122, 128; People v. Chicago Gas Trust Co., 130 111. 268; Milbank v. R. R. Co., 64 Howard Pr. 20; Bank v. Meriden Co., 24 Conn. 159." The courts have repeatedly pointed out that if a cor - poration can purchase any portion of capital stock of an - other corporation it can certainly purchase the whole and invest all its funds in that way and thus be enabled to engage successfully in a business entirely foreign to the purposes for which it was created, and this the law will not allow. Franklin Co. v. Lewiston, 68 Me. 43; Bank v. Bank, 36 0. St. 350.

Simmer v. Marty, 23 Fed. Cases 13809; People v. Chicago Gas Trust Co. (111.) 8 L. R. A. 497-n. In the case of Dunbar v. American Tel. Co. reported in 238 111. 456, the facts and findings were to the following effect: In this case the defendant company purchased the stock control of plaintiff company. Defendant was a New York incorporation, while plaintiff was an Illinois corporation. The question was raised whether or not defendant could retain the stock control of the plaintiff company and the court, through Justice Vickers, held that the defendant company could exercise no powers in Illinois which could not be exercised lawfully by a domestic corporation in the same line of business. The attempt by defendant to pur - chase a controlling interest in plaintiff company was un - lawful. "The word 'unlawful', as applied to the purpose and acts of corpora - tions, is not used exclusively in the sense of nialum in se or malum prohibitum. It is often employed to designate powers which corporations are not authorized to exercise or contracts which they are not authorized to make, — or, in other words, such acts, powers and contracts as are ultra vires. Neither a foreign nor a domestic corporation can lawfully become a stockholder in another corporation unless such power is ex - pressly given or necessarily implied, and especially is this true where the object is to obtain the control of such other corporation. There Is no provision of our general incorporation law authorizing one corpora - tion to purchase and hold shares of stock in other corporations, and there is no implied power to so purchase stock in other corporations except where it is necessary to carry into effect the objects for which such corporation was formed." • • • "As a general proposition, all contracts and agreements, of every kind and character, made and en - tered into by those engaged in an employment or business impressed with a public character, which tend to prevent competition between those engaged in like employment are opposed to the public policy of Illinois and are therefore unlawful. All agreements and contracts tending to create monopolies and prevent proper competition are by the common law illegal and void. The public policy of the state on any question is to be sought for in the constitution and legislation as interpreted and </seg>
            <seg id="p140">133 OPINIONS expounded by the courts. The Illinois constitution provides that the general assembly shall pass no local or special law for 'granting to any corporation, association or individual any special or exclusive privilege, immunity or franchise whatever.' This is a clear declaration that the public policy of the state is opposed to all exclusive and monopolistic franchises and powers of whatever kind and character." • • • "A contract made in violation of the public policy of the state is utterly void." * * "Regard for the public welfare is the highest law of the land." In the syllabus of this opinion it is stated: "To maintain a bill to set aside a purchase of stock by a corpora - tion upon the ground that its purpose and tendency was to restrict com - petition and that it was illegal and void because contrary to the public policy of the state, it is not necessary to prove a violation of the anti - trust law, nor is it necessary, in order to justify a decree in favor of the complainants, that the proof shall establish the averments of the bill beyond a reasonable doubt." The case of the People v. Union Gas Co. reported in 2."&gt;4 111. 393, approves the cases last above set out, and in addition Justice Farmer said: "A corporation organized under the general incorporation act to furnish and sell gas, electricity and ether lighting and heating substances for light, heat and power p..ipj£,cs tor public and private uses, has no express power to purchase stock in other corporations and it is not neces - sary to make such purchase to carry into effect the object for which It was formed. Such power is not given to it by implication." Probably one of the best discussions of this entire ques - tion is given by Justice Magruder of the Illinois supreme court in the case of the People v. Chicago Gas Trust Com - pany, reported in 22 N. E. 798. This particular case is cited in all jurisdictions and apparently sets forth the general rule. The facts in this case were as follows: The Chicago Gas Trust Company was organized under the general incorporation act of 1887. The object of its incorporation as set out in the statement filed with the secretary of state was to "build, erect, purchase or lease works for the manufacture, sale and distribution of gas and electricity for heating, lighting and power purposes and — to purchase and hold or sell the capital stock" • • • "of any gas works or gas company or companies, or any electric company or companies in Chicago, Cook </seg>

The said company purchased less than the majority capi-i tal stock of ail the other gas companies then engaged in manufacturing and distributing gas in the city of Chicago and information was filed against the Gas Trust Company alleging that said company had no power to purchase and hold the capital stock of other gas companies. Justice Magruder rendered the opinion and held in part as fol - lows: "Corporations can only exercise such powers as may be conferred by the legislative body creating them, either in express terms or by necessary implication, and the implied powers are presumed to exist to enable such bodies to carry out the express powers granted and to ac - complish the purposes of their creation. An incidental power is one that is directly or immediately appropriate to the execution of the specific power granted and not one that has merely some slight or remote rela- tion to it." "Where a charter confers upon a corporation the power to maintain and operate works for the manufacture and sale of gas, it is not a neces - sary Implication that the power to purchase stock in other gas companies should also exist. There is no necessary connection between manufac - turing gas and buying stocks. The right of a corporation to invest in shares of another company cannot be implied because both companies are engaged in the same kind of business. If, then, the power to pur - chase outside stocks cannot be implied from the power to operate gas works and make and sell gas, a company to whom the latter power has been expressly granted cannot exercise the former without legislative authority to do so. This is the law as settled by the great weight of authority. "The general incorporation act of this state does not. In express terms. confer upon the corporations organized under it the power to purchase and hold shares of stock in other corporations. It is silent upon that subject. The only powers granted by it are the ordinary corporate powers, such as the rights to be bodies corporate and politic, to sue and be sued, to have a common seal, etc. The charter of a corporation formed under such a general law does not consist of the articles of as sociatlon alone, but of such articles taken in connection with the law under which the organization takes place." * * "Viewing the main purpose for which appellee was formed, the incorporators could not tack on and connect with such main purpose the power to buy and hold stock in other gas companies by merely describing such power in the statement. To hold, that they could confer such power by writing it down in the statement would be to hold that the general assembly could clothe them with a part of its legislative functions. </seg>
            <seg id="p142">OPINIONS 135 When a corporation is formed under the general incorporation act for the purpose of carrying on a lawful business, the law, and not the statement, or the license, or the certificate, must determine what powers can be exercised as incidents to such business." The final conclusion of the court is properly set forth in the syllabi, wherein it is stated: "A corporation formed for the purpose of manufacturing and selling gas under the general incorporation law, which provides that corpora - tions formed under it 'may own • • • so much real and personal estate as shall be necessary for the transaction of their business. • • • * and may have and exercise all the powers necessary and requisite to carry into effect the objects for which they may be formed,' has no power to purchase and hold or sell shares of stock in other gas com - panies, as an incident to the purpose of its formation, even though such power is specified in its articles of incorporation." It would be possible to cover a great many more pages with citations from courts all over the land supporting the general rule as laid down in the beginning of this dis - cussion of this question. But suffice it to say that it is my opinion, as supported by the maximum authorities that a Nebraska corporation organized for general pur - poses other than as a mere holding company cannot di - rectly purchase, own, and hold the stock of other corpora - tions, foreign or domestic, except for the purpose of re - ceiving payment of or security for a debt, or unless the circumstances are such that the transaction is a necessary or reasonable means of carrying out or executing the ob - ject of its incorporation and is a direct incident thereto. I know of no express authority, legislative or otherwise* given to domestic corporations authorizing them to hold the stock of other corporations, and in view of the gen - eral rule as heretofore stated, it is not sufficient that a corporation expressly includes this authority in its ar - ticles of association, or its charter. For its articles of association will be strictly construed in accordance with the creative statute, and its charter will be likewise strict - ly construed in accordance with the law of this jurisdic - tion. </seg>
            <seg id="p143">136 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL i As indicative of the position of our Nebraska supreme court on this particular point, I would draw your atten - tion to the case of State v. Nebraska Distilling Co.. 29 Neb. at 718, wherein the court, in speaking of the proper construction of articles of association of corporations or - ganized under the general law, said: "We have to consider when- such articles became the subject of con - struction that they are in a sense, ex parte. Their formation and execu - tion — what shall be put into them, as well as what shall be left out — do not take place under the supervision of any official authority what - ever. They are the production ot private citizens, gotten up in the in - terest of the parties who propose to become incorporators and stimulated by their zeal for the personal advantage of the parties concerned, rather than the general good. * * These articles, which necessarily assume, by the sole actions of the corporators, enormous powers, many of which have been heretofore considered of a public character, some times affect - ing the interests of the public very largely and very seriously, do not commend themselves to the judicial mind as a class of instruments re - quiring or justifying any liberal construction. Where the question is whether they conform to the authority given by statute in regard to cor - porate organizations, it is always to be determined upon just construc - tion of the powers granted therein, with a due regard for all the other laws of the state upon that subject. * • • The manner in which these powers shall be exercised, and their subjection to the general laws of the state, and its general principles of public policy, are not in any sense enlarged by inserting in the articles of association the authority to depart therefrom." Now we come to the second question as proposed in the beginning of this discussion, to-wit; in effect: Whether or not a corporation commonly known and described as a holding company and organized for the principal, pri - mary and sole purpose of purchasing, owning and holding by a corporation of stock of other and subsidiary corpora - tions can be legally recognized and incorporated under Nebraska law, and if a foreign corporation, whether the same can be legally recognized and authorized to transact its business in the state of Nebraska. It is not my purpose with respect to the latter part of this question to in any way discuss the question of recog - nition by this state of corporations validly incorporated in other states. For the purposes of this discussion I am </seg>
            <seg id="p144">OPINIONS 137 acting under the assumption that undue preference will not be given to foreign corporations over domestic corpora - tions, and that a foreign corporation will not be allowed to exercise greater powers than those conferred upon domestic corporations. Accordingly with that point in mind it will only be necessary to discuss here the validity of a Nebraska corporation formed for the purposes above set forth. I take it that if the decision as arrived at with regard to the first question proposed here is correct, and in the absence of express statutory authority being granted for this purpose, that then we need only bother to discuss the proposition of whether or not such a corporation can be formed by reason of implication or the interpretation of the language used by the legislature in creating the gen - eral incorporation acts of this state. I am of the impres - sion that all interested parties will agree with me to the effect that so far as the constitution or statutes are con - cerned, there is no direct power given to corporations for the purpose of forming holding companies. It has been suggested that Section 565 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, authorizes such an incorporation. For convenience I will again set out this section: "Hove formed — Any number of persons may be associated and incor - porated for the transaction of any lawful business, including the con - struction of canals, railways, bridges, and other works of internal im - provement." The theory with regard to this section being advanced that the term "lawful business" can be properly inter - preted to include the formation of a holding company. Accordingly let us see if we can discover any interpreta - tion placed upon a similar construction by any of the courts either in this jurisdiction or the several jurisdic - tions. One of the cases which I have been able to discover which might have any bearing upon this particular point is the case of Market St. Ry. Co. v. Hellman, a California case reported in the 42nd Pac. 225. In this particular </seg>
            <seg id="p145">138 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL &lt; case, and as one of the points thereof, it was contended that one corporation could not hold stock in another cor - poration in the state of California. The holding corpora - tion was empowered by its articles of incorporation, among other things, for the purpose of buying, selling and deal - ing in all kinds of public stocks, bonds and securities. In passing upon this question Justice Searls stated: "Whether the purchase by a corporation of shares in another cor - poration is ultra vires or not is said to depend upon the purpose for which it is made and whether under the circumstances it is a reasonabla or necessary means of carrying out corporate objects." (Citing Hill v. Xisbet, 100 Ind. 341). In determining this point the court turned to the civil code and that particular section thereof which provided that: "Private corporations may be formed for any purpose for which in - dividuals may lawfully associate themselves." In discussing this section, which, as will be seen, is somewhat of a character similar to the Nebraska section, the court said: "It is beyond controversy that individuals may lawfully associate themselves for the purpose of purchasing, selling and dealing in all kinds of public and private stocks, bonds and securities. The Pacific Improve ment Company, having been organized for exactly that purpose, it is Infra vires to purchase, hold and sell stock in other corporations." This was as far as the court went on this particular point and no further reference was made to the code pro - vision other than as here stated. .Now let us compare this particular provision with the provision of the Nebraska statutes. We find (1) that un - der the Nebraska statute any number of individuals may be associated or incorporated for the transaction of any lawful business. Now this in turn raises the question of whether or not the holding of stock by one corporation in another corporation is a lawful business, and (2) whether such a holding would have been a lawful business at common law. The section as stated plainly refers to a </seg>
            <seg id="p146">OPINIONS 139 lawful business to be conducted by a corporation, and not any lawful business that might be conducted by individ - uals, there being a distinct difference between individuals and a corporation. This point, I take it, is too well estab - lished to even merit of citations. Now, turning to the California section, it is to be noted that private corporations are given by statute the full and complete right to transact business, or form for any pur - pose which individuals might transact or lawfully asso - ciate for. Under what I believe to be a reasonable con - struction of the Nebraska section, it appears to me that our legislature has attempted to retain its sovereign au - thority and not to dispense the same only along such lines as it may see fit and not to throw open the field and recog - nize corporations and individuals as being of a par, and the reverse of this is apparently true with regard to the California law. In order to more clearly bring out the point I am attempting to make I would again at this point refer to authorities as cited in the fore part of this discussion to the following effect: "A corporation is an artificial being created by law for a specified purpose and as such it stands on a very different footing from a natural person." Alby v. Billing*, 35 Miss. 6181. "A corporation has no natural rights or capacities such as those possessed by individuals or ordinary partnerships, and if such power is claimed words giving the power or from which it is necessarily im - plied must be found In the charter or it does not exist." Attociation v. Bank (111.) 64 L. R. A. 399; Dart* v. R. R. Co., 139 Mass. 258; George v. R. R. Co., (Nev.) 38 Pac. 441; Blair v. In*. Co., 10 Mo. 559; see also Cattatt v. Mitchell Co., 150 Fed. 32; Boca Mill Co. v. Curry (Cal.) 97 Pac. 1117; Meinhard Co. v. Mercantile Co. (Ga.) 61 S. E. 34; Julian v. K. C. 8tar Co. 209 Mo. 35. The only other case which I have been able to discover that will throw any light upon this particular provision of our statute is the case of People v. Chicago Gas Trust Co., decided by the Illinois supreme court and reported in 22 N. E. Rep. 812. Justice Magruder in handing down the opinion of the court takes time to thoroughly discuss the right of a holding company to transact business in the </seg>
            <seg id="p147">140 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL state of Illinois. For the basis of his opinion he takes up the Illinois statutes, and particularly that section of the statute which provided, "that corporations may be formed in the manner provided in this act for any lawful pur - pose excepting banking, insurance, real estate, brokerage, the operation of railways and the business of loaning money." As will be readily seen, this section in its fore - part is in a way a direct counterpart of the Nebraska sec - tion. The Nebraska section includes the right to con - struct railroads, canals and other internal improvements, whereas the Illinois section is restrictive to that extent. The Illinois statute provides that corporations may be formed for any lawful purpose other than as restricted, while the Nebraska statute provides that corporations may be formed for the transaction of any lawful business. In handing down his opinion Justice Magruder stated in part as follows: "When a corporation is formed under the general incorporation act for the purpose of carrying on a lawful business the law and not the statement of the license or the certificate must determine what powers can be exercised as incidents of such business." * * "If appellee can purchase and hold the capital stock of other gas companies, it can hold all the capital stock of such companies." • • • "One result is that the Chicago Gas Trust Company can control the four other companies. The quettion it not whether it hat attempted to exercise such control; the law looks to the general tendency of the power conferred." • • "The con- trol of the four companies by the appellee — an outside and independent corporation — suppresses competition between them, and destroys their diversity of interest, and all motive for competition. There is thus built up a virtual monopoly in the manufacture and sale of gas." * "The purpose for which a corporation is formed, under the act, must be a lawful purpose. So far as appellee was organized with the object of purchasing and holding all the shares of the capital stock of any gas company in Chicago or Illinois, it was not organized for a lawful purpose, and all acts done by It towards the accomplishment of such object are illegal and void. The word 'unlawful', as applied to corpora - tions, is not used exclusively in the sense of malum in se or nialum pro - hibitus. It is also used to designate powers which corporations are not authorized to exercise, or contracts which they are not authorized to make, or acts which they are not authorized to do; or, in other words, such acts, powers, and contracts as are ultra vires. </seg>
            <seg id="p148">OPINIONS 141 i The business of manufacturing and distributing illuminating gas, by - means of pipes laid in the streets of a city, is a business tf a public character. It is the exercise of a franchise belonging to the state. The services rendered and to be rendered for such a grant are of a public nature. Companies engaged in such business owe a duty to the public. Any unreasonable restraint upon the performance of such duty is pre - judicial to the public interest, and in contravention to public policy." (Citing cases including Oibbs v. Out Co. 130 U. S. 396). "Whatever tends to prevent competition between those engaged in a public employment or business impressed with a public character is opposed to public policy, and therefore unlawful. Whatever tends to create a monopoly is un - lawful as being contrary to public policy." (Citing cases&gt; • • • * " 'Public policy unquestionably favors competition in trade, to the end that its commodities may be afforded to the consumer as cheaply as possible, and is opposed to monopolies which tend to advance market prices, to the injury of the general public' " We are reminded by counsel that the application by the courts cf public policy to the law is a usurpation ol legislative functions. And undoubtedly some courts have gone so far as to deserve the charge of such usurpation. But it is the duty of the judiciary to refuse to sustain that which is against the public policy of the state, when such public policy is manifested by the legislation or fundamental law of the state. By the revised statutes it is provided that 'the common law of England, so far as the same is applicable and of a general nature, • * • shall be the rule of deci - sion, and shall be considered of full force until repealed by legislative authority.' " Attention is drawn at this point to the fact that Sec - tion 3697 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913 provides as follows: "Common luxe in force. — So much of the common law of England as is applicable and not inconsistent with the constitution of the United States, with the organic law of this state, or with any law passed or to be passed by the legislature of this state, is adopted and declared to be law within the state of Nebraska." "Public policy is that principle of law which holds that no subject or citizen can lawfully do that which has a tendency to be injurious to the public, or against the public good. This principle owes its exist - ence to the very sources from which the common law is supplied. The common law will not permit individuals to oblige themselves by a con - tract either to do or not to do anything, when the thing to be done or omitted is in any degree clearly injurious to the public.

" Attention is drawn at this point to our constitutional provisions in this respect, and particularly to Section 15 of Article III of the constitution, which provides: "The legislature shall not pass local or special laws in any of the following cases, that is to say: "Granting to any corporation, association or individual, the right to lay down railroad tracks, or amending existing charters for such pur- Granting to any corporation, association, or individual, any special or exclusive privileges, immunity, or franchise whatever. In all other cases where a general law can be made applicable, no special law shall be enacted." Article Xl-b, Section 1. "No corporation shall be created by special law, nor its charter extended, changed, or amended, except those for charitable, educational, penal, or reformatory purposes, which are to be and remain under the patronage and control of the state, but the legisla - ture shall provide by general laws for the organization of all corpora - tions hereafter to be created." • • • "Manifestly the constitution of 1870 reserves the old policy of grant - ing exclusive privileges to gas companies. After 1870 the public policy of the state was against the granting of exclusive privileges to corpora - tions of any kind. The general incorporation act of 1872 was passed in pursuance of section 1, art. 11. The prohibition of special charters granting exclusive privileges and the authorization of incorporations under a general law, followed by the passage of such a law, put the people of this state on record as being opposed to the creation of mono - polies of all kinds. </seg>
            <seg id="p150">OPINIONS 143 But of what avail is it that any number of gas companies may be formed under the general incorporation law, if a giant trust company can be clothed with the power of buying up and holding the stock and property of such companies, and, through the control thereby attained, can direct all their operations, and weld them into on* huge combina - tion? The several privileges or franchises intended to be exercised by a number of companies are thus vested exclusively in a single corpora - tion. To create one corporation for the express purpose of enabling it to control all the corporations engaged in a certain kind of business, and particularly a business of a public character, is not only opposed to the public policy of the state, but is in contravention of the spirit, if not the letter, of the constitution. That the exercise of the power attempted to be conferred upon the appellee company must result in the creation of a monopoly results from the very nature of the power itself. If the privilege of purchasing and holding all the shares of stock in all the gas companies of Chicago can be lawfully conferred upon appellee under the general incorporation act, it can be lawfully con - ferred upon any other corporation formed for the purpose of buying and holding all the shares of stock of said gas companies. The design of that act was that any number of corporations might be organized to engage in the same business, if it should be deemed desirable. But the business now under consideration could hardly be exercised by two or three corporations. Suppose that, after appellee had purchased and be - come the holder of the majority of shares of stock of the four companies in Chicago, another corporation had been organized with the same ob - ject in view; that is to say, for the purpose of purchasing and holding a majority of the shares of stock of the gas companies in Chicago, there being only four of such companies. What would there be for the cor - poration last formed to do? It could not carry out the object of its crea - tion, because the stock it was formed to buy was already owned by an existing corporation. Hence to grant to the appellee the privilege of purchasing and holding the capital stock of any gas company in Chicago is to grant to it a privilege which is exclusive in its character. It ia making use of the general incorporation law to secure a special 'privilege, immunity, or franchise;' it is obtaining a special charter under the cover and through the machinery of that law, for a purpose forbidden by the constitution. To create one corporation that it may destroy the energies of all other corporations of a given kind, and suck their life-blood out of them, is not a 'lawful purpose.' " "The power of purchasing and holding the capital stock of the four gas companies in question tends to relieve appellee of a proper share of its legal obligations, and to enable it to carry on a gas business without subjecting itself to the restrictions imposed by the statute. To this ex - tent the exercise of such power is not lawful." » • • • "The privileges awarded to the four gas companies under their re - spective charters were given them in return for and in consideration </seg>
            <seg id="p151">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 144 of services to be rendered by them to the public." • • • "that they should be permitted or required or forced to abandon the performance of such public duty is against the policy of the law. The public duty is imposed upon each company separately, and not upon the four, when combined together. Each for Itself, when it accepted its articles of as - sociation, assumed an obligation to perform the objects of its incorpora - tion. But t'.ie appellee, through the control which it does or may exer - cise over the four companies by reason of its ownership of a majority of their stock., renders it impossible for them to discharge their public duties, except at the dictation of an outside force, and in the manner prescribed by a corporation operating independently of them. They are thus virtually forced to abandon the performance of their duty to the public. The freedom and effectiveness of their action in carrying out the purposes of their creation are seriously interfered with, if not actual ly destroyed. A power whose exercise leads to such a result cannot be lawfully intrusted to any corporate body." I have set out the above case at length for the reason that I feel it is entirely decisive of the question before us, and by utilizing the opinion of the learned judge the necessity for further discussion on this point is fairly well eliminated. As will be seen upon a perusal of this case, the decision was rendered in view and in considera - tion of statutory enactments and constitutional provisions in some instances identical with the provisions and enact - ments of the Nebraska constitution and statutes. In conclusion I would briefly draw attention to the fact that a holding company is a new form of corporate life, having sprung into existence during the past ten to fif - teen years. Before the organization of holding companies the same result was brought about by natural consolida - tion of the various corporations, or a sale of the property of one to the other. When, however, these transactions became gigantic in their magnitude, as in the instance of determination by a court, and additional facts to the ef - fect that such an organization would be contrary to the public policy of this state as expressed by the constitu - tion, statutes of the state and the court decisions of the state, I am prone to answer the second question proposed in this discussion in the negative. And my conclusion is that not only is a holding company unauthorized under the corporate laws of this state, but also this state and </seg>

Respectfully submitted. G. T. TOU VELLE October 22, 1919. Counsel. MEMORANDUM ON RIGHT TO ORGANIZE HOLD - ING COMPANIES UNDER THE NEBRASKA CORPORATION LAWS A corporation is restricted to the rights and powers specified in its charter, consequently if the right to hold stock in another corporation is not set forth in the char - ter, such power cannot be exercised. This is axiomatic. The point then arises whether a corporation can under our law have the power to hold corporate stock. There is no direct constitutional or statutory or judi - cial authority granting such a right. Neither is such power directly prohibited. The matter is one of public policy, to be determined by the legislature rather than by decisions of the Attorney General. However, pending legislative enactments or judicial decisions, the rule may be laid down by the Department of Commerce, or by the Attorney General. The only provisions of the Nebraska corporation law bearing even indirectly on the subject are, as follows: Section 565 Revised Statutes: "Any number of persons may be associated and incorporated for the transaction of any lawful business, including the construction of canals, railways, bridges and other work of internal improvement." Section 566, Revised Statutes, enumerating corporate powers, provides among other things that a corporation </seg>
            <seg id="p153">146 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL may "fourth" hold personal estate and such other real estate as may be necessary for the legitimate business of the corporation. Section 4051, Revised Statutes, provides: "No corporation. Joint stock company or other association shall en - gage in business within this state, a majority of whose stock is owned by or controlled or held in trust for any manufacturing or other corpora - tion, which in the course of its manufacture or production conducts its business or any part thereof in a manner which would be prohibited by this article, if it were so conducted in the course of such business within this state." This last section seems to prevent a foreign corpora - tion, which could not itself do business in this state, from carrying on business here through a subsidiary corpora - tion. Every corporation is limited in its sphere of activities, by its own charter and by legislative enactment, and can only do those things it is expressly authorized to do. Ambiguous powers are construed against the corporation. 3 Thompson on Corporations, Sec. 3106. Thomas v. R. R. Co., 101 U. S. 71 R. R. Co. v. Kip, 46 N. Y. 546. De LaVergn Co. v. German, 175 U. S. 40. The general rule is that in the absence of specific sta - tutory permission, a corporation cannot subscribe to ac - quire or hold corporate stock of another corporation. 4 Thompson on Corporations, Paragraph 456, provides: "But the prevailing doctrine of the country is that a corporation cannot unless expressly authorized, make a valid subscription or pur - chase the capital stock of other corporations or otherwise become a stockholder except for the purpose of receiving payment of a security for a debt or unless the circumstances are such that the transaction is a necessary or reasonable means of carrying out or effecting the object of its incorporation." </seg>
            <seg id="p154">OPINIONS 147 and the same author in a later edition, Volume 8, Thomp - son on Corporations, Section 456, says: "As a general agreement in the proposition that a corporation cannot lawfully become a stockholder in another corporation unless the power to do so is expressly given or necessarily implied." There is no doubt that a corporation may be expressly authorized by statute to hold stock in another corpora - tion. 8 Thompson on Corporations, Par. 458, 460. 1 Cook on Corporations, Par. 314, states the rule "It may be stated as a general rule that a corporation has no im - plied power to purchase shares of the capital stock of another corpora- and in Paragraph 306, states: "The manufacturing corporation has no implied power to buy the stock of another manufacturing corporation for the purpose of holding the stock permanently." Burn v. Schuyler, 65 Conn. 336. Pattie v. Hillsboro, 4 Tex. Appeals 224 Knowles v. Sanderson, 107 Cal. 629. 10 Cyc. 1107, states the rule ; "One corporation cannot unless it is expressly authorized thereto by its governing statute make a valid subscription to the stock of another corporation or otherwise become a stockholder unless for the purpose of receiving payment of the security of a debt owing it." The three principles underlying the prohibition against holding companies are: First. Allowing a corporation to own stock in an - other organization, permits the diversion of corporate funds from the purposes mentioned in the charter of the holding company to the purposes allowed in the charter of the company in which the stock is held. </seg>
            <seg id="p155">148 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Second. Such a stock holding enables the corporation to practically indulge in business and risk its capital in a foreign enterprise. Third. Holding stock in other corporations provides an easy method, difficult to check, of monopolizing an in - dustrv. Much might be said both for and against holding com - panies. Certainly much harm has resulted therefrom. For instance the present condition of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railway Company and the New York, New Haven and Hartford, the assets of which have been mulcted through holding companies, probably, much good in industrial development has been accomplished also through holding companies. At any rate a holding com - pany permits the aggregation of capital for the purpose of a "blind pool", and permits promoters by the organi - zation of several companies to control large industries through a comparatively small actual investment. There are many cases holding directly that a holding company is contrary to public policy. Denny Hotel Company v. Schram, 6 Wash. 134. Franklin Company v. Leuiston, 63 Maine 43. Central R. R. of X. J. v. Pa. R. R., 31 N. J. Equity 475. De LaVergn Co. v. German, 175 U. S. 40. Knowles v. Sandercock, 107 Cal. 629. In this case the court says in holding that a manufacturing corporation cannot subscribe to the stock of a hotel company: "The general rule is undoubtedly that a corporation cannot own cor - porate stock unless expressly authorized. Indeed it has been said that statutes in regard to the. formation of corporations did not authorize any but natural persons to become incorporators" and "a private cor - poration has no implied authority to invest in shares of another private corporation. If this were so it might be an easy process to transfer its resources to another." The Denny Hotel Company case (supra) was a suit against a corporation on a stock subscription. The two </seg>
            <seg id="p156">OPINIONS 149 propositions of law involved were the power of a cor - poration to subscribe to stock of another corporation and its liability for such subscription before all the capital stock of the second corporation is subscribed.

In the case of People v. Chicago Gas Trust Co., 22 X. E. 798, there is an excellent discussion of the legality of holding companies, and in their opinion the court held that it was unlawful under the laws of Illinois. It is quite true, however, that this case is tinged with the monopolistic tendency of the holding company there con - sidered, but it has been subsequently construed in Peshtif/o r. G. W. Tel.

The Nebraska Shirt Company case holds that a manufacturing company has no power or right to subscribe to the stock of the Greater American Exposition Company, and the commis - sioner, Pound, in his opinion insinuates that under the law of Nebraska holding companies are illegal, saying: "Corporations have quite enough power without allowing them to incorporate themselves in new companies unless authorized by statute a corporation has no power to subscribe to the capital stock of another corporation and such a subscription is not binding.

It is exceedingly difficult to distinguish between "good" holding companies and "bad" holding companies, and so in reliance upon the general law, the field for possible illegal manipulation that holding companies afford the lack of statutory authority in the matter, and the judi - cial intimation as to their illegality. In the Horton case it would seem that this department should not overrule the decision of the Bureau of Securities determining that holding companies were not authorized by Nebraska law, and that a corporation could not appropriate to itself in its articles of incorporation the right or authority to ac - quire stock of other corporations. If any proposed incorporation deems itself aggrieved by such ruling, it has ample redTess under Section 13, Article 22, Title V, Chapter 190 of the laws of 1919, to appeal from this decision to the District Court of Lan - caster County, and to procure a judicial determination of the matter.

Corporations A foreign corporation wherein each stockholder has only one vote, re - gardless of the amount of capital stock owned by him, cannot be granted a permit to sell stock in Nebraska, under the present state constitution. Mr. L. W. Henderson, Yankton, S. 1). In re: Farmers' Terminal Elevator Company, Sioux City, la. My dear Mr. Henderson: I regret very much the de - lay that has been occasioned in connection with the above entitled matter, but as explained to you in our recent letter, circumstances have been adverse for an early de - cision in the premises. We have not made an examination of the application in this matter upon its merits and in this communication we are dealing solely with the question as to whether or not the Bureau of Securities can recognize the right of this corporation to sell its stock in this state, said stock being issued under articles of incorporation which author - ize the stockholders to vote only on the basis of personal representation rather than on the basis of a stock vote, </seg>
            <seg id="p160">OPINIONS 153 or a vote for each share of stock owned by the stockhold - ers in the company. For the purposes of this communication I am conced - ing that the corporation organized under the laws of the state of its domicile can properly limit the voting power of its stock in the respects as above set forth. This being true, the question before us then is whether or not the applicant has a right to superimpose the law of its domicile in this respect over the law of this state in a contrary respect, and whether or not said applicant is entitled to preference in this manner over domestic cor - porations of this state. Under Article Xlb, Section 5 of the Constitution of the state of Nebraska it is provided: "The legislature shall provide by law that in all elections for directors or managers of incorporated companies, every stockholder shall (have) the right to vote in person or proxy, for the number of shares of stock owned by him, for as many persons as there are directors or managers to be elected, or to cumulate said shares and give one candidate as many votes as the number of directors multiplied by the number of his shares of stock, shall equal, or to distribute them upon the same principle among a&amp; many candidates as he shall think fit, and such directors or managers shall not be elected in any other manner." This section has been re-enacted as a legislative act, together with further additions and will be found under Section 1 of Chapter 174 of the Session Laws of Nebraska for 1915. The only addition made to the constitutional section by the legislative enactment is as follows: "Provided, the right of cumulative voting in this act shall not ap - ply to strckhcldcrs of a corporatir n who own stcck in another corpora - tion engaged in a competing line of business, nor to any one who holds slock, the equitable owner of which is a stockholder in a corporation and engaged in a competing line of business, nor to their agents or rep - resentatives." I take it that it will not be at all necessary to enlarge upon the construction of this statute or upon the constitu - tional provision above quoted. Suffice it to say that said provision and said section, among other things, contem- </seg>
            <seg id="p161">154 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL plate and direct that each share of stock issued by Ne - braska corporations shall carry with it one vote. This statute applies to all corporations organized under the laws of this state, and as such, properly becomes a portion of Article II of Chapter 14 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, said article dealing generally with cor - porations. It is provided in Section 586 of Article II of Chapter 14 that: "Any corporation organized under the laws cf any other state or states, territory or territories, which has filed, or may hereafter file with the secretary of this state, a true copy of its charter or articles of asso - ciation, shall, on filing with the secretary of state a certified copy of the resolution adopted by its board of directors, accepting the provisions of this article, be and become a body corporate of this state." To all intents and purposes the last quoted section can apparently be construed to dispose of the question in hand, and particularly in view of what has been hereto - fore stated; but going further, and for the express pur - pose of meeting the theory which has been advanced with regard to comity between states, we will pass this point for the time being. Under Article XIV of Chapter 14 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, and under Section 725, it is required that foreign corporations shall appoint an agent or agents in this state and in that connection file a certificate in a certain form in the office of the secretary of state and in the office of the registrar of deeds in the county in which the corporation has its place of business, said certificate designating, among other things, the agent and his official title, and all for the purpose of providing for service of process on said corporation through the medium as appointed. It is further provided that no cor - poration shall transact any business in this state until said section has been complied with. Now, apparently this last section constitutes the door of entrance to this state through which foreign corpora - tions must enter, and by reason of the fact that this last mentioned section does not in itself impose apparent fur- </seg>

J be - lieve that the question involved herein is settled in a com - prehensive fashion by virtue of the following general rule with regard to comity between states. The rule is this: "Under the law of ccmity, a corporation has no authority to do an art or exercise any powers in a foreign state which a corporation of similar character created by or organized under the laws of the foreign elate is not permitted to exercise under the latter's constitution, laws and policies.

The Nebraska Supreme Court has said that foreign corporations do business here not by right but by comity and the state may at pleasure revoke the privilege which it has granted such corporations. See State v. Standard Oil Co., 61 Neb. 28. And, further, "The state may impose such conditions and limitations as it sees fit on foreign corporations seeking the privilege of doing business in the state." See State v.

When a corporation goes into another state than that by w T hich it w T as created with the consent of such foreign state, express or implied, it does so subject to the laws of that state. It cannot exercise powers or do acts therein which are contrary to the state's laws, although they may </seg>
            <seg id="p163">156 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL be authorized by its charter and by the laws of the state in which it was created. In support of this doctrine see Anselme v.

Strine, 58 Neb. 133; Rendering Co. v. Vermont, 207 U. S. 541. The doctrine of comity must yield to the positive law of the land. Hence foreign law must give way when in conflict with the statutes of the forum or the settled cur - rent of its judicial decisions. See Henry v. Works, 93 U. S. 664. Foreign laws will not be given effect when to do so would be contrary to the settled public policy of the forum. See Pennoyers v. Neff, 95 U. S. 714. The public policy of a state is to be deduced from its constitution, laws and judicial decisions. See Vidol v. Girard, 2 How. (U. S.) 127. WTiere the legislature of a state has not undertaken to regulate by statute the powers and business of foreign corporations doing business in such state, nor to prescribe how their contracts made therein shall be executed, the general principles of law applicable to cor - porations apply. See Platt v. Wilmot, 193 U. S. 602; Rumbough v. Improvement Co., 11 S. E. 528 (NC). Any power attempted to be exercised by a foreign cor - poration granted by its charter that violates a statute of the state or of the United States, or that is contrary to the settled decisions of the highest court of the state, or that is contrary to good morals, is against public policy, and the state may restrain the exercise of such power. See Clark v. Memphis Co., 130 S. \V. 751 (Tenn.). When a foreign corporation accepts a license permitting intra - state business, there is an implied condition that such business shall be conducted in obedience to the laws of the state in the same manner as a domestic corporation and that if the laws of the state are violated, it will for - feit all right to such license in the same manner that do - mestic corporations forfeit their charters.

W. 737 (Mo.) ; artin v. Stove Co., 78 111. App. 105. The courts of Nebraska, as an exercise of comity, will )t enforce a contract resulting from the transaction of business within the state, violating the public policy ereof. See Henni v. Fidelity Co., 61 Neb. 744. Con - acts made in the state by residents with foreign build - g associations, made through agents of such association's cated in the state, are Nebraska contracts, and their nstruction and validity are governed by the laws of the ate. National v. Retzman, 69 Neb. 667; People v. Shaffer, I Neb. 573. And thus this discussion could go on citing authorities, lies and statements, but I believe the statement as here - i made sufficient up to this point and a summary of the roposition would be in effect that the constitution of iis state, together with the legislative enactments, has stablished not only a rule of law with regard to cor - orations organized in this state, but also a rule of public olicy which effects all corporations transacting their siness in this state, and the law is apparently perfect- t plain that a foreign corporation cannot presume upon rule of comity between states to an extent that would How it to secure an unquestionable advantage over do - lestic corporations. And under the existing law this is ist as true as though an express statutory enactment tood of record in the laws of this state.

In the case of the aihvay Company v.

See also appeal L. A. Ry Co., 18 Atl. 498.

It seems that companies, firms, or associatioi formed and organized by and under trust deeds, agre ments, or declarations of trust, commonly known ar designated as common law corporations or companies, ai not recognized under the existing law of the state of N braska; that the law of the state of Nebraska makes r provision for the formation and organization of such con panies, and further makes no provision for and does n&lt; recognize such concerns in any manner or form, eitht from the standpoint of the right of formation and organ zation, or the right to transact business in this state.

The matter has been extensivel argued before the State Railway Commission under th Blue Sky law, repealed by the 1919 session of the legish ture, and before this Bureau under the existing law. Bot bodies arriving at the conclusion that these trust agret ments do not relieve the shareholders from personal lit bility and they are and have been treated as ordinar partnerships.

Hon. I). M.

Under such statute, it has been well hel&lt; that, although the officer of the Secretary of State in this respect ii a ministerial one, yet his power of refusing such certificate is not re strained to cases where the assumed corporate name is an exact im mitation of the name of the pre-existing corporation, but that he hai a discretion to refuse such a certificate where the name assumed s&lt; nearly resembles that of an existing corporation that confusion 01 the part of the public would be likely to arise between the two com panies." In connection therewith the case of State v. McGrath 92 Mo. 355, is cited. In this case it is held that the Sec- </seg>
            <seg id="p170">OPINIONS 163 ( i 1 i *tary of State had the power to refuse a charter to a &gt;rporation with a name similar to that of one already 1 existence, but under statutory authority the statute roviding "the corporate name of the proposed eorpora- on, which shall not be the name of any corporation eretofore incorporated in this state for similar pur - oses, or an imitation of such name." However, the Nebraska legislature has made no such rovision in regard to granting or refusing proposed ames of corporations. All cases where the Secretary f State or other ministerial officer has been held to have iscretionary power in regard to these have been where here was such a statutory provision, and it is my opin - oii that in the absence of such a delegation of power by tatute, the power does not exist. The duties of your •ffice as designated by statute are purely ministerial and onsist of recording and issuing the charter if the ap - &gt;lication is presented in due form. In connection with this I would call your attention o the fact that the legislature has made statutory pro - visions in regard to the similarity of names for two •lasses of corporations. Section 310 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, in regard to banks, gives the State Banking Board authority to require the junior bank to •hange or modify its name so as to prevent confusion. Section 3209 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, provides that insurance companies may not take names so close - ly resembling that of other companies as to mislead the public as to their identity; and under this provision the insurance board would have authority to reject a name. Since the legislature has delegated specifically this au - thority in these two classes of cases, it would seem that if they had desired it to exist for all corporations they would have so provided. And since they made special provision for these two classes of corporations, it would also be assumed that they did not consider it already in existence without statutory provision. </seg>

As I understand it, the objection to doing so is base&lt; upon the case of State v.

This amendment was made apparently to remedy the defects in the previous reading of the law, which was passed upon in the case cited above, and for the specific purpose of bringing building and loan associations under the provisions of Section 126. Previous to amendment, Section 126 read, as follows: "Every corporation previous to the commencement of any busi - ness except its own organization when the same is not formed by legislative enactment must adopt articles of incorporation and have them filed in the office of the Secretary of State and recorded in a book kept for that purpose * • * except mutual insurance com - panies, building and loan companies * • • ." but the amendment passing in 1911, it reads as follows: "Every corporation previous to the commencement of any busi - ness » • • must adopt articles of incorporation and have them filed in the office of the Secretary of State • • • . Banking cor - porations and building and loan associations must also file a copy of their articles of incorporation with the state banking board." I would call your attention to the language of the law, as amended. It says building and loan associations must also file their articles of incorporation with the state banking board. The word "also" used here cannot be construed to mean anything but they must file them with the Secretary of State and also with the State Banking Board. I do not feel that there is any question but that a building and loan association must file its articles of in - corporation in your office and pay the statutory filing fee therefore.

            <seg id="p173">166 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Corporations A domestic corporation cannot restrict the alienation of its stock. J. H. Donnelly, Chief, Bureau of Securities, State House. Dear Sir: The question has been presented to me as to whether or not a restriction or limitation placed in the articles of incorporation of an incorporated company, and as hereinafter set out, is valid and binding. For example — It is provided in the articles of incorporation that none of the stock of said company shall be issued or sold to any person, persons or corporation other than to the original incorporators, except in the case of death or retirement of any of the incorporators from the said corporation, in which event the corporation is to have the right to purchase and acquire any stock held by the deceased stockholder at its book value, and to re-sell the same to any other person selected by the unanimous con - senting vote of all of the other stockholders; together with a further limitation that there shall never be more than ten stockholders in the corporation, and that all of said stockholders shall have equal stock holdings and interests in the earnings and assets of the corporation, and any stockholder may be expelled for cause by unanimous vote of all the other stockholders under such rules and regulations as may be prescribed in the by - laws; but in such event the stock of such stockholder shall be purchased and taken over by the corporation at its book value as shown at the end of the last current year and may be re-sold and re-issued as hereinbefore provided; the stock in said corporation to be non-nego - tiable and non-transferable as collateral or otherwise, except to the corporation as hereinbefore set out. Necessarily this question and its answer must be con - trolled by an interpretation of the corporate powers as given to corporations organized under the laws of this state and by the statutes of this state. Under Section 566 of the 1913 Revised Statutes it is provided that every corporation has the following powers: </seg>
            <seg id="p174">OPINIONS 167 "First — To have succession by its corporate name; Second — to sue and to be sued, to complain and defend in courts of law and equity; Third — to make and use a common seal, and alter the same at pleasure; Fourth — to hold personal estate, and all such real estate as may be necessary for the legitimate business of the corporation; Fifth — to render the interest of the stockholders transferable; Sixth — to appoint such subordinate officers and agents as the busi - ness of the corporation may require, and to allow them a suitable compensation therefor; Seventh — to make by-laws, not inconsistent with any existing law, for the management of its affairs." Now presuming, for the purposes of an example, that the corporation in question is properly incorporated and for a legitimate purpose, with the exception of the fact that its articles of incorporation contain the conditions as set out hereinbefore, can said corporation by these provisions render its stock non-transferable? First, let us look at the character or nature of the cor - porate stock. In our consideration of the nature of the stock we shall be met at the outset by the fact that the term is one of general signification and that the same meaning is not attached thereto by the different judicial writers. Some decisions will be found intelligible only when the term is understood to mean the portion of the capital stock possessed by the individual member of the corporation ; others when understood to mean the entire number of shares authorized. In an exact use of language the "capital stock" must be understood to mean the en - tire number of shares authorized, while the property rights of the individual members of the corporation may be embraced under the term "shares" or "shares of stock." Under the earlier judicial writings shares of stock were held to be realty or personalty according to the nature of the interest of shares represented; but the fallacy of such decisions has been proven in the later decisions, and particularly in view of the doctrine that in the eyes of the law a corporation is a distinct legal </seg>
            <seg id="p175">168 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL entity and the share holders are distinct legal entities apart from the corporation. Inasmuch, therefore, as it has never been doubted that the corporate property be - longs to the corporation, as such it cannot at the same time belong to the shareholders. The character of the corporate property, therefore, cannot be allowed to de - termine whether shares are real or personal. But to de - termine this question reference must be had to the nature of the rights conferred by the ownership of the shares. These rights are, briefly speaking, a right to vote in the election of officers; to participate, by representation, in the management of the corporate enterprise; to receive a pro rata share of all dividends declared, and a pro rata share of the net assets of the corporation upon its dissolution. These rights must remain the same whether the corporate property be real or personal. Therefore, the shares conferring these rights are always real or al - ways personal, irrespective of the corporate property. That of the two they are personal appears from the fact that the rights enumerated are abstract and in futuro and are in general lacking in the essential elements of realty. In fact today in the majority of cases shares of stock are held to be personal property and to partake of the incidents of personal property, and as such the shares of stock are the property of the stockholders. A share of stock may be defined as the interest or right which the owner, who is called the shareholder or stock - holder, has in the management of the corporation, etc. It is well settled that a certificate of stock in a corpora - tion is not the stock itself, it is the mere evidence of the holder's ownership of the stock and of his rights as a stockholder to the extent specified therein. Just as a promissory note is merely the evidence of the debt se - cured thereby and as title deeds are merely the evidence of ownership of land. A certificate of stock itself, as distinguished from the stock which it represents, is un - doubtedly property. (See Fletcher on Corporations, Vol. 5, Sec. 3426, and authorities thereunder.) And if it is wrongfully detained from the true owner, or wrongfully </seg>
            <seg id="p176">OPINIONS 169 liverted by another, it may be recovered by an action of ietinue or replevin, or its value may be recovered by bringing an action of trover. The right to the possession of the certificate is incident to the ownership of the stock. (See also Fletcher on Corporations, Vol. 5, Sec. 3429.) The foregoing being true, now let us see what happens when a body of individuals becomes incorporated under the laws of this state and as incorporators subscribe to and pay for stock in the incorporated company. At such time as the incorporators subscribe and pay for their ■stock interests they are entitled to a manual delivery of i certificate of stock defining and setting out their stock interests in the corporation. I say certificate of stock rather than shares of stock, for the reason that shares )f stock are not susceptible to a manual delivery by rea - son of the fact that they are intangible and incorporeal property existing only in abstract legal contemplation. (See Fletcher on Corporations, Vol. 5, Sec. 3430 and authorities cited thereunder.) When delivered to the subscriber the certificate of stock heretofore referred to .hen necessarily becomes the personal property of the subscriber and as such is subject to the incidents of per - sonalty in its sale, transfer or otherwise. After becom - ng the personal property of the subscriber the certificate )f stock, or the shares of stock represented by the certi - leate, then becomes subject to the will of the subscriber, ind any act of dominion wrongfully asserted over this property by another in denial of the owner's right, or in - ?onsistent with it, may be treated as a conversion, and this is just as true of shares of stock as it is of other property. (See Herrick v. Humphrey, 73 Neb. 809; also Fletcher on Corporations, Vol. 5, Sec. 3446.) Now this brings us down to the point as to whether or lot shares of stock being personal property can be placed inder restraint of alienation by the issuing corporation. Plainly a restriction upon alienation of private property .vithout the consent of the owner would be unlawful, but mother factor enters into this question, to-wit: Whether </seg>
            <seg id="p177">170 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL or not this restraint upon alienation is impressed upon the stock by virtue of the charter of the issuing corpora tion and to such an extent as to leave the purchaser 01 owner of such stock helpless to complain. The answei to this will be found by referring to the statutes or legis lation which allowed the incorporation of the company for it is an accepted doctrine that a corporation has onlj those primary powers expressly given to it by virtue oi the incorporation statute and those additional powers which are directly incidental and necessary to the carry ing out of the primary purposes of the corporation. Als( at this point it might be well to draw attention to th( fact that there is a distinct difference beween the pur poses of an incorporation and the powers given to ai incorporation. I take it that no discussion will be needet on this point. Now, the general powers of a corporation organized under the laws of this state are those as hereinbefore specifically set out. Applying the measure of thost powers to the question before us we find that the legis - lature has provided that every corporation shall havt power to render the interest of the stockholders transfer able, and in addition thereto, under Section 567 of th( said Revised Statutes for 1913, the legislature has pro - vided that: "The powers enumerated in the preceding section shall vest it every corporation in this state whether the same be formed withou - or by legislative enactment although that may be specified in Iti charter or articles of association." The transfer of stock has been uniformly regarded as a legitimate subject of corporate legislation, to enablt a company to know who are the stockholders, to whon dividends are to be paid, who are entitled to vote, etc Generally speaking, stock was transferable at commor law and at the time the statutes hereinbefore quotet were enacted. Our Supreme Court had occasion to pass upon part 5 of Section 566 as hereinbefore referred t&lt; in the case of Miller v. Farmers Elevator Co., as reportec </seg>
            <seg id="p178">OPINIONS 171 n 78 Xeb. 441. In that particular ease a set of by-laws lad been adopted by the corporation which prohibited my person from holding more than five shares of stock it one time and also the transfer of stock to a non-stock - lolder, among other things. The company took the posi - ion that the fifth clause of Section 566 impliedly nega - ived the right of a stockholder to transfer his stock n the absence of affirmative action on the part of the orporation to render it transferable, and the court in &gt;assing on that point stated as follows: "We do not think the clause will bear that construction." « • • So radical' a departure from that doctrine could not have been made .ithout attracting wide attention, and it would have been followed by •rompt action on the part of corporations and the holders of stock o adjust themselves to the change. No such result followed. On he contrary, although that section has stood on the books for almost lalf a century, corporate stock has been bought and sold, during all hat time, on the theory that its transferability is not dependent upon normative action authorizing its transfer. This amounts to a prac - ical or contemporaneous construction of the statute, which is not to e lightly set aside. Besides, if the legislature had contemplated an nnovation of that character, it seems to us it would have expressed tself in more apt and unambiguous language. A careful reading of he entire section leads us to the conclusion that the legislature there - y undertook, not only to define the general powers of a corporation, ut also to enumerate certain qualities or properties which it should ossess, or certain consequences which should follow the act of in - orporation. It is clear that the first clause, the clause relating to succes - ion, is to be taken as expressive of a corporate quality or property, rather him grant of power. It attaches to a corporation the instant it comes pto being, and, of necessity, antedates the first corporate act. The fifth lause is complementary to the first, because, unless there could be a hange in the ownership of stock, the perpetual succession of the corpora - on, under its corporate name, would be impossible. The latter clause ''as intended, we think, not to make the transferability of corporate took dependent on some affirmative act of the corporation, but to npress the stock with that quality as a consequence of the act of icorporation. We see no escape from the conclusion that the by - iws in question are void as an unreasonable restraint on the transfer f property in the stock of the corporation. Lit is therefore recommended that the decree of the district court affirmed." </seg>
            <seg id="p179">172 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Attention is drawn to several important points covere by this statement of the court. First, that portion of th opinion relating to succession. The right of succession i an inherent quality of corporations and is one of the prin cipal characteristics of corporate enterprise and has bee recognized as such from the beginning of corporate en terprise. The principal means of having succession i by the transferability of stock, and the cutting off of th transferability of stock means the disposition of th power of succession. The second point is made by refei ence to the fact that if the legislature had contemplate giving such a power to corporations it certainly woul have expressed itself in plainer, clearer language. It is true that the case stated above involved the que* tion of the non-transfer restriction being placed in it by-laws, rather than its articles of incorporation or i its charter, but I do not believe that a distinction of thi sort will interfere with the sweeping decision rendered b the court for the reason that the court's decision wa based upon an interpretation of the statute and not th by-laws, and this interpretation of the statute must coi trol regardless of whether or not the restriction is place in the by-laws or in the articles of incorporation. If th corporation in question had the authority in the fin instance by virtue of this statute to place such a restrii tion in its articles of incorporation, then certainly : would have had the power to place it in its by-laws, an this would be true whether or not express authority wa given to the company in its articles of incorporation t make such a restriction upon the transfer of its stocl for the reason that the charter of any incorporatio consists not only of its articles of incorporation, but ( its articles of incorporation taken in connection with th enabling act, and a neglect to state the power specificall in its articles of incorporation would not restrain it froi t exercising this power if the power was given by th statute, and particularly is this true in the light of trl second section, or Section 567, wherein it is stated thtl these powers shall vest in every corporation, althougj </seg>
            <seg id="p180">OPINIONS 173 that may not be specified in its charter or articles of as sociation. The last mentioned case has not been reversed and stands as law in this state today, and such being the case, then truly a corporation does not have the power to impress its stock with an element of non-transferabil - ity, and a purchaser of the stock of a corporation or - ganized under the laws of this state will take its stock free from such restriction upon alienation, and any at - tempt upon the part of the issuing corporation to restrain the alienation of its subscribers' stock would be unlawful. But let us go further and see whether or not the Nebraska decisions on this point are supported by de - cisions of other jurisdictions. Fletcher on Corporations in Vol. 6 at Section 3758 states the following to be the general rule with regard to shares of stock and their transferability: "Shares of stock in a corporation are personal property, and it is. well settled that the owner, as in the case of other personal property, has an absolute and inherent right, as an incident of ownership, to sell and transfer the same at will, except insofar as the right may be restricted by the charter of the corporation cr the general law, or by a valid by-law, or by a valid agreement between him and the cor - poration, provided the transfer is in good faith and to a person cap - able of assuming the obligations of a stockholder. In the absence of such restrictions, a bona fide transfer does not require the consent of the corporation and cannot be prevented by it or by its officers." Among the numerous citations in support of the above quoted rule Fletcher cites the case of Miller v. Farmers Elevator Co., 78 Neb. 441.. In the case of Steele v. Telephone Association (Kans.) reported in 148 Pac. 661, the court held that: "Shares of stock are personal estate vendable at will and the cor - poration has no right to restrict their transfer except as authorized by statute." Further along in the opinion of the court in this case we find the following: </seg>
            <seg id="p181">174 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL "It is argued that by-laws affixing restraints upon the disposal of shares of stock by their owners ought to be permitted to insure harmonious membership and to prevent corporate turmoil. Harmony secured in this way may be as vicious as corporate turmoil. But the fatal defect in the 'argument it that it ignores the fundamental principles of corporate compotition." It appears to me that the point of the Kansas Su - preme Court is well taken. As hereinbefore mentioned one of the inherent characteristics of corporate existence is its right of succession, and it is in this respect that corporations differ from the ordinary partnerships, in - dividuals, etc., and a recognition of the power to inter - fere with the transferability or to cut off the right of succession in corporate existence will constitute a radical departure from corporate concepts as we recognize them today. In the case of Morgan v. Struthers, 131 U. S. 246, the United States Supreme Court said: "One essential feature of an incorporated joint stock company is the right of each stockholder, without restraint, to sell or transfer his shares at pleasure. So well established is this right that a by-law of a bank putting restrictions upon the transferability of stock in the hands of its members has been held void as being in restraint of trade. Even where the charter gives the corporation the power to regulate the transfer of stocks it has brer, held that this power does not include the authority to restrain transfers." * * * "It is just in this respect, especially, that an incorporated joint stock company differs from an ordinary co-partnership. In the latter, the individual mem - bers of the firm are presumed to, and in general actually do, con - tribute to the common enterprise, not only their several shares of partnership capital, but also their individual experience, skill or credit; no member having the right to sell out his interest or to retire from the firm without the consent of the co-partners; and if he does either the act amounts to a dissolution of the partnership. The very reverse, as we have said, is the case of a joint stock corporation, in which each stockholder, whether by purchase or original subscription, has the right, unless restrained by the charter or articles of association to sell and transfer his shares and by transferring them introduce others in their stead." Following right along the same line the Supreme Court of Wisconsin, in the case of In re Klaus, reported in 29 N. W. at 582, stated as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p182">OPINIONS 175 "The policy of incorporating a strictly private business with a limited liability of the stockholders towards their creditors, is at least Questionable. But when a private business or a partnership has be - come incorporated under the general law, and greatly favored by privileges and franchises and by restricted liability, there is no reason for making any distinction between such a corporation and others, and our statutes make none. The corporators have secured the ad - vantages of a corporation, and they should be governed by all the other incidents of a corporation. Why not? They cannot be a cor - poration, and still remain, in respect to the same business, a co-part - nership. The one must completely displace the other." • ♦ • "As a partner, a person may sell his interest in the partnership property, but he does not sell his interest in the partnership as such, and he may bind himself to his co-partners by his agreement; but, as a stockholder, he is in no sense the owner or part owner of the part - nership property. His stock represents his interest in the corporation, and that is made property by the statute. His individuality is merged in that of a stockholder. His stock is not only property, but private property, and he may do with it as he pleases. There is no community of interest in the different stockholders to form the basis of a good founda - tion for a contract between them as to the disposition of their stock." An agreement between stockholders of a corporation not to sell or transfer their shares without the consent of all the parties thereto is in restraint of trade, and con - trary to public policy, and is therefore void, if there is no other consideration than the mutual promises of the stockholders. See Fisher v. Bush, 35 Hun., (N. Y.) 641; Steele v. Farmers' Tel. Ass'n, (Kans.) 148 Pac. 661. A statute authorizing corporations to make by-laws consistent with the laws of the state does not authorize a by-law requiring stockholders before selling their stock to first offer it to the corporation, since the corporation cannot in the absence of express authority restrict the right of a stockholder to dispose of his stock. See Ireland v. Milling Co., (R. I.) 41 Atl. 258. The above stated rule of law is particularly important in the im - mediate case by reason of the fact that the Nebraska statutes authorize the passage of by-laws for the man - agement of the corporate affairs, said by-laws being not inconsistent with any existing law, and perchance it might be insisted that a restriction might be properly </seg>
            <seg id="p183">176 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL laced upon the alienation of stock by virtue of the tatute authorizing such by-laws. Attention is also drawn o the fact that the rule as stated makes specific refer - nce to the fact that such restrictions cannot be main - ained or provided "in the absence" of express author - y. So far as the Nebraska statutes are concerned I lave been unable to find any express authority authoriz - ng such a restriction or limitation upon the transfera - &gt;ility. of stock, and in fact our supreme court in 78 Neb., s heretofore referred to, has construed the only statu - ory offering along this line to be of a contrary effect. In the case of Farmers Bank v. Wasson, 48 la. 336, question arose similar to the one involved in the im - mediate discussion, and in that case the articles of in - orporation and by-laws declared that no valid transfer ' stock could be made until same was entered upon the &gt;ooks of the corporation, and a further restriction to le effect that the validity of such a transfer depended pon the approval and acceptance of the board of direct - rs. As a matter of fact, it will be noted from this state - ment that that case did not contain the absolute restric - ons upon the transferability of stock as the restrictions nder discussion in this brief. In deciding the case the owa supreme court stated as follows: "These restrictions are intended for the benefit of the corporation, when its rights may be protected thereby, and to prevent the transfer f stock to irresponsible persons, which if it should occur, would have the effect to impair the credit of the bank. The restriction first men - oned is necessary, in order that the officers of the corporation may now who are stockholders, which is essential in conducting elections r officers, and for other matters. It can never defeat the rights of ther parties, and, in all cases, must be regarded as a reasonable re - uirement. This, if it were not — as it is— in accord with an express rovision of the statute of the state would demand that it be upheld y the courts. But the same things are not true of the other restric - on. While it may be lawfully enforced to protect the rights of the orporation, it cannot, in other cases, be exercised without limitation so as to defeat the rights of others. If the corporation has no rights o be protected by its exercise, and other parties would be deprived f their property thereby, it cannot be enforced in such cases. Its en - orcement would operate as an infringement upon the property rights </seg>
            <seg id="p184">OPINIONS 177 of others, which the law will not permit. It would, besides, operate as a restraint upon the disposition of property in the stock of the cor - poration, in the nature of restraint of trade, which the courts will not tolerate. As the restriction is not imposed by express authority of the statute of the state, it cannot, in such cases be enforced. These con - clusions are supported by the following authorities: Sargent v. Franklin Int. Co., 8 Pick. 90; Quiner v. Murblehead In*. Co., 10 Mass. 476; V. 8. v. Faughan, 3 Binn. 394; Int. Co. v. Smith, 11 Pa. St. 120; Choteau Co. v. Harris, 20 Mo. 382." Turning to one of the cases last above cited, to- wit: Choteau Spring Co. v. Harris, 20 Mo. 382, we find in that case that the court laid down the rule that the power to regulate the transfer of stock did not include the power to restrain transfers or prescribe to whom they might be made, but merely to prescribe the formalities to be observed in making them. In deciding this case the court in part stated as follows: "Stock, in incorporated joint stock companies like the present, is always treated as property, without any declaration in the charter to that effect; and when such a provision is inserted, it is considered as merely cumulative, except insofar as it designates the peculiar charac - ter of the property, whether real or personal. One of the incidents of property is its transferability, our idea of property, dominion over a thing, including in it the power of disposing of it at pleasure, and, of course, the power of disposing of this stock, like the power of dis - posal of any other property, is incident of common right to the owner - ship of it; and the words in the charter 'transferability on the books of the company' are treated as merely cumulative, pointing out o*ne mode of transfer, but not excluding other modes where no exclusive words are used. The legislature may grant corporate power to restrain this transferability, but unless it is expressly given, it does not exist: and in favor of the power of disposing, the courts generally construe clauses affecting this right with a view to the particular purpose for which they are inserted, and give them effect to that extent only." A duty imposed on one implies a right in another to require that duty performed. It is the unquestioned right of a stock owner to exact of the corporation that it make a transfer of the share of the stock he owns on its books. This is necessary to complete his title so that his control of it cannot be questioned. Without this he is deprived of that full and free use of his property that the law says he is entitled to. Being entitled to dividends, if the </seg>
            <seg id="p185">178 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL corporation refuses to officially recognize his ownership he is powerless to collect without the aid of the court to enforce payment, and without a perfect title his property is of little marketable value. Yet it is his property as against the world to dispose of at will. With the posses - sion of the evidence of his title the world has the right to consider him the absolute owner, and the law will pro - tect the rights of third parties dealing with him on this supposition. The public has a right to presume and to act upon the presumption that a corporation has done its duty as to its outstanding stock in the hands of an owner and that his rights have been duly recognized on its books. And this is particularly true under the cir - cumstances existing by virtue of the corporate law and the policy of said law in this state. There is no express statutory authority for a restriction upon alienation of stock as regards general incorporated companies, and in fact the apparent statutory provision pertaining to the transfer of stock has been construed by the highest court of the state to mean that the stock of corporations or - ganized under the general incorporation laws is trans - ferable without affirmative action upon the part of the corporation and further, that the quality of transferabil - ity is impressed upon corporate stock as a consequence of the act of incorporation. See Miller v. Farmers Eleva - tor, 78 Neb. at 447. Further a certificate of stock is recognized generally as having the inherent quality of personal property. Wherefore, a certificate of stock be - ing clothed with all the incidents of personal property and in possession of the claimant rests in him the su - preme right to require any act performed capable of per - formance necessary to make his title perfect. Were this not so it would be equivalent to vesting power in corpora - tions to nullify every certificate of stock and itself reap the benefits. And this is a power which the courts have uniformly refused to recognize. Everett v. Bank, 82 Neb. 191, 20 L. R. A. N. S. 996; Pease v. Crcvyom Co., 235 HI. 391 ; Bank v.

After a careful perusal of the Nebraska statutes con - cerning corporations, and having in mind the historical development of corporate life beginning with the old Roman corporations and continuing through the English corporations and down to the present American corpor - ate organization, and considering particularly the privi - leges and immunities of corporate existence, I am im - pressed with the idea that the legislature of this state did not see fit to authorize the incorporation of companies and the giving to such corporations the right to restrict the alienation of stock and the prevention of corporate succession by such means. I feel that I am borne out in this impression by virtue of the decision as reported in the 78 Neb., as heretofore referred to, and not only that, but also the recognition of the character attached to cor - porate stock by virtue of other statutory legislation and other decisions of our supreme court, and more particu - larly attention is drawn to the fact that one of the last expressions of the legislature with regard to the limita - tions which may be imposed upon a transfer of stock is set out in Chapter 57 of the 1919 Session Laws dealing with co-operative companies. And under said chapter and in Section 735 and under the fifth clause thereof the legislature has given to co-operative companies the right "to regulate and limit the right of stockholders to trans - fer their stock," and apparently by such expression recognizing the fact that corporate organization in the state of Nebraska would not generally have such a right, and that it was necessary to specifically and expressly give to co-operative companies, a branch of the corpor - ate organization of this state, such a right. Going further we find that apparently the legislature has recognized the fact that corporate stock in its own right has the quality of personal property. For example, refer to Section 7735 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for the year 1913 and under Chapter 10 entitled "Attach - ment," which states as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p187">180 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY QENERAL "The order of attachment shall be directed and delivered to the sheriff. It shall require him to attach the lands, tenements, goods, chattels, stocks or interest in stocks, rights, credits, moneys and ef - fects of the defendant in his county," etc. Under Section 6363 of said Revised Statutes and under the chapter on revenue it is provided: "Personal property shall be listed in the manner following: First — Every person of full age and sound mind, being a resident of this state, shall list all his moneys, credits, bonds, or stocks, shares of joint stock or other companies," etc. That the interest of a stockholder in the property of a private corporation represented by certificate of shares registered in his name may be reached by garnishee pro - cess served upon the corporation has been upheld in this state, and Section 7735, Revised Statutes of 1913, has been construed to that effect. See case of Farmers Bank v. Mosher, 63 Neb. 139. In conclusion I would say that in my opinion the transferability of corporate stock in corporations organ - ized under the Nebraska statutes is not dependent upon some affirmative act of the corporation, and further, the incorporators* are without power to impress the corpor - ate stock with the quality of a restrictive alienation, and any such attempted restraint, either by virtue of by - laws, articles of incorporation or statements contained in the certificates of stock would be void as being without express authority from the enabling statute and as being an unreasonable restraint on the transfer of property in the stock of a corporation.

            <seg id="p188">OPINIONS 181 County Commissioners county commissioner cannot act as a commissioner of highways. Mr. J. H. Rayburn, Scottsbluff, Xebraska. Dear Sir: I have your letter of October the 27th isking if one of your county commissioners can act as ommissioner of highways. In answer to your inquiry we call your attention to Jhapter 71 of the Session Laws of 1919 commencing on )age 187 of those laws. This chapter amends Chapter »7 of the Laws of 1917, which amended Chapter 3062 of he Revised Statutes of 1913. Chapter 71 of the Laws &gt;f 1919 repeals Section 3062 of the Revised Statutes of L913, and Chapter 67 of the Session Laws of 1917. The Laws of 1917, as you know, provided for the appoint - ment of one of the board of commissioners as the com - missioner of highways. That section having been re - pealed and no mention being made in Chapter 71 of the Laws of 1919 for the appointment of a member of the board as a commissioner of highways, it would seem that there is no authority for such an appointment. We further call your attention to Chapter 72 immedi - ately following in the Session Laws of 1919. In that chapter it is provided that in counties like yours the highway commissioner shall receive such salary or com - pensation as the board may allow, together with all ac - tual traveling expenses while engaged in the duties of his office. This would make it somewhat inconsistent for the board to appoint one of its members and allow him a salary and extra compensation. So it would seem that a member of your county board could not be ap - pointed or act as a commissioner of highways. Chapter 71 also provides that the county surveyor shall act as the commissioner of highways and the board shall allow him his compensation and expenses. We think this answers your question, and we are. Very truly yours, October 29, 1919. Deputy Attorney General. By J. B. BARNES, </seg>
            <seg id="p189">182 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL County Treasurer The County Treasurer is not allowed to take fees for the collection o registration fees for motor-vehicles or for state hail insurance. D. B. Cropsey, State Treasurer, State House, City. Dear Sir: In answer to your inquiry of July 19th 1919, which is: "Does Section 2439 Revised Statutes of 1913 grant to county treasurers the right to take fees for collection registration fees from owners of motor-vehicles?" You also refer to Sections 15, 16 and 17 of House Roll 299, Laws of 1919. You also ask if county treas - urers are allowed fees from hail insurance. In answer to these questions, it is the opinion of this department that county treasurers are not entitled by law to take fees for such collections. House Roll 299 of the Session Laws of 1919 provides in substance that 25 per cent of these registration fees shall be paid over by the county treasurer to the road dragging fund and the balance of the fees are sent to the state treasurer and credited to the state highway fund. There being no provision of law for taking these fees, it is the opin - ion of this department that none can be taken by the county treasurer. We are, Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS.

Mr. W. L. McCandless, County Treasurer, Broken Bow, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Responding to your inquiry as to the pro - visions and application of Sections 11, 12 and 13, Chapter 222, Laws of Nebraska for 1919, we will say Section 11 of the act provides as follows: 1. Registration expires upon a transfer of the ownership of the motor-vehicle. 2. The transferor and the transferee of the motor vehicle join in a statement on the reverse side of the registration certificate, the transferor signing his name as on the face of the certificate and the transferee signing the same and giving his post office address and making thereon application for registration in his name. 3. Certificate so endorsed is to be forwarded to the State Board of Irrigation, Highways and Drainage with a receipt for the fees required by Section 15 and the registration number plate, and all charges are to be prepaid. 4. The State Board files the certificate, and upon receipt of the proper fees and if satisfied of the genuineness of the transfer, reregister and cancel the former number or reassign the same at the option of the Board. Section 12 provides: 1. The application for the transfer must be made by the registered owner within ten days after the transfer or lose the possession of the vehicle to the State Board. 2. The registration number may be assigned to another vehicle upon compliance with the provisions of the section. 3. The section provides that the Board may retain the plate and seal until reassignment or refusal, which indicates that the plate and seal should be sent in with the application. 4. If transfer of the motor-vehicle has been made within ninety days from the time of the payment of the fee the transferor may, upon application and return of the certificate, plate and seal, receive a refund of one-half of the fee; which Indicates that if refund is de - sired it can be obtained within ninety days. </seg>
            <seg id="p191">184 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL i: Section 13: 1. Upon compliance with Section 12 the State Board issues a new registration certificate with no charges except those provided in Sec. 15.i 2. The section provides that title to the motor vehicle does not pass to the transferee until he receives a certificate and writes his name in the place provided thereon; except as to dealers, who may use their dealers' number until sale or transfer, when the general pro - visions of the act apply. Number plates and seals not removed when the transfer is made to the dealer must be delivered by him to the State Board. The above provisions seem to indicate that your duties are to collect the fees and send same in together with the applications made out under the provisions of the foregoing sections. Trusting that the foregoing fully answers your inquiry, I am, Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General. By C. L. DORT, February 2, 1920. Assistant Attorney General. Court House If the consideration for the rebuilding of a court house is less than eighty-five per cent of the levy provided for by the special election, then in that case the county board may enter into a contract for the erection of the building without waiting for the collection of the entire tax so voted. Mr. Richard C. James, County Attorney, Richardson County, Falls City, Nebraska. Dear Sir: The Attorney General has your letter of the 3rd inst. in which you inform us that the court house of Richardson county was destroyed by fire and that the people are anxious to rebuild. You also say that the county commissioners are about to submit to the people </seg>
            <seg id="p192">OPINIONS 185 it a special election a proposition of a special annual ax of five mills for five years with which to build said •ourt house (see Section 436 of the Revised Statutes of 1913). You desire us to give an opinion of this depart - ment as to whether this special tax, if it is duly voted, must first be collected before any contract can be en - tered into by the county board for the erection of the court house. Answering that question, Section 439 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 provides: "If the time such election be had and such tax voted be before the tax lists for that year have been delivered to the county treasurer, then such levy shall be entered upon such tax lists for that year; but if such election be not had until after the tax lists for that year have been delivered to the county treasurer, then such tax shall not be levied or carried on such tax lists until the next annual levy of taxes, when the same shall be levied and collected annually for the time voted at such election." Section 440 provides: "Such sum so levied and collected shall constitute a special fund for the purposes for which the same was voted and shall not be used for any other purpose, and shall be kept by the county treasurer sepa - rate and apart from the other county funds: Section 441 provides: "No contract shall be entered into by the county board, for the erection of buildings to be paid for out of such fund, in a turn to exceed eighty-five per cent of such levy, until all it collected and paid into the county treatury." Construing these provisions, it is the opinion of this department that if the consideration for the erection of your court house is less than eighty-five per cent of the levy provided for by the special election, then in that case the county board may enter into a contract for the erection of said building, without waiting for the collec - tion of the entire tax so voted. The prohibition which the statute seems to provide for is with regard to the excess of the eighty-five per cent of the levy so voted. </seg>
            <seg id="p193">186 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL The question you submit is a difficult one, but we ar quite certain that if, as above stated, the contract prie does not exceed ttie eighty-five per cent of the entire ta: so voted, the courts would hold that a contract entere&lt; into with regard to the eighty-five per cent and not ti exceed that, would be lawful.

Special Assistant Attorney General Delegates to National Party Conventions Delegates to national political nominating conventions are only moral - ly bound to vote for the candidate having the highest vote. Such delegates have discretionary power in voting. Mr. J. H. Rowlings, Correspondent, The Associated Press, Lincoln, Nebr. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of December 8, asking for an opinion by this department as to the in - tent and purpose of a provision in Section 2154 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, which provides that the Secretary of State shall issue the election certi - ficates to the delegates of the various political parties, who are elected at the primary to serve at the national political nominating conventions for President, and that such certificate shall show the number of votes received in the state by each candidate for President and Vice- President, will say that it would appear that it was the intent and purpose of the legislature in making this pro - vision that the candidates should be governed by the vote of the state as a whole and not by the vote of the districts from which thev were elected. </seg>
            <seg id="p194">OPINIONS 187 However, whatever obligation is based upon them is a purely moral obligation only and only morally binding. It must be remembered that these men are elected to at - tend a convention to nominate a candidate for President and Vice-President, and by the very nature of their duties, they are given discretionary powers. If every state were to provide, as a matter of law, that delegates to the convention should be governed solely and abso - lutely by a preferential vote taken within the state, and it happened that there were a large number of candidates and the vote was so divided that no one candidate could receive a majority, then a deadlock would result, and there would be no method of changing it. The nature of the duties of these delegates gives them discretionary power. The vote taken is merely to serve as an expres - sion of the will of the people, which is to bind them morally, but only so long as other outside circumstances do not arise, which in their discretion render a change necessary. That they are morally bound by thfe preferential vote so given, is shown by the case of State ex rel Nebraska Republican State Central Committee et al v. Addison Waite, Secretary of State, 92 Neb. 313, which arose out of the historical split in the Republican party when the Progressive party was organized in 1912. The language used in this case is, as follows: "The preferential vote given by the voters of a political party at a primary election for a particular person as the party candidate for President while morally binding upon the delegates of such party to the national convention • • • ." The question of whether the delegates are morally bound by the vote of the state as a whole or by the vote of the congressional district where they were elected, in case the latter happens to be different from the former, is rather a close one. It is a moral obligation only. As I said above it would appear that the endorsements on their certificates of election of the vote of the whole state rather than of the vote of the congressional district would </seg>
            <seg id="p195">188 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL indicate that the understanding of the legislature was therefore then considered as delegates from the state and not from the district, and therefore then bound in so far as they are bound by the vote of the state as a whole and not by the vote of the district. On the other hand the obligation is only a moral one. If a delegate feels that there is a greater moral obligation to abide by the result of the vote in his district, than to abide by the result of the vote in the state, the law is not manda - tory or compulsory, and there is no way of compelling him to follow the preferential vote of the state as op - posed to the preferential vote in his district. Summing it up, I will say that it is probably the meaning of the section to place a moral obligation upon the delegates to caste their ballots in accordance with the preferential vote of the state at large until such a time as circumstances in their discretion require a change, but that if they see fit to be governed by the vote in the dis - trict rather than by the vote in the state, it is entirely within their power' to do so.

Divorce A County Judge does not have the jurisdiction to hear and determine divorce cases. Robert Ford, Esq., County Judge, Boyd County, Butte, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of October 17th requesting an opinion of this department as to whether or not Chapter 206 of the Laws of 1919 confers jurisdiction upon a county </seg>
            <seg id="p196">OPINIONS 189 udge to hear and determine divorce cases, raises an in - eresting, difficult and important question. In reaching a solution it is necessary to consider both he state constitution and various statutory enactments. The county court is a constitutional court of special and imited jurisdiction. (Art. VI, Sec. 16, Constitution of eb.) It has original jurisdiction in probate and estate latters. In ordinary civil matters its jurisdiction is ounded on that of a justice of the peace except that its urisdiction is enlarged to include certain civil cases where - n the matter in litigation does not exceed one thousand lollars. The legislature has provided that it has no juris - liction in a number of civil actions such as malicious prose - *ution, actions upon contracts for the sale of real estate, he actions involving the title to all boundaries of land, &gt;tc. ; these excepted matters being cases in which litigation s apt to be important and of far-reaching effect. (Sees. 204-1211, R. S.) The legislature in 1905 provided for a juvenile court vith jurisdiction over dependent, neglected and delinquent •hildren, (Sees. 1244-1264, R. S.) and specifically provided hat: "The county court in each county shall have concurrent Jurisdic - ion with the district court but such jurisdiction shall not be exercised &gt;y the county court except in the absence of the judge or judges of he district court from the county." It will be noted that at the time the legislature con - 'erred juvenile court jurisdiction upon the county court hat the jurisdiction of the juvenile courts did not include livorce matters. In 1919 the legislature specifically placed jurisdiction &gt;f all cases for divorce or alimony or involving the cus - ody of children in the juvenile court (Chap. 206, Lawg l919). It will also be noted that while this chapter ma - erially amends the sections of the Revised Statutes lealing with the jurisdiction of county, district and uvenile courts it neither specifically repeals or amends </seg>
            <seg id="p197">190 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL any of said sections. It would seem that the legislatur in conferring divorce jurisdiction upon juvenile court had overlooked Section 1245 of the Revised Statutes whie permits a county judge to hold a juvenile court in hi county when the district judge is absent therefrom. Divorce jurisdiction in this state (Sees. 1567-1641 B S.) has always rested in the district court. In this stat and in other states the legislature has been extreme! loath to confer divorce jurisdiction on any inferior cour of limited jurisdiction. The matter of domestic relations the foundation of the home and of the matrimonial right and obligations under .the Anglo-Saxon law and methcx of life is too important to be placed in the hands of an 1 court except a court of general original jurisdiction. To particularly guard against unconscious or unwittinj amendments of existing law by legislative enactment an&lt; to prohibit surreptitious or clandestine legislation, th« constitution of Nebraska, Article III, Section 11, speci fically provides that: "No bill shall contain more than one subject and the same shal be clearly expressed in Its title, 'and no late shall be amended unless th netc act contain the section or sections so amended and the section o sections so amended shall be repealed.' " This provision has been upheld and construed in Small v. White, 4 Neb. 353; Stricklet v. State, 31 Neb. 674, an&lt; State v. Barton, 91 Neb. 357, to mean that an amendaton act does not amend or change existing legislation unles: the sections of the law altered or amended are speci fically enumerated as amended or repealed in the amenda tory legislation. This legislation concerning divorce jurisdiction woulc seem to come within the purview of this constitutiona provision, and while the matter may be fraught witl doubt, this department holds that Chapter 206 of th&lt; Laws of 1919 does not confer divorce jurisdiction upoi county judge acting as a judge of a juvenile cour </seg>

At the present time, our Constitution does deny and ibridge the right of women to vote on account "of sex ind is, therefore, contrary to the Federal Constitution as hanged by the 18th amendment.

II. — Upon the question of whether or not a petition once filed may be supplemented by additional names or a supplemental petition, we would state that your petition should be in full when filed if possible, but that if a supplemental petition or additional names are filed be - fore the rights of other persons have intervened, said supplemental petition or additional names would probably be properly a part of said original petition. III. — Under the conditions expressed in Paragraph II hereof, we would say that the petition would be considered as a whole if names or supplemental petition were filed before intervening rights of ob - jectors' petitions had been filed. IV. — As to the question of amendment of the petition by change of the age expressed after the names upon the petition, we would say that if the age expressed upon the petition is over twenty-one (21) that is all that is required, and that an amendment would not be necessary, although there might be a mistake in fact as to the actual age expressed in the petition.

Mr. C. A. Kingsbury, County Attorney, Ponca, Nebraska My dear Mr. Kingsbury: We have your letter of Sep - tember 16th in which you ask for some information in regard to the question of the right of women to vote in this state for or against any proposition coming before the people of the State of Nebraska and you express some doubt as to the right to full and complete suffrage as depending upon the constitutional election yet to come. In answer to your inquiry, we inform you # that it has been the consistent holding of this department that women are now entitled to vote on any and all propositions com - ing before the electors of this state. There has been no amendment to Chapter 30 of the Laws of 1917 which amended and repealed Section 1940 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, but thirty-seven states having ratified the amendment to the Constitution of the United States, giving to women full and equal suffrage, seems to render it unnecessary for us to examine the laws of this state on that question. The 14th amendment to the Constitution of the United States reads as follows: "AH per tout born or naturalized in the United States and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citiiens of the United States and of the state where they reside. No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privilege* or immunities of citizens of the United States, nor shall any state deprive any person of life, liberty, or property without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its 'Jurisdiction the equal protection of the law."

Dear Madam: In reply to your letter of August 21st, permit me to say that in my opinion it is not necessary for women voters to state their exact age to registration officials in those counties where registration is required.

This act which you quote you will find in the statutes on page 382 of the 1915 Session Laws. It is an act entitled "An Act to provide for the registration of voters in cities having a population of more than 40,000." The Act, therefore, does not apply to Falls City or to any other city except Lincoln.

In other words, under the provisions of the Act which ap - plies to Falls City, the registration officer is not required to ask the age of the applicant, and merely must ask whether the applicant is a qualified voter. The applicant may, in my judgment, answer "Over twenty-one," and that reply should be accepted by the registration officer, unless "the fact shall appear" to the registration official that the person is very nearly of the age of twenty-one, in which case he might be justified in insisting on the exact age. I have been informed by the registration officials in Lincoln that even under the act which you quote, they have been accepting the statement "over twenty-one" when the registrant was beyond question over that age. This, I think-, is entirely proper. The purpose of the registration act, as very well out - lined in your own letter, is to identify the voter, and as you state "it is not the actual age of the voter but his apparent age which is of value for purposes of identifica - tion." It is therefore my idea that if the voter takes the oath that he or she is over twenty-one, the registra - tion official may accept that statement, making, if he de - sires, a notation of the apparent age of the voter for the purpose of identification.

Women may vote at the pri - mary election for all officers for which they are entitled to vote at the general election. Hon. D. M. Amsberry, Secretary of State, Capitol Build - ing, City. Dear Sir: You request the opinion of this department as to the time election boards should be appointed in this state in 1920. Section 1971, Revised Statutes, as amended by Chapter 83, Laws of 1919, provides: "That the Clerk of the District Court shall appoint the election board at least fifteen days prior to the primary general election of each general election, and provides further that the board shall hold office for a term of two years." The present boards were appointed prior to the pri - mary held in July, 1918. The next general election pri - mary will be held in April, 1920. In our opinion the pur - pose of the statute is to provide for a new election board prior to the biennial general election primary, and that the new boards should be appointed at least fifteen days before the April primary in 1920, even though this short - ens the two year term of office of the old board by some three months. Women may vote at the primary for the nomination of all offices, for which they are entitled to vote at the general election. It would be an absurdity to allow women to vote at the primaries in the selection of a can - didate for whom they are not permitted to vote by the state law. Very truly yours, CLARENCE A.

The said section provides "In each division and beneath all candidates placed thereby by nomination or petition a blank space shall be provided into which electors may write the name of any person for whom they wish to vote and whose name is not printed upon the ballot."

Mr. Frank Edgerton, Attorney at Law, Aurora, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Relative to the matter of the abolishment of the office of County Assessor at an election where the proposition was voted upon and where a majority of the votes cast on the proposition favored the abolishment of the office, but the number of votes cast for the proposi - tion did not constitute a majority of all votes cast at the election, we respond as follows: We have come to the conclusion that to abolish this office would require a majority of all votes cast at the election and not merely a majority of the votes cast upon the proposition. We support this finding by the following cases: Bryan v. Lincoln, 50 Nebr. 620, L. C. 624; State v. Anderson, 26 Nebr. 517, L. C. 520 State v. Bechel, 22 Nebr. 158. We have also reached the conclusion that it was the intention of the legislature to require a majority of the votes cast at the election, inasmuch as it required the vote to be taken at a general election, and inasmuch as it is a proposition in which the entire county is inter - ested and requires a petition of at least 10 per cent to submit the proposition to a vote. In the light of the authorities we have mentioned, we believe that the intention of the legislature is clear, and that our courts would hold as the decisions we have cited tend to hold, that it would require a majority of all votes cast at the election and not merely a majority on the proposition.

            <seg id="p211">204 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Elevators A licensee under the public grain warehouse law is required to receive all grain of suitable quality and condition tendered for storage so long as he has room to receive it. Mr. John E. Curtiss, Secretary. Xebraska State Railway Commission, Office. Dear Sir: I have examined the question propounded in the letter of the Updike Grain Company, dated July 20, 1920, viz: Is an elevator owner holding a license as a public warehouseman required to accept all grain ten - dered to him for storage? My opinion is that a licensee under the public grain warehouse law (Laws 1917, Chapter 155), is required to receive all grain of suitable quality and condition ten - dered to him so long as he has room to receive it. By accepting the provisions of the act, filing application and receiving a permit, the owner of an elevator becomes a public warehouseman. This implies that he must serve alike all who tender grain. The word "public" when used as an adjective, means "pertaining to, or belonging to, the people; relating to a nation, state, or community; open to all the people; shared in or to be shared or participated in or enjoyed by the people at large; not limited or restricted to any particular class of the community; of or pertaining to the people, belonging to the people." (32 Cyc. 747.) The statute also provides that (Section 7): "No discrimination shall be made between different customers by any public warehouse either in facilities, charges, or handling of any grain under this act." The business of a public warehouseman is one im - pressed with the public use, and as such is subject to regulation by the public. Munn v. People of III., 94 U. S. 113; The Central Elevator Co. v.

Eminent Domain A foreign corporation operating electric transmission lines, cannot exercise the power of eminent domain in Nebraska. Mr. T. A. Bronne, Secretary, Xebraska State Railway Commission, Office. Dear Sir: 1'our inquiry concerning the Continental Gas &amp; Electric Corporation, a Delaware corporation, in - volves this question: May a foreign corporation, operating electric trans - mission lines, exercise the power of eminent domain in Nebraska ? It must be answered in the negative. The question is of such importance and so frequently asked that I deem it proper to set forth the reasons for the answer with some detail. The right of eminent domain is an attribute of sover - eignty which the state itself may exercise or which it may delegate to others to exercise. Various explana - tions of its origin may be found but none of them throws light on the present inquiry. It may be taken as an accepted fact that the right inheres in all sovereign states. In The Mississippi &amp; R. R. B. Co. v. Patterson, 98 U. S. 403, 25 L. Ed. 206, the Supreme Court says: </seg>
            <seg id="p213">206 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL "The right of eminent domain, that is, the right to take private property for public uses, appertains to every independent government. It requires no constitutional recognition; it is an attribute of sovereign - ty. The clause found In the constitutions of the several states provid - ing for just compensation for property taken is a mere limitation upon the exercise of the right. When the use is public, the necessity or expediency of appropriating any particular property is not a sub - ject of judicial cognizance. The property may be appropriated by an act of the legislature, or the power of appropriating it may be dele - gated to private corporations, to be exercised by them in the execution of works in which the public is interested." Under constitutional provisions in many states for - eign corporations are not allowed to exercise the power; their policy being to restrict the granting of such power to those fully under their control. In the absence of constitutional restrictions, the legislature has plenary power to delegate the exercise of the right of eminent domain to a foreign corporation. However, delegation thereof will not be presumed and in order to effect a delegation thereof there must be an express grant. Authorities sustaining this proposition are cited below. In order correctly to interpret the statutes bearing upon this matter, the general policy of the state should be considered. At the time of the adoption of our con - stitution the right of eminent domain was important chiefly with reference to railroads. Telegraph lines were used mainly in connection with railroads and were usual - ly on the railroad right-of-way. Canals for carrying commerce were out of the question and canals for irriga - tion were deemed little more than a possibility. Tele - phone lines and electric transmission lines did not exist. Pipe lines and interurban railway lines were, of course, not considered. When, therefore, the subject of railroads was covered it was doubtless thought that the whole field had been occupied. The constitutional provision (Art. XI, Sec. 8) is as follows: "No railroad corporation organized under the laws of any other state, or of the United States and doing business in this state shall be entitled to exercise the right of eminent domain or have power to acquire the right-of-way, or real estate for depot or other uses, until </seg>
            <seg id="p214">OPINIONS 207 it shall have become a body corporate pursuant to and in accordance with the laws of this state." So strictly has this constitutional provision been con - strued that it was held that a foreign railroad corpora - tion could not acquire a right-of-way by means of a cor - poration organised under the laws of this state. Koenig P. C. B. &amp; Q., 27 Neb. 699. See also Trester v. M. P. Ry Co., 23 Xeb. 242 ; State v- Scott, 22 Neb. 628. We turn now from the regulation of foreign corpora - tions operating railroads to the power of domestic cor - porations to own real estate. Such power is indicative of the power of a corporation to exercise the right of eminent domain. Owing to accumulations of real prop - erty in the hands of religious corporations statutes of mortmain were passed by parliament at an early day to prevent their acquiring land. Such statutes were dic - tated by a desire to prevent large holdings, by religious animosities and by the general principles of the common law under which land was held by a military tenure which, of course, was inconsistent with ownership by a corpora - tion. In the time of Blackstone alienation to a corpora - tion was a ground of forfeiture. Cooley Blackstone (4 Ed.) Vol. 2, p. 469, Book II, p. 269. Likewise conveyance to an alien was a ground of forfeiture. Cooley Blackstone (4 Ed.) Vol. 2, p. 653, Book II, p. 274. See also: Dougherty v. Kubat, 67 Neb. 269. Foreign corporations seemingly had no right what - ever at common law to hold real estate. Under modern statutes the rules have been somewhat relaxed and cor - porations may now hold real estate; but in Nebraska, even domestic corporations have not unrestricted power to do so. A corporation's power in that regard is limited </seg>
            <seg id="p215">208 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL to the holding of such real estate as may be necessary for its legitimate business. Rev. Stat. 1913, Gen. Sec. 566. Colerige Creamery Company v. Jenkins, 66 Neb. 129. The authorities above cited show the general tendency to limit the power of domestic corporations to hold real estate. All of the reasons for limiting domestic corpora - tions apply to foreign corporations and in addition there - to all the reasons that apply to aliens. It is, therefore, to be expected that restrictions would be found in our statutes. The statute authorizing foreign corporations to hold liens upon real estate (Rev. Stat. 1913, Gen. Sec. 732) was enacted in 1911 and provides as follows: "Foreign corporations shall have the right to receive, take, pur - chase and hold by mortgage or otherwise, any securities and liens executed, given or transferred or so intended to represent or secure loans upon or purchase-money of lands or other property situate or being in this state, and to sell, assign, transfer, and to sue upon, foreclose or otherwise enforce the same heretofore or hereafter ac - quired." The power of foreign corporations to hold land in Nebraska is governed by Sections 6273 and 6276, Rev. Stat. 1913. They are as'follows: "Non-resident aliens and corporations not incorporated under the laws of the State of Nebraska are hereby prohibited from acquiring title to or taking or holding any lands or real estate in this state by descent, devise, purchase or otherwise, only as hereinafter provided, except that the widow and heirs of aliens who have prior to March 16th, 1889, acquired lands in this state under the laws thereof, may hold such lands by devise or descent for a period of ten years and no longer, and if at the end of such time herein limited, such lands, so acquired have not been sold to a botia fide purchaser for value, or such alien heirs have not become residents of this state, such lands shall revert and escheat to the State of Nebraska; and it shall be the duty of the county attorney in the counties where such lands are situated to enforce forfeitures of all such lands as provided by this article." and provided further, nothing in this article shall be </seg>

It is usually held, in the absence of legislative limita - tion, that the interest conveyed by condemnation pro - ceedings is no greater than necessary for the purpose for which the property is taken.

"This is in accordance with the rule of strict construction uni - versally applied to 'such statutes, and also in accordance with the rule that statutes are presumed to refer and apply only to persons and things within the state enacting them." Lewis Sec. 374, tupra. Evansville db Henderson Co. v. Henderson Bridge Co., 141 Fed. 51 In Chestatee Pyrites Co. v. Cavenders, supra, the court, in discussing this matter, says: "The right of eminent domain is a sovereign right of the state. It is inherent in every sovereignty, and existed before constitutions were adopted. It lies dormant until the legislature sets it in motion. As the legislature cannot in every case supervise the condemnation, it may confer the power upon agencies. These agencies may be in - dividuals or corporations, and the legislature may even confer this power upon foreign corporations or individuals living in another state. The power thus conferred is always to be strictly construed, and will not be permitted to be exercised except where it is affirmatively granted. Its grant is in derogation of common right, and is the exercise of one of the highest of the powers of sovereignty. Where, therefore, a priv - ate individual or corporation seeks to take the property of another under the power of eminent domain, affirmative authority for the exercise of the power must be shown. The power may be conferred either by special act creating the corporation or by general acts re - lating to all corporations of designated classes. If a foreign corpora - tion undertakes in this state to condemn private property, it must show legislative authority to do so. We have searched the authorities diligently to ascertain if any court has ever decided that a foreign corporation could exercise the right of eminent domain without legisla - tive authority from the state wherein it proposes to exercise the right, </seg>
            <seg id="p218">OPINIONS 211 and have been unable to find a single case so holding. All the courts seem to hold that this right of eminent domain does not exist as a matter of comity between the states, and all hold, so far as we can find, that a foreign corporation must have affirmative authority from the state in which it proposes- to exercise the right. 'A railroad com - pany or other quasi public corporation cannot exercise the right of eminent domain in another state than that by which it was created, unless it is expressly or impliedly authorized to do so by the laws of such other state. Such power does not come within the rule of comity': Clark &amp; Marshall on Private Corporations, 2734, sec. 854. Judge Thompson, in his excellent and valuable work on Corporations (volume 6, section 7932), says: 'The power of a private corporation to ac - quire private property for the public purposes for which it may have been chartered is a power which comes to it alone through the dele - gation of the state of its sovereign right of eminent domain. The power cannot, therefore, be exercised by a foreign corporation on a mere principle of comity, because it will never be presumed, in the absence of affirmative legislation, that the state delegates any part of its sovereignty to a foreign corporation. It may be stated with con - fidence in every case that this power cannot be exercised by a corpora - tion created under the laws of one state or country, within the limits of another state or country without the consent of the legislature of that other state or country, affirmatively expressed.' We are satisfied to close this part of the opinion with this authority from so eminent an author. 2. The defendant in error claimed, however, that sections 650-657 of the Political Code are broad enough to include foreign corporations. We think that they should not be so construed. We think that the legislature cannot be held to have granted the right of eminent domain, one of the highest of the sovereign rights of the state, to any and every corporation which may be created by any other state or country. These sections must be construed strictly. We cannot believe that the legislature, by the use of the words 'any corporation,' intended to confer part of the sovereignty of the state upon every corporation created in any state or country in the world which might be engaged in one of the businesses Aesignated in these sections. As Judge Thomp - son says in the quotation above, 'it will never be presumed, in the absence of affirmative legislation, that the state delegates any part of its sovereignty to a foreign corporation. • • • This power can - not be exercised by a (foreign) corporation * • • without the consent of the legislature • • • affirmatively expressed.' " In Spratt v. Helena Power Transmission Co., (Mont.) 8 L. R. A. (N. S.) 567, it is said: "Section 526 is found in Chapter III of title I, which deals with the powers of corporations, and without here stopping to analyse </seg>
            <seg id="p219">212 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL the several sections of that chapter, we are of the opinion that they, each and all, have reference solely to domestic corporations, and that, while the language of Sec. 526 may be broad enough in its terms to Include foreign as well as domestic corporations, such was not the legislative intention." It therefore follows that Section 7420, Revised Statutes 1913, does not by the language "all persons, associations and corporations," etc., refer to corporations created anywhere in the world. It refers only to Nebraska cor - porations or to those foreign corporations authorized to do business in this state. Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General.

Dear Sir: Commissioner Browne submitted this ques - tion: The owner of an elevator agrees to purchase wheat at the market price at the time the wheat may be shipped out. He pays the owner of the wheat per bushel $1.00 down, the balance to be paid at the time of the shipment of the wheat, less storage charges, the wheat being de - livered to the elevator at the time of the contract. Does this make the owner of the elevator liable under the public grain warehouse law? </seg>
            <seg id="p220">OPINIONS 213 I think that the transaction makes the elevator a pub - lic warehouse and the owner liable as a warehouseman under that statute. The statute provides, (Section 1): "Any grain which has been received at any grain elevator or grain warehouse for which payment has not been made within ten days after the receipt of the same, is hereby deemed to be held in storage." The meaning of this is that any contract of sale be - tween the owner of grain and the proprietor of the eleva - tor shall not be valid unless payment shall be made with - in ten days. Payment is defined as "the delivery of money or its equivalent by one person from whom it is due to another person to whom it is due." (30 Cyc. 1180.) Unless the payment is in full so that nothing remains to be done be - tween the seller and the buyer, the transaction is brought within the terms of the statute and parties are liable thereunder.

Examination Fees The examination fee paid by persons applying for a license to practice dentistry shall in no case be refunded. Similar fees paid by persons seeking to become licensed chiropractors or licensed physicians and surgeons shall be returned if the ap - plicant cannot take the examination. Mr. Philip F. Bross, Secretary of Finance, Lincoln, Xebr. Dear Sir: In answer to your oral inquiry of recent date in regard to the refund of fees paid for the various examinations provided for by law, will say: </seg>
            <seg id="p221">214 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL I— DENTISTS Section 14, Division 4 of Title VI of Chapter 190 of the Session Laws of 1919, makes the following provision : "Every person applying to the Department of Public Welfare for a license to practice dentistry at the regular semi-annual meeting shall pay to the treasurer of said state board of dental examiners a fee of $20.00. uhich in ho case shall be refunded." It seems to me that the wording of this law removes all doubt in this particular case. The law provides that the fee so paid, shall in no case be refunded, and must be assumed to mean exactly what it says. II— CHIROPRACTIC In regard to this the law makes the following pro - vision : "Every applicant making application for an examination and a certificate under the provisions of this article shall pay to the depart - ment the sum of $25.00, all such fees to be equally divided among the members of the board making such examination, as full compensa - tion for their serrices." From this it will be seen that it was the intention of the legislature that the fees so paid go to the examiners in return for the services which they render. They ren - der these services only when the applicant takes the ex - amination. If the applicant cannot take the examination, the service cannot be rendered, and if the services are not rendered, the members of the examining board are not entitled to receive the fees but they should be re - funded to the applicant, and I do not find in this portion of the law any specific provision against a refund as men - tioned above. In the absence of such provision, the fees should be returned.

Dear Sir: Your letter written to the Governor under date of August 25th has been referred to me by the Governor with request that I answer it. I think you have raised a very interesting point and one which perhaps deserves some serious thought as to whether the returns on money loaned and money invested ought not to be the same, but of course as a matter of law it is absolutely settled and has been for years that there is no possible connection between excess profits in business and usury on money loaned, and this must necessarily be true. The risks attendant upon any business enterprise are so much greater than that of money loaned upon good security that the returns must necessarily be a great deal CLARENCE A. DAVIS, </seg>
            <seg id="p223">216 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL larger, otherwise people would not hazard investment of money in business enterprises. I think you will find that an analysis of various in - vestments will show you that automatically this thing has worked out until the returns in almost every line of business are about equal to the risks which one runs. The interest on money loaned is of course the lowest, the interest on money loaned without security is higher, money invested in public utilities where they are under government supervision is about the same, settled in - vestments such as bank stock and the stock of well estab - lished corporations has slightly more risk and pays a slightly higher return. Manufacturing business, which is always more or less of a risk, pays a still higher re - turn, running up to 25 or 30 per cent, and from there on up the returns on money invested have always been, and probably always will be, about commensurate with the risk involved, so that I say your proposition as a legal matter is entirely hopeless. As a matter for economists and legislators to work out it may be that a fair profit can and will be defined for money invested just the same as a fair rate has been established for money loaned. But I would suggest for your serious consideration that such a bill, if it were ever passed, would result in most serious handicapping of business enterprises and of individual effort which has always been the strongest feature of our institutions. I trust that this will be at least a partial answer to the idea as set forth by you. Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, August 30, 1919. Attorney General. </seg>

Thompson, in our opinion the objections of the defend - ant to the jurisdiction do not rest upon sound and sub - stantial legal grounds. Defendant's motion is based on the theory that de - fendant is deprived of his liberty because he was extra - dited when not a fugitive from justice. The provisions of the Federal Constitution in respect to extradition, Section 2, Article 2, are as follows: "A person charged in any state with treason, felony or other crimes, who shall flee from justice and be found in another state, shall on demand of executive authority of the state from which he fled be delivered up to be removed from the state having jurisdiction of the crime." Two things only are necessary to the validity of extra - dition proceedings: 1. It must appear the defendant is substantial charged with a crime. 2. That he is a fugitive from justice. Dennison v. Christians, 72 Neb. 703, affirmed 196 U. S. 637. In the case at bar, there is no question but that de - fendant is substantially charged with a crime of murder. The fact that after having been so charged, he left the state, no matter for what purpose, he is a fugitive within the meaning of the extradition law. </seg>

Rayner, 124 Fed. 481 In the Appleyard case, the Supreme Court of th United States said: "A person charged by inditement or by affidavit before a magit trate with the commission within the state of a crime covered by it laws and who after the charge of the commission of such crime leave the state — no matter for what purpose, or with what motive, nor unde what belief — becomes from the time of such leaving and within th&lt; meaning of the constitution and laws of the United States a fugitive from justice, and if found in another state must be delivered up b; the Governor of such state to the state whose laws are alleged to b&lt; violated, on the production of such indictment or affidavit, certifle&lt; or authentic, by the Governor of the state from which the accused de parted." In re Willard, 93 Neb. 298, our Supreme Court holds "Certificates of executive authority are made conclusive as tc their validity when presented to the executive of the state where th« fugitive is found." On the authority of Kentucky v. Dennison, 24 Howard, 66, and Dennison v. Christians, 72 Neb. 703, subsequently carried to the Supreme Court of the United States and affirmed in 196 U. S. 637, our Supreme Court on the au - thority of Hyatt v. Cochran, 188 U. S. 691, holds that the finding by the Governor that the accused is a fugi - tive from justice is conclusive. Roberts v. Riley, 116 U. S. 80, sets forth the same doctrine. A fugitive from justice is any person, who commits crime and goes to an adjoining state. The purpose of his departure is immaterial. Bruce v. Rayner, 124 Federal 481, holds : "It is true that if a person commits a crime and withdraws him - self from the state where It is ccmmitted without any thought of flee - ing from justice, for the purpose of going to his home, he is still within </seg>

In that case Moyer, Hayward and Pettibone were indicted in Idaho for the murder of Ex-Governor Steurnberg. The defendants were appre - hended in Colorado, and returned to Idaho on extradi - tion proceedings, with no opportunity to test the validity of such proceedings before the Colorado court. The charge was the prisoners were practically kidnapped. The Idaho court held that it had jurisdiction over the prisoners when they were brought before it, and the manner or method in which the presence of the prisoners were se - cured was immaterial, and held that : "If the prisoner is within the jurisdiction of the demanding state and there applies to its courts for relief, it cannot raise the question as to whether or not he has been as a matter of fact a fugitive from the justice of the state within the meaning cf the federal constitution and the act of congress." Other cases laying down this same rule are : Kerr v. Illinois, 119 U. S. 436 Mahon v. Justice, 127 U. S. 700 In the words of Judge Barnes, In re Willard, 93. Neb. 298, quoting from State v.

Howell against the United States Casualty Company, and have taken time to go into the matter to quite an extent.

Calling your attention to Section 3245 of the Revised ■Statutes of 1913, which provides a penalty for the viola - :ion of the provisions of the sections mentioned above as f ollows : "Any company or association, or any officer, agent or broker there - if which or who issues or delivers in this state or to any citizen there - of any policy in wilfull violation of the provisions of this article, shall &gt;e punished by a fine not exceeding $100.00 for each offense; and Lhat the department of trade and commerce may revoke the license it any company, association, agent or broker thereof, which or who •iolates any of the provisions of this article." You will see that this section provides for a penalty o{ a fine not to exceed $100.00, and that also that the Insurance Department may revoke the license. The proceedings which have been had in this case appear to me as being rather peculiar. The State Insur - ance Board would have no authority to levy a fine of this kind. The only way that the payment of this fine ?ould be brought about would be by a complaint regular - y made before a court where the offense was committed, ind a criminal trial upon the facts, the same as any )ther criminal trial, and a fine imposed by the court. I epeat that the State Insurance Board has no authority ;o levy or collect such a fine, but it must be levied by the court in the regular manner provided by law. I, therefore believe that the action of the Insurance Board n fining the sum of $100.00 in this manner was wholly v-oid, and that the company cannot and should not be ?ompelled to pay the same.

            <seg id="p233">226 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Foreign Languages Religious instruction in a private, denominational, parochial or public school must be given in the English language to pupils who have not passed the eighth grade examinations. Rev. C. F. Brommer, Hampton, Xebraska. Dear Sir: The Attorney General is in receipt of your letter of October 21, 1920, raising another question under the foreign languages act, and inquiring whether or not it is an interference with religious instruction for the law to provide that instruction in parochial schools must be in the English language. We call your attention to Chapter 249 of the Laws of Nebraska for 1919 which provides that no person, in - dividually or as a teacher, shall in any private, denom - inational, parochial or public school, teach any subject to any person in any language than the English language. The section immediately following provides that lan - guages other than the English language may be taught as languages only after a pupil shall have passed the eighth grade. The distinguishing point between a parochial school and our ordinary public school is that in the parochial school there is a certain amount of religious instruction which is a part of the curriculum of the parochial school. The law specifically provides that parochial and denom - inational schools shall be subject to the same school laws as the public schools. It seems to us that the statute we have quoted is very clear and explicit to the effect that no foreign languages may be taught in such schools until after the pupil has attained and passed the eighth grade. Inasmuch as re - ligious training is a part of the curriculum, we believe that the religious training must be in the English lan - guage. You will note by Section 5 of Chapter 155, that all public, private, denominational or parochial schools shall </seg>

All of these sections of our laws indicate that the in - ention of our legislature is that citizens of this state shall get away from all antagonizing influences which night tend to obstruct the inculcation or patriotism and :he growth of good American citizenship in the pupils )f the schools of this state. Our legislature has deter - nined that instruction in foreign languages in the schools &gt;f this state, except as languages after the pupil has )assed the eighth grade, is detrimental to good citizen - ship. This is a matter that has been determined by the egislature and is not a matter that is now being deter - nined by this office. It is merely our explanation of the anguage used by the legislators in enacting the laws of .his state. You refer to the fact that it is desired in your school o give religious instruction in the German language in &gt;rder that the pupils may attend German churches or ierman services with their parents and be thus enabled :o worship with their parents. We cannot see that such i statement has any bearing upon this proposition, for t is an admitted fact that religion does not depend upon iny language or any nationality. It is also a well known Fact that where parents desire their children to have Knowledge of a foreign language before it is taught in the ordinary course of school training, such children ob - tain such knowledge from the daily family intercourse in their own homes, and any smattering of such a lan - guage as might be obtained by listening to religious in - struction would be but a makeshift.

Instruction in German in a Sunday school for the purpose of preparing the pupils to receive religious instruction is legal. Rev. John I). Gross, Hastings, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of the 5th inst., addressed to the Attorney General has reached the office during his absence and has been referred to me for answer. I enclose herewith a pamphlet containing an inter - pretation by the Attorney General of the new language laws of this state. You will notice the inhibition upon the teaching of a foreign language in schools such as yours is made, if at all, by Senate File 24. The first section of said act forbids any person to teach any sub - ject to any person in any language other than the Eng - lish language, in any private, denominational, parochial or public school. It is obvious that your Sunday school is not a private, denominational, parochial or public school in the sense in which those terms are used in </seg>
            <seg id="p236">OPINIONS 229 House Roll No. 64, passed by the same session of the legislature that passed Senate File No. 24, for if it were, as you can readily see, nobody who did not hold a teach - er's certificate, could instruct a class even in the Sunday school and it is plain that such is not the intent of the law. The Attorney General has held for reasons set out logically and forcibly in the enclosed pamphlet that Sec - tion 2 of Senate File No. 24 is a continuation of the first section and covers the same subject matter and relates to the same thing, viz : The teaching of languages in priv - ate, denominational, parochial or public schools. In as much as your school belongs to neither of those classes, as those terms are used in the statutes under considera - tion, it occurs to me that a logical conclusion is that so long as the instruction in German in those infant classes is merely ancillary to the purpose of preparing the pupils to receive religious instruction, which in your school is carried on in the German language, it is permissible. You will observe that under the law it is clearly per - missible to give religious instruction in the German lan - guage, provided it is not done in schools of the classes enumerated in Senate File No. 24 and House Roll No. 64. It is also permissible beyond question to teach the Ger - man language as a language in school classes above the eighth grade where the pupils have finished the eighth grade studies in a satisfactory manner. There is nothing then in the law which absolutely pro - hibits the teaching of German or any other foreign lan - guage in this state or prohibits the giving of religious instruction in any foreign language, although the right in both instances is somewhat restricted. The question is whether the restrictions extend to the infant classes in Sunday schools and as heretofore pointed out, this department, after a careful consideration of the question, has come to the conclusion that such restrictions do not apply to instruction given in a Sunday school in a for - eign tongue where such instruction is merely ancillary </seg>

Mr. H. Dasenbrock, Leigh, Nebraska. Dear Sir; This department is in receipt of your favor of October 18, in which you inquire whether at the pres - ent time, it is unlawful in Nebraska to teach a "con - firmation" class in the German language, provided that the members of such class have not all passed the eighth grade. The law, as it stands now, Chapter 249, of the Laws of 1919, prohibits any person from teaching any subject in any "denominational, parochial or private school" in any language than the English language; permits lan - guages other than the English to be taught, if a student has successfully passed the eighth grade, and provides for a penalty of between $25.00 and $100.00, or a thirty (30) day jail sentence for a violation of this law. This department construes the law to prohibit the teaching of a "confirmation" class in German or in any other language except English, when the members of such class have not passed the eighth grade examinations. </seg>
            <seg id="p238">OPINIONS 231 This law is in force at present, and will be continued i force unless it is declared unconstitutional by the Su - reme Court, in the suit now pending.

It is not binding even upon the County Attorneys and it is most certainly not binding upon the courts. In view, however, of the large public interest in these measures and of the sincerity of a great many people who are conscientiously endeavoring to obey the new laws, I have deemed it advisable to give a somewhat extended explanation of what is covered in these bills and of what acts are deemed a subject of prosecution. Senate File No. 24, the foreign language bill, is as follows : "Section 1. No person, individually or as a teacher, shall in any private, denominational, parochial or public school, teach any subject to any person in any language other than the English language. Section 2. Languages other than the English language may be taught as languages only after a pupil shall have attained and suc - cessfully passed the eighth grade as evidenced by a certificate of graduation issued by the County Superintendent of the county in which the child resides." House Roll No. 64, which regulates private, denomina - tional and parochial schools, is an extended bill, the chief points of which are as follows: 1. Compels the attendance of children between the ages of seven and sixteen during at least twelve weeks each year, and if the school in that district continues more than twelve weeks, then of two-thirds of such period, at a public, private, denominational or parochial school. 2. Provides that all private, denominational and parochial schools and the teachers employed therein, shall be subject to the general school laws of the state in regard to graduation qualifications and certifica - tions of teachers and pupils. 3. Prohibits anyone's employment as a teacher in any private, parochial or denominational school who does not have a teacher's certificate so that they could teach in a corresponding public school. 4. Provides that all schools shall give courses in American His - tory and Civil Government to give all pupils a thorough knowledge of Ihe history of our country and form of government. </seg>
            <seg id="p240">OPINIONS 233 5. Provides that the County Superintendent shall inspect all schools and report any propaganda or instruction which is subversive of Ameri - can institutions, a republican form of government or good citizenship. 6. Allows freedom of religious instruction in private, denomina - tional or parochial schools, but not in a foreign language. Senate File No. 237 prohibits the holding of public - meetings in Nebraska in any other language than the English language except meetings or conventions held for the purpose of religious teachings, instruction or worship. Following the usual rule of statutory interpretation, these bills, dealing with the same general subject, passed by the same legislature at the same time, are to be con - strued together with reference to any matters wherein one bill sheds light upon another. In the first place, it ought to be made clear that there is nothing in any of these bills which prohibits the speak - ing of foreign languages among individuals in private conversation. The chief questions which have arisen are in regard to Senate File No. 24 which is quoted literally above. A plain, careful reading of the first section will dispose of any inquiries that will be made regarding it, except as to what constitutes a private, denominational or parochial school. As to what constitutes such a school, an examina - tion of House Roll No. 64 will give a general idea. It is evident that by a private, denominational or parochial school, the legislature meant such a school as might take the place of a public school. This is shown by the pro - vision that requires all teachers and pupils to be sub - ject to the general school laws. It is shown by the pro - vision which requires teachers to have certificates as in the public schools. It is shown by the fact that the County Superintendent is authorized to supervise and inspect these schools. In consideration of these things, it is our opinion that a school (private, denominational, parochial or public) </seg>
            <seg id="p241">234 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL may consist of a meeting of two or more pupils with a regular course of study, systematically pursued, with a classification of pupils. When this condition exists, whether the thing which is being conducted be called a school or not, it is our opinion that it is unlawful to teach any subject in any language other than the English. The most numerous questions raised are over Section 2 of the language bill, which is quoted above. This sec - tion has been widely misunderstood by people who have read apart from its context and without reference to the .whole of the bill which enacted it. The bill says: "Section 1. No person * * * as a teacher shall teach in any private, denominational or parochial school, any subject * * * . Section 2. Languages other than the English language, may be taught as languages only after the pupil shall have attained the eighth grade, etc." It is our opinion that the second section of this bill is a logical, clear cut continuation of the first section, that it covers the same subject matter and relates to the tame thing, viz: the teaching of languages in private, denominational, parochial or public schools. We are forced to this conclusion by other considerations, the first of which is that the record of this bill in its course through the house and senate read with the amendments which were offered and rejected show that it was meant to so apply. In the second place, if the section is not read with re - lation to schools, it prohibits the teaching of a mother to her child of even the simplest words of her mother tongue. It prohibits instruction in the family in such a way that I have grave doubts of its constitutionality, if it is not read in connection with the complete context of the act. Third, the language of the section itself, by using the word "pupil" and requiring an eighth grade certificate seems to make it a section relating to schools. </seg>
            <seg id="p242">OPINIONS 235 For these reasons, I am of the opinion that the foreign language bill does not prohibit the teaching of foreign languages in the home from one individual to another and does not prohibit the teaching of foreign languages, provided this is not done in a school, bearing in mind the very strict interpretation of the term "school" that 1 have given above. The next most common question is whether there is anything in these bills which prohibits the conducting of a Sunday school in a foreign language. There is not. Bearing in mind, the general definition of private, denom - inational and parochial schools which is implied in House Roll No. 64, by requiring certificates for teachers, by re - quiring compliance with the general school laws, by re - quiring equipment and supplies, by requiring instruction in American History and Civil Government and by ex - pressly permitting religious instruction, it is clear in my mind that Sunday schools conducted in a foreign language are not prohibited by these bills. Further proof that foreign language Sunday schools are not prohibited by this bill is shown by the fact that an amendment to prohibit such Sunday schools was de - feated by the legislature. The most difficult question under these bills is whether it is permissible to conduct in addition to the regular schools out of hours classes or Saturday schools, where - in children are instructed in subjects in a foreign lan - guage. It is my opinion that such schools are prohibited by these bills. An amendment permitting such out of hours schools was defeated by the legislature. My opin - ion is that such out of hours schools are "schools" with - in the meaning of the act and that the teaching of sub - jects in them in a foreign language is prohibited.

There is shown in all these bills a fair tendency to not interfere with religious instruction or religious classes and these may be conducted so long as they are a fair equivalent for the Sunday school and are not run for the purpose of conducting a school to dodge the re - quirements of English school instruction. To these rulings, however, should have been added the following warning: the exceptions in favor of Sunday schools and of outside classes for religious instruction conducted in a foreign language and for private instruc - tion in a foreign language, were made by this legislature not because they were considered desirable or because they created good American citizens, but the exceptions were made solely because of the ideals of this country, which allow, so far as possible, freedom of religious creed and of formal religious worship, and the exception allow - ing private instruction in a foreign language, as a lan - guage, was made solely because of the extreme hardship that would be occasioned in certain cases in the home were not this possible. Because these fundamental rights were protected, they must not be abused. Any attempt to evade the Ameri - canization program set up in these bills, by teaching other things under the guise of religious instruction, will be prosecuted without leniency. Any attempt to evade the bills requiring public school attendance in an English language school where American History and Civil Gov - ernment are taught, by undertaking by means of individ - ual instruction in a foreign language and the constant use of such language, to defeat this bill will likewise be the subject of prosecution. The fact that schools for re - ligious instruction are protected by these bills, does not mean that any school can be named a school for religious instruction and escape the penalties of these bills. In other words, where there is a fair, honest compliance with the laws as enacted, religious instruction and the sanctity of the language in the home will not be disturbed, but where these provisions are used as a screen for the con - tinuation of un-American practices, this office will assist </seg>
            <seg id="p244">OPINIONS 237 to the best of its ability, the local officers in the prosecu - tion of the offenders. For the serious consideration of the citizens affected by these bills, this department desires to urge that at - tendance for the full time in the public schools of this state, raises a presumption of an honest desire to comply with the law. In conclusion, it is impossible for this office to reply by letter, saying that this or that local situation does or does not comply with the law. Such a ruling can only be made after an investigation of both sides of the situation. A letter from either party to the controversy, cannot be taken as a sufficient basis to give a final rul - ing in regard to any school. Therefore, I recommend that every local situation be fully referred to and ex - amined by the County Attorney of the county where it arises, who, after a full investigation of all the facts, is the only competent person to determine whether or not the acts in question are subject to prosecution. The above explanations are given with the sole inten - tion to honestly state our interpretation of this very dif - ficult situation and we ask for the same fairness and candor on the part of the people affected as we have en - deavored to give in our explanation. CLARENCE A. DAVIS. Attorney General Initiative and Referendum The Secretary of State should refuse to accept for filing referendum petitions when "a true and correct copy of the measure to be referred" is not attached to any of the petitions. Such petitions do not comply with Section 2337 of the Revised Statutes of 1913. To Honorable D. M. Amsberry, Secretary of State. Dear Mr. Amsberry: I have before me your inquiry of July 14th in which you state: </seg>
            <seg id="p245">238 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL "There have been offered to me, together with the request that I file, certain documents which purport to be referendum petitions on Senate File No. 2. 'A true and correct copy of the measure' is not attached to any of the petitions offered for file, and it is admitted by the gentleman who presented these documents that these petitions were circulated in the same condition in which they were offered to me and were not circulated with 'a full and correct copy of the meas - ure to be referred" attached to any of said petitions." You ask whether, under these circumstances, the peti - tions comply with the statute and. should be accepted and filed by you. It is our opinion that Section 2337, Revised Statutes of 1913, is a complete and decisive answer to the ques - tion you have raised. That section provides that a full and correct copy of the title and text of the law shall be attached to initiative petitions, "and referendum petitions shall be attached to a full and correct copy of the measure on which the referendum is demanded and may be filed in numbered sections in like manner." I do not know what more clear language the legisla - ture could have used to say that a copy of the entire bill must be attached to the petitions while they are being circulated and when they are presented for filing. This interpretation is further strengthened by the fol - lowing part of the same section : "When any such • • * referendum petition shall be offered for filing, the Secretary of State, in the presence of the Governor and the person offering the same for filing, shall detach the sheets con - taining the signatures and affidavits and cause them all to be attached to one or more printed copies of the measure • • • against which the referendum petitions are filed." Detached? Detached from what? Obviously from the copies of the measure to which they were attached while being circulated. Continuing further, "The detached copies of such measures shall be delivered to the person offering the same for filing." </seg>
            <seg id="p246">OPINIONS 239 From whence did these detached copies come if not taken from the petitions as they were circulated and pre - sented for filing f It is hard to see how anything could be more clear and explicit than this section of our statute. It refers to the manner and condition in which the peti - tions are to be circulated and signed. The reasons for this provision are obvious. Under our constitution the referendum is a reservation of legis - lative power in the voters of the state. By the use of the referendum every voter is made a legislator. Every per - son who signs a referendum petition is asking the privi - lege of voting on a legislative measure. The voter be - comes a legislator. It must therefore follow that the voter must be fully advised of the matters upon which he is to sign a petition and later cast a vote. The in - telligent exercise of this power is impossible without the voter having a chance to read and understand the meas - ure in question. It is a matter of common knowledge that referendum petitions are obtained by circulators who present the petitions to the voter with a very limited amount of discussion. Unless the measure upon which a referendum is to be invoked is attached to the petition, the elector must rely upon the statement of the circulator, whose interest lies entirely in the direction of obtaining as many signatures as possible and who is not in a posi - tion to give a fair and impartial statement of the meas - ure to the voter. To guard against fraud, deception and ill-advised action, the legislature, not only in Nebraska but in every other state where direct legislation is at - tempted, has provided that the voter must have under his eye as a part of the petition to which he attaches his name, a complete and full copy of the measure sought to be referred. It seems to me that the circulation of referendum peti - tions which contain nothing more than the title to a bill and the signatures to which are obtained from the voters with no more explanation than that given by the party who circulates the petition, is the very essence of bad government. I can conceive of no more vicious system </seg>
            <seg id="p247">240 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL of government than that which would permit the circula - tion of a petition practically in blank, and then the at - taching of these petitions to a copy of a certain measure and asking to have that measure suspended by reason of such a system. The whole principle of our government is that the voter is given every means of casting an in - telligent vote. To say that a referendum petition which will suspend the operation of a law can be circulated without giving the voter even a copy of the bill, is direct - ly contrary to that principle, and I may say for your further information that where this matter has been passed upon in other states it has been held that a copy of the bill must be attached to the petitions while they are being circulated. Some confusion in this matter has resulted from an attempted application of Section 2335 of the Revised Statutes to the facts in this case. Section 2335 provides explicitly the form of the printed petition. It sets this form out as it is to be used. But this section is limited to the form of the petition which must be printed and has no reference to the requirement that copies of the bill be attached to the form as printed. Our attention has been called to the case of Bartlhifi v. Waite, 96 Neb. 532, and 148 X. \Y. 507. We have made a careful analysis of this case and we feel that it is ab - solutely in accord with the principles herein laid down. The only question raised, discussed or decided in that case in reference to the form of the referendum petition was whether or not the statute requires a full text of an act of the legislature upon which a referendum is de - manded to be printed on the face of the referendum peti - tion. The court decided that the statute did not require the printing of the full text of the law on the face of the petition. This is exactly our own view and is following out explicitly the terms of Section 2335. In other words, the decision in Bartling v. Waite is an interpretation of Section 2335, and the court expressly states that Section 2337, which is the answer to your present inquiry, is in - applicable to the facts as presented to the court in that </seg>
            <seg id="p248">OPINIONS 241 case. The question of whether or not "referendum peti - tions shall be attached to a full and correct copy of the measure on which a referendum is demanded" was not before the court for decision. In view of the statute and the reasoning above given, it is my opinion, and I am glad to add that it is the unanimous opinion of all the lawyers attached to this department, that these petitions as presented to you do not comply with the statute, that they were not circulated in a manner which complies with the statute, and that therefore, following the law, you should refuse to accept them for filing. Respectfully submitted, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, July 16, 1919. Attorney General.

Mr. W. B. Young, Chief of Bureau of Insurance, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. SUBJECT: In re application of Bankers Fire Insur - ance Company of Lincoln, Xebr., for license: Dear Sir: In answer to your oral request for an opinion from this department upon the legal questions involved in the matter named above, and for an opinion by this department as to what disposition should be made of this matter, will say: </seg>
            <seg id="p249">242 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL The above matter has been given considerable serious consideration by this department through various con - ferences with the members of your department, of the representatives of the Bankers Fire Insurance Company, and through the hearings, which have been held in re - gard to it. A large number of points have been brought up, and are before us for consideration in connection therewith, a discussion of which I think will help to clear up the situation and act as an explanation in paving the way for our final conclusion. First of all, I believe it would be well to get clearly in mind the history upon which the discussion is based. The Bankers Fire Insurance Company was organized in the spring of 1919, with a capital stock of two million dollars, a requirement that it have a surplus of fifty per cent of the paid up capital stock, and also a requirement as a part of its articles of incorporation that there be at least $500,000.00 of paid up capital stock before appli - cation was made for a license to do business. Simultane - ously, the Bankers Brokerage Company was organized, the same individuals signing its articles of incorporation, as incorporators as signed the articles of incorporation for the Bankers Fire Insurance Company. The Bankers Brokerage Company had a capital stock of $5,000.00. Subsequently a contract was entered into between the Bankers Fire Insurance Company and the Bankers Brokerage Company, by their respective officers, accord - ing to which contract the Bankers Brokerage Company purchased from the Bankers Fire Insurance Company $1,500,000.00 of the capital stock of the Bankers Fire In - surance Company, and agreed to pay therefor $2,250, - 000.00, this contract to run until September 1, 1920. As a part of this contract it was provided that the Bankers Brokerage Company should establish both policy and loan agents throughout the State of Nebraska, and bear all the expense of their establishment. Acting upon this con - tract, the Bankers Brokerage Company sold the stock of the Bankers Fire Insurance Company to various persons throughout the State of Nebraska at increased prices, pay- </seg>
            <seg id="p250">OPINIONS 243 ing the Bankers Fire Insurance Company the amount provided for in the contract, and paying from the ad - vanced price, the expenses of selling the stock, and re - taining whatever difference there might be as their own profits or suffering the loss which may have been occa - sioned, the facts in regard to which we are not conversant with at the present time. At least in December, 1919, sufficient of the stock had been sold, so that the Bankers Fire Insurance Company had the $500,000.00 of capital stock, together with a surplus of $250,000.00, as required by the articles of incorporation, and thereupon made ap - plication to the Insurance Department for a license to transact an insurance business in the State of Nebraska. The Insurance Department then in regular course, caused an examination to be made of the affairs of the Bankers Fire Insurance Company, and subsequently conducted a further investigation by putting various witnesses upon the stand and taking their testimony with the assistance of this department. I. — I would call your attention first to the fact that the reports of the examiner shows that the Bankers Fire Insurance Company is a solvent corporation, that it had more than $500,000.00 of capital, had more than $250, - 000.00 of surplus, that it has been properly organized ac - cording to law, that its articles of incorporation are prop - erly filed, that its officers and directors have been elected, that in so far as the company itself in the matter of its organization, internal government and financial standing are concerned, it is in a proper condition to be granted a license to transact insurance business in the State of Nebraska. II. — I would next call your attention to the fact that prima facia the contract entered into between the Bank - ers Fire Insurance Company and the Bankers Brokerage Company is a valid contract between two separate and distinct legal entities. The question which has arisen is whether this contract is a valid contract between two sepa - rate and distinct legal entities, or whether it was collu - sive and was a subterfuge for evading the law. This is </seg>
            <seg id="p251">244 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL a matter which could only be finally determined through an adjudication by the courts, but we must say that at least prima facia the presumption is that it is not, but is legal and valid. III. — In case it should be the opinion of your depart - ment in considering the evidence before it, that the con - tract as made and entered into was made by collusion, and was a subterfuge for the purpose of evading the law, another serious question would arise, namely; whether the collusion was attributable to the Bankers Fire Insurance Company, or whether the officers of the Bankers Fire Insurance Company are guilty of collusion aR individuals only and not as officers of the company, as there has been some testimony to indicate the con - tract was made in order that the officers of the Bankers Fire Insurance Company, who made it, might realize a profit from the sale of stock through the medium of the Bankers Brokerage Company, the presumption would be that the Bankers Fire Insurance Company did not have knowledge of such collusion because the officers doing this for their own personal advantage would be presumed not to communicate the facts to the insurance company. Therefore, the collusion could not be attributed to the in - surance company, but only to the officers thereof as in - dividuals. I will have to say, therefore, that there would be serious questions in the event the evidence were found sufficient to justify a conclusion that there was collusion in the making of the contract, whether such collusion were attributable to the Bankers Fire Insurance Company. IV. — Another point which I have given serious con - sideration is the fact that the rules which are at present in force in regard to the selling of stock to insurance companies were not put in force by the Insurance De - partment of the State of Nebraska until December 1, 1919, and therefore most of the events in connection with, this matter took place prior to the going into effect of these rules. The organizers of the Bankers Fire Insurance Company have stated that when they first undertook the matter of organizing the company, they discussed it with </seg>
            <seg id="p252">OPINIONS 245 I Mr. Eastham, who was then Insurance Commissioner; that they submitted to him the contract between the Bankers Fire Insurance Company and the Bankers Brokerage Company, and that he approved thereof; that they then went ahead with their plans and carried them out in accordance therewith. I have very grave doubts as to whether, in view of this fact, the rules which were put in force on December 1, 1919, should be made to ap - ply in any way to acts prior to that time, and have very grave doubts as to whether any objection could be made to acts done prior to December 1, which were done in accordance with the approval of a previous commissioner of insurance, and in accordance with the interpretation placed upon the law, upon which interpretation the ap - proval was based. V. — It will also be remembered, and is a matter of department record, that at the same time the Bankers Fire Insurance Company was in the process of organiza - tion, a number of other companies in the State of Ne - braska were also in the same process. They secured the approval of the then Insurance Commissioner to their plans, and went ahead and carried out their plans. Tn their cases there was not even the question, as there is in this case, of whether or not there was a bona fide sale of stock without promotion expenses being paid, but their stock was sold and the expenses were paid directly from the sale of stock in excess of that which would be allowed under the rules as put into effect December 1. This was done and allowed relying upon Section 3227 of the Insurance Code, which provides that companies may use their surplus in establishing the company in business without impairment to the company. In connec - tion with this case, it will be noted that even should the conclusion be reached, that the methods used of dispos - ing of stock was a subterfuge, and that money was paid for organization and promotion and for establishing the company in business as well, the other companies, which were in the process of organization at the same time as the Bankers Fire Insurance Company, and which ad- </seg>
            <seg id="p253">246 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL mittedly used more than the amount provided for the organization and promotion, and justified the same under this clause as expense of establishing the company in busi - ness, have all since been granted licenses, and are now transacting an insurance business. It appears to me that it would be a rather difficult proposition to sustain the equity of a refusal to grant the Bankers Fire Insurance Company a license to do business in view of the fact that a number of other companies, whose circumstances are not so different have been granted licenses. VI. — Another point has been presented by the attorneys on behalf of the Bankers Fire Insurance Company, which seems to us to present considerable difficulty, and is name - ly; that Section 3167 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, which was repealed by the 1919 legislature, and re-enacted as a part of the Code Bill, the peculiar language used therein "hereafter organized," it is contended makes the provision, as found in the Code Bill, being passed subsequent to the organization of this company inap - plicable to this company, and the former law as found in the Revised Statutes of 1913, being repealed it is argued also does not apply, There is considerable au - thority in support of this contention, and I am not pre - pared to say that a court would not agree with the argu - ment, as advanced by counsel for the Bankers Fire In - surance Company upon this matter, and hold that the statute does not apply to them. I have set out all the above propositions in order to show that there are a number of factors entering into this matter, involving serious points, points which are worthy of consideration, and questions upon which it is almost impossible for this department to give a final decision. I do not feel that I am prepared to say that the contract as entered into between the Bankers Fire Insurance Company and the Bankers Brokerage Com - pany was entered into by subterfuge and by collusion. There are some things in the evidence, which we have before us to indicate that such was the case, but were the matter presented to a court, the court might take a </seg>
            <seg id="p254">OPINIONS 247 different view and hold that it was a perfectly valid con - tract between two separate entities, as it is prima facia. I am not prepared to say that in case the evidence is sufficient to show subterfuge or collusion, a court would hold that it was such on the part of the Bankers Fire Insurance Company. On the other hand I feel more strongly inclined to think the court would connect it up only with the officers of the Bankers Fire Insurance Com - pany, who were directly responsible for it, and who had personal interest involved therein, if any such could be found. I am not prepared to say that a court with the matter presented to it would not say under the circum - stances, and inasmuch as the rules did not go into force and effect until December 1, 1919, and inasmuch as other companies were granted licenses under somewhat similar circumstances, and inasmuch as the plans of the Bankers Fire Insurance Company were approved by a former Insurance Commissioner, that it would be inequitable and unjust to refuse them a license at this time. In view of these many grave doubts and questions which now exist, I feel that the best thing to do under the circum - stances is to find if possible some reasonable solution to the problem, which will be the most beneficial to all parties concerned. In connection with this, I would like to call your at - tention to what the result would be if the Bankers Fire Insurance Company were refused a license to do business in this state. Such action would necessitate placing the affairs of the company in the hands of a receiver, and the resulting process of liquidation. This is a long, slow and costly process. Eventually the number of people in this state, who have paid their money for stock in this corporation, would realize but a small percent of their initial investment, when the process of liquidation was completed. It appears to me as being far better for their interests that the company be granted a license to do business, avoiding the costly and slow process of liquidation, and be given an opportunity to pay them dividends upon the money, which they have invested, and </seg>
            <seg id="p255">248 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL to attempt to increase their surplus to such a place that eventually the stockholders will be able to realize in full the amount which they have invested. In view of all of this, I feel that the best solution of the entire problem is one which has been suggested and agreed to by the interested parties themselves, namely ; that there be turned over to the Bankers Fire Insurance Company by the Bankers Brokerage Company, the profits made by it out of the sale of the Bankers Fire Insurance Company stock. The proposal in concrete form is that the Bankers Brokerage Company turn over to the Bank - ers Fire Insurance Company the sum of $100,000.00, as the profit, which it has made from the sale of the stock, and also that the contract for the sale of stock between the two corporations be cancelled. There is no provision of law by which it is possible to examine the books of the Bankers Brokerage Com - pany and determine the exact amount which should be turned over by them as the profit made from the sale of this stock. Also it is probable that at this time in view of the fact that these profits are represented by notes and various other securities, the exact value of which cannot be definitely settled it would be impossible to tell the specific amount, but from all the evidence now before us, I am inclined to feel that the sum named above represents a very fair estimate, and as a matter of compromise should be accepted. I will therefore say that it is my recommendation that if the Bankers Broker - age Company will turn over to the Bankers Fire Insur - ance Company to become a part of the surplus of the Bankers Fire Insurance Company, the sum of $100,000.00, and cancel the contract for the purchase of stock, that the Bankers Fire Insurance Company should then be granted a license to transact an insurance business in the State of Nebraska.

The sale by an irrigation company of certain of its facilities to an irrigation district does net divest the State Railway Commis - sion of jurisdiction as to that part of the property still retained by the irrigation company. i.

Both the initial charges for water rights and the annual charges for maintenance made by irrigation companies are under the con - trol of the State Railway Commission. Mr. John E. Curtiss, Secretary Xebraska State Railnay Commission, Lincoln, Xebraska. Dear Sir: Answering further your question as to whether or not the charges of the Belmont Irrigating Canal &amp; Water Power Company for water rights are within the jurisdiction of the Commission, I will say that L have made further examination of the records and of the authorities and my conclusion is that the State Rail - way Commission has full jurisdiction of the initial charge for the so-called water right as well as full jurisdiction of the annual charges or rates made thereafter. The company has been operating for many years un- Jer the act of 1895 and amendments thereto and the fact that it has sold certain of its facilities to an irrigation district does not divest the Commission of jurisdiction as to that part of the property that it still retains. Nor, as the land described in the record is within the original appropriation, is the irrigation district free from the L'ontrol of the Commission. As it has purchased the ?anal from the original company, it has assumed the obligations of that company to provide water for the land in question although such land lies without the ter - ritorial limits of the district. In other words, the obli - gations of the original company were not affected by the transfer of certain of its facilities to the irrigation dis - trict. </seg>

By the statute of 1895 it was declared "that the watei of every natural stream not heretofore appropriated within the state of Nebraska, is hereby declared to b&lt; the property of the public and is dedicated to the use oi the people of the state subject to appropriation as here inbefore provided." There was no provision in the ad of 1895 for the regulation of charges, but it was never - theless recognized by the supreme court that such charges were within the control of the state. Castle Rock, etc., Co. v. Jurisch, 67 Neb. 377 (p. 382) ; Farmers Canal Co. v. Frank, 72 Neb. 136 (p. 160). In 1911 it was enacted as follows: "Irrigation works constructed under the laws of this state arc hereby declared to be common carriers. The owner or operator of an; works for the storage, carriage or diversion of water except irrigation disticts must deliver all water legally appropriated to the parties en - titled \o the use of the water for beneficial purposes, at a reasonable rate, to be fixed by the state railway commission, according to the Ian in such cases relating to common carriers." It will be noted that no distinction is made between the so-called permanent water rights and annual rates, It is evident that the legal appropriation referred to ir the section is that appropriation originally made by the irrigation company. In 1913 the act of 1911 was repealed and the new pro - visions were made. They are continued substantially th( same in the laws of 1919. Thereunder the State Railway Commission is given full power over all charges made by irrigation companies. Sections 14 and 15 of Divisior 1 of Chapter 190 (Session Laws of 1919, p. 833) are as follows : </seg>

The state railway commission shall have the power and ii shall be the duty of such commission to regulate the rates, service and general control of all irrigation works constructed and operated under the laws of the state of Nebraska except the work of irrigation districts. Sec. 15. The owner and operator of any such works for the storage, carriage or diversion of waters, except irrigation districts, must deliver all waters legally appropriated to the persons entitled to the use or the water for beneficial purposes as reasonable rates to be regulated by the state railway commission and shall conduct and manage said works for the storage, carriage or diversion of waters for said appropriators, under such rules and regulations as shall be prescribed by the state railway commission for such service and con - trol of such irrigation works." The act of 1911, while repealed by the act of 1913, was retained in the Revised Statutes of 1913 as Section 86 of Chapter 33. Its language is in part retained in Divi - sion 3, Section 27 of Chapter 190 of the Session Laws of 1919. The general purpose of the law of 1895 is laid down by the court in Farmers Canal Co. v. Frank, 72 Neb. 136. Following are some of the statements in the opinion : "There are two conflicting ideas upon which the laws of the sev - eral states and territories relating to the use of waters for the purposes of irrigation are based. One is that any person or individual may appropriate surplus waters which have not theretofore been appro - priated, and may use the same to irrigate such lands as he may see fit. This was the basis of our irrigation law in this state until the passage rf the act of 1895. Laws 1895, ch. 69. This system tends to breed monopolies, and to lead to antagonisms, strife and dissension. Since the land in arid regions is useless for the purpose of agriculture unless water is applied to it, this doctrine makes the landowner de - pendent upon the owner of the water right and leads to gross exac - tions and abuses. The doctrine of private ownership of water for irrigation purposes, disassociated from the land to which it is designed to be applied, has been proved by long experience to be detrimental to the public welfare. It has proved productive of endless controversies and abuses, and has given rise to interminable litigation. "The other doctrine is that the right to the use of water should never be separated from the land to which it is to be applied. 'Where this doctrine prevails, canals and ditches become like railroads, great semi-public utilities, means of conveyance of a public commodity, their owners entitled to adequate compensation for services rendered, but </seg>
            <seg id="p259">252 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL having no ownership in the property distributed.' Report on irriga - tion in California, United States Agricultural Department, 1901. It is unnecessary to set forth here the advantages of this idea. By the adoption of the irrigation law of 1895, which was modeled upon the Wyoming law, this state adopted the latter policy, by which the right to use the water shall not be granted separate from the land to which it is to be applied, and that the right to use the water should attach to the land, and, when the land is sold, be sold with it; and, for this reason, the statute is explicit in requiring a description of the land to be irrigated and the amount thereof to be set forth in the applica - tion "The object of the law in question is the promotion of irrigation within the state of Nebraska by a just and fair apportionment of the waters of the state among its people in such manner as to utilize the waters to the fullest extent. To this end the state has in a manner seized upon these waters, and, as a matter of police regulation, for the public benefit has prescribed certain rules applicable to all persona alike regarding the methods of procuring the right to the water, the quantity to be applied to each acre, and the preservation of rights which have become vested. As in all other states and territories where irrigation is practiced, priority of appropriation gives priority of right, and no person or corporation is favored more than another. The law gives to every citizen of the state the right, upon complying with cer - tain prerequisites, to appropriate for beneficial purposes the unappro - priated public waters of the state, and it protects him in the enjoy - ment of this appropriation after his right is once vested. He takes this right, however, subject to the rights of all prior and subsequent appropriators, and he cannot infringe upon their rights and privileges. Section 20 of the act provides: 'That such appropriator shall at no time be entitled to the use of more than he can beneficially use for the purposes for which the appropriation may have been made. "It is the evident purpose of the law, taken as a whole, to enforce and maintain a rigid economy in the use of the waters of the state. It has been, and is, the policy of the law in all the arid states and territories to require and enforce an economical use of the waters of the natural streams. The urgent necessities of the situation compel this policy by the very force of circumstances. One of the main ob - jects of the system of administration of public waters prescribed throughout the arid regions is to restrain unnecessary waste, and to provide for an economic distribution of that element so necessary to the very existence of agriculture in those regions. This is also the policy of the state of Nebraska in its regulation of the use of the waters of the state, and the law should be construed so as to effect a reasonable, just and economic distribution of water for irrigation purposes. The court will take judicial notice of the fact that there are hundreds of acres within the state susceptible of irrigation to </seg>
            <seg id="p260">OPINIONS 253 every acre which there is water enough to supply, and it is obvious that a construction of the law that will best distribute the use of the waters is to be preferred, if such construction is not inimical to any constitutional inhibitions or limitations." The foregoing statements are sufficient to show that the state has assumed full jurisdiction of all charges made by irrigation companies. The language of the act of 1895 and 1913, providing that the operator of irrigation works must deliver all waters legally appropriated to the persons entitled to the use of the water for beneficial purposes at reasonable rates, forbids alike all discrimina - tion and all exorbitant charges. No distinction between water rights and annual charges is made. The entire subject is placed within the regulation of the Railway Commission. Some of the authorities bearing upon this subject are : Kinney on Irrigation and Water Rights, 2nd ed., Sec 1342; Crate ford v. Hathaway, 67 Neb. 325.

Hon. George W. Marsh, Auditor Public Accounts, Lin coin, Nebraska. Dear Sir: I have before me your letter of February 5th, in which you inquire whether it is your duty, under the law, to issue and deliver the warrants under House Rolls 13 and 14 of the Extraordinary Session of 1918, which provide for the payment of mileage and salaries to the members of that legislature. You suggest that the issuance and payment of these has been refused on the ground that the bills are in con - flict with the state constitution and for the further rea - son that the appropriations were not mentioned in the governor's proclamation, calling a special session. The constitutional provision which enumerates the compensation of members of the legislature is Article 3, Section 4, of the general constitution adopted in 1875. As originally adopted, this provision stated that: "They shall each receive for their services $3.00 for each day's attendance during the session and ten cents for every mile they shall travel in going to and returning from the place of meeting of the legislature on the most usual route, provided, however, that they shall not receive pay for more than forty days at any one session." This was amended in the year 1886 by changing the rate to $5.00 per day. "Provided, however, that they shall not receive pay for more than sixty days at any one sitting nor more than one hundred days during their term." This section was in turn amended to its present form in the year 1912 and the constitution now provides: </seg>
            <seg id="p262">OPINIONS 255 "Both senators and representatives shall each receive pay at the rate of J 600. 00 for each regular session of the legislature during their term and ten cents for every mile • • * . Each session except special sessions shall not be less than sixty days." You will note from the provisions of the first two forms in which this constitutional provision existed, that it is quite clear that the per diem wage of $3.00 or $5.00 a day was to be paid to the members while they were in ses - sion whether in regular or special session. The question involved then is whether the constitu - tional provision enacted in 1912, has so altered the law that payment of salaries for a special legislative session is prohibited. It is my opinion that the law was not so changed. You will note that the provision now reads that mem - bers are to be paid "At the rate of $600.00 for each regu - lar session," and also that mention is made in the same section of special sessions. There is clearly nothing in the section that positively prohibits the payment of sal - aries to a special session. In the absence of such a pro - vision, I am clearly of the opinion that they ought to be paid for the following reasons, viz: It is the inherent power of a sovereign state to do those things which are reasonably necessary to carry on its ordinary functions. To hold that the members are not entitled to pay for a special session is to dangerously handicap the government of the state. I take it that there is a power to compel the attendance of members of the legislature at the session. This power is Inherent in sovereignty and without it, the government could not exist. I know of no other place In the law where attendance can be compelled where the law does not make some provision for the payment of the mileage and ordinary fees for the attending party. Along the same line it has been suggested that in cases of vacan - cies in the membership of the legislature occurring after the close of the regular session, that it would, perhaps, be impossible to fill these for a special session if the members could not be compensated in some form or other. This seems particularly necessary in the case of a special session because such a session is only to be called by the governor "On extra - ordinary occasions" and when such an occasion arises as was the </seg>
            <seg id="p263">256 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL occasion of the last special session, it is extremely important that a full representation be had and that all members be in attendance. I may suggest that it is not at all necessary that the constitution make affirmative provision for the payment of salaries for a special session. I take it that the power is inherent in the government to do those things which are necessary to do to carry out its functions. Article 3, Section 16 of the constitution which provides "That no extra compensation shall be made to any public officer, etc." has been called to my attention, but this provision was in the original constitution of 1875, at which time there seems little question but that the members could be paid for special sessions. In regard to the second point raised, it is urged that Article 5, Section 8, precludes the payment of these ap - propriations. That article provides: "The governor may on extraordinary occasions convene the legisla - ture by proclamation, stating therein the purpose for which they are convened and the legislature shall enter upon no business except that for which they were called together." The governor's office reports to me that the only spec - ial session of record since this constitutional provision was enacted, was one called April 14, 1882, by Governor Albinus Nance. The 7th provision of his proclamation reads : "To provide for the payment of the ordinary and contingent ex - penses of the legislature incurred during the session hereby convened." The proclamation issued in 1918 by Governor Neville calling the extraordinary session of that year does not include such a provision. I am nevertheless of the opin - ion that despite the absence of this provision from the call of the session, that the appropriation bills there enacted were in accordance with the constitution. Mv reasons for </seg>
            <seg id="p264">OPINIONS 257 this are as above stated in another connection that I feel it is the inherent power of the state to perpetuate itself and to pay whatever incidental expenses are neces - sary to enable one of its co-ordinate branches to cany out its functions. In conclusion, I am therefore of the opinion that the warrants ought to be issued on both of these appropria - tion bills and I feel that the ruling is also a matter of sound, common sense. I would suggest, however, that the points involved herein are most important in rela - tion to the future conduct of our state's affairs. If it should ever be held that the legislature cannot be paid for a special session, 1 would regard it as a very serious handicap and a dangerous condition for our state gov - ernment to be in and if this opinion should be erroneous 1 may venture that the fundamental law should be so changed that the legislative branch of the government can perform its functions unimpaired, at any time an emergency may arise. I therefore feel that perhaps this matter should be adjudicated by a competent tribunal and would suggest that you seriously consider by means of a friendly action the obtaining of a Supreme Court ruling on the issues here involved. Very truly yours, Note: — The situation herein explained is cured by constitutional amendment January 1, 1921, providing sal - aries for extra sessions. C. A. D. CLARENCE A.

            <seg id="p265">258 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Legislature A member of the legislature must resign his office to become a candi - date for membership in the Constitutional Convention. Abel V. Shot well, County Attorney, Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Answering yours of the 19th inst. in which you inquire if a member of the legislature can become a candidate for the constitutional convention, we submit the following: Section 6 of Article III of the Constitution of this state provides: "No person holding office under the authority of the United States, or any lucrative office under the authority of this state, shall be eligible to, or have a seat in the legislature, but this provision shall not ex - tend to precinct or township officers, justices of the peace, notaries public, or officers of the militia, nor shall any person interested in a contract with, or unadjusted claim, against the state, hold a seat in the legislature." This section clearly shows that the office of a member of the legislature and the office of a member of the con - stitutional convention are at least incompatible offices and the same person cannot hold both offices at the same time. We are therefore of opinion that if a member of the legislature desires to become a candidate for the con - stitutional convention he must resign his legislative mem - bership. It is said in 29 Cyc, at page 1381: "It may be laid down as a rule of the common law that the hold- Ing of one office does not in itself disqualify the incumbent from holding another office at the same time, provided there is no incon - sistency in the functions of the two offices in question; but at common law two offices whose functions are inconsistent are regarded as in - compatible." You will observe that these offices are incompatible by the section of the constitution quoted above. It is further said in 29 Cyc, on page 1382: </seg>
            <seg id="p266">OPINIONS 259 I "Such a statutory incompatibility is often inferred from the com - mon provisions in the state constitution's intent to secure the distribu - tion of the three powers of government among the three departments of government. The acceptance of an incompatible office by the in - cumbent of another office is regarded as a resignation or a vacation of the first office." It is therefore the opinion of this department that one who desires to become a candidate for membership in the constitutional convention, if he is already a mem - ber of the legislature must resign his legislative office. We are not unmindful of the fact that the call for the constitutional convention, which is Senate File Xo. 217, provides that the incumbency of another office shall not disqualify the person holding the same from being a mem - ber of the constitutional convention. We are of the opin - ion that this provision is in conflict with the section of the constitution above quoted, and the constitution, which is the supreme law, will be held to govern where a con - flict is found between it and the provision of the statute. This is the best opinion we can give you, and we are Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General. By J. B. BARNES, May 20, 1919. Special Assistant Attorney General. Legislature A vacancy in the office of members of the legislature may occur by death, by the acceptance of a military commission or by removal from the district. Unfilled vacancies in the membership of a house does not reduce the required number of votes required to pass an act with the emerg - ency clause. Hon. Samuel R. McKelvie, Governor of the State of Nebraska. Dear Sir: In response to your oral request for an opinion from this office as to when vacancies in the office </seg>
            <seg id="p267">260 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL of members of the legislature occur, how such vacancies shell be filled and what number of votes it takes to pass an act with the emergency clause when there are unfilled vacancies in some of the representative and senatorial districts, I will say: 1. There are various ways in which a vacancy in the office of members of the legislature might occur. The most usual ones would be by death, by the acceptance of a commission to any military office which requires the in - cumbent to exercise his military duties out of the state for a period of not less than sixty days and by removal from the district for which he may have been elected. (Sec. 2275, Revised Statutes of 1913.) The happening of any one of these events operates ipso facto to create a vacancy in the office. 2. The statutory provision relative to the filling of such vacancies is as follows: "When a vacancy occurs in the office of representative in congress, or members of the legislature, and the body in which such vacancy exists will convene prior to the next general election, the governor shall order a special election to fill such vacancy at the earliest prac - ticable time, and ten days' notice of such election shall be given: Provided, any vacancy occurring in either house of the legislature dur - ing a regular or special session thereof shall be filled by the governor within five days after said vacancy occurs by appointment of some qualified person of the same political affiliation as the previous en - cumbent from the district in which the vacancy has arisen." (Section 2279, Rev. Stat. of 1913.) 3. I am of the opinion that it takes two-thirds of the number of members of each house when the membership is full, to pass an act with the emergency clause; that is to say, I think there must be sixty-seven votes in the house and twenty-two votes in the senate, to pass an act with the emergency clause, regardless of the fact that </seg>

Dear Sir: The Attorney General has your letter of January 27th, asking for an opinion as to whether in - dividuals making wine for their own use, also beer or imitation of beer, are liable under the prohibitory laws of this state. In answer we quote to you a part of the statutes re - lating to intoxicating liquors. Section 1 of Chapter 187 of the Session Laws of 1917, entitled "Intoxicating Liquors," provides as follows: "The words 'Intoxicating Liquor' or 'Intoxicating Liquors' as used in this act, shall be construed to embrace all malt, fermented, vinous or spirituous liquors, wine, porter, beer, ale or any intoxicating drink, mixture or preparation of like nature, and all malt or brewed drinks, and all mixtures or preparations, whether patented or not, which will produce intoxication, and, in addition thereto, such liquors of a dif - ferent character and not hereinbefore enumerated capable of use as beverage containing over one-half of one percentum of alcohol." Section 2 of the same act provides that: "It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture, sell, keep for sale or barter, give away, barter, exchange, transport, purchase. </seg>
            <seg id="p269">262 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL or sell or barter under any pretext, any malt, spirituous, vinous and intoxicating liquors, except only certain liquors for medicinal, me - chanical, scientific or sacramental purposes by persons specially au - thorized in the manner and to the extent only as hereinafter provided. It shall be lawful, however, for any person to make, keep or sell sweet cider, unfermented wine, wood alcohol, and denatured alcohol, and nothing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the bonaflde manufacture and sale of vinegar." A reference to these sections will advise you of the situation you inquire about. It is the opinion of this department that the manufacture or sale, barter or ex - change, giving away or otherwise disposing of or manu - facturing liquors which contain more than one-half of one per cent of alcohol is unlawful. Of course the ex - ception made by the statute, authorizing persons to manu - facture and sell sweet cider, unfermented wine, wood alcohol and denatured alcohol, are the only kinds of liquor that one can manufacture or use.

Mansion The Governor is not required by law to reside in the executive man - sion. The mansion cannot be used for any other purpose than the home of the Governor. Hon. S. R. McKelvie, Governor, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir : I have before me your request for opinion : 1. Whether the Governor is required by law to reside in the executive mansion provided by the state? </seg>
            <seg id="p270">OPINIONS 263 2. If the Governor is not required to reside in the Inansion, can it be used for other purposes, such as hous - ng some of the executive departments of the state! In the Session Laws of 1899, page 318, is found an ct entitled "An Act to Provide an Executive Mansion. * * And to Appropriate the Sum of Twenty-five housand Dollars Therefor." This act provides: "Section 1. * * * The Board of Lands and Buildings to olicit proposals for sale * * * of an executive mansion • • • O BE OCCUPIED BY THE GOVERNOR." "Section 3. After said property has been purchased • HE SAME SHALL BE OCCUPIED BY THE GOVERNOR." Despite the apparently mandatory form of this statute, . am of the opinion that the Governor is not required by aw to reside in the executive mansion. My reasons are is follows : 1. It is a serious question whether the title to the act »s quoted above is a sufficient expression of the substance )f the act so far as it seeks to compel the Governor to jccupy the mansion. The fact that both of the manda - :ory clauses appear by the complete context to be merely ncidental to the paramount financial clauses strengthens his view of the lack of any intent on the part of the egislature to compel the governor to reside in the man - sion. 2. Article 5, Section 1 of the Constitution of Nebraska jrovides that "the Governor • • • shall reside at he seat of government • • • during their terms of &gt;ffice." &lt;I feel that there is a grave question whether he legislature, even had they so intended, would have he power to restrict the residence of the governor to - iny particular lot or block so long as he complied with he constitutional provision and resided at the seat of government; and especially am I inclined to feel that his is true since it affects materially not only the gover - ior but other members of his household over whom the egislature certainly have not any extraordinary control. </seg>
            <seg id="p271">264 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 3. In the year 1913 a committee was appointed by the legislature on Codification and Revision of Laws. This committee compiled what is now known as The Revised Statutes of 1913. After these had been compiled an act was passed adopting the Report of the Committee as the Revised Statutes of 1913 of Nebraska and repealing all other acts omitted from or inconsistent therewith. The Act of 1899 .providing the governor's mansion (and the only act that could possibly be construed as compelling his residence there) is not included in the statutes so adopted. There is therefore a grave question whether this act is any longer a part of the laws of the state. See 42 L. R. A. 518. It is a general rule of 'the common law that the use of the word "shall" is not conclusive evidence of a mandatory intent in cases where no public or private right or duty is abridged or infringed. 35 Cyc, 1451. See also People v. Chicago, 184 111. 597 Montgomery v. Henry, 144 Ala. 629 Suburban Light and Potcer Co. v. Board, Etc., 153 Mass. 200 County Com., Etc. v. Meekins, 50 Md. 28 Clancy v. McElroy, 70 Pac. 1095 (Wash.) In re Supervisor, Etc., 215 Pa. St. 119. It has been suggested that the implied obligation of meeting the people of the state and perhaps even of hold - ing some social functions constituted such a duty as to justify the mandatory interpretation of the word "shall." The mere consideration of the fact that there is not the slightest legal obligation on the governor to do any of these things is a sufficient answer to that suggestion. </seg>
            <seg id="p272">OPINIONS 265 4. In State v. Sheldon, 78 Neb. 552, our Supreme Court assumed that the governor is required by law to occupy the executive mansion. The question in that case, how - ever, was the question of whether the governor could occupy the executive mansion without paying rent there - for, and whether by so doing he was increasing the bene - fits of his office. In my judgment the court did not con - sider in the slightest the question now under considera - tion of the duty of the governor to occupy the mansion. 3. I might further call your attention to the fact that Governor Capper of Kansas for the last four years has not occupied the executive mansion which is provided by the state of Kansas, but has lived in his own home in Topeka: and 1 am informed on good authority that the present Governor Allen of Kansas does not expect to occupy the executive mansion. I cite this, not for its legal significance, but merely to show that there is no universal custom in regard to these matters. In regard to the second question, it is my opinion that the mansion cannot be used for any other purpose than the home of the governor, without further legislative en - actment. The following are my reasons therefor: 1. The mansion came into the possession of the state by virtue of a special act which provided only for its use for a definite purpose, and made no attempt to give its control to any other person than the executive. 2. There is at present no state board under whose jurisdiction the control of the mansion may properly come. Before the formation of the Board of Control the con - trol of all state buildings was in the hands of the Board of Public Lands and Buildings. By Article 5, Section 19 of the State Constitution certain specific institutions were given to the Board of Control. The executive mansion is not one of these; and there is no general provision au- </seg>
            <seg id="p273">266 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL thorizing the Board of Control to have jurisdiction over any other buildings than those specified. Article 8, Section 1 of the Constitution provides the general powers and duties of the present Board of Edu - cational Lands and Funds: under its powers and duties there is no provision by which it could fairly be claimed the control of the mansion can be vested in it. The result of the formation of these two boards has worked the abolition of the old Board of Public Lands and Buildings, with the result that there is now no state board who has authority to deal with the mansion. Section 5891 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 provides : No building shall be changed or diverted from the use or purpose, kind or class of building from that which the appro - priation was originally made • • • ." Under this act I am of the opinion that the question is definitely settled by statute; that until the legislature acts further, the mansion cannot be used for anything other than the home of the governor. 3. Section 5531 of the Revised Statutes provides: "The governor is hereby constituted the legal custodian of all the property of the state not especially entrusted to other officers by law, and he is hereby authorized and empowered to take summary posses - lion of such property of the state without any process of law and to adopt such measures as he may deem proper to preserve it from in - jury and deterioration." Under these circumstances I am of the opinion that the governor is the only proper custodian of the mansion during his incumbency in office and that he may take such measures as he deems fit to preserve it "from injury and deterioration."

Cropsey, State Treasurer, Lincoln, Xebrasla. Dear Sir: In response to your oral request for an opinion from this office relative to the tender of payment of municipal bonds owned by the state, I will say that you are clearly within your rights in demanding that payment of bonds owned by the state and in your cus - tody, shall be tendered before the bonds are surrendered. Where the law in existence at the time the bonds are issued fixes a place of payment, that is the place where payment should be tendered. Where the law is silent as to the place of payment, tender of payment should be made at the place of payment fixed in the bonds them - selves. From about the middle of July, 1913, until the 21st day of July, 1917, all bonds and coupons issued by any county, township, precinct, city, village or school district in the state were required by law to be made payable at the office of the State Treasurer. You have an unquestioned right to demand that payment be ten - dered at your office of any of these bonds owned by the state before same are surrendered. Where the bonds were issued before the law required them to be made payable at your office, and place of payment was named in the bonds themselves, you have a right, in my opinion, to demand that payment be tendered at that place before the bonds are surrendered. In 1917, an act was passed which was approved April 21st, 1917, and took effect three calendar months there - after. This act provided that "the county treasurer shall be the county fiscal agent and all bonds and coupons is - sued by any county, township, precinct, city, village, school district or other political subdivision of a county, shall be made payable at the office of the county treas - urer." Chapter 7, Session Laws of 1917. </seg>
            <seg id="p275">268 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Bonds of the kinds above named, when issued after said act went into effect, are payable, in my opinion, at the office of the county treasurer even though another place of payment is named in the bonds. The prevailing rule in such matters seems to be that "if the grant of power the place of payment is desig - nated, this controls, although the validity of the bonds is not affected by a disregard of such a requirement. The only result is that payment cannot be compelled at any place other than that provided by law. • • • p ro . visions for payment elsewhere are regarded as illegal. The rule, however, affects merely the validity of the pro - vision and does not avoid the bonds." Section 357, Abbott Public securities. See also Township of Enfield v. Jordan, 119 U. S., 680.

John Speedie, Deputy State Superintendent, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. My dear Mr. Speedie: Answering your question, 'Does Chapter 227 of the Laws of 1919, entitled Nepotism' apply to the employment of teachers by the school board when a teacher is employed who is related o one of the members of the board, such member not voting for or taking part in the matter of fixing the kvages for employment," we respond as follows: It is the opinion of this department that the law above nentioned is not applicable to such employment. The aw in question reads as follows: "It shall be unlawful for any person elected or appointed to any public office or position under the laws of the State of Nebraska, or &gt;y virtue of the ordinance of any city or village in said state, to ap - &gt;oint as deputy, clerk or helper, in said office or position, to be paid rom the public funds, any person related by blood or marriage to the &gt;erson elected, appointed or making such appointment." </seg>
            <seg id="p279">272 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL A school teacher is not a deputy; is not a clerk; is not a helper of the school board and therefore does not come within the inhibition mentioned in this chapter. The school laws, as published by Hammond and Stephens, provide on page 50 that "no contract with a teacher shall be valid unless agreed to either by all the members of the district board or by two members of such board who are not related to the fourth degree to such teacher, and whose terms of office extend beyond the date of the term of school contracted for." We think this school law is the one that governs the hiring of teachers and therefore the Act of 1919 has no application to such employment. We are, Yours very truly, CLARENCE A.

Amsberry, Secretary of State, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Answering your inquiry as to ballots at the next general election, and specifically pertaining to the office of Supreme Judge, formerly held by Judge Cornish and now held by Judge Flansburg, under ap - pointment by the Governor, we respond as follows: By J. B. BARNES, </seg>
            <seg id="p280">OPINIONS 273 Section 21 of Article VI of the Constitution of Nebras - ka provides that vacancies of this character shall be filled by appointment by the Governor until a successor shall be elected and qualified, and such successor shall be elected for the unexpired term at the first general election that occurs more than thirty days after the vacancy shall have happened. Section 1992 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, provides that every ballot shall contain the name of every candidate whose nomination for any office speci - fied in the ballot has been certified or filed according to the provisions of this chapter, and no other names, and the name of no candidate shall appear on the ballot more than once. Section 1995 provides that in each division and beneath all candidates placed there by nomination or petition, a blank space shall be provided, into which electors may write the name of any person for whom they wish to vote and whose name is not printed upon the ballot. Section 1999 provides that the ballots shall designate the office for which the persons therein named are voted for. Section 2030 provides that nothing in this article con - tained shall prevent any voter from writing on his ballot the name of any person for whom he desires to vote for any office, and such vote shall be counted as if printed on the ballot and marked by the voter. It is to be noted that this last section does not provide that the voter may write in the name of both the person and the name of the office where such office does not ap - pear upon the ballot to be filed at that election. Concerning the questions raised, it seems beyond ques - tion that the two candidates who have now filed for nom - ination to fill vacancy upon the Supreme bench, filed to fill the vacancy created by the death of Judge Sedgwick. These candidates filed at the primaries some time previ - ous to the death of Judge Cornish and at the time of </seg>
            <seg id="p281">274 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL their filing there was but one vacancy, which was thai created by the death of Judge Sedgwick, and it was foi this vacancy that they filed. It was also a legal impossi - bility under our non-partisan primary act, for any person to file for the vacancy created by the death of Judge Cornish. It therefore appears that according to our laws there are two candidates who have now filed and whost names are to be placed upon the ballot as candidates tc fill the vacancy created by the death of Judge Sedgwick and this office should be so designated that the voters will know they are voting upon these two candidates to fill the vacancy created by the death of Judge Sedgwick. These candidates were running for this particular ofJ fice and hence could not be nominated for another offieej and it was for this office and this office only that they were nominated. Since it is for this office that they are nominated, it would be manifestly unfair for them to be permitted to run for another office in which there was no vacancy at the time of their filing and for which nom - ination the electors did not vote and have not been given an opportunity to express a choice. The non-partisan law relating to the judiciary, speci - fically provides the manner in which persons may become candidates for such non-partisan offices. The two candi - dates now nominated complied with the non-partisan law relating to nominations for the office then to be filled. The vacancy created by the death of Judge Cornish is a distinct vacancy and the office is a distinct office. This is the more manifest from the fact that the respec - tive terms of the two offices end at different times and it therefore appears that the candidates could not have been nominated to fill both vacancies, for in such an event un - certainty would result as to which candidate was nom - inated for the longer term. However, the principal is the same in either event, whether the terms are coincident in point of time, or whether they do in fact terminate at different times. </seg>
            <seg id="p282">OPINIONS 275 We called your attention to the provisions of the Con - stitution providing that vacancies in the office of Supreme Judge shall be filled at the next general election which occurs more than thirty days after the vacancy shall have occurred. This provision of the Constitution, standing alone, is not self -executive ; it does not provide the ma - chinery by which the electors are given the means of filling the vacancy at the next general election. It is therefore incumbent upon the legislature to designate the manner and the means for nominations for such of - fice, by a reasonable and fair manner, so that any and all persons who may desire to become candidates for the office, under our primary law, may have a reasonable and fair opportunity so to do. It appears that if the legisla - ture fails to enact such legislation, the electors have no method of expressing their choice in a legal manner, and the privilege of filling the vacancy at the next general election, as provided by the Constitution, fails for want of legislation carrying out the rights reserved to the voter by this section of the Constitution. See 12 C. J. page 73*1; State v. Gardner, 3 So. Dak. 553; 54 N. W. 606. The sections of the statute relative to writing in the names of candidates, being a provision of the general election laws, do not apply to nominations or election of non-partisan candidates where such provisions are in con - flict with the expressed provisions of the non-partisan acts. The legislature, itself, has placed a construction upon the constitutional provision referred to, as seen by Section 2280 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, in which it is provided that an appointment shall continue until the next election at which the vacancy can be filled, thus showing that it was the intent of the legislature that the vacancy should not be filled except in the manner provided by law, and that when a vacancy occurred at such a time as to be too late for the regular process pre - liminary to election to take place (that is the regular primary), that the appointment should hold until the next election at which a successor could be regularly nom - inated and elected. That an appointee has a right to </seg>

No candidate could file at the primary, under our pri mary law, for the non-partisan office vacated by the deatl of Judge Cornish, because his death occurred only a fev days before the primary. There is no means providec for filling the vacancy created by the death of Judg( Cornish under the election laws. There is no methoc for nominating candidates as provided by law, Penrod v State, 102 Nebr. 734; 169 N. W. 266. In that case it is held that the general election laws with reference to nom ination of candidates do not apply to non-partisan elec tions; and it is clearly reasoned that party distinctions being done away with, and the general laws allowed to apply, any number of candidates might file by petition and one of them be elected by a very small proportion of the votes cast. The same reasoning holds good in the instant matter. See also State ex rel Jones v. O'Dwyer, 119 N. E. 732 Herman v. Lampe, 175 Ky. 110. If the general laws of the state do not apply and the non-partisan law itself does not provide a means, then the legislature has provided no process by which the electors may hold an election and express their choice to fill the vacancy created by the death of Judge Cornish, at the next general election in November. This being true, the appointee must necessarily hold over until such a successor can be regularly elected under the means as now provided by the law for nominating and electing candidates for non-partisan offices. A question arises whether or not the electors at the general election may write upon the printed ballot both the title of the office they wish to vote for and the name of the party that they wish to fill such office. The law provides for printed ballots. The purpose of ballots is to suggest to the voters, generally, the issue or the can - didates for offices to be filled. There must be a general </seg>
            <seg id="p284">OPINIONS 277 • submission of the proposition or the candidates, to all the voters in order to have a full and free election. Voters may, of course, write in the names of candidates where an office is to be filled and where there is no conflicting authority, or conflict in the laws, which would prevent such action being taken. We have heretofore considered and concluded that the general election laws do not apply to these non-partisan offices in so far as there is a conflict upon the manner of nomination and election to these offices. It follows, therefore, that unless the issues and matters to be sub - mitted to the voters are printed on all the ballots, all the electors of the state do not express themselves upon them, and the mere expression of a few electors upon an issue not generally known to the electors and upon which they are not called upon to express themselves, would not con - stitute an election by the people of the state. Tf this were not true, the small coterie of voters might secretly arrange among themselves to write on an issue or an office, and at the same time express their choice of the person to fill it. This would not constitute an election. Authoritv for this position is found in Forney's Election, 19 Pa. Co. C. T. 258, and in re Contested Election by Lawler, 180 Pa. State, 566; 37 A. 92. Another question to be considered is whether or not the ballot should be so printed as to express the title of the office, as a vacancy created by the death of Judge Cornish, and leave a blank space for the expression of the voters. Such a provision, however, is undoubtedly not called for by the statute. Where there is no method of nominating candidates and the court has held the general law does not apply, of course there is no limit to the number of nominations that might be made. The same reasoning holds if you allow the voters to promiscuously write in the names of any number of different candidates in blank spaces. To allow an election to take place in that manner would carry with it all the evils of an election where nomina- </seg>
            <seg id="p285">278 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL • tions could be made in an unlimited number. If there is any question as to whether or not the ballot should be so printed, it is of such a doubtful nature that we do not believe your office would be justified in assuming authority to print the ballot in such form, and if any person believes that you would have authority and that it is your duty to print the ballot in that form, such per - son has a remedy by mandamus to have such question decided. Section 1992, heretofore referred to, provides that the ballot shall contain the names of the candidates and no other names. Section 1999 provides that the ballots shall designate the office for which the persons named are to be voted for. Under these sections it becomes your duty, where nominations have been made, to place opposite the names of such candidates the respective offices for which they are candidates. This implies that if there are no candidates for any office, it is not your duty to place the name of any office upon the ballot. This seems particu - larly true in as much as no nominations can be made under process of law for the office of Supreme Judge, formerly held by Judge Cornish and now held by Judge Flansburg, by appointment. It further appears that there was no vacancy in the office of Supreme Judge separate and distinct from the office occupied by Judge Cornish, for which candidates have been nominated and which should be designated upon the ballot. It is our opinion that this office should be designated as a vacancy created by the death of Judge Sedgwick, with instructions to vote for one of the two candidates for that office.

Dear Sir: In answer to your oral inquiry in regarc to the amount of fee to be charged applicants for i pharmacy license, under Chapter 190 of the Laws o1 Nebraska of 1919, will say that although the law appeari to be conflicting in regard to this matter, it is my opin ion that the intention was to require a license fee ol Fifteen Dollars ($15.00).

Section 3 of Chapter 190 provides that all persons making application for registration shall pay to the De - partment of Public Welfare the sum of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00). Under the rule generally applied in the construction of the law, Section 3 being subsequent to Section 1, woulc take precedence and govern. Also a reasonable construe tion of the language of the entire act leads me to th« belief that the intention of the legislature was to provide that Five Dollars ($5.00) of the total examination fet of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) should accompany the appli cation, but that the sum of Fifteen Dollars ($15.00) was to be paici for the examination, the remaining Ten Dol lars ($10.00) to be paid at some subsequent time, either at the time of taking the examination or at the time ol granting the license.

            <seg id="p292">OPINIONS 285 Section 1115 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 makes this provision : "No person hereafter shall conduct or operate any pool or billiard hall or pool alley outside the limits of any incorporated city or village without first having obtained a license from the county board of the county in which the same is to be operated." Section 1116 provides: "Before any such license shall be granted by the county board the applicant therefor shall file a petition in the office of the county clerk of said county praying that said license may be granted. Said petition must be signed by at least thirty of the resident freeholders of the precinct in which said pool or billiard hall or pool alley is located and operated." Section 1117 provides for notice of the application and for a remonstrance, and closes with the provision that after the hearing of the remonstrance, if there be any, the county board may, in its discretion, grant or with - hold the license. We assume from your letter that Arthur is not an incorporated village, but if it is incorporated, then the application for a license to conduct a pool hall will have to be made to the village board and the county commis - sioners would have no authority to grant a license to operate a pool hall in an incorporated city or village. If the license is to be granted by the county board, the statute seems to confer a discretion on such board to grant or withhold a license as it may see fit. We also have a letter from Mrs. Fred Heath inquir - ing about the same matter, in which she asks the Attor - ney General if the remonstrance that is now on file to the granting of a license to another than the present petitioner can be used in the instant case.

Price Discrimination It is not lawful for the manufacturers of butter to establish concen - tration stations in the state and pay at these concentration stations the same price that is paid on the central market. It is not lawful for an independent buyer of butter to auction it off. Mr. Charles A. Goss, City National Bank Bldg., Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Goss: I have before me your letter of February 27th, regarding interpretation of Section 4029 of the 1913 Statutes relative to price discrimination. You ask whether it is permissible under our statute! for the manufacturers of butter to establish concentra - tion stations in the state and pay at these concentration stations the same price that is paid on the central market. My opinion is, and it is the unanimous opinion of the attorneys connected with this department, that such a proceeding is not lawful. There is no objection, of course, to the establishment of a concentration station or to the buying of butter at the station. However, when the price that is paid at that </seg>
            <seg id="p294">OPINIONS 287 ! : I station is other or different from the price that is paid at surrounding stations (excluding the difference in costs of transportation) we are of the opinion that the statute This statute was passed to compel a fair payment over the entire state and to compel an equal price over the entire state except for the costs of transportation. When the price paid at a concentration station such as Holdrege or Wayne, is the same as that paid at the central market in Omaha, it is obvious that the butter actually purchased at the concentration station is handled at a loss of the cost of the transportation to Omaha. If we were to rule that the establishment of these con - centration stations was lawful and that the city price could be paid at these stations while the ordinary price paid to the producer is paid at surrounding towns, we think the result would be that every company would label every cream station where there was any competi - tion, a concentration station, and that would practically nullify the statute in regard to the butter business. Your second question as to whether it is lawful for an independent buyer to buy butter fat direct from the farmer and auction it off to the manufacturer at a higher price than the manufacturer would have paid thp farmer, we regard this as a very close question. We incline to |the opinion that the statute was passed primarily to pro - tect the producer and that so long as he obtains the uni - form price that the intent of the statute is met.

Dear Sir: Your letter of some weeks ago has been mislaid and has just been called to my attention, in which you ask for information regarding a scandal in connec - tion with the dental examination held in Nebraska last June. There was indeed a serious scandal in connection with this examination. During the course of the examination one of the examiners found a student in possession of the complete list of questions. Upon being pressed this student admitted that he had received the questions at one of the fraternity houses the night before the exam- </seg>
            <seg id="p297">290 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ination, and that almost all of the applicants for license had been equally guilty. It so happened that the examina - tion was being given in a room adjoining our office in the state house and it was quite natural for the Dental Board to ask us to help examine the applicants regard - ing their knowledge of the affair, or otherwise it would be none of our affair. An examination disclosed that all of the students except two, one of whom was a colored boy who was not present the evening before and the other a young fellow who refused to participate in the matter, were in possession of the questions the evening before the examination at one of the fraternity houses, at which time all of the questions on all of the subjects were read over and correctly answered and notations made by all of the applicants for license. The most searching kind of an examination failed to reveal from what source the questions came. The students told a story of a purported telephone call from a stranger who offered to sell them the questions for a sum of money — about $300 — which sum they raised and deposited in a particular place from which they took the questions at the time of making the deposit ; an extremely unlikely story, as you will perceive, but one which we never were able to shake ; and also it is a fact that the $300 was raised by the students, although it was never received by the alleged party, there having been some kind of a hitch in the plan at the last minute and the students having pro - cured the questions without leaving the money. During the course of the examination there was a great deal of bitterness shown by the students toward the exam - ining board, and the charge was repeatedly made that this was not the first year that the applicants had had the questions, that "it was a common thing for this to be done; that it was done in other schools, and that there were people who made a business of supplying those questions to applicants for the dental license." I rather surmised at the time that there might be a wholesale collusion between the chapters of the national dental fra - ternities which might have something to do with the </seg>
            <seg id="p298">OPINIONS 291 whole matter. I did not like the whole affair, and in - duced the Dental Board to postpone the examination in - definitely and the whole crowd of applicants were kept out of practice for two or three months, after which they were finally given another examination whfcsh most of them passed, although several failed. I think the wholesale airing which the matter had here — and it occupied the front pages of our papers for two or three days — has probably had a very wholesome ef - fect on the examinations of all the professions in this s^tate. But I was amazed to see how common an offense the whole thing was considered to be by a crowd of young professional men who ought to have had an altogether different idea upon the subject. I may say that in this case whoever did procure the questions — whether it was one of the boys or whether it was the mysterious stranger — procured them by breaking into a desk in the state house and having copies made from one of the printed copies which he stole. I think this is a very complete report of what our situation was. 1 would certainly be glad to assist you in any way possible in determining whether there is a wholesale scheme on the part of the dental fraternities to aid their members by procuring these questions sys - tematically in the different states before the examinations are given. Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS. December 4, 1919. Attorney General. Public Health The Department of Public Welfare can require the county health officers to fumigate outside of villages and cities in case of small - pox or infantile paralysis. Mr. H. M. Sinclair, County Attorney, Kearney, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Responding to your letter of August 19th inquiring as to the theory upon which the State Board of </seg>
            <seg id="p299">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 292 Health has made its rule regarding the expense of fumi - gating outside of cities and villages, we would state that this theory is based upon the proposition that it is the duty of the Board of Health of the county to fumigate for the protection of the general public. If these duties of fumigation are performed by these officers, there will, of course, be no charge to the county, and you will notice by the rule that smallpox and pole - omyelitis (infantile paralysis) are the only diseases where fumigation is required absolutely. In other cases, we presume that the person causing the fumigating to be clone would be bound to pay therefore, which in most cases we presume would be the individual. Of course, there is the other theory that the duty of the individual to the public requires him to keep his premises safe so that same may not become and con - stitute a nuisance and a menace to public health. Thus the question of whether the individual owes more to the public, or whether it is the duty of the public to protect itself, becomes an unsettled proposition. However, under the delegated authority to the Board of Health to make such rules and regulations as may be necessary, it would seem that their regulation and re - quirement, although it may place a little additional bur - den upon the county health officer, is not an unreason - able rule or regulation. However, this does not mean that it is the duty of the county health officer to perform these duties except in the case of smallpox and poleomye - litis. The manner of fumigating is very simple, and the per - formance of this duty requires no unusual skill; so the purpose of the regulation is simply to see that the pre - caution is actually taken, placing this burden upon the county. The cost should be very nominal, as we under - stand that all that is required is the burning of formalde - hyde candles sufficiently to take care of- the cubic air </seg>

            <seg id="p302">OPINIONS 295 i I t : i i &gt; Railroads ,! The performance of intraplant switching service by a common carrier under terms of a contract of lease between the carrier and the owner of a manufacturing plant, without specific charges for such Rervic*. is unlawful, both under the Federal law and under the State law. Specific charges for such switching service must be made and must be paid in money. ron. H. G. Taylor, Chairman, Xebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Xebraska. Dear Sir: In response to your question for an opin - ion as to the application of the Union Pacific Railroad '.'ompany, filed with the Interstate Commerce Commis - sion under Section 208a of the Transportation Act of 920, for authority to exempt the smelting plant of the \merican Smelting &amp; Refining Company at Omaha, Ne - naska, from paying charges for intraplant switching and he request made in connection therewith that the Ne - traska State Railway Commission approve such exemp - ion, I have this to say: The application grows out of the case of American Smelting &amp; Refining Co. v. U. P. R. R. Co., decided in Ihe circuit court of appeals, 8th circuit, May 21, 1919, jnd reported in 256 Federal Reporter at page 737, opin - on by Judge Garland. In that action the railroad com - pany sued the smelting company to recover the value of ertain intraplant switching services performed by the plaintiff for the defendant between July 26, 1912, and 'he time of the filing of the suit. The plaintiff prevailed n the lower court and on appeal to the United States ircuit court of appeals the decision was reversed. There /as a contract originally entered into between the de - endant and the plaintiff on April 23, 1886, by which the 'laintiff leased to the defendant certain real estate in he city of Omaha, Nebraska. The lease was subsequent - ly renewed and the defendant relies upon the new lease ated April 23, 1912, a copy of which is attached to the nswer in the case and a portion of which is copied in </seg>
            <seg id="p303">296 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL the opinion. Under the terms of the lease, the defendani is required to pay an annual rental of $5,000 until Janu ary 1, 1925. Thereafter the amount progressively in - creases until the charge will be $9,000 annually aftei January 31, 1934. Section 2, Article 2 of the lease reads as follows: "And for the consideration aforesaid the said Pacific Company covenants and agrees to furnish all material for and to lay upon iht grading therefor, as hereinafter set forth, all necessary tracks ovei and upon said premises, which the said smelting company may re - quire to be laid for the handling of its freight and material in tin prosecution of its business and do all switching of its cars within iti premises necessary in placing the same for loading and unloading freight or material therefor free of charge to said smelting com pany." The officers of the carrier became convinced that ren - dering the intraplant switching service for the smelting company without making a charge therefor was contrar&gt; to the provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act, am particularly Section 1 of the Elkins Act. In deciding th« case the court uses this language: "In the consideration of this question it is apparent that this cas&lt; is much different from those cases where unlawful rebates or conces sions are usually considered. It lacks the presence of a competitiv&lt; shipper complaining of discrimination, or the United States moving at the request of the Interstate Commerce Commission. The complain of the plaintiff in paragraph 7 of the complaint also alleges: " 'Said switching and movement of cars being separate anc apart from, and in addition to, any services rendered by plaintif in and about the delivery to or acceptance from said plant o loaded cars in connection with and as a part of the transportatioi thereof from or to points beyond the plant limits or in and abou the delivery to said plant of empty cars for loading or the remova therefrom of empty cars after unloading in connection with trans portation to and from said plant.' "By this allegation of the plaintiff, the switching service in ques tion has no relation to or connection with transportation of passenger: or property in interstate commerce and therefore in no view of th&lt; case could the provision in regard to the switching service be affectet by the act to regulate commerce and the amendments thereto. </seg>
            <seg id="p304">OPINIONS 297 "With reference to section 2 of the Interstate Commerce Act and section 1 of the Elkins Act, there is no evidence that the plaintiff, by performing the switching service in question, according to the terms of the lease, charges, demands, collects, or receives from the defendant a greater or less compensation for the transportation of passengers or property subject to the provisions of the act to regulate commerce than it charges, demands, collects, or receives from any other person cr persons for doing for him or them a like and contemporaneous service in the transportation of a like kind of traffic under substan - tially similar circumstances and conditions. Nor is there any evidence that by the performance of the switching service in question, the plain - tiff offers, grants, or gives any rebate, concession, or discrimination in respect to the transportation of any property in interstate or foreign commerce, by it, whereby any such property is transported at a less rate than that named in its tariffs published and filed, or whereby any such other advantage is given or discrimination practiced in the transportation of property in interstate commerce. "The switching service in question performed wholly within the state of Nebraska, and so far as this record is concerned is not con - nected with interstate commerce at all. Therefore the Interstate Com - merce Act and its amendments are not applicable to it. We do not say that this lease between the plaintiff and the defendant may not, in proper case, be shown to be an unlawful concession or rebate; all we say is that it is not shown in this case." It is difficult to understand just how the court arrived at its conclusion in the face of the cases cited in the opin - ion itself. Under the holdings of the courts, it is not material in what way the discrimination may be accom - plished, nor is it material in what way a shipper may be favored. In Vandalia Railroad Co. v. United States, 226 Fed. 713, cited by Judge Carland, this language is used: "The statute (referring to the Elkins law) evidently aims to pro - hibit, not only discrimination as between shippers, but departure from the tariff rates, irrespective of its actual discriminatory effect. The history of this legislation demonstrates that both discriminations and rebates have ever been sought to be hidden under the most subtle disguises. Every device that seeks to cover up either a rebate or a discrimination in interstate transportation is denounced by the statute, provided only, as to a rebate that thereby the property is actually transported at less than the tariff rate." </seg>
            <seg id="p305">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 298 The fact that there was a contract in existence rela - tive to intraplant switching seems immaterial. In the leading case of Louisville &amp; Nashville R. R. Co. v. Mottley, 219 U. S. 467 ; 55 Law. ed. 297 the contract was entered into between the carrier and the plaintiff about ;the year 1871 in settlement of a claim for personal injuries to the plaintiff and his wife. The contract provided that the company should furnish an annual pass to the plaintiff and his wife during their lives and was one of the considerations for the settle - ment of the case. The contract was in all respects law - ful at the time it was made. The case was originally instituted in the federal court and after its reversal by the supreme court of the United States it was reinstituted in a state court of Kentucky. After the passage of the act of June 29, 1906, Hepburn Act, the carrier refused to perform the contract further on the ground that the act of congress made enforcement of the contract illegal. The court held in an extensive opinion that the railroad company could not lawfully accept from Mottley and wife any compensation different in kind from that pro - vided in the tariffs, and that charges for transportation were to be paid only in money; that the contract was made subject to the continuing power of regulation; and that the act of congress was not invalid because the obli - gation of the contract was impaired. The Mottley case has been frequently cited with approval. See Interstate Commerce Commission v. Atchison, To- peka &amp; Santa Fe R. R., 234 U.

W. 411; affirmed by the supreme court of the United States in Menasha Wooden Ware Co. v. Minneapolis, St. Paul A S. S. M. Ry. Co., 245 U. S. 633; 62 Law. ed. 522; </seg>

Interstate Com- merce Commission, 219 U. S. 498; 55 Law. ed. 310. It seems under the authority cited above that it is im - material whether the favor granted is an interstate movement or purely an intrastate movement. It is not necessary that there should be any "device" in the technical sense of that term in order to work a viola - tion of the statute. Dye v. United States, 262 Fed. Report, 6. The foregoing considerations relate entirely to the in - terstate aspect of the case. As the intraplant switching service is considered by the court as a purely intrastate movement, the position of the applicant becomes import - ant under the state law. Under Sections 221 and 222, Revised Statutes of Nebraska, 1913, forbidding unjust discrimination and undue preference, it would be unlaw - ful for the carrier to perform the switching service with - out making a proper charge therefor and any attempted exception of the smelting company from such charge would clearly work undue preference. The contract to furnish switching services in connection with the lease of the real estate is violative of the provisions requiring uniformity of charges in Nebraska. In State v. U. P. R. R. Co., 87 Neb. 29 the validity of a contract providing for the issuance of railroad tickets and the furnishing of transportation for advertising to be furnished the railroad company in cer - tain newspapers was before the cour^ The contract was held invalid. It was decided that under the law of this state a railroad company may not furnish such transpor - tation for services or property by way of barter, uni - formity of charge being required, and that the only </seg>

See also Interstate Commerce Commission Conference Ruling, 207. The exception proposed, allowing intraplant switching for the smelter at Omaha to be without charge, would clearly give an undue preference to that concern. It would doubtless result in unjust discrimination, although there are no other smelters in the city of Omaha. My conclusion is that the application should not be allowed.

            <seg id="p313">306 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL It follows that the county must give notice of its in - tention to open a county line road and fix a time for hear - ing on the question of damages and provide for paying the same.

Mr. T. C. Dougherty, County Engineer, Auburn, Nebr Dear Sir: One of the county commissioners of your county has requested this department to give you our views of Chapter 189 of the Session Laws of 1915 which provides for trimming trees and hedges and removing underbrush from the public highway. Section 1 of that act provides that where there is standing or growing any osage orange, willow or locust hedge fence, trees or undergrowth bordering the public highways, when such fence, trees or undergrowth be- </seg>

Section 2 provides that whenever any land owner or his agent shall neglect to trim such hedge fence, trees or undergrow T th as herein provided it shall be the duty of the road-overseer of the district in which such hedge fence, trees or undergrowth is located to report the same in writing simultaneously to the county attorney and to the county board, giving the location of the same. It is further provided in substance that the county attorney on receipt of such notice from the road overseer shall immediately serve a written notice upon the owner of the said hedge, trees or undergrowth, or upon his agent, to have such hedge, trees or undergrowth trimmed and the trimmings burned or removed within ten days. It is further provided by Section 2 that upon a failure of the owner or his agent to comply with said notice of the county attorney within said 10 days, the county at - torney shall give notice in writing to the land owner or his agent fixing a date for hearing before the county board on a complaint previously entered by the road over - seer that the said land ownier or his agent is maintaining a public nuisance by failure to trim said hedge fence, trees or undergrowth in accordance with the provisions of this act. It is further provided in that section for a hearing before the county board and if it shall appear that the alleged public nuisance is maintained by the owner or agent of the land, the county board shall forthwith and at once declare such trees, hedge or undergrowth a public nuisance and make an immediate order for the trimming of the same in accordance with the provisions of the act. </seg>
            <seg id="p315">308 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL The section further provides that in case of the failun of the owner or agent to comply with the order of th board, the road-overseer shall cause the same to be doni and charge a rate agreed upon with the county boar* not to exceed one dollar per rod, which shall be pai&lt; from the county general fund. We think this section embraces the growth or under - brush to the middle of the highway where the same exists The section also provides for an appeal from the ordei of the county board to the district court. We think a compliance with the provisions of this sec - tion should be required by the overseers of the highways in your county, and you should assist as far as possible in carrying out the provisions of the act. The evident intention of the law was to destroy the shade which would keep the highway in an impassable condition if the same was not properly removed. I think this is all that we can say in regard to this section, but it strikes this department that the provisions of the law are quite ample to enable the overseers of the roadways to maintain them in a reasonably passable con - dition.

We have carefully checked all of the different depart - ments and found that each of them have a certain fund of money which is set apart to be paid for extra help. In times gone by this has been considered to mean extra clerical help whenever it was necessary to handle the department. We feel that if such a man can be employed who can install office systems and labor-saving devices so that extra employees will be unnecessary, that such a charge might properly be made against the "extra help funds" of the departments. It is perhaps not within the ordinarily accepted phraseology of "extra help," but at the same time it is help of an unusual nature rendered to the different departments. We can see no objection to your employing such person. Very truly yours, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General. By J. B. BARNES, August 15, 1919. Special Assistant Attorney General.

            <seg id="p317">310 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL regulations governing water and sewerage, and request - ing our opinion as to the legality of the same, and pro - pounding a number of other questions. The authority of your department to regulate water and sewerage plants is based upon Section 1, Article 1, Title VI of Chapter 190 of the Laws of 1919, reading as follows: "The department of public welfare shall have general supervision and control over matters relating to public health, sanitation and gen - eral public welfare • • • ." and Section 2, Division 7, Article 2 of the same Title, Chapter and Law, which provides: "The department of public welfare shall have supervision and con - trol of all matters relating to necessary sanitation and quarantine. The department shall formulate, adopt and publish such proper and rea - sonable general rules and regulations, as will best serve to promote sanitation throughout the state and prevent the introduction or spread of disease." In addition the department is empowered to take the necessary steps to cope with an emergency for a serious epidemic. On the basis of such authority, it seems to us that your rules and regulations governing water and sewer - age, propose a very ambitious program, for your depart - ment, the legal basis of which is exceedingly doubtful. A number of your requirements, such as the formation of plans showing the size of water mains, valves, hydrants, the required submission of an engineer's report discuss - ing the present and future needs of a community, do not appear to be required for present necessary sanitation. It is the opinion of this department that it is exceed - ingly doubtful whether the legislature by the use of the language quoted in the previous paragraph of this letter ever intended to empower your department to make rules governing the installation of sewerage and water systems throughout the state. Such matters are ordinarily by the existing law left to the discretion of municipal au- </seg>
            <seg id="p318">OPINIONS 311 thorities, except in cases of emergencies, where unsani - tary conditions endangering public health prevail. In our opinion you have no legal power to interfere with proposed or existing water or sewerage systems. The whole question comes down, as to what is necessary sanitation, and what are reasonable rules and regulations in respect to it. In answer to your specific questions: First — Your proposed regulations if applicable at all, in accordance with our opinion previously expressed, are applicable to private as well as municipal corporations, and to municipal and state institutions. Second — In respect to non-compliance of your regula - tions, your remedy is a criminal prosecution through the county attorney of the county in which the violation oc - curs. Punishment for such violation according to Section 2, Division 8, is a fine of not less than $15.00 or more than $100.00 for each offense. Third — Except in emergency conditions wherein public health is in danger, in our opinion you have no power to do any of the things mentioned in the third paragraph of your letter. In case of danger to public health, you have authority to take any steps to protect public health including any and all methods mentioned in the third paragraph of your letter. Fourth — You have no power to interfere with the operation of any existing sewerage system on the ground that it is a nuisance, or that it creates an offensive local condition. You can only interfere with said system when by polluting the water supply, or by other methods it endangers the public health, in which event you can use any of the methods described in the fourth paragraph of your letter. Fifth — In our opinion you have no legal authority to make any regulations requiring engineers to include in their specifications a clause that the work is done in ac- </seg>

School Board re director, treasurer and moderator in order to make a legal con - tract binding upon the school district must be together and act together as a board in signing the contract. Mr. John Phillips, Hay Springs, Nebraska. Dear Sir: The Attorney General has your letter of June 5th, 1919, in which you inform us that an agent approached your school district treasurer who signed a contract for some sort of machine, for $38.50. You also state that the agent afterwards approached the director, who also signed the so-called contract; and you ask, in substance, if the contract is legal. It is the understanding of this department that in order to make a legal contract the director and treasurer should be together and act together as a board in signing the contract. You state that the agent got the signature of the treasurer and then afterwards found the moderator and got his signature. First — It is our opinion that this is an illegal transaction and does not bind the school district. Second — There was in no sense a meeting of the board at the time this contract was signed. Third — The moderator cannot be compelled, in our opinion, to draw a warrant or sign a warrant to pay for this instrument </seg>
            <seg id="p320">OPINIONS 313 ; &gt; i I Fourth — No one would be the loser but the agent who megotiated this transaction. If the school board should desire to take the instru - ment when it is offered, you should call a meeting of the director, moderator and treasurer, and if the board at such meeting agrees to pay for this instrument and take it they may do so, but if they decline to do this the agent will have to take back his instrument and there is no liability on the school district itself.

School Districts The Employers Liability Act includes school districts as employers. However, a school district may elect not to come under Part 2 of the Compensation Act. LVr. F. A. Kennedy, Deputy Compensation Commissioner, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your oral inquiry as to whether or not school districts are among the employers who come under the provisions of the Employers' Liabil - ity Act, I will say that the provisions of statute that the term "employee" shall be construed to mean "every person in the service of the State or of any governmental agency accredited by it, under any appointment or con - tract of hire, express or implied, oral or written," is broad enough, in my opinion, to include school districts |n the list of employers, for they are governmental agencies. </seg>
            <seg id="p321">314 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL • You will note, however, that it is not all employers who come under the provisions of Part 2 of the Employ - ers' Liability or Workmen's Compensation Act, for Sec - tion 137 of the act as amended in 1917 provides that un - less employers shall take out Workmen's Compensation Insurance or shall furnish to the Compensation Commis - sioner satisfactory proof of their financial ability to pay direct the compensation that may be awarded to be paid by them, to injured employees, they shall be held to have elected not to come under Part 2 of the Act and shall be required to respond in damages to an employee for personal injuries in like manner as if they had tiled an election with the Compensation Commissioner rejecting the provisions of Part 2 of the Compensation Act. The effect of an election not to come under Part 2 of the Compensation Act is to bar the defendant from the defense that the employee was negligent, unless it appears that such negligence was wilful or that the em - ployee was in a state of intoxication; also to bar the defendant from the defense that the injury was caused by the negligence of a fellow employee or that the em - ployee had assumed the risks of the employment. All these defenses, however, might be eliminated and still a school district not be held liable to an injured employee; for a school district is a quasi corporation with limited corporate powers granted it exclusively, so far as I have been able to ascertain, for educational purposes, and the general rule is that - ; "The management of public schools is a branch of the state gov - ernment, and school districts and school boards, considered as corpora- 1 tions or quasi corporations, ordinarily are not liable in tort, as for the negligence of their officers, agents, employees, and contractors.' . . . In the absence of a statute, a school district or school board' is not liable for injuries caused by its negligence or the negligence of its officers or agents in the construction of a school house or in ] falling to keep a school building or premises in proper repair and. condition, or in furnishing unsafe and unsuitable means of conveyance In transporting pupils to and from schools." 35 Cyc, 971-2. </seg>

I am of the opinion, therefore, although the question is not entirely free from doubt, that if a school district refuses to furnish the insurance required by the Work - men's Compensation Act and elects to come under Part 1 of said Act, an injured employee has but slight chance of recovering damages in any action he may bring against said school district, because of alleged negligence upon the part of itself or its officers. I am the more confirmed in this view from the fact that I find no provision of statute which authorizes a school district to raise any money by taxation for any purpose other than the pro - viding of school facilities and the maintenance of schools.

Dear Judge Hobart: The Attorney General has your letter of April 2d, 1919, in which you state that you have recently issued a peremptory writ of mandamus, com - pelling the election board of one of the wards of the city of Scottsbluff to allow all persons of the age of twenty - one, citizens of Scottsbluff and of the United States, to vote for members of the school board.

You state that you would like to know upon what we base the opinion of this department. As we view the law, Section 1946 provides for the qualifications of voters at the general election. Chapter 30 of the Laws of 1917, amends Section 1940 of the Laws of 1913, while Section 6733 of the Laws of 1913 provides as follows: "Every person, male or female, who has resided in the district forty days and is twenty-cne years old and who owns real property or personal property that was assessed in the district in his or her name, at the last annual assessment, or who has children of school age, residing in the district, shall be entitled to vote at any district meeting or school election, held in any district, village or city. * * * I It is the opinion of this department that the section ; H8t quoted is a special statute and provides for the ualifications of voters at school elections and therefore overns this question while the other sections mentioned' l your letter relate only to the general election laws. , t is quite likely that you may be right in your construe- § ion of the laws regarding this question, and while this uestion is not free from doubt, we are constrained to iew the law as above suggested.

            <seg id="p324">OPINIONS 317 i Schools A school district having less than 100 pupils has no right to organize as a district having 150 or more pupils, or to vote on and issue bonds in excess of five per cent of the assessed valuation. Mr. J. T. McCuistion, Attorney at Law, Hebron, Xebr. Dear Sir: The matter referred to in your letter of November 9, 1920, and previous communication, has re - ceived considerable attention by the writer and on ac - count of various conflicting matters I have not had time to make response to vour inquiry until this time. The Hubbell School District, known as District No. 41 in Thayer County, Nebraska, as we understand it was organized as a district or more than 150 pupils. The last school census we understand has shown a census of but 80 pupils, and this district has proceeded to vote and issue $25,000 of school bonds, and the question before us is whether or not the school district has the power and tuthority to issue such bonds. Under the theory that iuch school district still belongs to the class of school listricts having more than 150 pupils, it has been our lesire to make a finding favorable to this district, so that t might have an adequate school house for its purposes. A T e have very reluctantly come to the conclusion that the school district is without authority to vote and issue bonds ;o the extent of $25,000. This office months ago gave an opinion that Section 150 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913 was in 'orce and effect. This section provides that in school listricts having less than 100 pupils may not issue bonds n the aggregate amount to exceed five per cent, except n districts having over 100 school children, computed on he last complete assessment of the taxable property of he district for state and county purposes. This would imit the amount of bonds, which might be validly issued &gt;y school districts to five per cent. </seg>
            <seg id="p325">318 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Section 459 of the Statutes of 1913 provides that the phrase "school district" as used is meant to mean and refer to the school district as it existed immediately prior to and at the time of the issuance of any bonds by said school district, including all lands and property and in - habitants comprised and contained in said school district at the time of the issuance of any bonds. Section 7664 provides for an annual school census. This census would of course fix the status of your school district as to the number of pupils, which would govern at the time the bonds were voted. We are aware of the fact that the State Superintend - ent a number of years ago made a ruling that schools then organized as high school districts should not lose their organization as a high school on account of decrease in the number of pupils. However, this ruling has noth - ing to do with the revenue nor with the status of the dis - trict for revenue purposes and taxation. The purpose of Section 450 and other sections is tc protect the taxpayers from being excessively taxed ir small districts. As I have said before we regret very much to havt^ to be compelled to reach this conclusion, and presume that it is of no binding force or effect upon you or the school district, but is merely an expression of an opinioi t of this office. If a proceeding were started against th&lt;f Auditor to compel the registration of school bonds, w»&gt; probably would be called upon to defend it, as that is i 1 part of the duties of this office. We have made it a prac 1 tice to endeavor to assist in so far as compatible witJj the duties of this office to persons making inquiries re garding bond issues, etc., etc., but of course you realiz that except when called upon by some department of th': state that this is hardly a part of the duties of the At, torney General's office.

Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of the 27th inst. will say that if your school district is one smaller than i city district yet containing one hundred and fifty pupils with a school board of six trustees, that is to say, if it is organized under the provisions of Section 6798, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, it may issue bonds up to hirty per cent of its assessed valuation for the purpose )f building and furnishing a school house when author - zed so to do by a vote of the electors of the district.

Sheriffs When the time for the regular election of the sheriff was in November, 1918, and the sheriff who was a candidate for re-election die** October 29, 1918, and no one was elected sheriff at the regula.' election, the person appointed on November 2, 1919, is entitled to hold over the full statutory period of four years. Mr. R. D. Flory, County Attorney, Albion, Nebraska. Dear Sir: The Attorney General has your letter oj December 8, 1919, asking for the opinion of this depart ment on the question of the election of a sheriff for youi county at the November election of 1920. As we understand the situation, Mr. Anderson, youi former sheriff, was a candidate for re-election at th&lt; November election of 1918, which was the statutory tim&lt; for the election of sheriffs in this state. Anderson diet October 29, 1918, and a vacancy in the office of sherif was thus created. On November 2, 1918, the county boan regularly appointed Willotts sheriff to fill such vacancy It appears that no one was elected sheriff at the Novem ber election, and therefore Willotts was entitled to hole over as sheriff until his successor should be elected ant qualify. See opinion of the supreme court in State ex re Waring v. Willotts, 174 N. W., which opinion is attache* to your letter. </seg>
            <seg id="p328">OPINIONS 321 You observe that the legislature at its 1917 session amended Section 1954 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, which amendment provides that sheriffs shall be elected at the November, 1918 election and every four years thereafter. Therefore there is no election for sheriffs in the year 1920 and the term of the sheriff's office is now four years. Therefore no sheriff can be elected until November, 1922, without calling a special election for that purpose, and we find no provisions of the statute for the calling of a special election in such a case. Conse - quently the term for which Willotts holds over does not expire until the regular November election of 1922. We do not advise the filing of a motion for a modifica - tion of the opinion in the case of Waring v. Willotts, for it seems clear to us that the opinion already disposes of the question you present. The first paragraph of the syllabus in that case reads as follows: "An appointee to fill a vacancy in a public office is generally en - titled to the benefit of a statutory provision that officers shall hold over until their successors are elected and qualified." Paragraph 5 of the syllabus reads as follows: "The time for which the right to hold over exists is as much a part of the incumbent's term of office as the fixed statutory period." In the body of the opinion it is said: "Did respondent's tenure under his appointment end January 9th, 1919, leaving a vacancy to be filled by the county board? An ap - pointee to fill a vacancy in an office is protected by the general sta - tutory provision that officers shall hold over until their successors ire elected and qualified." Citing State v. Metcalf, 80 0. St. 244; Sackett v. State, tf4 Ind. 486. It is further said in the opinion : "As a general rule the appointing power has no vacancy to fill lpon the expiration of a term, where the incumbent is entitled to hold &gt;ver until his successor is elected and qualified." Re Adversary Opinion to Governor, 50 L. R. A. N. S. i68, and cases cited in note. </seg>
            <seg id="p329">322 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL The death of Anderson did not occur thirty days be - fore the general election, and under the statute the va - cancy should be filled. Revised Statutes 1913, Section 2278. The vacancy therefore was properly filled by the appointment of respondent and therefore there was an incumbent to continue in office until his successor is elected and qualified. Revised Statutes 1913, Section 2275. His tenure under his appointment and the statute did not ter - minate January the 9th, 1919. Revised Statutes 1913, Sections 1967-2280: The term for which the right to hold over exists is as much a part of the incumbent's term of office as the fixed statutory period. State v. Metcalf, 80 0 St. 224. Again, further on in the opinion, it is said: "In exercising his right to hold over respondent in due time com - plied with all statutory requirements. He was in possession of the office, performing its functions under a valid appointment. The fail - ure of the county board to approve his bond was not attributable to him but was an arbitrary departure from their official duty based under a misapprehension of the law or on a preconceived purpose to prevent him from exercising his right to hold over. In either respect the result is the same. The unauthorized conduct of the county board did not create a vacancy or oust respondent from his office, or force him to resort to mandate for the approval of his bond as a condition of holding over." An examination of the statutes and of the opinion from which these quotations are made convinces us that Willotts is entitled to hold over for the full statutory period of four years; and therefore we advise that n&lt; election should be held for the purpose of electing a sherifl in the year 1920.

            <seg id="p330">OPINIONS 323 I Sheriffs Money paid by the chief state agent for the use of a sheriff's personal automobile in enforcing the prohibitory laws belongs to the sheriff. A sheriff may rightfully retain fees for services rendered and expenses incurred outside of his county. Fees paid to sheriffs for additional work in his county should be re - ported to and turned into the county funds. Mr. Gus Hyers, Chief State Agent, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: The Attorney General has your letter of March 22, 1919, submitting certain questions to this de - partment for answer. 1. If you were to go into a county and there hire the sheriff's personal automobile and pay him a consideration for the use of the same, without paying him any money per diem or for his assistance, would this money right - fully belong to the sheriff or should he turn it over to the county funds? Answering this question, it is the opinion of this department that the money would belong to the sheriff. 2. If you were to pay a sheriff per diem for his serv - ices rendered outside of his county in another part of the state, and also his expenses, would he be rightfully en - titled to retain those fees? It is the opinion of this de - partment that if the sheriff was not acting in his official capacity but acting for you in rendering his services, he would be rightfully entitled to retain the compensation you paid him. 3. If you were to pay the sheriff per diem for addi - tional work in his own county, should he turn those fees in to the county? It is the opinion of this department that where the sheriff is acting in his own county and as sheriff, although he might be assisting in the enforce - ment of the prohibitory laws, the fees paid to him for such services should be reported to and turned into the county funds. </seg>
            <seg id="p331">324 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 4. You state that in many counties commissioners have made no allowance for deputies for sheriffs. If your de - partment should authorize the sheriff to employ a deputy to assist him in enforcing the liquor law, could this money be paid to the sheriff for such deputies' work? It is the opinion of this department that the money in such case could be paid to the sheriff, but he would be required to report the money so paid and turn it in to the funds of the county. We think that in enforcing the prohibitory laws and in paying out the funds of the state for that purpose, great care should be taken to see that the funds are so paid that they should be properly accounted for and thus avoid needless or wrongful expenditure of the state funds.

Daniel Swanson, Lincoln, Nebraska Dear Sir: In response to your oral request for an opinion as to who has charge of the grounds on which the state fair buildings are located, I will say that the title to said lands and the buildings thereon is in the State of Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p332">OPINIONS 325 Section 19 of Article 5 of the Constitution as adopted in 1875 gave the Board of Public Lands and Buildings general supervision and control of all the buildings, grounds and lands of the state, except those for educa - tional purposes. This section of the Constitution has been amended and the control of many of the institutions belonging to the state is now vested in the Board of Control. However, the state fair grounds does not be - long to the institutions placed, either by the constitution or the statute, under the Board of Control. Section 5875, Revised Statutes of 1913, which was passed after the amendment to the Constitution abolish - ing the Board of Public Lands and Buildings and estab - lishing in place thereof the so-called "Board of Control," provides that the care, management and control of all the public buildings, lands, lots and grounds heretofore under the care, supervision, management or control of the Board of Public Lands and Buildings, except such as had been transferred to the so-called "Board of Con - trol" — otherwise known as "The Board of Commission - ers of State Institutions" — are transferred to and vested in the Board of Educational Lands and Funds. Section 1, Revised Statutes of 1913, provides, however: "The state fair shall be held annually at or near the city of Lincoln in Lancaster County under the direction and supervision of the State Board of Agriculture, upon the site and tract of land selected and now owned by the State for that purpose and known as "the State Fair Ground." I am of the opinion, therefore, that the management and control of said lands vests in the Board of Educa - tional Lands and Funds, except as modified by the pro - vision of statute above quoted which gives the direction and supervision of the state fair to the State Board of Agriculture.

            <seg id="p333">326 REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL State School Funds The legislature may under the constitution provide for a plan where - by each district which has within it state lands shall be paid out Of the state school fund an amount equal to the amount which this district would receive if these lands were taxable. Mr. J. D. Ream, Constitutional Convention, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Ream: My department has under considera - tion the proposition, which you stated to me Saturday, regarding the distribution of state school funds. Your proposition, if I recall it was this: In the eastern parts of the state most of the state school lands have been sold, and the school districts in which these lands lie are able to tax the lands and procure the revenues therefrom. In the western part of the state where the school lands lie, the school lands being state property are not taxable, and the districts therefore get no benefit from them. The present plan of administrating the state school fund is to make a prorata distribution of it to all the districts of the state, irregardless of whether they have within the district state lands, which are exempt from taxation or not. This of course creates a very inequitable situa - tion, because the eastern districts not only get the taxes on the land but get their share of the state school fund, while the western districts get no taxes on the land, and at the same time only get the same share of the state fund. The question then is, whether under Article 8, Section 7, of the present Constitution, it would be possible for the legislature to provide a plan whereby each district which has within it state lands should be paid out of the state school fund an amount equal to the amount which this district would receive if these lands were taxable, and then make a prorata distribution of the balance. Our opinion is that the legislature can so provide under the present constitution. The present constitution says: </seg>
            <seg id="p334">OPINIONS 327 "Provision shall be made by general law for an equitable distribu - tion of the income of the fund, etc." We believe that under the phraseology, if the legisla - ture should pass a bill such as proposed, that it ought to be sustained. At the same time my mind is not free from doubt on the subject. Our decision would not be final, and the court might hold the other way. "We can see vhere the court might say that "an equitable distribu - tion" means the equal distribution to all districts, and if they should do this it would of course defeat the en - tire act of the legislature. We see also the difficulty of relying on legislative action on this matter, because the legislature being a representative body, the greater ma - jority of whose members are from the districts where the lands are already taxable, might be very reluctant to pass such a bill, whereas, the present convention be - ing a state wide body and representing the entire state would be much more likely to remedy this situation, and therefore on the ground of prudence in both of the above contingencies, we believe it would be better if you can have it done to have the amendment which you propose incorporated in the new constitution rather than to rely on a legislature and on a court decision, which is not abso - lutely free from doubt. I trust that this is a complete answer to your ques - tion, and it is our best judgment of the matter. Yours very truly, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, January 27, 1920. Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p335">1 328 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Suffrage Under the present constitution (1919) women in this state may vote for all public officers not specifically excepted in Chapter 30 of the Session Laws of 1917, and who are not specifically named in the constitution. Women are at present entitled to vote for presi - dential electors. Mrs. W. E. Barkley, Jr., City. Dear Madam : Pursuant to your request, I have care - fully considered the constitutional and statutory pro - visions of this state as to what officers and questions may be voted upon by the women of this state. It is, of course, a universally accepted doctrine that state constitutions are a restriction of and not a granting of power. It therefore follows that the legislature has the full power to grant suffrage to women except where specifically pro - hibited by the constitution of this state. The constitution of this state, Article 7, Section 1, provides : "Every male person of the age of twenty-one years or upwards belonging to either of the following classes, who shall have resided in the state six months, and in the county, precinct, or ward for the term provided by law shall be an elector." Our Supreme Court has held by implication at least, that the above constitutional provision only applies to the public officers specifically named in the constitution and it would also seem logical to say that it only applies to the questions or propositions submitted to the voters, the manner of the submission of which is specified and designated in the constitution of Nebraska. Recognizing this situation, the Nebraska legislature of 1917, in amending Section 1940 of the 1913 Revised Statutes of Nebraska to grant suffrage to the women of Nebraska so far as was within their power, used the following language: "Every person of the age of twenty-one years or upwards shall be an elector, and shall have the right to vote for all officers to be </seg>
            <seg id="p336">OPINIONS 329 elected to public office, and upon all questions and propositions sub - mitted to the voters, at any and all elections, authorized or provided for by the constitution or laws of Nebraska: Provided, however, that no female person shall be permitted to vote for United States Senator, United States Representative, or for any officers specified and desig - nated in the constitution of Nebraska, or upon any question or proposi - tion submitted to the voters, the manner of the submission of which is specified and designated in the constitution of Nebraska." It therefore follows that the women of this state may vote for all public officers not specifically excepted in the above statute, and who are not specifically named in the constitution and upon any question or proposition sub - mitted to the voters, the manner of the submission of which is not specified or designated in the constitution of Nebraska. The following officers and questions appear to be either specifically exeepted in the statute passed in 1917, above referred to, or are so named or designated in the con - stitution of Nebraska that the women are not entitled to vote thereon: 1. United States Senator, United States Representative. 2. All state officers including Railway Commissioners, Supreme Judges, District Judges, and County Judge, Justices of the Peace, Police Magistrate, and the Board of Regents, and members of the state legislature. 3. Constitutional amendments. 4. The signing of petitions for or voting on questions submitted under the initiative and referendum as to state laws. 5. The adoption of or continuance of township organizations. 6. Members of municipal charter conventions. 7. Members of state constitutional conventions Since the constitution of the United States permits each state to determine who shall be entitled to vote for presidential electors and for the president of the United States, and since the constitution makes no provision relative thereto and since the above legislative act of 1917 referred to, in no manner excepts the office of president of the United States or presidential electors, it therefore </seg>
            <seg id="p337">330 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL follows that the women of Nebraska are entitled to vote for presidential electors. Article 15, Section 2 of the Nebraska state constitu - tion specifically provides for members of a state con - stitutional convention, the manner of their selection, and the constitution of such a body generally. It is therefore our opinion that the women are not entitled to vote for members of the state constitutional convention under the amended Section 1940 of the 1913 Revised Statutes of Nebraska, which specifically provides that the women may not vote "for any officer specified and designated in the constitution of Nebraska or upon any question or proposi - tion submitted to the voters, the manner of the submis - sion of which is specified and designated in the constitu - tion of Nebraska." Section 6733 of the 1913 Revised Statutes of Nebraska provides : "Every person, male or female, who has resided in the district forty days and is twenty-one years old and who owns real property or personal property that was assessed in the district in bis or her name at the last annual assessment, or who has children of school age residing in the district, shall be entitled to vote at any district meet - ing or school election held in any district, village or city." Our Supreme Court has held relative to this section that the constitutional provision limiting the electors of the state to male persons, would not apply to school dis - tricts and the officers thereof. It would further seem, since the 1917 legislature of this state in amending Sec - tion 1940 of the 1913 Revised Statutes to give the women of this state suffrage as far as possible, in no way re - ferred to or repealed the said Section 6733 above referred to, that it was intended that the said Section 6733 should be construed and considered in conjunction with and not in conflict with Section 1940. From this it must be con - cluded that the women still have the same rights as to school elections as heretofore and no more. Especial at - tention is called however to the fact that Section 6733 above, specifically requires both male and female voters, </seg>
            <seg id="p338">OPINIONS 331 in order to vote at any school election must be "one who owns real property or personal property that was as - sessed in the district in his or her name at the last an - nual assessment, or who has children of school age resid - ing in the district." It has been called to our attention informally, that in the recent city election in Lincoln both men and women were permitted to vote for members of the school board without being asked as to their quali - fication in the above respect. Since the constitution of this state does not speci - fically provide for the submission of bonds at elections, it would therefore follow from the above that, under Sec - tion 1940 of the 1913 Revised Statutes, as amended by the 1917 legislature, women are entitled to vote at all elections upon any question submitted concerning the is - suance of bonds. From all of the above it would seem that the women of Nebraska are at present entitled to vote for president - ial electors; county and city officers (except county judge and justices of the peace and police magistrates) town - ship officers; upon all bond issues submitted at elections; and upon city ordinances under the initiative and referen - dum.

            <seg id="p339">332 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL there is a movement on foot to establish a Sunday pic - ture show in the village of Tobias; that a petition has been filed with the board with the request that this ques - ion be voted on at the regular election April 6th. You inquire if this election is favorable to such exhibition, has the board legal right to grant permission for such a show? In answer to this question we inform you that by Sec - tion 5106 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913 itself provides that the governmental powers of cities and villages are lodged in the trustees. The section reads as follows : "To make all such ordinances, by-laws, rules and resolutions not inconsistent with the laws of the state, as may be expedient, in addi - tion to the special powers in this chapter granted for maintaining the peace, good government and welfare of the corporation, inflicting fines or penalties for the breach thereof, not exceeding one hundred dollars for any one offense, recoverable with costs, and in default of payment to provide for confinement in the prison or jail, at hard labor upon the streets or elsewhere, for the benefit of the city or village." This grant of power is amply sufficient to enable the trustees of the village to pass the ordinance contem - plated by your letter. Section 8802 of the Laws of 1919 provide a penalty for Sabbath breaking, playing of base ball and dancing in this state, but there is nothing in this section which pre - vents the village trustees from passing an ordinance licensing the picture show on Sunday. Therefore we in - form you that the board has ample power to license the picture show mentioned in your letter provided your elec - tion is favorable to the granting of such a license.

Dear Sir: The Attorney General has your letter of October the 10th, 1919, asking for advice as to how your village board shall handle the question of Sunday picture shows. As suggested in your letter, an action might be com - menced in the district court to enjoin the running of the Sunday picture show as a nuisance. But this is not a very satisfactory way of disposing of the question be - cause of the necessarv delavs in a suit of that kind, and it might not be terminated for a year or two. On the other hand, we find no provision for holding a special election to determine the policy of the village board as to the conducting of picture shows on Sunday. The best and cleanest way to handle this question is for the village board to pass an ordinance prohibiting the running of picture shows on Sunday, or in other words, to license and regulate the running of a picture show which may be conducted on any other day or eve - ning except Sunday, and we would suggest that the mat - ter be handled in that way. Section 5059 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 gives the village board the power to provide for licensing and regulating theatrical and other amusements within such village, and a picture show sure - ly comes within that definition.

The law does not contemplate that the company shall be taxed upon its receipts for business done prior to the preceding calendar year. The gross amount of premiums may be taken into consideration in determining the fair value of the capital stock, but is not neces - sarily controlling. The insurance companies contemplated in Section 6357 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 may be taxed both on their capital stock and also assessed a tax as determined by this section. Harry R. Ankeny, Deputy County Attorney, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You call my attention to Section 6357, Re - vised Statutes of 1913, and ask the following questions regarding the construction to be given same: "First. Should an insurance company, as contemplated by this statute, be taxed at each county, town, city, village and school dis - trict where an agent conducts the business upon the gross amount of premium received by said agent for all Nebraska business done within the state by said agent? "Second. Assuming that you answer the above question in the affirmative, would you limit the tax to the gross amount of premiums received on new business, or should a tax be levied upon renewal premiums as well? The reason we inquire as to this distinction is because this section which relates to domestic insurance companies states that taxes shall be levied upon the business done 'during the previous calendar year', while Section 6355, which relates to foreign, life and accident companies, requires payment of taxes upon all busi - ness written 'during such preceding year or prior thereto.' "Third. Should the gross premiums be taken into consideration in determining the fair value of the capital stock for assessment pur - pose? "Fourth. May the insurance companies contemplated by this sec - tion be taxed both on their capital stock and also assessed a business tax to be determined as designated by this section?" </seg>
            <seg id="p342">OPINIONS 335 I will answer the above questions in the order in which they are pronounded. 1. In my opinion said Section 6357 contemplates that an insurance company governed by its provisions shall be taxed at the place where its agent conducts its busi - ness, upon the gross amount of premiums received by said agent for all Nebraska business done within the state by such agent for such company, subject, of course, to the deductions for re-insurance and cancellations. 2. The statute provides that the insurance company shall be taxed upon the gross amount of premiums re - ceived by it for all Nebraska business done within the state during the preceding calendar year, less amount of same ceded to other companies as re-insurance through regularly authorized agents in this state and less pre - miums returned on cancelled policies. The law evident - ly does not contemplate that the company shall be taxed upon its receipts for business done prior to the preceding calendar year. 3. The gross amount of premiums may be taken into consideration, of course, in determining the fair value of the capital stock of an insurance company for assess - ment purposes but they are not necessarily a controlling factor. 4. If the question were a new one, I would say that the tax upon the gross receipts of a domestic insurance company provided for by Section 6357 is intended for a property tax and not a tax upon business, but the su - preme court of this state held, in the case of Aachen and Munich Fire Insurance Co. v. City of Omaha et al, 72 Neb. 518, that a tax upon the gross amount of premiums received by a foreign fire insurance company, under the provisions of Section 6354, Revised Statutes of 1913, was not a property tax but was a tax upon insurance inter - ests or business and was authorized by the second sub - division of Section 1, Article IX of the Constitution of Nebraska.

Respectfully submitted, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General. By GEO. W. AYRES, July 3, 1919. Deputy Attorney General. P. S. — Permit me, in addition to what is said above, to call vour attention to the case of Bankers Life Insur - ance Company v. County Board of Equalization of Lan - caster County, et al, in which in a lucid and able opinion by Judge Barnes the question of the taxation of domestic insurance companies in Nebraska is discussed. In that case it is said: "It is probable that under the general provisions of the revenue law of 1903 (laws 1903, ch. 73) domestic insurance companies may be required to list their capital stock for taxation; but, if the capital stock is taxed, its value must be ascertained in the manner provided by section 10955, Ann. St. 1909, and when such value is ascertained there must be deducted therefrom the value of the real estate and other tangible property of the company otherwise taxed, and the re - mainder will furnish the amount upon which the tax against the cor - poration may be levied. "An assessment of the property of a domestic insurance company for taxation which includes its capital stock, its surplus, its contingent reserves, its gross premium receipts mentioned in section 10960, Ann. St. 1909, together with all of its other, tangible property, is excessive, and amounts to double taxation, and should not be sustained." (89 Neb. 469. 470.) Section 10955 Ann. Stat. 1909 is Section 6343 Revised Statutes of 1913. This section was amended by Chapter 108, Session Laws of 1915, so as to provide that there should be no deduction from the assessed value of the capital stock of a bank or other corporation assessed in accordance with its provisions, because of real estate mortgages held by such corporation on which it paid no taxes. </seg>
            <seg id="p344">OPINIONS 337 If the insurance companies be fairly assessed accord - ing to the plan suggested and sanctioned in the case of Bankers Life Insurance Company v. Board of Equaliza - tion, supra, the assessment will be a fair one and ought to stand the test of the courts. You will note that in that case "gross receipts" are treated as an item of property. G. W. A. Taxation A city of the first class having a population of more than 5,000 and less than 2 5,000 inhabitants may be authorized by the majority of the legal voters of the city at a general or special election or by a petition to appropriate the four mills authorized by House Roll No. 518. Mr. Chas. E. Bruckman, City Attorney, Hastings, Nebr. Dear Sir: The Attorney General has your letter of June 27th in which you ask: "Can the Mayor and Council, at this time, as an additional or supplemental appropriation bill, pass an ordinance appropriating the 4 mills authorized by House Roll 518 and certify the same to the county clerk and have it included in the levy?" Answering this question, we are of opinion that it is quite doubtful if this could be done by the passage of an ordinance. But Section 4974 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 was amended by the legislature of 1917, and the amendment will be found on page 257 of the Session Laws of that year. The amendment is as follows: "The city shall within the last quarter of each fiscal year pass an ordinance termed 'The Annual Appropriation Bill,' in which cor - porate authorities may appropriate such sums of money as may be deemed necessary to defray all necessary expenses and liabilities of such corporations, not exceeding in the aggregate the amount of tax authorized to be levied and revenue available during the then ensuing year; and in such ordinance there shall be specified the object and purpose for which such appropriations are made, and the amount or </seg>
            <seg id="p345">338 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL amount* appropriated for such object or purpose. No further appro - priations shall be made at any other time within such fiscal year, un - less the proposition to make such appropriations has been sanctioned by a majority of the legal voters of such city, either by a petition signed by them or at a general or special election duly called there - for; and all appropriations shall end with the fiscal year for which they were made: Provided, the fund arising from road taxes and bridge taxes, as in this chapter provided, shall be deemed especially appropriated for the street repair purposes and provided that the in - come arising from the operation of water, lighting, power, heating, and sewer system shall be deemed especially appropriated to the pay - ment of the current expenses of and to the cost of improvements and extensions and additions to said systems respectively, and shall not be included in the annual appropriation ordinance; and provided, fur - ther, nothing hereinafter contained shall be construed to prohibit the council from appropriating other money in the annual appropriation bill for the use of streets, grades, and bridges, and for water, light - ing, power, heating and sewer systems." We would suggest that a petition by a majority of the legal voters of your city, authorizing such an appropria - tion as you desire, and a levy of the tax therefor, be obtained, or that you submit the question to a special election to be called for that purpose. If you obtain the petition with the requisite number of names there is no doubt but what the matter could be arranged in the manner you desire. The same could be done, of course, if a majority of the voters should authorize the same at a general or special election. It may be possible that the court would sustain an appropriation made in the manner you suggest in your letter, but to avoid any ques - tion we think the manner suggested above is the best way to dispose of the matter.

The opinion in this case, we think, will help you out. We would advise you to have these lands assessed or re-assessed and at the proper time, have the county bid them in at a re-sale and when the time arrives, file a petition to foreclose the tax lien.

            <seg id="p347">340 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Taxation A domestic insurance company organized under the mutual plan and without any capital stock whose agents over the state only receive applications for insurance in the company, the policies being is - sued at the head office and the money being received at that place, if taxable under Section 6357 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 should be taxed under this section, at the place where the principal office of the company is located. W. H. Osborn, Jr., Secretary State Board of Equaliza - tion, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You say there is an insurance company in this state organized under the mutual plan and without any capital stock, which has a provision for the return to its policy-holders of such a percentage of the premiums paid for their insurance each year as are not needed to pay losses and defray the running expenses of the com - pany. You state further that this insurance company has various agents throughout the state who receive ap - plications for insurance in the company but who do not issue policies or receive money therefor, the policies be - ing issued at the head office of the company and the money received at that place. You inquire where, under such circumstances, the gross amount of the premiums of the company on Nebraska business, less certain deduc - tions permitted by Section 6357, Revised Statutes of 1913, should be listed for assessment purposes. The section of statute to which you refer reads, in part, as follows: "Every life, flre or accident insurance company or surety com - pany organized under the laws of this state • • • that operate on the assessment plan, have no capital stock and make no dividends, and whose scheme of insurance does not contemplate the return of any percentage of earnings or profits to policy holders, shall be taxed In the county, town, city, village and school district where the agent conducts the business upon the gross amount of premiums received by it for all Nebraska business done within the state during the pre - ceding calendar year, less amount of same ceded to other companies as reinsurance through regularly authorized agents in this state and less premiums returned on cancelled policies. Such gross receipts </seg>
            <seg id="p348">OPINIONS 341 less reinsurance and cancellations shall be taken as an item of prop - erty of that value and be assessed and taxed on the same percentage of such value as other property." Assuming, for the purpose of the argument, that the provisions of said section are constitutional, and that a company such as you describe is properly taxable upon its receipts under the provisions of said Section 6357, I am of the opinion that the gross value of the premiums received by the company, less the deductions allowed, should be returned and the tax paid at the place in this state where the principal office of the company is located and where the money is received and the policies issued. It is possible to give the statute a more literal construc - tion in this way than any other. It may be urged, of course, that where the statute says "agent" it means "agents" and that where it says "gross amount for all Nebraska business done within the state during the preceding calendar year" it means "gross amount of all premiums received at the home office upon applications for insurance taken at the agency" less cer - tain deductions permitted by the statute, but even in that case some difficulty would be experienced in determining the amount of the deductions from the gross receipts, for the re-insurance is usually taken in block, I am informed, and not by the re-insurance of specific selected risks. It is quite plain that such a company can not be taxed at each place it maintains a soliciting agent, upon the gross amount of all premiums received by it in the state less the deductions provided for by statute, for such a method of taxation would be so obviously unfair as to be unconstitutional, and it is elementary that laws should receive such a construction, if possible, as will render them constitutional.

            <seg id="p349">342 REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Taxation Where there is a mortgage upon land which does not contain a "tax free" covenant, the mortgage interest is to be assessed to the mortgagee, and the remaining interest in the land is to be as - sessed to the mortgagor. Mr. 0. C. Bell, County Assessor, Lancaster County, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of November 14 in regard to the assessment of the land of Mr. W. H. Ferguson, will say that I believe that Section 6350 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 covers this matter. This section of the Statute provides that where there is a mortgage upon land the mortgage interest is to be assessed to the mortgagee, and the remaining interest on the land is to be assessed to the mortgagor. This should be done in all cases unless the mortgage contains the tax free covenant, which you say the mortgage in the pres - ent instance does not contain. You will notice, however, that this section provides that the tax upon the mortgage interest is a lien upon the land, and the real estate may be sold in case the taxes upon the mortgage interest are not paid. I would call your attention to this fact, for the reason that it will be necessary for Mr. Ferguson to pay the taxes upon the mortgage interest in order to prevent them becoming a lien upon his land in case the mortgagee does not do so. I have not gone into the question of whether or not under the federal law the mortgagee is exempt from pay - ing such taxes, if he did not pay, it makes no difference in your action. Under our statute you must assess the mortgage interest as such, and then the interest of the mortgagor as such.

Taxation A county board has no right or power to refund any tax paid under protest, unless the provisions of Sections 6492 and 6493 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, are strictly complied with, and any re - lease, commutation or repayment of taxes paid under protest in any other manner than that provided for in these sections, renders members of the county board individually liable to the county and the state for such action. Mr. George W. Marsh, State Auditor, Lincoln, Xebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your request for an opinion as to the powers and duties of the county boards in re - mitting taxes paid under protest, we quote Section 6491 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, which reads as follows: "No injunction shall be granted by any court or judge in this state to restrain the collection of any tax, or any part thereof hereinafter levied, nor to restrain the sale of any property for the non-payment of any such tax, except such tax or the part thereof enjoined be levied or assessed for an illegal or unauthorized purpose; nor shall any per - son be permitted to recover by replevin, or other process, any prop - erty taken or restrained by the county treasurer for the non-payment of any tax, except such tax be levied or assessed for illegal or un - authorized purpose; but in every case the person or persons claiming any tax, or any part thereof, to be for any reason invalid, who shall pay the same to the county treasurer, may proceed in the following manner, viz: First — If such person claim a tax, or any part thereof, to be in - valid for the reason that the property upon which it was levied was not liable to taxation, or that the property has been twice assessed in the same year and taxes paid thereon, he may pay such taxes under </seg>

If such taxes are paid to the proper authority, other than the county treasurer, such persons so receiving them shall, within ten days thereafter, deliver such taxes, or such part thereof as are paid under protest, to the county treasurer, together with a copy of the receipts given for the same, and the county treasurer shall retain the money so paid under protest until otherwise directed by order of the county board. Within thirty days after pay - ing such taxes the person paying them shall file a statement in writ - ing, duly verified, with the county board, setting forth the amount of tax paid under protest, the grounds of such protest, and shall at - tach thereto the receipt taken for said taxes. Whereupon at the first meeting of the county board thereafter, they shall inquire into the matter, and if they shall find, either that the property upon which taxes were levied was not liable for taxation, or that it had been twice assessed in the same year, and taxes paid thereon, they shall issue an order to the county treasurer to refund the taxes, stating therein what sum shall be refunded, and if they shall find that the grounds of such protest are not true, they shall issue an order to the county treasurer to dispose of the money in the same manner, as though it had not been paid under protest. Appeals may be taken from such decisions in the same manner and within the time as appeals are now taken from the action of the county board in allowance or disallow - ance of claims against the county; and if such an appeal be taken the county treasurer shall retain such taxes until the case is finally de - termined: provided, he shall in all cases retain said money until the time for an appeal shall have elapsed. If an appeal from the decision of the county board be taken, and upon the final determination thereof their decision be affirmed, the treasurer shall at once carry the order of the board into effect; but if their decision be reversed, they shall issue a new order to the treasurer conforming to the decree of the court finally determining the case. In all cases where the treasurer shall refund such taxes he shall write opposite such taxes in the tax list the words, 'Erroneously taxed — refunded.' Second — If such person claim the tax or any part thereof to be invalid for the reason that it was levied or assessed for an illegal or unauthorized purpose, or for any other reason except as hereinbefore set forth, when he shall have paid the same to the treasurer, or other proper authority, in all respects as though the same was legal and valid, he may, at any time within thirty days after such payment demand the same in writing from the treasurer of the state, of the county, city, village, township, district or other subdivision, for the benefit, or under the authority, or by the request of which the same </seg>
            <seg id="p352">OPINIONS 345 was levied, and if the same shall not be refunded within ninety days thereafter, may sue such county, city, village, township, district or other subdivision for the amount so demanded; and if upon the trial it shall be determined that such tax, or any part thereof, was levied or assessed for an illegal or unauthorized purpose, or was for any reason invalid, judgment shall be rendered therefor with interest and the same shall be collected as in other cases." Section 6492 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 provides: "When any demand to refund taxes paid is made upon any treas - urer, as provided in the second method of procedure indicated in the preceding section, such treasurer shall transmit a copy of the same to the authorities authorized by law to audit and pay accounts against the state, county, city, township, village or district, as the case may be, who shall pass upon the same as upon any other claim, but no claim for refunding such taxes shall be paid unless it appears to the satisfaction of such authorities that the sum was levied for an illegal or unauthorized purpose." Section 6493 provides as follows: "No county or town board, city council or village trustees shall have the power to release, discharge, remit or commute any portion of the taxes assessed or levied against any person or property within their respective jurisdictions for any reason whatever. Any taxes so discharged, released, remitted or commuted, may be recovered by civil action from members of any such board, council or trustees, and the sureties on their official bonds at the suit of any citizen of the county, township, city or village, as the same may be, and when col - lected shall be paid into the proper treasury. Nothing in this section contained shall be construed to prevent the proper authority from re - funding taxes paid, as provided in the two next preceding sections, nor to interfere with the powers of any officers or board sitting as a board for the equalization of taxes." Section 6437 gives a tax payer the right to apply to the county board of equalization for a correction of his assessment and if he fails to make an application to the county board of equalization the assessment against him is conclusive unless and until set aside in a court of competent jurisdiction. Therefore, a county board has no right or power to refund or repay any tax paid under protest unless the provisions of Sections 6492 and 6493 are strictly complied with and any release, commutation or repayment of taxes paid under protest in any other </seg>

Taxation The County Board of Equalization has only the right to adjust the valuation as between individuals, classes of property and precincts. The State Board of Equalization has the power to raise or lower the general valuation of the county. Mr. Philip F. Bross, Secretary of Finance, Lincoln, Nebr. Dear Sir: It appears from your letter of July 15th that the County Board of Equalization of Nuckolls coun - ty has attempted to arbitrarily revise the valuation of realty in that county by reducing the assessor's valuation 20 per cent in fourteen precincts and 30 per cent in two precincts. The power of the County Board of Equalization was correctly stated in the opinion rendered by Judge Barnes of this department, June 18, 1920, to Mr. W. H. Osborne. The function of the County Board of Equalization is to adjust the valuation as between individuals, classes of property and precincts. It has neither power nor author - ity to attempt to raise or lower the general valuation of the county. Such is the function of the State Board of Equalization. The action of the Nuckolls County Board in lowering the valuation of two precincts 30 per cent and the remainder of the county 20 per cent is clearly an attempt to evade the law as interpreted in this opinion. </seg>
            <seg id="p354">OPINIONS 347 I I I i i Both the State Board of Equalization and yourself, as Secretary of Finance, have ample authority to nullify such action by the County Board of Nuckolls county. Section 6447 of the Revised Statutes grants the State Board of Equalization power to increase or decrease the total assessed valuation of any county and by so doing may increase the aggregate valuation of all property in the state to an amount greater than that returned by the various county assessors, by giving notice to any county in which property is under-valued and requiring said county to appear and show cause why its assess - ment should be increased. After such hearing, the State Board may increase the valuation of such county on a per centum basis to such a figure as will constitute a just and equitable assessment of all state property. Such notice should be served on the county clerk, county as - sessor and chairman of the County Board of Equaliza - tion, at least five days before the hearing. The State Board may adjust valuation as between counties without such a hearing, providing that the ad - justment does not increase the aggregate valuation of the returns from all counties. Section 1, Article IV, Title I, Chapter 190 of the Laws of 1919, grants the Secretary of Finance power and au - thority to: ( 1 ) Investigate the methods of local assessors and County Boards of Equalization in the assessment, equalization and taxation of all (2) To require any County Board of Equalization to make such Wders as the Secretary shall deem just and necessary, to order and direct any County Board of Equalization to raise or lower the valua - tion of any classes of property, and to do and perform any act or to make any order or direction to any County Board of Equalization as to the valuation of any class of property in any county which in the judgment of the said Secretary of Finance may seem just and necessary.

Taxation — Banks In determining the assessed value of banking institutions, by consider - ing the paid up capital of the bank, plus its surplus and undivided profits, deductions should be permitted in most instances only to the amount of the value of real estate or other tangible property belonging to the bank and otherwise assessed to it. Members of the State Board of Equalization, Lincoln, Nebraska. Gentlemen : You ask my opinion concerning the proper method of determining the assessed value of banking in - stitutions. In answer to your question I will say that the Su - preme Court has held that the statutory provision rela - tive to the taxation of banks in this state "is a provision not for taxing the corporations therein named on their capital stock, but for taxing the shareholders upon the value of the stock held by them." (State v. Fleming, 70 Neb., 529.) This being true the real and ultimate fact to determine is the real value of the capital stock. This is not necessarily measured exclusively and entirely by the amount of the paid up capital of the corporation plus surplus and undivided profits, although the statute pro - vides that those matters shall be considered in connection with the market value of the stock, if it has a market value, and the condition of its business, if it is a state bank, as shown by its last report to the state banking board, in determining the real value of its stock. </seg>
            <seg id="p356">OPINIONS 349 I am informed, however, that the usual, and in fact, ;he almost universal custom is to consider the paid up •apital of the bank, plus its surplus and undivided profits is being the measure of the gross value of its stock and :hen to make certain deductions in order to determine ts net value for assessment purposes. If this plan is followed, the deductions permitted should be limited, in my opinion, in most instances, to the value of real estate or other tangible property be - 'onging to the bank and otherwise assessed to it.

University Campus Extension The guarantors to the state of the cost of campus extension, in the city of Lincoln, are required to turn over to the state titles to all real estate included in the tract, remove all salvage therefrom and make final settlement with the Regents before August 31, 1919. don. Samuel Avery, Chancellor, University of Nebraska, City Campus, City. Dear Sir: I beg to acknowledge receipt of your eom - nunication of April 16th in behalf of the University and y direction of the President of the Board of Regents, equesting an opinion as to the period of time within ,'hich the guarantors to the state of the cost of campus xtension in the City of Lincoln, are required to turn over o the state titles to all real estate included in the tract nd remove all salvage therefrom and make final settle - lent with the regents. </seg>
            <seg id="p357">350 REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL I have carefully considered the contract in question and have talked, to some extent, with the men who are familiar with the transaction as it took place at the time The particular paragraph in the contract in question ie as follows: "The entire tract shall be acquired and conveyed to the university within the period in which the funds arising from the three-quarters mill tax are available." The 1913 session of the legislature created the campus extension fund to be raised by an annual three-quarters mill levy for a period of six years. The act creating this fund did not make any of the fund available; it required an appropriation by the 1913 legislature to make any ol the fund available. Nor could the 1913 legislature ap - propriate or make available any of the fund so provided for, for more than the biennium. The 1913, 1915 and 1917 legislatures all, in carrying out the intention of the 191? legislature in creating the building fund, appropriated and made available this fund for the succeeding two yean following each respective legislature. All of the above appropriations were unquestionabh contemplated by the 1913 legislature in the creation o' the six years fund as being the inevitable and necessan manner of making the fund available for the six years This manner of appropriation and the six year perio&lt; covered thereby, was undoubtedly the particular perioc of time in the minds of those drawing and signing th&lt; contract and expressed by them in the terms "Withii the period in which the funds arising from the three quarters mill tax are available." This period expires under the constitution of Nebraska Article 3, Section 19, with the expiration of the firs fiscal quarter after the adjournment of the present legis lature, tfie constitutional section referred to being a "Each legislature shall make appropriations for the expenses c the government until the expiration of the first fiscal quarter afte the adjournment of the next regular session." </seg>
            <seg id="p358">OPINIONS 351 The fiscal year under our laws, is from November 31st lo December 1st and the present legislature will, of course, adjourn this month, which is in the fiscal quarter ending May 31st, and the first fiscal quarter, therefore, after |the adjournment of this legislature begins June 1st and nds August 31st, 1919. It therefore follows from the above that in the or - dinary course of events, and within the very evident in - tent of the parties signing the contract in question "the period in which the funds arising from the three-quar - ters mill tax are available" will expire August 31st, 1919. The fact that the present legislature enacted House Roll 153, with Section 4 as follows: "The appropriations provided for in the three-quarter mill special University building fund levy for the years 1913 to 1918, are hereby extended and made available for two years from the date at which said appropriations would otherwise lapse under the provisions- of the constitution of the state." raised the question as to whether the extension of the availability of this six year fund by the present legisla - ture extended in any manner the contract of the guar - antors. It is our opinion that it did not so extend the contract for the reason that no such extension was with - n the contemplation of the parties signing the contract it the time of their signing; this being apparent from the ery face of the contract and from the situation existing t that time. In the case of any ambiguity, the intention bf the party signing must govern. Respectfully submitted, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, April 17, 1919. Attorney General. </seg>

Dear Sir: The Attorney General has your letter of May 3rd in which you ask whether, where a village is located in a township, it is proper to hold a township election within the limits of the village. There is no in - hibition against holding such election any place within the township limits, and if the village is determined by tht voters to be the most central place for holding the elec tion, there is no reason why it cannot be so held withir the limits of the village.

            <seg id="p361">354 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Warrants Semi-annual payment of interest on school warrants should not be guaranteed to teachers. Persons to whom school warrants have been issued, can only be reim - bursed for the discount which they have to stand in order to con - vert warrants into cash, by a vote of the electors of a school dis - trict. C. L. Trombla, University Place, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter to the Superintendent of Public Instruction has been referred to the Attorney General for answer. You ask first if it would be legal for you to guarantee the payment of interest semi-annually on school warrants issued to teachers in your district. This is a question rather difficult to answer. School warrants are simply an acknowledgement of an indebtedness; they are not promissory notes, nor bills of exchange, but are a peculiar sort of acknowledgment of a legal indebtedness. If there are no funds in the treasury with which to pay these warrants when issued and delivered, they can be registered for payment and paid in the order of regis - tration. These warrants draw interest by law at the rate of 7 per cent per annum from the date of registration until they are paid, and we know of no provision by law which would authorize and guarantee the payment of in - terest semi-annually. Therefore, we would not_jujy_ise you to make such a guarantee, as that promise, if made, might have to be redeemed by the board making the guarantee. In answer to your second question which reads: "Can we legally reimburse the teachers for the discount they have to stand in order to convert these warrants into cash," we inform you that we know of no way this can be done except with the advice, consent and by a vote of the electors of the school district. Answering your third question which reads: "Where a contractor made a bid to do a certain job of work for </seg>
            <seg id="p362">OPINIONS 355 a certain sum of money, and warrants have been issued to pay him and there are no funds with which to take up the warrants, can he compel the district to stand the discount in order to cash these warrants," we inform you that where teachers are hired for a stated sum and contracts are let for a stated sum, with no agreement on the part of the teachers or the contractors to take their pay in school district warrants, the law implies payment in cash. We know of no authority by law for the issu - ance of a greater amount in warrants than the teachers' wages call for, or the contract entered into with the con - tractor calls for, but there is a sure way by which this matter can be properly adjusted and that is to call a special meeting of the school district voters and submit the question you propound in your letter to the voters themselves. They have full power to determine the finan - cial transactions of the district and their vote will au - thorize the board to take such steps as may be necessary to let you out of the dilemma you are in in relation to the matter of the discount of school warrants. We would advise you to consult your attorney and see if he can devise any plan to let you out of your difficulty, for this department cannot see any other sure and legal way to solve your situation. We are, Yours very truly, CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General. By J. B. BARNES, October 22, 1920. Deputy Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p363">356 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Woman's Reformatory Women may be committed to the reformatory, under Chapter 238 of the Session Laws of 1919, by Police Magistrates and Judges of the Juvenile and District Courts, but cannot be so committed by Jus - tices of the Peace. Memorandum: To the Board of Control. Subject: Commitments to Woman's Reformatory. The question arises as to what court has jurisdiction to commit women to the reformatory under Chapter 238 of the Laws of 1919. Section 3 of the statute provides that any female of fifteen years of age and upwards, con - victed by any court of certain offenses, "may be sen - tenced and committed to the Nebraska State Reformatory for Women, to be there confined under the provisions of law relating thereto." The phrase "convicted by any court or magistrate" of the offenses specified would apparently permit a Jus - tice of the Peace or Police Magistrate to commit a woman to the reformatory for an indefinite period, until she be paroled by the Department of Public Welfare. However, Section 18, Article VI of the Constitution of Nebraska, limits the jurisdiction of a Justice of the Peace to a sen - tence not exceeding ninety days. In view of this limitation, in our opinion a Justice of the Peace has no power to commit to the woman's re - formatory for an indefinite period, and all persons sent to the reformatory must be sent under an indefinite sen - tence according to the act governing reformatories. There is no such constitutional limitation upon the power of a Police Magistrate. Section 8914 of the Re - vised Statutes of 1913, making the criminal jurisdiction of Police Magistrates co-extensive with Justices of the Peace, is repealed by implication in Chapter 238 of the Laws of 1919, such being an act complete within itself. </seg>
            <seg id="p364">OPINIONS 357 Consequently, in our opinion, women may be com - mitted to the reformatory by Police Magistrates and Judges of the Juvenile and District Courts, but cannot be so committed by Justices of the Peace, and the matron of the home may refuse to accept any person committed by a Justice of the Peace. Because the capacity of the reformatory is limited, it would be well for a committing judicial officer to confer with the matron of the home as to the accommodations there before committing any person.
