Remarks.— Cedar county is located in the extreme north and almost east part of the state. Its location and topography make Its climate ana productiveness very similar to that of western Iowa. Owing to Its proximity to the Missouri river the rainfall has proven sufficiently abundant to r.iiso un average crop when crops are average In t lie recognized corn producing tcriltory of the United States. The soil is a black loim wiih a clay subsoil. Occasionally there are little knolls where gravtl Is in evidence, which allows it to retain moisture. The land is generally gently rolling becoming rough only alonu Missouri river on the nortn. About 95 pei cent, of the land Is til the 5 UDlilldble per cent being mostly along the bluffs.

            <seg id="p035">Nebraska'* / 37 Ceneral Remarks. — Clierry, the largest county in the state, has an are* ■bout one-linlf of that of Belgium, and is equal to the combined areas of the states of Connecticut and Rhode Island. It forms a part of what is known as the "sand lulls country," and is well adapted to stock raising, with detached portions of fairly good fanning land in the valleys. A great many cattle, horses nnd sheep arc fed on the range. About 2,500,000 acres of government land, suitable for range purposes, are still open to settlement in the county. There are two flouring and grist mills. An important f&lt; presented to the successful industry of stock-raising, so extensively carried on, is the abundance of water supplied by numerous streams, lakelets and wells. Total number of acres under cultivation 414,450. The average value per acre of land is $3.01. The value of live stock in 1904 was $3,054,650.00, Cherry county ranking second in valuation of live stock. The total value of wheat, oats, corn and rye produced in 1903 was $357,053.00, a per value of $54.08. The bank deposits in 1903 were $257,773.29, a per capita of $39.41.

The soil is a rich, sandv loam, of pood deuth *n*i fertility. There is practically no waste land in the entire county, for it is true that some of the land is too much broken for profitable hu such lands are especially fitted for grazing purposes, as it is on such lands that winter's snows refuse to lie, and the range stock finds the richest grasses here, entirely free from snow, even in midwinter. The county is well watered, both for stock-raising and irrigation poses. The North Platt flows oblique! the county, while the I pole, Pumpkin Seed, Lawrence Fork. Red Willow, Indian. Middle, 1' Cedar, Rush, Dug Out and Greenwood creeks, scattered all over the e together with the innumerable lakes i* the north part, furnish an abundance of water in almost every nook and coiner. Cheyenne county's climate is moderate and healthful. T as a rule, mild and entirely free from the severe storms that make some localities so undesirable as a winter home. Horses run t no feed except the grass of the prairies, and come out in the sprr condition. The summers are warm, but seldom uncomfortal nights do much to counteract the heat of the day. The principal occupations of Cheyenne county's people arc farm in stock-raising. Without irrigation fine crops of wheat, rye, oats and potatoes »re raised, of the highest quality and ample yield, while in the vallr irrigation, crops of alfalfa and wild hay arc harvested, which bi i prices in the market than timothy nnd clover.

            <seg id="p045">47 General Remarks.— TV of Clay county is mostly undulating prairie, and the soil is a dark, sandy loam, with a friable clay subsoil. There is little waste land, 93 per cent being tillable, and the rem broken but good for pasturage. Good drainage is furnished by the BIuw rivers, School, Big and Little Sandy creeks, and smaller streams. are from twenty-five to one hundred and twent feet in depth, and the supply of water is abundant. Both climate and soil are well adapted to timber and fruit culture, as many groves and orchards in all parts of the county sufficiently provo; maple, ash, box elder, black walnut .xnd cottonwood ar* the principal forest trees, and apples, plums, cherries, peaches, grapes ami small fruits do well. In 1890 Clay produced more wheat than and otlier county in Nebraska. The leading crops are winter wheat and corn, though all the other cereals and grasses, vegetables, etc., are successfully u tensively raised.

It is rich in agri - ural resources, fine valleys and rich table-lands. Famous in early s for its buffalo, elk, deer and antelope. Today the second county in the ,e in value of live stock. Registered herds of Shorthorns, Hereford*, rdeen Angus and Galloway cattle. The large ranches and farmers raise good lity of feeding steers. A great hog country, both red and black, also stered herds. Corn, whe.it, oats, rye, barley, flax, cane, millet, speltz, ) alfalfa and brooine grass as specialties. These latter two named plant* worth more per acre to the farmer and stockmen of Custer county than i, timothy or blue grass to the Iowa or Illinois farmer. Not a Sand Hill Country Uninformed people consider Custer county a sand hill country. No greater «rror could be made. Excepting the country north and west of Anselmo, a small territory west of Callaway, a narrow strip 2 by 0 miles west of Broken Bow and parts of the Loup valleys, no finer black soil can be found anywhere. Traversed by the Burlington system from southeast to northwest, * branch line to Sargent and a branch of the U. P. from Kearney to Calla - way, with 12 railroad towns, the farmer and stockman have good railroad facilities, there being 94.20 miles of railroad in the county. Broken Bow, the county seat, of 2,500 people with good schools, churches, large stocks of goods and business houses, no saloons, good people, is rapidly becoming a fine residence city. The county has no bonded indebtedness, all warrants are payable in cash. Low Taxes. The principal industries are farming and •tock-raising. Grazing lands that grow the finest grosses in the &lt;at least 150 different varieties, 119 kinds have been selected), are in good demand, selling at from $5 to $10 per acre. Smooth farm ng at $15 to $25 per acre, and rapidly advancing. Alfalfa. acre, sptltz yielding 40 to CO bushels per acre, and from February to December, 9 months of the year, will run the price of farm land in Custer county to $50 per acre.

General Remarks. — Dakota county is in tlic extreme northeast corner of Nebraska, just across the Missouri river from Sioux City, Iowa, and is one of the oldest settled counties in the state. Its north and east boundary is the Missouri river. Lack from the river for a distance of ten miles is ■ very fertile valley, after which the land becomes gently rolling. Every acr« of land in Dakota county is tillable. The soil is all a deep, rich, black loam, free from rock and sand, and cacti year produces satisfactory crop*. There never lias lw»cn a crop failure in Dakota county, and it has been settled sine* All the hind dips toward the Missouri river and is well provided small creeks which empty into that watercourse. iie principal crop is corn, which proves, year after year, a splendid success, yield licing from 33 to 90 bushels per acre, according to the season and Ninety nor cent of the farmers also raise hogs and make it a point eed all their corn. Stock cattle also are bought every fall and during the winter months in connection with hogs. These cattle are ped to Sioux City from tV ranges, bought by our* farmers and driven oot to their farms, only a few miles from the utoclt yards. AVhen fat, are driven back to the stock yards on foot, thus saving transportation iheat and other small grain is also raised, but is not considered one of best paying crop9. In the past fifteen years potato raising, market ening (for the Sioux City market) and fruit growing have been taken nd proven a financial success, and more people are engaging in these in - rics each year. Exceptional yields of this class of products are the rate, the nearness to Sioux City, a city of over 50,000 inhabitants, makes the industry very profitable. South Sioux City, Dakota City, Ilomer, Jackson, Hubbard and Emerson are the towns in the county, South Sioux City being the larger, with a popu - lation of 1.000. There i s a sugar beet syrup, preserving and canning factory in successful operation in South Sioux City. Two railroads traverse the county, the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis A Omaha and the Or«it Northern.

The amount paid for cream during the year of 1003 by the different com - panies probably amounted to $30,000. One company alone puid out over •28,000. The south half of the county is given largely to stock-raising, although n immense amount of grain is also grown. The Republican river flows through liis south Imlf of the county, and along this river runs the main line of lie "Burlington" railroad frcm Kansas City to Denver. Here are rich lfalfa bottom farms, and clone by are cheaper grazing lands. Amongst be cattle feeders is found a good home market for everything the farmers f the county raise. This good home market is one of the advantages of 'ranklin munty as a home for the farmer. The south part of the county • almost entirely of American population. The north lulf of the county is given almost wholly to raining crrain. The country is perfectly smooth and level. The hind is worth from $25 to $40 an acre, depending upon the improvements. A line of the "Burlington" railroad runs through the north part of the county from Nebraska City to Holdrepe. There is a large German settlement of eplendid German people, with well improved farms, fine churches and school buildings. Good water and plenty of it. Wells on the creek bottoms and river bottoms are eifrth to twenty feet deep, and water of th best. Upland wells usually run fifty to eighty feet deep. On the prairie they are deeper. There are a great many fine creeks, all fed by springs, and of course never fail. Then is timber along all these creeks.

General Remarks.— Furnas county is well adapted to raising cattle, hogs and sheep. The fine grazing land on the rolling prairie, extensive crop acreage on the table-lands and in the valleys, and an abundance of good water render this section particularly desirable for stock-feeding purposes. The soil is a dark, sandy loam, with a silt subsoil. Good drainage is furnished by the Republican river, Sappa, Beaver, Elk and Muddy creeks. Wells on the upland are from sixty to one hundred and fifty feet in depth, and in the ralley* from ten to forty feet. A larj:i is devoted to the cultivation of wheat, corn, rye, sorghum nnd alfalfa respectively ; all the cereals and moat of the tame grasses do well. Potatoes and all kinds of vegetables are suc - cessfully raised and apples, peaches, plums, cherries and apricots are the leading fruits. Maple, ash, elm, box elder and cottonwood are well adapted to the county. The value of land has increased 33 per cent since 1897, and at present there is a steady demand for farms, especially in the parts where alfalfa is produced. There are seven flouring and grist mills and three brick yards. The total number of acres under cultivation is 427,640. The average price of land in the county is $12.13 per acre. The yield of the four principal crops for 1903 was as follows: Wheat, 1,690,314; corn, ■44; oats. 70.434: the total value of these crops being $2,514,113.00, being a per capita value of $203.17. The value of live stock in 1904 was $1,250 - I he bank deposits in 1003 amounted to $593, - 926.79, a per capita of $48.00. RIPTION OF TOWNSHIPS Range 21 T. 1.

The soil is a dark, sandy loam, with a silt subsoil. Seventy-five per cent of the land is tillable, and the remainder is rough and sandy. The North and South Platte rivers traverse the entire length of the county from west to east. Wells on the upland are from one hundred to three hundred and fifty feet in depth, and in the valleys from se\ thirty feet. The Platte valleys, being about two and one- fourth mi breadth, are well adapted to irrigation, and already over fifty miles of ditches have been constructed. Alfalfa is grown very successfully in the valleys and the acreage devoted to it being annually increased. Abo: acres have been planted in sugar beets this year. Stock-raising is the lead - ing industry, and mixed farming is carried on to some extent. The value of live stock in 1904 was $n ; The total value of wheat, oats and rye produced in 1903 was $148,609.00, a per capita value of $76.07.

KEYA PAHA COUNTY General Remarks. — Keya Paha county, Nebraska, is located between the Niobrara and Keya Paha rivers, on the northern boundary of the state, midway east and west. Being fifty miles in length and with an average of twenty miles in width. The character of the soil varies, a small portion being sandy, and by far the greater part being a fine loam and clay soil. The lay of the land also differs, while there are many extensive prairies, yet there are good valleys and rolling lands. Along the rivers are scattered what are called bench and bottom lands, composed of excellent heavy soil, and in many instances are well timbered, with deep canons affording good shelter for stock in winter, and making, altogether, desirable and valuable farms. Through the center of the county, running east and west, extends a stretch of table - land, varying in width from one to two miles; the soil is not uniform, a portion being sandy, but there are also some of the best farms in the e on the same, the ground being rich and very productive. Diverging off from this table, running north or south, as the case may be, are many living streams, meandering through extensive valleys, and flowing into the two rivers. These valleys are well adapted to the stock, hog and farming industries. The &gt; produces corn, wheat, rye, barley, oats, millet, speltz, cane, alfalfa, grasses, and there is an abundance of prairie hay, the yield per acre is good, which all makes this county one of the best and most reliable stock and fanning districts in Nebraska. Owing to the fact that hog cholera is un - known in the county, that branch of industry is very successfully carried on by those who give it any attention. About 75 per cent of the land is tillable. The industries are horse, cattle and hog rai h farming, which latter is followed extensively. Although the county has been settled for twenty years or more, there are no railroad facilities, but the people are dependant upon the North-Western R. R., running through the court' the south of the Niobrara some fifteen miles. However, there was in 1903.

The Keya Paha river is a medium sized stream and the Niobrara river bordering the enmity on the south, is one of the main rivers of Nebraska. I'liesc carry off the surplus waters of the county, and give good outlets to the many streams flowing into them from the county. The drainage facilities .ely be improved upon, as the general Iny of the land dips from the table- land respective rivers. The climate is mild and healthy. Springview, the county seat, is located on the table not far from the center of the county. It is a good, thriving town, having a good school and amply supplied with churches. There are three banks, all in flourishing condition. The prot' represented and there are two s'ordon, located in the western part, is another active town, being well supplied with churches, schools, a bank, I, etc. Brocksburg, in the eastern part of the county, and situated on the Keya Paha, is an energetic place, and a good bu ter. Telephone lines are stretched in all directions over the county, and any town and any one can be reached with but little difficulty. There is an abundant rain - fall, giving all the moisture needed for the raising and maturity of the The county has, up to within three or four years ago, been considered prin - cipally as a stock-raising section, but the increase of the rainfall in recent years has dispelled that idea, and it is now conceded that Keya Paha county is rapidly developing into an excellent farming district, and to that extend that it will soon be classed with the farming counties of the state. About a fourth of the county is under cultivation, the balance being occupied by ranchmen for grazing purposes, yet there is room for more ranches, plenty of land to place more cattle on and a large scope of territory on which the home seekers can build homes. The financial condition of the county and its people is good. The population is nearing the 4,000 mark, and is rapidly increasing. While the values of land have a rising tendency, they are still low.

It is watered by the North and Calamus rivers, which run in a southeasterly direction across the entire county. Neither of reams ever overflow their banks or go dry at any point. The North Loup valley has an average width of about two miles, which is mostly composed of level, rich, well-cultivated and much im - proved farms which product! wheat, corn, oats, potatoes, speltz and alfalfa. The Calamus valley has an average width of about one mile with a low. levtl, sandy loam soil which at present is being used mostly for grazing poses. The remainder of the county consists of rolling, broken prairie able for dairying, fanning and stock -growing. This county is twenty-four miles square and has about 204,000 acres of vacant government land subject to entry under the homestead law. The population consists almost entirely of Americans. Taylor is the couty seat and the largest town, and i - situated in the southern part of the county, from which point there radiate- - in all directions telephone lines, reaching the most remote neighborhood and a large per cent of the farmers have telephones in their homes. Land can be l*&gt;ught at prices ranging from $3,000 to $40..00 per acre, and a large amount has changed hands the last year at these prices. Schools, churches and )&gt;ost offices are located at convenient points for all settlers. The entire county is well situated for farming: either dairying or growing of crops. The Peatrice Creamery Co., of Lincoln, has had a cheese factory in successful &lt;&gt;l&gt;eration at Taylor for some years. The value of wheat, corn, oats and rye produced in 1903 was $201,144.00, a per capita value of $154.19 bink deposits in 1903 amounted to $87,750.73, a per capita of $87.24.

The result of these conditions is that Merrick county is the home largest single feeding establishment in this state; Mr. T. B. Hord fattt annually for the market approximately 15,000, cattle, 15.000 sheep and I hogs, while there are a number of smaller feeders; nnd all the farmers in th» county are engaged more or less extensively in the business of the markets with meat. Dairying is practically a new industry in Nebraska. In this line Merrick county is forging to the front, the Beatrice Creamei gathering and shipping to their creamery at Lincoln from one station. ( • City alone, approximately $00,000 worth of cream a year, this from a begin - ning only three years ago, when they introduced their first separator into the county. These figures suggest the establishment here in the near future of a large and profitable creamery business. Merrick county, in common with the rest of the Platte valley, is well adapted to fruit raising and will I not distant future be largely devoted to the production of small fruits and ablcs for eastern markets, such a record as 1,600 quarts of straw! ■ on five rods square of land by Geo.

The county south of the Niobrara river, while possessing some fertile valleys whir' duce good crops, is largely made up of large sand hills and hay valleys, and ia occupied largely by stockmen who own all the way from one bund five thousand head of cattle. The portion of Sheridan county lying nor'!, of the Niobrara river is altogether a different country. Here no sand hills appear and no hay valleys, except along the creeks. The soil is a limy. day loam and gently rolling. This is the home of the mixed farmer ami stockman. Wheat, oats and barley do fairly well. Rye is an excej crop. The quality of potatoes in the county is excellent and the yield is al - ways good, only one crop being lost in nineteen years. The yields in 1003 were about as follows: Wheat, 18 I barley, 27 bushels; oats, 60 bushels; rye, 30 bushels; potatoes, from 100 to 300 bushels per acre planting of potatoes is the rule here). Some good corn is raised in this por - tion of the county frequently, but it ia not considered a corn count comparison with the eastern half of the Btate. Sub-irrigation is pr» ■Jong most of the creeks, besides several large ditches along the Niobrara river, where surface irrigation is carried on to a considerable extent. Under irrigation alfalfa makes from five to seven ton per acre, while on unirrigated lands a few men are now getting alfalfa started which has yielded from a ton and a half to four tons per acre. Land is cheap. DESCRIPTION OF TOWNSHIPS Range 41 T. 24. Sand hills and hay flats; few small lake- T. 25. Sand hills and hay flats; few small lake-. T. 26.

Small grain, potatoes and vegetables do well. Hay is tlie principal crop, and pood grazing land is very general in every part of the county. The Niobrara and numerous streams afTord pood drainage in the northern part. Wells are from twelve to twenty-five feet deep in the Niobrara valley, and from one hundred and fifty to three hundred and twenty - five feet on the uplands. There is an abundance of fine water for stock purposes. Owing to the advance;! price of domestic animals, there is a very general demand for ranches in this section of the state: and as considerable amount of government land is still open to settlement, many quarter sections hare been disposed of within the last eighteen months. The value of live stock in 1904 was $001,015.00. The vain* &gt;( w! corn and rye produced in 1903 was $66,329.00, a per . The bank deposits in 1903 amounted to $158,537.60, a per capita of $77.14.

General Remarks. — Eighty-six per cent of the land surface o - i-ounty is tillable; the remainder is untillable largely on account of sand. Thirty per cent is rich valley land. Every township is well drained. The Klkhorn flows through the entire width of the county from west to east, ing the Humbug, Indian, Muscat ine. Pleasant Run, Nobody's and Spring Branch creeks from the north and the Rock, Elm, Butterfly, Oak, Union Meridian creeks from the south. Excepting a sandy belt south of the Klkhorn from one to two and one-half miles in breadth, all the county has a good soil with a dark, rich, sandy loam, and clay subsoil. The low ii lands yield a luxuriant growth of grass, and the rolling prairie pro - duce* all the cereals abundantly. Every section is well wooded with arti - ficial groves. All small fruits, apples, cherries, plums and peaches do well. stock raising and mixed fanning are the leading industries. There are two i louring and grist mills and one brick-yard in the county.

The county is twenty-four miles square and contains sixteen .ships, six miles square or 576 square miles. It is traversed by four ims, the North Blue, Lincoln creek, Beaver creek and the West Blue . These streams all have running water at all seasons and three of them flouring mills located upon them within the county. They are skirted i of the way by a narrow belt of timber, though natural timber is not abundant. A large number of artificial groves have grown to considerable and furnish abundant shade and fuel. The surface is gently rolling, enough for drainage but not broken. Practi - cally all the land within the county is under cultivation. The soil is rich, vegetable mold and is from three to five feet deep, while the subsoil is pourus and receives and holds the water to be yielded up as needed during dry weather. Vegetation will nourish here with less rain than almost anywhere else and the precipitation is always sufficient to insure good crops. Ehe farms average about 100 acres each and are in a high state of coiti - on and well improved. Comfortable and even elegant homes, surrounded barns, granaries, fine groves and orchards, dot the landscape everywhere, 'ywhere. Three railroads traverse the county; the Burlington )and Missouri River road from east to west, the Chicago and Xorthwestet^Jrom northeast to southwest and the Kansas City and Omaha from north to south.

The acreage of wheat this year is thirty-fir* i to each 160 acres, throughout the county and the yield is about twenty els to the acre. It is nearly all fall wheat and the quality is excellent, is somewhat less than the average yield of the county, taking one year another. Many fields have yielded forty bushels per acre and some a* as fifty and even sixty bushels. The acreage of corn i» considerably larger of wheat and the average crop is about forty bushels per acre, Oats, potatoes, alfalfa and almost all cereals do well here and are paying Reeding is a prominent and profitable industry of the county and many isand cattle and hogs are fattened. Apples, peaches, pears, plums, cherries and all kinds of small fruits do well here and when properly cared for are remunerative. There are a number of paying orchards within the county, but in general the fruit industry haa been neglected. It has been proven, however, that many varieties can be raised here as successfully as anywhere in the country and farmers are turning their attention more and more to its cultivation. The climate is most delightful at all seasons of the year. The elevation above the sea and the absence of low, swampy lands make the atmosphere clear, dry and bracing and soften the rigor of winter and modify the heat of summer. In the warmest weather the nights are almost always cool and comfortable. It is a delightful and healthful climate to live in and the roads are always good. Even after the hardest rains in a few hours the roads are dry and smooth. Mud and rough roads are practically unknown.

In the valleys of the Platte and North Platte riven are found the largest igation enterprises of the state. In many places the valley reaches a width 10 to 12 miles and contains some of the best soil to be found anywhere the state. About 1,184 miles of canal have been actually constructed diverging water from these riven. These canals cover about 660,000 acres. REPUBLICAN RIVER On the Republican some very successful ditches have been operated. The total length of these ditches is about 133 miles, covering about 35,000 acres. WHITE RIVER, HAT CREEK AND NIOBRARA fn the northwestern part of the state, a large number of canals have bin It using the water from Hat creek, White river and Niobrara river and ir tributaries. Most of thew ditchesc are small, but they are of great value, they furnish the means of supplying winter feed for the cattle which grass &gt;n the range adjacent to these irrigated sections during the greater part the year. These small ditches also enable the ranchman to raise a variety products which would be impossible without irrigation. LOUP RIVERS Many canals have been built taking their water from the Loup rivers and their tributaries. The largest of these, the Great Eastern canal, which heads a short distance above Genoa, has about 70 miles of canal constructed and in operation and covers about 40,000 acres of land. These streams flow for the greater portion of their lengths through a section of the state where the natural rainfall is generally sufficient for the production of good crops, and for this reason only a very small percentage of the flow has been diverted for use in irrigation. fome very extensive schemes for the development of power have been wed involving the use of the waters of the Loup, Elkhorn and Platte rivers, it is probable that work on some one or more of these will be commenced an early date. ELKHORN RIVER Eily a few canals have been taken out of the Elkhorn and lower Niobrara rs for irrigation. Among the largest of these is the Elkhorn Valley canal, :h is about 12 miles in length and coven about 9,000 acres of land. Ee Elkhorn river is used extensively for the development of power and cation has been made for water for several large power plants on the rara. </seg>

Eie Lodge Pole, which rarely flows more than 20 cubic feet per second at point, supplies 77 miles of canal, covering about 12,000 acres of land, a large percentage of this land receives sufficient water to insure the pro - ion of good crops. §many localities in Nebraska the land under irrigation has reached a state of cultivation and a large variety of crops is produced. Under the canals many well improved farms are found which will compare favor - with any to be found in the eastern portion of the state. A great deal of alfalfa is grown under irrigation and the cultivation of sugar beets is being rapidly developed. The beets show a very large percentage of sugar and the tonnage is heavy. The abundance of sunshine and the fact that the amount of moisture supplied may be regulated so as to give the growing beets just the amount required, and the further fact that the soil seems to be particularly adapted to their growth, make this an ideal locality for sugar beet culture. Much of the land under irrigation has never been broken up and is devoted to the production of native hay. The native sod when irrigated produces large crops of hay of a very superior quality. Within the past two years, the supreme court of this state has handed down several opinions which have done much to settle the question of irri - gation rights in Nebraska. These decisions declare the irrigation laws of the state to be constitutional, define the rights of riparian owners and uphold th rights of appropriators who have made beneficial us* of the water. This has done much to establish the stability of existing rights and to encourage appropriators. There are still a number of important points which remain unsettled. Nebraska extending as it does from the Missouri river almost to the mountains, includes within its borders two distinct regions. The east - ern portion of the state is within the humid region and the rainfall is suffi - cient for successful agriculture, and the extreme western portion might be classed as semi-arid. Here the rainfall is very variable and is generally deficient and very few crops can be raised without irrigation. The conditions being so different in different portions of the state, render it very difficult to settle many of the questions which arise in regard to the use of water. The question of the distribution of the waters of interstate streams is a very important one and one which should be settled as soon as possible. Nebraska is particularly interested in this question. A very large part of the land reclaimed in this state receives its water from the Platte rivers. About 1,200 miles of canal covering about 560,000 acres, receive their supply from this source. The pioneers of irrigation have gone into this part of the state </seg>

These people should protected in the use of water which they have appropriated, and be me - ed that subsequent appropriates in other states will not be permitted divert the water and ruin their work of a life time. Some system should devised whereby the appropriator of the water of any stream who has mad* leficial use of the same, should be protected without regard to state line* other political subdivisions. (n the early days of the settlement of this state there was a great prejudice linst irrigation and anyone who advocated it was looked upon as an my of the state. Many of the pioneers who settled in the western portion the state, realizing the uncertainty of agriculture when dependent upon th* :ural rainfall, constructed a number of canals which demonstrated the ue of irrigation. |.*ebraska has now about 2.500 miles of canals, covering about 1,000,000 es of land. In the western part of the stale the normal flow of many of streams during the heighth of the irrigating season, has already been ap priated, but only a small portion of the entire flow is used, and a large ount of land can still be reclaimed by an intelligent system of storage I by educating the irrigators to use the water upon the land when it is to had, instead of waiting until the crops are suffering, and everyone desires use the full amount of his appropriation. On some of the smaller streams, plan of distributing the water by a time schedule has proved very suc - iful. This allows each appropriator to use all the water available in the earn for a short period and then turn it out to be used by the next on« o is entitled to it. In this way it is possible to accomplish much more n could be accomplished when each irrigator is restricted to the amount his appropriation, which is sometimes only a fraction of a cubic foot par ond and is allowed to use it for the entire season. We have a district irrigation law in Nebraska which enables a majority of the land owners in any territory which is susceptible to irrigation from a common source, to organize a district, and this district has authority t» vote bonds for the construction or purchase of works, and to levy a tax to raise money to pay these bonds, and also to pay for the maintenance of the works. This law has worked out very successfully in many cases, and we have some districts organized under it which are finely improved and in pood financial condition. I There has been considerable development along the line of pumping water r irrigation, and quite a number of plants have been put in operation, em Dying windmills, water wheels, gasoline and steam engines for the n power. Taking everything into consideration, Nebraska has made very good pro grass in irrigation improvement, and is in position to make still greater da relopment in the future. </seg>

Situated in the geographical center of the United States, it command* the entrance to the great and rapidly developing west. From Omaha diverges the three great trunk lines which connect tbe central states with the Pacific coast. Omaha reflects today, is her splendid growth and great progress, the wonderful development of the peerless empire of Nebraska, of which she is the chief city. Within the limits of a brief presentation of statistics such as this must be, it is not possible to set out adequately all the facts concerning Omaha. The list at the head of the article indicates Omaha's growth as clearly as it can be indicated by mere statistics. Behind these statistics lies a history of splendid achieve - ment on the part of a community that was a straggling village forty years ago and is today a city of over one hundred and twenty thousand people, a city beautifully located and well built; a city fortunate in the character of its people and the strength of its institutions, commercial, industrial and educational, but most fortunat« of all is its location, as the gateway of the vast commerce of the fertile prairies of Nebraska. I From a city of 66,536 population in 1890, it increased to 102,555 in 1900, d in the past four years has made a magnificient increase of 20.000, which </seg>

            <seg id="p178">180 ie borne out by government statistics. A glance at a comparison of the manu - factured products in the year 1890 and in the present year gives one a splendid idea of the remarkable growth and development of the city. In 1890 the manufactured products of Omaha were valued at $87,946,100, and the output in 1903 is conservatively estimated at $106,000,000. In the two yean from 1901 to 1903 the sales of the jobbing houses increased $2,000,000, the total •ales in 1903 approximating $95,000,000. These latter figures give an idea as to the excellence of Omaha as a distributing point and shows the un - mistakable growth of the country which draws upon her trade. No city in the United States affords better opportunities than does Omaha. The city has ample railroad facilities, large and well organized banks and the great success of the plants already established shows what may be ac - complished by wise investors who take into account the advantages offered by Omaha's favorable location. The smeltering works, the great meat packing establishments, the bag and clothing factories, the railroad shops and the host of other thriving industries are the best evidence of the splendor of the*e opportunities. There remains an ample field in all the woodworking lines, (such as the making of furniture, sash doors and blinds) ; agricultural ma - chinery and supplies; corn and wheat mills and the "sides lines" naturally belonging to the milling industry ; and a host of other staple articles of which the great west is a consumer and for which, thanks to bountiful crops and prosperous times, the great west is able to pay well. E&gt; anyone who may desire to invest in the enterprises noted above, Omaha afford a hearty welcome. They may come to her with the full assurance not only will their business needs be met, but that they may look for per - satisfaction in every other way. Omaha's list of churches, universities, ges. schools, both public and private, libraries, art galleries, clubs, ters, parks, boulevards, resorts, fine residences, etc., will bear comparison those of any city double her population. The auditorium, one of the finest and most spacious buildings for public purposes in the United States, was dedicated in May, 1904. This supplies Omaha with a building capable of caring for the largest convention* and meetings which she may be calltd upon to accommodate. Valued at two hundred thousand dollars and built according to modern plans and conven - iences, it stands a model of architectural beauty. The city hall, court house, federal building, high school, public library, St. Joseph's hospital and other buildings, attest to the taste in architecture which the people possess. Omaha also prides herself upon having two of the finest railway stations in the world. I Within ten minutes street car ride from Omaha lies the city of South laha, which being so closely connected with Omaha, seems to be part of s great metropolis. Here is located the second largest live stock market the world, and third largest meat packing industry. The receipts of live »ck in 1903 were as follows: Cattle, 1,071,177; hogs, 2231,067; sheep, 1, - (,763; horses and mules, 52,829.

It is the gateway to the great devel' southwest. Five railroads operate in and out of the city, viz: The lington, Union Pacific, Missouri Pacific, Rock Island and Northwestern. These roads diverge in every direction, giving to the city a wonderful advantage is securing and maintaining supremacy in trade throughout the southwest and northwest. By these road facilities Lincoln's trade relations extend over </seg>
            <seg id="p182">184 Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado, Wyoming, South Dakota and even into Montana. N'i city in the west is experiencing such a staple, sound and rapid develop - ment, commercially and otherwise as Lincoln. It has never been, and is not now, the victim of a boom. Throughout its entire history it has maintained a substantial growth, and the same is continuing with most wonderful pros - pects for such growth indefinitely. The approximate assessed valuation of the city, as made in 1004, is $20,000,000, showing a growth since 1902 of over $8,000,000. The great railroad milage, railway franchises and other railroad property are not included in this as these are assessed by state authorities The wholesale business of Lincoln includes the following: Wholesale groceries; wholesale lumber; wholesale harness and saddlery; wholesale furni - ture, mattresses, iron beds and upholstered goods; wholesale coal; wholesale cream, butter, cheese and eggs; wholesale plumbing, iron pipes, pumps, etc.; wholesale jewelry; wholesale drugs; wholesale dry goods; wholesale crockery and glassware; wholesale confectionery; wholesale printing and publishing, and numerous minor establishments. In all there are about thirty-five large jobbing houses whose volume of trade in 1003 aggregated $21,000,000. In this summary no account is taken of twenty-two firms distributing agricultural implements and machinery, nor of six grain companies operating over one hundred and fifty elevators throughout the state. In manufacturing Lincoln has made a most rapid growth. The United States census for 1000 gives $4,106,961 as the volume of the manufactured products of the city. Since that date the manufacture of shirts and overalls, creamery products, harness and saddlery goods, and artificial stone has so increased the volume of business that a very conservative estimate of the value of the annual manufactured product is $7,000,000. Lincoln has the greatest creamery plant in the world, the Beatrice creamery company producing annually $4,000,000 worth of cream - ery products, having a monthly pay roll of about $43,000. Lincoln is the larg - est center in harness and saddlery west of Chicago, one firm producing $200,000 worth of these goods in 1003. Space does not permit of an extended analysis of the city's manufacturing growth and wealth, but the growth of these cited and of all others is simply due to the fact that nothing can prevent Lincoln becoming an important factor of trade in the west, southwest and northwest within a radius of seven hundred miles. These industries and all others must of necessity grow as the west grows and develops, which it i8 doing at a rapid pace. Within twenty minutes ride from the city, and connected by street railway service is located the suburban town of Havelock, where are located the Bur - lington railroad manufacturing and repair shops, which give employment to over six hundred men. The entire plant is valued at a little more than $500,000 and has an annual output of over $000,000; building locomotives, cars and coaches. At West Lincoln are located the Union Stock yards, with a daily capacity of three hundred cars and provided with railroad facilities by five railroads. At Burnham, three miles southwest of Lincoln is located the Burlington sheep feeding station, the most extensive in the west and cap- </seg>
            <seg id="p183">185 able of feeding 45,000 sheep. The company has its own elevator and mill for As an index to the city's growth and wealth, it is well to glance a figures showing the bank deposits of the city. There are two state, one sav - ing! and three national banks in Lincoln. Two of the national banks are United States depositories. The financial growth of the city is wonderful when it is considered that in 1900 the deposits were $3,540,833; in 1902 they amounted to $5,115,000 and on September 1, 1904 they aggregated $7,023,17130, a growth in four years of $3,500,000. At Lincoln are located the state capitol and grounds and four state tutions, viz: The penitentiary, home for the friendless, hospital f&lt; insane and the state fair buildings and grounds. These give employment to over two hundred people and represent an expenditure of over $1,500,000. The University of Nebraska is located here, which has sixteen buildings, rep - resenting a valuation of $10,500,000 and an annual expenditure for main - tenance of $200,000. This, together with the institutoins of learning located at the surburban towns of University Place, College View and Bethany, gives Lincoln first rank as a city of learning. In the city are also two conservatories of music and three business colleges. Nearly four thousand students attend school here for nine months of the year and their influence upon the city must be apparent to all, both in their effect commercially and socially. The value of public school buildings of the city amounts to $500,000. The present school population is 13,818. Taking all these things into consideration, no city in the west or middle west has more superior environments to influence its value in retail and whole - sale trade, in social life and in the intellect and splendid character of its people. It stands today with as bright a future and as substantial a growth aa any city in the country. SOUTH OMAHA Never was a city more appropriately named than was South Omaha when someone having a full realization of its marvelous growth and its future pos - sibilities applied to it the name of "The Magic City." With the building of the Union Stock Yards commenced the upbuilding and development of a city which has astonished even those who nourished the highest hopes. At that time (1884)) it had only the proportions of a small village and a popi: of three hundred. In 1903 the population had increased to 31,383. It has an area of six square miles with 105 miles of streets of which ten miles are paved and over 35 miles well graded. It has forty miles of sewers, fourteen miles of street railway. The city has one of the finest fire dep;i the country, with the best of apparatus and has over two hundred fire hy - drants. The streets are illuminated with 156 electric arc lights, of the city, as returned by the assessors in 1904, was approximately $20,- </seg>
