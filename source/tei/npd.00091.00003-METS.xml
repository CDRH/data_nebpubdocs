         <seg id="p004">STATE OF NEBRASKA i ¦'r ¦¦] (I DEPARTMENT'S FINANCIAL STATUS [. | A study of the comparative table below will show that the 1939 income f {ell $500 below that of the preceding year and that the salaries and ex- ~i penses were correspondingly lowered, in fact, the lowest, with one excep- '-I 1 tion, in the history of the department. ¦ i. The reduced annual receipts since 1930 prove that fire insurance pre- 1 mium income has decreased fifty-nine per cent during the ten year period. )•; The fact remains apparent that, under depressed economic or crop con- f ditions, the scope of the fire marshal's activities are widened and at the J time when the office income is the least. ;! A nation-wide study shows that no other state fire prevention de- ; partment carries the three point program—statistics, inspection and arson :j investigation—with so low a levy on premiums. Here we are entitled by law to 3/Bths of one per cent of the premium income on stock and foreign mutual companies and one-eighth of one per cent from state-wide domestic ; mutual and assessment companies. Nothing from local assessment fire ) associations. The prevailing assessment in other states is one-half of one j per cent from stock and mutual companies alike, including reciprocals '• which are wholly exempt in Nebraska. Some states collect as much as j two per cent of premium income and with limited activities. No part of \ the proceeds of the 1 levy in Nebraska may be transferred to other funds. 1 An added expense for 1939 came from aW.P. A. project whereby I a -5 card index system brings available all fire losses during the past 27 years. ¦; The cost of this valuable record rests alone in the purchase of printing \l and second-hand filing cases. \ During the year our accounting system has been standardized to IS meet the requirements of the state auditor. Not a penny is received ex - cept through the state treasurer's office and no purchase of supplies ex - cept through the state purchasing agent.

         <seg id="p010">STATE OF NEBRASKA I """ I I ;¦¦ FIREMEN'S TRAINING SCHOOLS CONDUCTED Four regional one-day schools for volunteer firemen were held during j February at Norfolk, at Alliance, at Holdrege and at Seward. Seventyj- I six towns were represented by 336 registered firemen. A registration fee of ! fifty cents was paid to defray expense of postage, printing and local meet- - ing places. J. Burr Taylor from Chicago, R. D. Mac Daniel from Indian]- j apolis and Walter Reed Gage from Kansas City came from their fire insurance agencies, and without expense, to have an active part in the ! programs. The Grand Island department furnished Captain Ronnfeldt to j have charge of training in evolutions as the weather and local-, facilities |i permitted. / it Roll was called at each session and attendance reported to local city Jj officials. Evening entertainment programs were left to the discretion of host departments. • j The management of the schools was with the committee chosen at I the Grand Island state school of 1938 and consisted of Horace M. Davis, ! Director, Fay Wood of Seward and R. J. Van Fleet of Hastings. 1 j pi State School at Grand Island . j I The state-wide school was held at Grand Island, upon local invitation, j i April 25, 26, and 27, 1939, with 54 towns represented and 272 firemen \'\ registered, 34 of whom were chiefs. A fifty-cent registration fee was col- ¦ j lected. The cash receipts were $123, to which was added the balance from j j the regional schools of $20.70. The expense ran to $235.18, leaving a defi- \ cit of $81.38. | -.]' J. Burr Taylor, Western Actuarial Bureau, Chicago, served throughout ;i as chairman and discussion leader. Other who assisted from abroad and &lt; at the expense of their organizations were Walter Reed Gage, Arson In-- . vestigator of the National Board of Underwriters, Kansas City; R. D. • Mac Daniel, Grain Dealers Mutual Insurance Company, Indianapolis; ; Harry Layer, Lincoln, of the same company, Engineer Hale Baldwin of | the Nebraska Inspection Bureau, Omaha; J. E. Cryan, President Nebraska j Fire Prevention Association, Omaha; and R. B. Willard, state chemist, "&gt; Lincoln. Horace M. Davis, R. J. Van Fleet and Fay Wood constituted j the committee in general charge of program arrangements. j Upon registration each fireman was asked to write his preference for j the subjects he was most interested in having discussed. The favorite topic was for Fire Prevention and Inspection. Accordingly, arrangements i were made to "plant" an empty building, that had lately been abandoned I as a restaurant, with fire hazards. During afternoon sessions the firemen \ were divided into squads and while some were studying hose and ladder i </seg>
         <seg id="p011">DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION evolutions at the Grand Island drill tower, others were inspecting the building and discussing the hazards. The interest was so keen that an unprogratned evening was devoted to a discussion that led to local appli - cations of fire hazards in their own communities, the degree of danger and how best corrections might be made. Engineer Baldwin led a symposium of specifications for fire trucks for volunteer departments with special reference to utility for rural lire extinguishment. Mr. Mac Daniel outlined plans for inspection work and efficient fire prevention week activities. Mr. Gage discussed incendiarism and pointed out how volunteer firemen can be helpful in procuring evidence of arson in cases of fire of undetermined origin. Captain Ronnfeldt was in charge of training work at the tower. Chemist Willard graphically illustrated the various degrees of hazard in liquid fuels and showed that "hot" tractor fuel is as treacherous as gasoline and must be handled and 1 labeled accordingly. A theater was engaged for a first aid demonstration I by the Seward fire department. This program was considerably disturbed | by a Union Pacific railroad celebration that filled the city with a pleasure - &lt;¦ seeking crowd. Editor-fireman Ralph Cox of Arapahoe served as effi - | cient. secretary and made a running story of the meeting. It was hoped | the minutes might be printed for distribution but a deficit instead of a . profit .balance forbade. LaFrance Foamite Corporation furnished $50 ¦ worth of merchandise which was awarded as attendance prizes. i After the dinner at the closing evening, there was animated discussion 3 as to worthwhileness of the schools and the most practical course to pur - \ sue to afford the best training in fire'prevention and fire extinguishment j for "two-story" fireman. Upon motion it was agreed to follow the same ; program for 1940 with the same committee in charge of arrangements. ) The present plan is for six regional schools to be held at Norfolk, I Ainsworth, Alliance, McCook and Tecumseh, and a state-wide school at Grand Island in April, with the financial sponsorship of the League of Nebraska Municipalities. ; .'¦'!..'.-. . . ; |¦ . ; ."¦'¦¦¦ ¦-&#132;: "'¦.':'.¦'-'¦ .-'¦'' ' .)' ¦¦¦¦'. I As a result of fire, one farm building in this country is sacrificed every 1 fifteen minutes. This means that 96 expensive bonfires are built every 24 1 hours, 2,880 every month, 34,560 in the course of a year. A big percentage | of this waste of time, effort, property and natural resources, to say nothing j of precious human lives lost in fire, is absolutely preventable.

         <seg id="p012">STATE OF NEBRASKA j RURAL HOME INSPECTION BY SCHOOL j CHILDREN 1 i Conscious oi the increasing fire waste on the farms, the fire marshal's ! office selected two typical Nebraska counties to determine what the actual j' conditions as to fire prevention might be. Interest in the subject was i emphasized from the fact that rural electrical developments are presumed j to decrease fire hazards if the wiring is well done and passes inspection. I This work was carried on during annual Fire Prevention Week. Lack of funds and man power restricted activities to. two counties. In cooperation with county superintendents Mrs. Blanche Pfrehm, [ Howard county and Mrs. Lora Kieck of Cass county, a deputy i state fire marshal visited all the rural schools of these counties giving ;."j short talks to the pupils about fire hazards and distributing home inspec - tion blanks to each. The blanks were to be filled out by the pupils, with the help of their parents, and returned to the teacher. After using the data secured for a fire prevention lesson, the teacher sent the completed blanks to the county superintendent who in turn sent them to the state fire marshal's office for further study. The questionaires, or home inspection blanks, contained 22 questions on fire hazards about the house and outbuildings. Nearly all of the blanks were returned from Howard county and more than three-fourths of them from Cass county. In all, 1,142 blanks were filled out and returned to the state office. In the talks before the pupils, the common fire hazards around the ' j farm buildings were discussed, especially emphasizing the dangers in i careless handling of gasoline, kerosene and tractor fuel, the dangers in ; using kerosene or tractor fuel to start fires, cleaning clothes with gaso - line, keeping gasoline in other than red containers. J j Nearly one-half of the replies to the question, "Is keTOsene or tractor fuel used to start fires?" were in the affirmative. Reports in the office of state fire marshal show that between 30 and 40 people are burned to death each year in Nebraska by the careless handling of gasoline, kerosene and tractor fuel and more than 100 are seriously burned. | More than half of the replies to the question about water storage on the farms for fire fighting were in the affirmative. About one-third of the farmers in these counties have telephones with which to call a fire department. According to the reports, there are only 55 chemical fire extinguishers on the farms of these counties. There were 313 reporting lightning rods. </seg>
         <seg id="p013">DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION Nearly all of the farmers keep gasoline in red containers. There are a few exceptions. One pupil writes, "The cans are marked so we all know them." Mistaking gasoline for kerosene has caused many tragedies in Nebraska. ' • -;¦' Most of the reports show that the pupils are cognizant of the fire hazards about the farm when their atention is called to them. One pupil writes from Cass county, "We consider the pipe going through the ceil - ing our fire hazard. We are careful about letting the fire get out of con - trol. The collar around the pipe is lined with asbestos paper." Another writes in reply to the question on fire hazards about the home, "Lamps, stoves, no lightning rods, buildings have no fire [protection, no fire ex - tinguishers, no phone." Still another, "Since our house was, burned in November 1937, all fire hazards have been removed. The cause of the fire was the chimney." I . Blanks were also distributed in some of the schools of Butler county I and 158 were returned to this office. I ' ; "¦¦•. '¦¦¦:.;:' ¦ ¦¦';-.¦¦¦ ! . ¦• ' :!: .. : ; ¦". I PLANS FOR PUBLIC BUILDINGS APPROVED Upon invitation of local authorities, the fire marshal's office has cx - i amined 34 plans submitted by architects for new buildings designed for ! public occupancy—schools, theaters, hospitals, churches and auditoriums. ' There is no state law code in Nebraska and this office is deemed by ¦' WPA, PWA and other federal agencies as coming the nearest to having the best information as to modern building requirements, especially as to .: exits and seating facilities. The law does, however, emphatically place the |j responsibility for inspection, approval or disapproval, of all public buildings |j after they have been constructed. ;It may, therefore, be reasonable that if approval of plans may save expensive later alterations. 1 ' . ;..-V V :,- ¦ LOSSES FRpftl LIGHTNING ! As Reported by Fire Insurance Companies I The fire insurance companies reported heavy losses by lightning during 1 the months of June, July, August and September. There were 490. adjust - ] ments reported during the year amounting to $139,211. One hundred J twenty-three of them were in Douglas County with losses of $62,427. The I largest loss was on the stock yards at Va11ey—549,315.93. One hundred j thirty-nine lightning claims were reported to the office.as paid during the I month of October. V • : .; </seg>
         <seg id="p014">STATE OF NEBRASKA j SCHOOL HOUSE FIRES Of the thirteen school house fires during 1939, five were rural and nine were in cities and towns. The total value of the buildings involved was $425,900 with insurance of $267,400 and losses estimated at $50,029. Two of the rural schools were total losses of both buildings and contends. The largest losses were at the Doniphan public school with an estimated loss of $17,500, Concordia College at Seward, $16,000, and the gymnasium and auditorium of the Jackson high school, Lincoln, $9,700. These three fires all occurred at night so no lives of school children were endangered. Five of the fires were of unknown origin, one by spontaneous com - bustion, two from defective chimneys, two from sparks on roofs, one by overheated electric motor, one from a heated stove and one from a gasoline stove. I There was an actual loss to the school districts, not covered by in - surance, of $18,400. ANALYSIS OF RURAL FIRES Rural fire losses for 1939 are comparable to those of 1938. There were 510 rural fires reported by fire chiefs during 1939 with losses of $583,911, or an average of $1,145. There were total losses in 300 rural fires. During 1938, there were 459 rural fires reported with losses of $635,725, or an average loss of $1,385. Approximately 55 per cent of the value of the property involved was covered by insurance. Insurance companies reported 1,440 claims paid during 1939 amount - ing to $612,862. The average rural claim was $425. The apparent dis - crepancy between the reports from fire chiefs and insurance companies is due to the methods of reporting. The fire chiefs report only on fires with losses of more than $5 and regardless of insurance. The companies re - port only on fires where insurance is carried and every loss regardless of the size. i The first fire insurance company was started by Benjamin Franklin after he had jumped from a second story window of his home. In carrying kindling coals from one room to another, he had dropped some live embers on a rug. j The most immediate life and property hazard in Nebraska results from petroleum products. </seg>
         <seg id="p015">i DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION I CLEANUP CAMPAIGNS | At two periods of the year there are recognized programs for fire jj prevention. They are apt to be coincident with the annual spring and fall | house cleanings. : . ' . a Fire Prevention. Week occurs at a fixed date in October and made I public by proclamations by the President and each Governor. It is timely I for Nebraska because, in this climate, chilly evenings are beginning to I require starting of stoves and furnaces. ; I ¦¦-¦•..' Municipal fire departments are taking increased interest each year in I making inspections at this time and in carrying on educational programs I throughout the schools and civic bodies. They are also becoming interested I in spring Cleanup Week, which is not at any fixed time but depends upon I weather conditions. • a Literature and suggestions for programs are available through the I Fire Marshal's office, or the National Fire Protection Association, Boston. I The Nebraska Fire Prevention Association, Brandeis Theater Building, sj Omaha, is prepledged to be helpful in furnishing speakers to fire depart - | ments and civic organizations on Fire Prevention Week or- at any time | during the year. ..¦'':¦¦¦'.'¦ ; RURAL FIRE PROTECTION j . .¦ ¦,¦'&lt;¦. * ¦. .¦'•¦¦' '¦¦.¦¦ \ At the Fremont convention of the Nebraska Volunteer Firemen's I Association, resolutions were passed calling upon the next legislature to i enact legislation for two purposes: .".'; * 1. To require all electrical wiring to be in accordance with the National Electrical Code. 2. To amend an inadequate law for.the organization of rural fire protection districts. . I : '-':: t \ Despite the fact that a comparatively small j percentage of the Ne - braska municipalities recognize the National Electrical Code by ordinance, and that there is no statute setting up a safety standard for electrical wiring throughout the state; the unicameral legislature of 1939 did not see fit to pass such a law. ¦ ¦ ".'. But the law for rural fire protection districts was unanimously passed. I It has had the widest public acceptance of any legislation enacted on be- I half of fire prevention and protection in two decades. The first, district to I : organize thereunder was the Tri-county district with headquarters at I Wausa. Probably there are twenty or more such districts in various de - | grees of progress. ¦ </seg>

RURAL ELECTRICAL INSPECTIONS BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FIRE PREVENTION The Rural Electrical Inspection Bureau has had its second year as auxiliary service of the Department of Fire Prevention. This bureau's primary function is to inspect electrically wired farmsteads on the REA power lines. This service was set up in November 1937 at the request of the power districts in operation at that time. Since then every new dis - trict that has been organized has requested this inspection service to better the type of electrical construction. The inspection bureau is self-supporting and operates solely on a fee basis. During the past year there were 2,320 original inspections and 365 re-inspections on farmsteads that were either wired foV the first time or converted from farm lighting plants to 115-230 volt service. The fees col - lected for these inspections are $3.50 for each original inspection and $1.00 for the re-inspections required. The inspectors receive $2.50 for the first inspection and the $1.00 for re-inspection. One dollar goes to the office for supervision, office expense and equipment. i - During the past year sixteen training schools were held to instruct wiremen and prospective wiremen on the fundamental principles as set up by the National Electrical Code. These schools were usually three-day sessions and acquainted the wiremen with the requirements necessary to pass inspection by this office. Chas. M. Horham, Chief Inspector, has full charge of these schools, which are made possible through the cooperation of the Vocational Education Department. It is gratifying to note that, after these schools are held, the electrical installations are considerably improved and fewer rechecks are needed before clearances are issued. During 1938-39, the inspection work was carried on in 19 districts which include 30 different counties of the state. The following table shows the number and type of inspections made in the different rural public power districts for the two years the inspection bureau has been in operation. </seg>
