            <seg id="p003">OFFICE OF STATE LIBRARIAN, Lincoln, Neb., Dec. 20, 1910. To the Honorable ASHTON C. SHALLENBERGER, Governor of Nebraska: required by law, I herewith submit my report for e biennium ending December 1, 1910. On November 30, 1908, the number of regularly acces - sioned volumes in the library was 58,173, which did not include 22,443 volumes of Nebraska Supreme Court reports then in my hands for distribution and sale, nor the thou - sands of volumes of House and Senate Journals, Session Laws, and reports of the State's administrative and execu - tive officers which were on hand. 1 During the last biennium the library has received by urchase 1,603 volumes and by donation and exchange ,572 volumes, making a total of 4,175 volumes added dur - ig the two years. The number of recorded volumes in the brarv is now 62,348. By the publication of volumes 77 to 86 of the Supreme Court reports during the biennium the number of such re - ports on hand has been increased to 2."),()94. I refer at length to this increase in the number of vol - umes in order to emphasize the necessity for some imme - date action on the part of the legislature to provide addi - tional quarters for the library. Its growth is sure to be as rapid in the future as it has been in the past. For the last two years we have been obliged to resort to all sorts of devices to provide shelf room for the books as they are received, and now find ourselves confronted with the necess - ity of taking out half of our reading tables in order to pro- Cde the needed space, and this will be but a temporary ake-shift. LThis overcrowded condition has already brought about sarrangement of the volumes on the shelves, with its « </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 REPORT OF THE attendant confusion, which, as it increases, will become more and more intolerable. , The Capitol building in which this splendid library is housed is admittedly a "fire trap" from basement to dome. Its destruction by fire and the loss of the library would be a most serious calamity, not only because of its money value, but because it would take years to replace many of the rare volumes it now contains. Phen the Legislature meets this winter it will find the ig crowded to its fullest capacity, regular boards and ments without quarters, and no committee rooms for :s own use. The situation should be met by it and handled for the best interests of the State — not ignored or passed on to a succeeding Legislature because of a desire to make a record for economy. Four years ago the Legislature made an appropriation of $25,000 to the Nebraska His - torical Society for the purpose of constructing a foundation for a new. building for its use, coupled with the provision that the society should procure an approved site. The site, a half-block lying immediately east of the Capitol grounds and admirably suited for the purpose, was procured and the foundation partially completed. The plans and specifi - cations for the proposed historical building might easily be modified so as to provide ample room for the State Library, Supreme Court, Travelling Library Commission, Attorney General, and Historical Society, and I understand that such an arrangement would be satisfactory to the Historical Society. The rooms now used by the Supreme Court and Library on the second and third floors of the Capitol build - ing would accommodate the needs of the Legislature and other State officers for some years to come. The neighboring States of Colorado, Kansas, Iowa, Illinois, Wisconsin and Minnesota have appreciated the real economy of caring for their property and have provided safe, commodious quarters for their libraries. Nebraska is free from debt. Her people are prosperous. She has a magnificent library in poorly lighted, poorly ventilated, cramped, unsafe rooms. S trust that your Excellency may in your message to egislature direct its attention to this matter and make recommendation as the conditions demand. h Attached to this report is a statement of the condition le Library and Supreme Court funds, a detailed state- </seg>
