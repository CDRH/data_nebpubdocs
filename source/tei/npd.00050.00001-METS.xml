            <seg id="p007">3 DEPARTMENT OF TRADE AND COMMERCE BUREAU OF BANKING Lincoln, December 31. 1920. Hon. S. R McKelvie, Governor, Sir: Herewith we submit for your information summaries and individual reports of the One Thousand and Nine State Banks under the supervision of this Department as of November 13, 1920, and comparisons with the biennial report issued December 31, 1918. During the biennium just passed, ninety-five new charters were granted, a list of which is herewith shown. Of these charters forty - eight were issued prior to April 4, 1919, when your approval was given to the bill withholding the protection of the Guaranty Law to new banks for a period of two years, and forty-seven were granted since that date. During 1920 up to November 13, only twelve new charters were granted. During the biennium, two banks were liquidated, eight consolidated with other banks, and four failed up to the date of this report. Since the date of this report and up to the end of the year, two banks have failed, no figures for these being available. • The two banks liquidating paid to the State Treasurer for the Guar - anty Fund Reserve $1,224.87. This Department is holding $4,199.66, contributed by liquidated banks for which no provision is made for either distribution or application. Some disposition of this should be pro - vided for. The Guaranty Fund of consolidating banks follows the con - solidation and is set up in the succeeding bank for the protection of the consolidated deposit. Drafts have been drawn against the Depositors Guaranty Fund to pay the deposits in full in four instances as shown in the accompanying schedule, aggregating $737,639.16. In the Verdon failure, it seems possible at this date that a draft may be averted. At Ceresco no re - ceiver has been appointed at this time. Legislation is desired to prevent the further organization of small banks, to curb speculation, to dismiss the reckless, incompetent banker, and give weight to the criticisms and recommendations of the examiners and the Department. A bank failure in a community is a calamity, mad when it is the result of criminal acts of the officers, no efforts should be spared to bring the offenders to justice. When a guilty officer is over - taken the keenest lawyers at the Bar are retained and every device of </seg>
            <seg id="p008">TWENTY-EIGHTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE 4 the profession is employed to delay, obstruct and defeat justice, and the executive officers of State Government get the blame. In conclusion permit me to express my appreciation of the confi - dence and consideration shown to the Department at all times and under all circumstances by your Excellency and the valuable advice and assis - tance of the Attorney General's office. Whatever success or efficiency has been attained, is in a measure due to the loyalty, energy and ef - ficiency of the examiners and the Department assistants. The most cordial relations have existed and not a single instance of removal has occurred. Very respectfully submitted, J. E. HART, Secretary, Department of Trade and Commerce. </seg>
