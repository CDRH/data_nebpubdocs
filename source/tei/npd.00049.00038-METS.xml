            <seg id="p001">1 CO-OPERATIVE CONCERNS INTRODUCTION In order that data might be secured concerning the opera - tion of co-operative concerns, a mailing list was made up of all concerns in Nebraska operating in 1919 and appearing to l&gt;e co-operative ill motive. Over six hundred questionnaires were then sent to the various managers. These questionnaires requested certain information concerning the business for the year of 1!&gt;1!&gt;. Some of the managers immediately responded, while to others it was necessary to send a second and even a third notice. As the replies were received from all parts of the state the general information is typical of Nebraska as a whole and altho different classes are affected by different conditions, vary - ing with locality, it is felt that the general averages reflect average conditions. Tabulation was not begun until five hun - dred questionnaires had been received which appeared to be fairly complete in the information given. It was later found necessary to discard six of these. In this bulletin we are offer - ing the results obtained together with such explanations an4 comparisons as may be deemed necessary. The summary, which is Table 7. will acquaint the reader with the general idea. Tho first six tables show the tabulation of the results of dividing and sub-dividing into groups according to the end to be attained. </seg>
            <seg id="p002">2 It is noted that this division is first made on a basis of commodity handled and the latter sub-divisions are made under the head of patronage or stock dividend concerns. Truly co-operative organizations should all come into the patronage dividend class as that is the spirit of co-operative ideas and laws. This list was made up of farmers' associations which were supposedly co-operative and the name appeared to indicate co-operation. But in some cases where the name gave every indication of its being co-operative it was found to be in the non-patronage class where in other cases the opposite was true. All non-patronage concerns could have been dis - carded and only the patronage used, but it was thought best to use them and present the results of the tabulation. It will be noted, however, that the four lumber yards are not tabu - lated further than the first classification as thev were all non- patronage and under these circumstances could not be of com - parative value. The four miscellaneous concerns were also omitted from further tabulation as they were primarily organi - zation companies. As the stock yards organization had a capital of only $200.00 it would not have been proportionate to the rest and therefore was omitted. This left 485 of which 111 were classified as non-patronage and 374 as patronage concerns. DEFINITION OF TERMS The terms used in this article are defined below in order that there may be no confusion in ideas. Patronage — By this is meant the patronage dividend. This is a dividend declared on the basis of the goods bought by a stock-holding customer in case of a store or the like or on the basis of goods sold by the stock-holding customer in case of elevator or the like. </seg>
            <seg id="p003">3 Xox-Patroxaok — This refers to a business which apportions its dividends only on the basis of the number of shares held bv the stockholder. Capital — The capital stock of the concern representing the total money invested. Credit— -The total average credit of the concern. It is the average amount borrowed for the year and represents the additional capital needed to run the business. Vou'ME — Volume refers to the total amount of business or total turn over of stock in terms of dollars. Ratio — Ratio of volume to capital: the volume expressed as a multiple of capital and secured by dividing the average capital into the average volume. METHOD OF TABULATION As commodity handled has a large influence on volume of business, capital, and average credit, the division was first made on this basis. Table 1 gives the manner of classification. As there is no sharply drawn line in kinds of commodities handled by co-operative concerns there may be minor cases of overlapping. By studying this page it is shown that of the TiOO replies there were -&gt;."&gt;0 concerns which could l&gt;e classed as elevators, because grain was the principal commodity handled. The number opposite each of tlu&gt; eleven main classifications gives the total number while the number in each subdivision is written opposite its proper name. For example, grain alone is handled by 4&lt;&gt; elevators while '-» handle grain and farm supplies. These concerns were thus classified as it was apparent that the supplies were not of the nature of general merchandise and did not require an extra building. They were therefore classed as Elevators, rather than Elevator and Store. After classifying the concerns they were subdivided according to the distribution of profit and were classed as patronage or non - patronage as previously defined. This subdivision was made to determine the number distributing profits on a patronage basis </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 and also the effect of a possible patronage dividend upon the volume of business transacted as compared with the volume of business in case no patronage dividend was anticipated by the customer. This comparison was carried further and the ratio of volume to capital plus credit was found as well as the ratio of volume to capital alone, since the capital plus the average wedit justly represents the actual capital involved in securing 1 the volume of business. The results of this division are shown in Table -2. For example, there are 187 elevators declaring a patronage dividend. These have an average capital of $12,972.00, and an average credit of $9,716.00. The ratio of their average volume of busi - ness to average capital is 16.5 and the average volume is 9.4 times the capital plus average credit. As previously classified, elevators were subdivided into eight classes according to com - modity handled. For each of these classes has been found the total number, average capital, average credit and ratio of volume to capital according to the plan followed in the main divisions. This shows the minor difference in capital required and ratio of volume to capital when different side lines are handled by elevators. Tables ?&gt; and 4 show the figures derived from a sub division on the basis of capital. Table 3 deals with organiza - tions which declare a patronage dividend and Table 4 deals with non-patronage concerns. Under these headings were con - sidered the concerns as previously classified according to com - modity handled. They were further divided into four groups as follows: $5,000.00 and under. $5,000.00 to $10,000.00. $10,000.00 to $15,000.00 and $15,000.00 and up. Under the first grouping were placed all having a capital of $5,000.00 or less. The total numl)er in the group, the average capital and the ratio of volume to capital was thus secured. This was done to find the point in capital where the largest turn over of volume was secured per dollar of capital, under the various conditions. In Tables 5 and f&gt; a subdivision was made to find the ratio of volume to the sum of capital and average credit. By this method it was shown that concerns which had a large volume of business in proportion to capital were securing this volume mainly through the use of borrowed capital. </seg>

            <seg id="p007">7 RESULTS OF TABULATION In the tabulation to determine effect of patronage dividend upon volume of business it was found that the average volume of (53 non -patronage elevators was $80(&gt;,(&gt;80.00 while the average volume for 1ST patronage concerns was $"212, 721. 00. Hut the capital in the first case was $18,055.00 while in the second case it was $12,972.00. Although the volume of business in one instance was about 50 per cent larger than in the other, the same was true of the capital. In Table 2 it is shown that in the case of elevators the ratio of volume to capital is practically, the same whether or not a patronage dividend is declared. This seemed also to apply when capital plus credit was con - sidered as capital, as the ratio in one case was J).4 while in the other it was '.)." which is approximately the same. Tt is interest - ing to note the varying ratios in the classes of business con - sidered under elevators and the causes for this variation. In grain and live stock in which the co-operator is selling mainly., note that non-patronage volume is really higher in ratio than with patronage concerns. Hut when buying enters in. as in machinery, the ratio is in favor of the patronage dividend business. : , There were S5 stores of which &lt;&gt;5 paid a patronage divi - dend and 20 did not: it will be noticed in this tabulation, given on the same page that the ratio of volume to capital is 7.1 to 1. The ratio of the volume to capital plus credit is 4.i&gt; to 1. These are the ratios in the class of stores paying patronage dividends as compared with 5.7 to 1 and 3.7 to 1 in case no patronage dividend was paid. It would appear tb indicate that the patronage dividends have an effect on volume when the patronage is of a buying nature. This is true because in most instances the current market price is charged and the </seg>

            <seg id="p010">10 customer feels that;, ;iir patronizing bis co-operative organiza - tion, he will later receive in form of a dividend some of the money spent. In considering this data from the standpoint of efficiency we notice under capital division of elevators con - ducted on a patronage basis the following results: lf&gt; have an average capital under $5,000.00; 73 have a capital between $5,000.00 and $10,000.00: while 59 are capitalized at $10,000.00 to $15,000.00, and 40 over $15,000.00, Judging from numbers alone this would seem to indicate that the most efficient capital was between $5,000.00 and $10,000.00. This seems also to be true with the non-patronage elevators. But when the capital plus average credit is considered (Table 5) the larger number fall into the group of those having more than $15,000.00. there being 117 in this class. This would mean that the average working capital is considerably higher than indicated by the capital division. Since elevators appear to need more capital than represented by the capital stock it would seem advisable for them to increase their capital stock and thus to decrease the amount they are compelled to borrow. Considered from a standpoint of ratio the capital under $5,000.00. in both patronage and non-patronage divisions, shows the largest volume of business in proportion to capital invested. This is true also in the division of capital plus credit. With capital of $5,000.00 or under a ratio of 20 produces only a volume of $100,000.00. A salary and small incidental expense in running an elevator easily amounts to $2,000.00. which is 2 per cent of $100,000.00. Thus it is seen that even though the ratio is large the volume represented is not proportionately large and a profit of 2 per cent on volume of business is easily overcome by the salary alone. Therefore, actually the ratio under the $5,000.00 to $10,000.00 capital is larger than the ratio under the $5,000.00 capital. In comparison with the ratio </seg>
            <seg id="p011">11 of 10.7 under capital of $12,184.00 the same is true. With the ratio of 10.(5 we find a volume of about $175,000.00, as com - pared with a volume of about $91,000.00, over the $100,000.00 allowed for expense. Eight per cent of the $15,000.00 addi - tional capital means $1,200.00 or a 1.2 per cent on $100,000.00 volume. This interest will of course take up much of the difference in profit due to the larger volume of business. Hut on the other hand those having a capital of $10,000.00 to $15,000.00 must necessarily borrow and actually did borrow as is shown by the fact that 40 elevators have a capital of $15,000.00 and up. making an average of $27,455.00, while ."&gt;;&gt; have from $5,000.00 to $10,000.00. As compared with this, under the capital and credit division, in Table ."&gt;. are 117 elevators. This shows that although the stock may be small the actual average capital used is over $15,000.00 in most cases. Iii the tabulation of stores it is found that the larger number have capital over $15,000.00 which is clearly proven to be the most efficient capitalization for. though capital under $5,000.00 has twice a.s large ratio, the volume is so small that the expense, more than takes the profit. And the capital and credit divi - sion shows that a capital much larger than $30,000.00 does not return the volume in proportion to the increased expense. </seg>

            <seg id="p014">14 CONCLUSIONS 1. The largest number of co-operative organizations are elevators. 2. The addition of machinery or lumber to the com - modity handled materially increases the investment required. 3. The average capital of patronage elevators is $12,072.00 with an average credit of $9,710.00. Those paying only a stock dividend show an average capital and credit 50 per cent larger and they have a correspondingly larger volume of busi - ness. Apparently an increase in capital for patronage eleva - tors of 50 per cent would show a corresponding increase in volume of business providing the managerial ability was the same as that required by elevators organized on the stock basis. The above is borne out in latter grouping by capital and capital plus credit. 4. The patronage dividend influences volume of business. wherever the patron is buying. When selling grain only, he apparently goes where present cash receipts are larger. 5. The largest ratio of volume to capital does not indicate the most profitable business until after expenses are deducted, neither does the smallest ratio indicate the least profitable busi - ness if the capital is large, for in this case the volume would be correspondingly large. If the capital be small, a small ratio may indicate a profit providing the business is one which handles a commodity upon which a fairly large per cent of profit is made. 6. In many cases a volume of business is apparently large when capital alone is considered. When capital plus credit is considered it is found that the business is obtained largely from the use of borrowed capital. While it would be unbusiness- </seg>

Ill proportion to paid-up capital the amount of capital borrowed by many companies is too large for conservative co - operative business. The state law limits the amount borrowed by any corporation to two- thirds the amount of capital stock. This seems to be sufficient for safe business without directors borrowing more upon their personal responsibility. 8. Those handling merchandise can well afford to increase capital to the capital plus average credit since the credit demand is much more constant than is true with elevators. !).
