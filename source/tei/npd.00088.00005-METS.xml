         <seg id="p005">STATE TREASURER 5 GENERAL STATEMENT Pursuant to the requirements of the Constitution and the laws of the State of Nebraska, I herewith submit my biennial report of the State Treasury for the bieriium ending June 30, 1940. The Honorable T. W. Bass was elected State Treasurer in 1&amp;38, taking charge of the office in January, 1939. He served as State Treasurer until August 21, 1939 when he died rather suddenly. On the 26th day of August, 1940, 1 was appointed by the Governor to fill the vacancy, caused by the death of Mr. Bass, the State Treasurer. This makes it incumbent upon me to covey that povtion of the bienniura served by my predecessor as Well as that which was covered by myself. 'At the beginning of the bienmum there was a total balance in tine several funds of the treasury in the amount of $21,621,930.68 of which 5893,372.92 were Federal Funds and $20,728,557.76 were State Funds. At the close of the biennium there is left a total balance in the several funds of the treasury in the amount of $20,878,lll;53; of which $783,435.49 are Federal Funds and $20,094,676.04 are State Funds. This shows a decrease of Federal funds in the amount of §109,937.43 and a corresponding decrease in State funds of $633,881.72.; . . . During this biennium there Was disbursed from the General Fund §12,428,417.71; whereas during the previous biennium there was §11,737, - -035.40 disbursed from the General fund. This shows an increase in General fund disbursements of approximately §691,382.37. 'OVER-DRAFT REDEEMED" • At the beginning of the biennium there was an "over-draft" in the General fund of $427,453.41. At the close of the biennium this over-draft Was completely redeemed. . This was accomplished due to the increased tax receipts, and not by any new forms of taxation which so many other states have felt imperative to adopt.. /¦ . . ' . These increased tax receipts were due in no small part to the many Federal funds which were expended in this state. The Parity, Soil Con - servation, Wheat and Corn loans to the farmers, the W.P.A., P.W.A., Old Age Assistance and the many, many other Government agencies which contributed so much to the social and economic well-being of our state, especially in these times of economic adversity and drought. These extra Government aids made the tax load much lighter and as a result the State deficit was completely wiped out during this biennium. </seg>
         <seg id="p006">REPORT OF 6 It should, therefore, be a matter of great pride to all Nebraskans, that the State's financial affairs are in such excellent condition, and ihnse responsible for this satisfactory condition are entitled to the com - mendation of the tax-payers of the State. 'STATE TREASURER - AUDITS" Under the direction of the State Auditor of Public Accounts, three &lt;:• inplete audits have been made of this office. Each of these audits have shown all monies paid into the treasury have been properly accounted for, and, all bank deposits are adequately secured by the necessary col - lateral. I personally believe the Slate Auditor's office has neither the time nor sufficient personnel necessary to make these semi-annual audits. Furth - innre, 1 feel that these semi-annual audits should be made by an indepen - dent Auditing Company, with the approval of the Governor, legislature in the Slate Auditor. Past experiences have shown that such audits are absolutely necessary and 1 feel that such audits should be fair, impartial, nun-partisan and unbiased. Audits should be made without fear or favor in order that the State Treasurer's records may be complete and an honest analysis of every penny of the tax-payers monies. The legislature should therefore provide for future audits not only of the State Treasury, but also for all the departments and offices in which s!ale funds are received and handled. TREASURY EMPLOYEES - BONDED At the present time all employees of the State Treasurer are bonded. Inasmuch ns these employees receive only nominal salaries, I feel the laws should be so amended, "'to pay the premium on these bonds in the same manner in which the bonds of the State Treasurer and Deputy State Treas - urer ;ire provided for." Further safe-guards were established, in that the Sheriff's office pro - vided us with "police protection" in making our daily deposits; and I wish In personally express my appreciation to the Sheriff, Mr. George Lang and to his deputies, Mr. Clark and Mr. Brosnihan in providing us with this splendid service. They are to be commended for their efforts in behalf of protecting state funds in time of transit to and from the various de - positories. </seg>
         <seg id="p007">STATE TREASURER 7 It is with considerable pride that I present this biennial report of the Treasury department, and I want to express my sincere thanks for the friendly cooperative spirit of Honorable Governor R.
