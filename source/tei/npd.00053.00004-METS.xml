            <seg id="p013">13 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I PRESIDENTS ADDRESS State Board of Agriculture: Gentlemen : In a generalization of your Board's actions covering the year 1921, I wish to be as brief as possible, as you will be made acquainted with their activities through another source. With conditions normal, it is no slight task to stage a Fair that is successful financially and at the same time one that meets the ap - proval of the exhibitors and patrons in general. The economic condi - tions of the country the past year were even worse than the preced - ing year; with these conditions prevailing, the Board made effort to steer a course that would not work a hardship on any division of the Fair, and in the meunwhilc leave the organization on the right side of the ledger at the end of the year. For the three years preceding, our patrons were given high-class free attractions at a cost far in excess of that expended by any other Fair in the Union. Precedents are dangerous, unless we keep adding and improving; we had set a high standard and could not afford lower it, but conditions demanded a severe cut in the cost of con- ducting: the Fair. In reducing the cost of staging the Fair, it wu reasonable to expect that the Board would reduce the price of tickets to a pre-war level. I can assure you that of the many serious things that tasked their best energies, this subject held a leading position. Their better judgment prevented them giving way to their personal desires, and with the other State Fairs, they left the price of entrance the same as last year. I feel that the financial statement to be submit - ted to you will justify their actions. I recommend that the incoming Board govern themselves in such a manner that a reduction can be made this year. With no reduction made in premiums, there was a generous response in all lines of exhibits. The wonderful exhibits of Agriculture in past years were excelled both in volume and in quality in 1921. Nature opened wide the portals of her bounty, and added an extra incentive to the splendid men who filled this hall to capacity. There comes a time in building up a great Agricultural Exhibit, when quantity or number tend to reduce the value and effect of the object sought in the minds of the builders; this point was nearly reached in the swine department in the years 1919 and 1920. The year 1921, with a lesser number, comfortably filled the barn with animals carrying more show value than ever before. I feel that exhibitors have grasped the thought that quality and not quantity should receive their first consider - ation. With financial conditions in the cattle industry at the lowest ebb </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 BPPllPT At 1 VTJIBiSL A aTlTC n. . . n i , ,. . ..j.. ,.,, Tf 'DL* In its history, there was an increase in number on exhibition; but a pleas - ing feature was the uniformity in classes while in the show ring. If not so many outstanding, more to exact from the judge the closest exami - nation. These exhibitors, under trying circumstances, showed the faith that is in them, and should receive our warmest commendation. Briefly, "onward" was the word in every department on the grounds; "deterioration" is a word unknown to splendid men and women, to the boys and girls who make possible the pride you hold for the achievements attained. In building up a respectable hcme wherein to house the annual ex - hibits of farm and factory, we were compelled to travel the long road. Looking back over that road I am moved to pay homage to the State Fair men who traveled it. The average man will never know the ob - stacles they overcame; the prejudice they were compelled to allay to attain the end they had in view. The necessity for most of the State Institutions sprung from the larger cities of the State; even the Itata University received its greatest patronage from this source. While ihe farm communities were not so directly interested in these institutions. their representatives in the Legislature, as a usual thing, gave them more consideration than they gave to the organization that should be of a vital interest to them. Happily, conditions have gradually changed and you can go before the Legislature in the future, assured of the sam. treatment riven t;i the other wants of the State The concession department of the Fair presents more new for the management to solve than any other department. As &lt; they seemed to have attached themselves to F'airs, running ha without end. There has been a tendency in late years to cont within stricter bounds, until today we are confronted with the as to whether or not paid concessions, other than those nect the patron's wants, should find a place at a State Fair. It may be, that in some obscure corner, "Far from the m crowd," a carnival company could introduce the only jolts whi&lt; make the patrons feel that they were still connected with th&lt; world; but, with their cheap shows, and a crowd of hangers-or ways on the alert to turn a crooked trick on the unwary. I feel that they ar out of place at a State Fair. There are many healthy, wholesome amusements to take their plac» Your Board is, and has been giving this serious thought, and at no lat date a subtitute will be found, satisfactory to the people. Games of chance have been eliminated, but these so-called games of skill were still with us last year at the beginning of the Fair. After a thorough investigation of these games, the Board was satisfied that the public did not have one chance in a thousand, and closed them up tight. As this took a gTeat deal of time and trouble, I recommend that </seg>
            <seg id="p015">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTUH 15 in the future the work of elimination take place previous to the opening of the Fair. The personal element which is a vital part of our organization, is l'i ought to oar attention by the death of three former members of the State Board of Agriculture, since the last annual meeting, C. H. Rudge, Peter Yoingers and J. H. Taylor. / Mr. Taylor was a member from Douglas, and left the Board when he removed to Saunders County. He was an enthusiastic Fair man, and gave to this organization the best that was in him. To all men here assembled, the names of Rudge and Youngers are well remembered, for they have written them large across the face of the State Board of Agriculture. Work and loyalty were the outstanding elements in their nature and no - where better shown than in their work on this Board. The best eulogy that can be given them, is to call on them to repeat their last official - words to their fellow-members — Mr. Rudjre — "I want to say that in effacing myself from the manage - ment of the State Fair I am missing one of the most enjoyable busi- t-ss connections I think I have ever had, and I know that you have se - cted men today who will fulfill the duties that are imposed upon the Board of Managers to your entire satisfaction, and perhaps a little bet - ter than the old Board, as they are in close touch with what is going on. We who are retiring are still in close touch with the Fair inter - t&gt;ts and if any time we are called upon to assist in any way, whether a* gate-keepers or ticket sellers, or any other position on the Fair grounds, Mr. Youngers or myself will be only too glad to help out. I think I made a mistake yesterday in being a little weak in allowing you to fleet me as a member of the Board as I feel a man who accepts a duty of this kind should be in a position to give it his undivided atten- tion and be on the ground when there is work to be done. It is a hard thing for me to accept a position and not be Johnny on the Spot." Mr. Youngers — "In leaving this Board of Managers I am leaving a place I really enjoy. It was a pleasure to work with such men as con* stituted that Board. During the fourteen years I have been with them it has been a pleasure to me and I say, as Mr. Rudge has said, I shall be glad to be of service to the Board in any way. I used to think it was an honor to go around and watch the holes in the fences when I was first put on the Board of Agriculture. It does not matter what position a man has if he does the best he can, he should enter into the spirit in which it is tendered and if you want to make a success of it, let everyone take off his coat. It makes no difference whether he is a member of the Board of Managers or not, it is his duty to push on all occasions." 1 am grieved to announce, since preparing: this address, the death of another member of this Board, G. E. Hall of Waterloo, Nebraska. He was an earnest worker in the interests of the Association, and by </seg>
            <seg id="p016">16 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Ilia kind consideration and affable manner had endeared himself to all with whom he came in contact. Your representatives attended the annual meeting of the National Association, and beg to report a very interesting, and instructive meet - ing. Most every phase of the Fair business was, more or less, in - telligently discussed, but the outstanding features of the meeting was your Secretary's presentation of his understanding of the swine fu - turities as mapped out, and saddled on the Fair last year; and the ladies remarks covering their method of handling the Women's and Chil - dren's department at some of the Fairs. These women had their subject -well in hand, and gave some very useful information from an educational and exhibitor's standpoint. It would be well to get into the hands of County Fair Secretaries the plan these women use in exploiting this fea - ture of the Fair. In outlining his understanding of the swine futurities, your secre - tary took a decided stand for independent action by the Fair management in determining the amount of premiums to be paid by the association; while his marks met with the veiled opposition of the breed-secretaries •who were present, they elicited favorable comment from most of the Fair men. I recommend a full discussion of the subject at this meeting. In the annual statement of last year I brought to your attention the loss of the old cattle barn, and the method adopted by the business men of Lincoln to finance the building of the present one. This $150,000 was placed at the Board's disposal, without any legal obligations what - ever on the Board's part to reimburse the donors; but we did obli^at^ ourselves to use our best efforts to have the Legislature appropriate an amount necessary to cover the cost of this building. The legislature "is- tified our expectations, and we received an amount sufficient to cover prin - cipal and interest. In addition to the above, the Legislature appropri - ated $22,500 to be used in laying permanent streets, side-walks, curbing and like needs. Most of this appropriation was expended as follows; paving and a retaining wall and sidf walk on Humphrey Avenue from Ollis Avenue to Dunham. Paving, curbing and parking of Morton Av - enue from the street car entrance to Dunham Avenue. The condition of the seats in the Auditorium was such that it became necessary to replace them. The Board decided that a concrete floor for the seats to rest on would vastly increase the accomodations to our patrons, and be cheaper in the end. The cost of this impromement was taken out of the appropria - tion. From the balance remaining in this fund the Board decided to fill in, and bring the grounds of the women and children's building to grade. This work has been going on since the late Fair. No other improvements of a permanent nature were made on the grounds, but the cost of re - pairs and upkeep is considerable owing to the condition of the old build- While the needs for more permanent buildings are imperative, I feel </seg>
            <seg id="p017">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 17 that the late Legislature was very considerate toward us and we should be thankful for the favors received. It is well at this time, to mention another appropriation made by the Legislature to the State Board of Agriculture for the purpose of distribution. In the past separate appropriations were made direct to various organizations for promotion purposes. At the time the ap - propriation was under discussion, your Board objected to being made cus - todian and distributor of this fund, but the Legislature willed other - wise, and without any reservation whatever, made it the duty of the State Board of Agriculture to distribute this appropriation where it will do the most good in promoting agriculture. While your Directors have adopted a plan of action, this is subject to your pleasure, and should receive a thorough discussion at this meeting. While discussing the needs of the State Fair, and providing for its wants, this meeting should not overlook the fact that the State Board of Agriculture covers a broader field, and should be jealous of its perog - atives. This representative body of men should not adjourn before bringing before the public your views of the conditions and needs of Agri - culture in general. Because of the fact that the influence you exert ii of a mural nature, is no reason why you should neglect the larger duties of this Board. In bringing this to your attention, might I expect some definite action on your part. I could not close without tendering to every man connected with this organization my sincere appreciation for the kindly help, and co - operation he has given me in the last two years. The splendid unity you men have shown in the work at hand, has lightened the labors of one whose only recon-.mendation is "Loyalty to a cause." The following persons were nominated to fill the vacancies on this Board for the coming year: First District— W. B. Banning, W. T. Parkinson, P. L. Hall. Second District — Jacob Sass, Albert H. Miller, Peter M. Tyson. Third District — R. Widdle, Joseph Roberts, R. M. Wolcott. Fourth District — Con McCarthy, Perry Reed, O. R. Jones, John D. Hasik. Fifth District— H. J. McLaughlin, T. B. Keedle. Sixth District — O. G. Smith, Emerson R. Purcell, F. F. Everetts. A telegram was presented from Mr. Tyson nominating T. J. Jensen in the second district, but the president ruled that nominations could not be made by telegram.

It has enabled me to broaden out until now I am looking after the raising </seg>

MR. WOODMAN — I rise to put in nomination a man from Scotts Bluff County, a county with two hundred and fifty thousand acres all in cultivation, a county that has a hundred and fifty thousand acres more soon to be placed under irrigation, a county that values water pretty hig-h, much higher than probably some of you people who come from other parts of the state, even under the prohibition rule we value it; a county which has not had any representative on this board whatever, Mr. F. F. Everetts, a man who has had twenty-five years of actual soil work as agriculturist and irrigator, a man who at the present time is president of the State Irrigation Association and a man who has valuable business en- terprise and is an all-around neighbor. SECRETARY'S REPORT In summing up the year of 1921 we can again declare to the world that the farmers of our great state — with the assistance of the elements and the wonderfully fertile soil contained within our borders — have pro - duced an over abundance of food products. In normal times this would mean an untold amount of wealth to our state, through its individual citi - zenship. Unfortunately, we cannot call the present times normal. In- stead of finding our financial institutions carrying surplus deposits, wt find them almost depleted, and credit a thing of the past. This condition just reverses our economic problems as they have ex - isted for a period of years just passed, and calls for the most serious con - sideration — not alone by those engaged in the occupation of producing our food products, but to those engaged in commercial activities as well. It is a well established fact that many men in other industries thought their business would thrive and prosper regardless of whether our agri - cultural industry flourished or not. The present situation is exemplifying to them that they have been laboring under a misapprehension. We now find them, as individuals and organizations, willing to assist in obtain - ing better prices for our food products, that the farmer may be endowed with a greater buying power, and thereby stimulate business activity. The war, for a time, interrupted the normal trend of our agriculture. The stimulus of higher prices and, more than that, the urge of patriotic impulse resulted in largely increased production. With the coming of peace and the inevitable period of reconstruction, the unusual foreign demand for our agricultural products subsided. Ev- </seg>
            <seg id="p019">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOAKI) OF AGRICULTURE 19 erything was thrown open and those countries that had a large surplus of these products on hand were enabled to put them on the open market. Thus fur a year and a half now, our agriculture has been undergoing a very serious depression, due to the production of more foodstuffs than we can use ourselves and more than we can sell at a price that will give the producer a profit for his labor and investment. It is a well established fact that present prices for farm products are below the actual cost of production, very much below comparitively those which prevailed during the five pre-war years. This is just one way of saying that the wages of the farmer are far lower than the wages of any other group. Thus a condition is confront - ing us which, if continued, will within a very short space of time impose a heavy burden upon domestic consumers. Good business ethics teach us that no class of people can continue to produce any article, at a loss. A year ago I called to your attention the fact that the farmers were not asking anything peculiar for themselves . They were asking — and rightly so — that they should receive a fair return for their labor and in - vestment. They are asking for, and should receive, their share of a proper balance between agriculture and the other industries of the wor Can they afford to force this situation by a decreased production and run the chance of a bitter complaint from the consumer? Or should they trust implicitly in the future, with a vision that this nation will adopt fairly definite policies as to an equitable balance between agriculture and industry? Personally, I cannot help but feel that we are approaching that period which history shows has come into the life of every nation, when we must determine whether we shall strive for a well rounded, self sus- taining national life in which there shall be a fair balance between &lt; ur fool producing, manufacturing, wholesale and retail industries. We should avoid the mistake made by many other nations, in the past, and not allow our food stuffs to be produced by the peasant type of farmer, thus sacrificing our independent farming as it exists today for the pur- pusf of building up large cities An unbiased consideration of these problems is made much harder now because our agriculture is in a very bad state, much worse than is realized by those not engaged in this occupation. We of this great agri - cultural producing portion of our nation realize the situation as it exists, but there seems to be a tendency from many sources to regard the com - plaints and appeals being voiced by the farmers, and those who speak in their behalf, as simply the recurrence of the grumblings which have been heard in past periods of depression. The truth is that we are passing through the most severe period of depression of agricultural activities we have ever experienced. It is not </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 •imply a case of low prices for farm products; we have experienced lower prices in times past. The present trouble is that while prices of farm pro - ducts are lower than before the war, prices of the things for which the farmer must pay still remain near the war level. A comparison will convince one that the purchasing power of the majority of the farm pro - duce is lower that at any time in our history . If this condition is not adjusted at an early date, our basic industry in this country will snon be undermined. Something 1 must be done to put the purchasing power of the farmer's dollar on a par with the dollar of the other fellow. When this is accomplished, the well justified complaint of the American farmer will be heard no more. Let us now look to the future. We all realize that when we emerge from this period of economic disorder and confusion both here and abroad we will find ourselves at the beginning of a new era. The past life of this nation has been one of exploitation and promotion. We have used our natural resources — including the stored up fertility of our soil — without due thought for the future. We have proclaimed the individual initiative of our people. That was all very well and perhaps very wise during the years of development, but from this time on we must pursue a much dif - ferent policy and our first thoupht should be to stabilize the one industry without which all others will fail — viz., the agricultural pursuits of the great middle west. This can only be accomplished by some centralized agency through which not only the farm statistics of the nation will be compiled and given to the public, but this agency should also compile and give to the general public the statistics of all other industries. The farmer will then be in possession of necessary information to guide him in his future plans and purchases. In short we have come to the time when team work it needed. There must be a mutual understanding to induce sympathy and co-operation between agriculture and other business in general. They are dependent one upon the other. They are alike necessary to a well balanced nation; one cannot exist without the other and they should work together for the ultimate good of all. For your consideration I venture to suggest some of the things that could be done to place agriculture upon the plane it so rightly deserves, not alone considering this from the selfish standpoint of the farmer. When we have benefitted him we have benefitted all. In the administration of our credit machinery, the future effect on agriculture must be given more consideration than in the past. Those in charge must be informed that it takes more money on a longer time loan to carry the cattle man of the west than it does to take care of our east - ern Nebraska farmer who is in a position to turn his produce more regu - larly. </seg>
            <seg id="p021">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 21 Improvements in marketing methods, through the organization at co-operative associations, should not only be permitted but encouraged. Cheaper transportation methods, when it becomes necessary to trans - port our products to foreign markets, would facilitate trade. A careful study and survey of actual cost of production should in - clude not only such cost upon the farm but all along the line, from the farm to the consumer's table. A better understanding of the forces which influence prices. This is necessary to the intelligent adjustment of production to the needs of con - sumpton. In some way enable us to carry over the surplus from years of high production to periods of lower. I previously mentioned our disregard, up to the present time for the fertility of the soil. This fertility is our greatest asset, and this brings us to the problem of tenantry. A system of land tenure which leads to an involuntary conspiracy between landlord and tenant to impoverish the soil is a public menace. Tenancy of itself is not necessarily an evil, but the inevitable and logical result of high land values. One of our greatest educational propogandas is to promote a sys - tem of tenure which will protect the public interest without doing an in - justice to either the landlord or tenant. During the past few years we have been creating what might be termed expensive appetites and expensive ideas. This applies to all classes and now that, of necessity, we are compelled to curtail some of our appetites and ideas, we are not taking the thought with the best of grace. The sooner all classes bring themselves to the realiza - tion that we have passed the period of extravagant spending of money and that curtailment of credit will work to their benefit instead of being a handicap, that much sooner will our economic situation right itself. A great reduction must, of necessity, take place in our government and state expenditures, not to the detriment of our public business but the theories and fads must go. Transportation rates must come down, interest rates must be lower - ed, unlimited speculation must be curbed, and in the final analysis the business of this nation must get itself to a level with the prices which the products of our basic industry are bringing in the open market Then will general prosperity be with us again, and not before. In looking back, many things of pleasure in the year 1921 come to our minds. On the other hand, probably as many if not more events of regret are recalled. For many it was a year of prosperity, not in a great measure, bat prosperity just the same. To others it was replete with trials and tribulations.

All of this has been done at an approximate cost of $425,000.00, of which the legislature appropriated $351,000.00. The difference has been taken care of by the receipts of the fair. This does not include the yearly maintenance of the grounds and buildings, nor any expense connected with the staging of the Fair proper. Upon inquiry I find that very few fairs the nation can show a better record for the same period. All of this was done at a time when prices for labor and material were at their highest. It is gratifying to note that the Board has adhered to the one prop- </seg>

Therefore the money which has heretofore gone for such work can be applied on the buildings proper. We have been staging son.e wonderful fairs, with a liberal patron - age. When we stop to invoice the situation and figure that a larg. - percentage of our patronage comes from the rural d. struts and that Nebraska is not as thickly populated yet as some of our older states, making our patrons travel much longer distances to reach our institu - tion, we should feel justly proud of the support given our Slate Fair by our citizens.

"Finding it will be impossible to be with you at the annual meeting, I am sending you a report of matters that came under my observation in the several countries visited and more especially in my native coun - try — Denmark. I spent most of my time there with relatives and friends ■whom I had not seen for forty-seven years. I left Clarks in March and reached Denmark about the middle of April. I made my headquarters in Kolding, the city where I was born, and which I found ha-; grown considerably since I last saw it. I found all of my relatives in comfortable circumstances, in fact than I expected. I spent a few days resting after the h it trip and getting acquainted with the manners and customs of the country. I found that I could not speak the Danish language as freely as formerly, zed that it would take several days before I could expect to If you -an manage to use three-fourths Danish and one-fourth h "V will make a jfuess at understanding but when you go at em with a fifty-fifty proposition you are rather up against it. Americans are welcome guests wherever you go in Europe, and ly everyone you meet has either relatives or friends in this country. They seem disappointed when they discover you live many miles from those for whom they are inquiring. It is a great honor to be an American and travel in these foreign tries. It is quite a task to secure passports and permission to go one feels well repaid for the difficulties encountered. One of the thiners I learned at Kolding was that they were very short of corn, for some time In about four days "Uncle Sam" had an cargo of corn in the harbor and everyone was well supplied — a fact which gave me a great deal of pride and satisfaction. I desired grntly to see and visit with his majesty, the King of Denmark, and intended to do so when in Copenhagen. During my stay at Kolding he took a little vacation of his own, wired that he would be in the city and soon followed. The officials got busy and arranged to give him a reception. I was accorded a place with the reception com - mittee and met the king, with whom I had a few moments conversation. fie is very democratic in his actions and the following morning he came up to the city alone went into a drug store and bought a cigar and later returned to his floating home. He is well liked by everybody and a friend to all. Later I visited Copenhagen, looking over the city and the many improvements. One of the outstanding features is the school and com - munity gardens, of which there are many.

On my return I found it well stocked with livetock, a modern house with electric lights, hot and cold water, piano and rugs and everything that makes for a comfortable home. The ground is not as fertile as it should be and you are always able to gather a wagon load of cobble stones but I was informed the farm was producing better crops.

Factories were built with the funds set aside for this purpose, and it was not many years until the association was independent.

I believe the power this body to say which is the regularly organized agricul- unty or district in the state of Nebraska. The al society tutes are not so closely defined on these matters and I think the ite Board will have to give its best judgment on the matter. In order ou an idea of how some of these things will creep in and dif - iranizations be criticised because of things we should not en- dorse, I recall in our county years ago there was an organization cre - »ted at Wisner by a bunch of enterprising men who formed a stock so-called, and put up a show. They did not pay any premiums, a representative down to the annual meeting more than once I believe, and we turned them down but we up in our country are persistent fellows and they kept coming and finally they re - ■ocmition and were given a seat in this body. Matters went along for a few years when we saw an item in the report of the County Commissioners of $700.00 given to the Wisner Stock Show out of our treasury. I went to the treasurer of the Board and he said that they could not get away from it, it was the law. I said "don't you pull off anything like that again or you will get into trouble". It was not regularly organized agricultural society, they didn't give any premiums, they brought in a few pumpkins, but the principal show was a show to make some money, business men of the town put some money into it and expected to get some money out of it, but after that they didn't draw any more $700. 00 out of our treasury and there has not been any show since. I do not know the situation at Bartley and would have to have more information than I have before I would want to vote to seat these gentlemen. It is easy to send the gentlemen down here and put up some kind of a show or fair. There is something wrong in that county if they are pulling off a fair at McCook, why haven't they </seg>

The men who were on the Board and serving with me f jr the first term, the majority of them are now dead. With one exception they are off the State Beard. So time goes rather fast, when you look back at changes, and I think it answers a feeling that is sometimes in the breast of some people that it is a wheel within a wheel and there is no chance. I can look back and I know it is not a good idea for us to look back unless at times, over those years in retrospect, and I can see the conditions of the State Fair and the grounds, and all things per - taining to it, and I can see it today, and I am certainly pleased that I have been a small part of the Board that has accomplished these im - provements that have taken effect in the last ten years.

Danielson, Secretary Nebras - ka State Board of Agriculture. PASSENGER RATES FOR FAIRS AND EXPOSITIONS, 1922 Mr. Chairman and Members, Executive Committee Western Passenger Association, Chicago, I Gentlemen This Committee — appearing before you today — represents the State, Interstate, District and County Fairs located in that section of our na- tion which is traversed by the railroads represented in the Western Passenger Association. We come to you, at this time, in a friendly spirit of co-operation; feeling that the subject to be discussed is one of mutual interest. We jr deliberations today will bring forth additional information &gt;wledge greatly beneficial in the guidance of our future rela- shir In the past the railroads of the country have displayed a keen in - st in these agricultural institutions. Our mission here at this time augment that interest. While we realize that the railroads have been the target of much riticism, we are not here to discuss that phase of the question. Due, possibly, to the many things involved in the manipulation of anything as gigantic as our railroad systems, and the many opportunities for disagreements, we have reached the point where the people of the United States are disposed to eliminate Ihf railroads wherever practicable in their methods of travel. We are here in an honest endeavor to bring about a closer and more sympathetic relationship between these two factors for the common good, and we are working toward the end that the people will use the railroads more freely, especially in attending the fairs and expositions to be held this fall. I think you will bear us out in the statement that the railroads are so organized that their greatest profits are derived 1 from the volume of business handled. Your overhead is practically the same whether you handle a large volume of business or whether you are, to use a railroad term, "run - ning light". This applies to the fairs as well; our overhead is just as great in opening these institutions whether we have an attendance of 50,000 or 300,000. Both your institution and ours are gravely con - cerned over the need of showing a profit in our business. It behooves </seg>

They are a graphic method of portraying what has been accomplished in the intervening time from one fair to another. They bear a most direct relationship to the educational problems of the day. They are the blackboard upon which is pictured the result of progress, improvement, initiative, and the better methods of closer study. They are the show windows of their several communities. They are the insti - tutions which stand as a stimulus for greater and better production in At these fairs the agriculturist, the pure bred livestock man and t manufacturer meet upon common ground, to ascertain the progress improvement which they have been able to attain in the activities in which they are engaged, since the holding of the last fair. These institutions occupy an important place in the progress of our nation; more so than the ordinary person realizes. A proper pre - sentation is the most convincing proof of their real value. Let us, for the moment, consider the abrogation of these for a period of years. What would be the result? Are those interests which should be vitally concerned prepar accept the consequences of destroying the incentive for the ind.i to strive toward the production of an ear of corn that will yieid kernels in uniform rows upon the same cobb? The production of ' that will yield more grain per head? The production of will put on more meat in a shorter period of time?

Th by scientific breeding of a sheep that will return a larger C f and of higher quality? The production of a better, sturdier beasts of burden — the horse and mule? The invention an of all labor saving devices? The progressive American nation of today is the result of what "Yankee" ingenuity and unwavering steadfastness to a purpose can do. This nation cannot afford to close up the institutions which have been such a guiding star to progress, and return to the primitive days of many years ago. Fairs preceded the establishmnt of agricultural colleges, agricul - tural experiment stations and the agricultural extension service. Fairs have come to us from the old world. The first agricultural fair in America, of which we have any record, was held at Cambridge, Massa - chusetts, in 1804. The next was formed in 1809 by the citizens of Maryland, Virginia and the District of Columbia. In 1852 one was established in North Carolina. From that time on they have been the advance guard of civilization. </seg>
            <seg id="p061">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 61 I call this to your attention to demonstrate that the fairs have been the pioneer institutions in advanced agriculture, in many instances pre - ceding the extension of transportation lines. They have been the one in - stitution which has ever been in the foreground in building up and im- g this vast commonwealth of ours. Many territorial fairs were g before individual states were admitted to the Union. They are not money making institutions any more than the schools are. Rather, they are money losing institutions. If the fairs of today were not supported by state, county or private subscriptions, they t exist as in many cases expenses outweigh receipts.

We are not unmindful of the co-operation which the railroads have displayed toward the fairs in the past. We are wondering if the work that has been started and the in - ntive offered should not be extended. You have realized the import- ance of assembling these exhibits. Is it not as important to make sure that the individual citizen is given the same incentive to pay a visit these exhibits, once they are assembled? The ho'ding of a fair with the most wonderful exhibits possible to obtain would be a complete failure and all effort wasted, if the farmer could not avail himself of the opportunity of seeing and observing the progress made.

Men up around Alliance are planted onions and potatoes in alternate rows, in order that sail the onions may make the eyes of the potatoes water and so furnish them with moisture. I do not vouch for that as a fact. We hear a good many ories of Alliance but we do not believe them all. As the product of our wheat is called the "staff of life," and our pies the Great American Desrert," it seems to me that we may very fittingly call the potato "the Great American Filler".

In general, there is no article of diet that is so universally used by all and so well liked as the potato. Just the other day I saw one of our prominent attorneys rushing up the street. He is quite a gad-about, goes home, you might say, when he does not have any place else to go. I blocked his progress and said. "What's your hurry?" "Wife just telephoned that she is going to have baked potatoes. I'm going home to lunch," he panted. Now, gentlemen, we appreciate the product of your toil, and feel that we Americans owe much to the great American spud. They told me when I first came to Scottsbluff that he who said "potato" was a tenderfoot. Not wishing to have that title I immediately learned to say "•pud." Now, if there are any here from afar that are inclined to say "potatoes" let's initiate them and teach them to say "spuds." We are really glad to have you with us. I thank you.

V, Gentlemen, I cannot meet here with you without thinking back u&gt; the beginning of this organization. I remember the tirat move that was made. It was in Lincoln. There was a few present there and We had the secretary of the Potato Growers in Wisconsin with us. We did not know anything about organization in this state. I happened to be present at that time there. I heard something about potatoes and I wanted to see what's coming. They had the spirit in them that we should or - ganize in Nebraska. It looked kind of small at that time especially down there when no one knew that Nebraska would come to the front as it did. The first meeting we had to organize there was only a few farmers there. There wasn't enough at that time to elect officers. And, really, the way I got an office in that organization was on account of lack of timber. It has grown up so that now we see what we have accomplished during these years, it's only five or six years since the beginning, and I most say this, financially we was always pretty hard up, we never had any money ahead but through the assistance of the Agricultural College and the assistance of the growers and the good luck, it grew to the sise it is now today. </seg>
            <seg id="p155">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 155 So, now, we are in a condition that we can carry this work on properly. While we have made a great movement forward, but I tell yon we got a great problem before us yet. First, a great deal of atten - tion must be put into the marketing: line, etc., and that ia for this Asso - ciation to forward. We have come to realize that we have to look for the marketing end of our business, and this is a big item in our mar - keting: that if we want to find out good markets and also get profitable marketing we must first consider putting our goods up in a condition and in a way that every buyer is looking for so that he can know what he is buying and not feel it is up to him and he don't know what to do, but so he will know that he is getting the best. Then we will not have much trouble in marketing our product. It was only about a week ago a man came up here. He heard of western Nebraska and he knew of the western Nebraska seed potatoes. He came one afternoon over from Crawford for there was nice seed potatoes over there. He wanted to get them from different territories wherever he thought seed potatoes were produced. He did not favor buying a whole carload from one farmer but wanted, if possible, from five or six farmers and each one labeled with the name of that particular farmer. He wanted to find out what results would be. If he gets good suits from certain shipments, why, he thinks he can get good seed tatoes without the expense of coming clear up here or going all over the country each fall or winter. Consequently, if those particular parties gave a man like that the best there is, that is one thing that is going to help the marketing of our products. If we can put the market from the producer to the consumer closer than we do most of the time by having the proper products and sending them to the proper places and the confi - dence of the buyers that they can pet what they want without going to the different commission men. etc.. and then we find out if it's worth being done. So I want to remind you that we are a long ways from being as complete and up to the highest standards of putting our products out that we should b«. I see with a great pleasure that this is one of the best conventions in regard to attendance from all over that we have had so far. (Applause.)

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF GOOD SEED POTATOES ON IRRIGATED GROUND Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: From my experience in the growing of potatoes I have found that there is more disease and that the process of running-out is more prominent in a potato plant than in most other farm crops. I have grown wheat and corn, but I have never found them to be as susceptible to disease or deterioration as potatoes. If it is true that potato plants are seriously affected with disease and loss of vigor then the main considerations are maintainance of vigor and control of disease, and this implies careful selection of seed tubers. This running-out process is not a disease, but an inherent quality of the potato plant. We learn from the experiments that have been conducted in this valley in the past five years that this condition of the potato lie potat&lt; plant and the loss of vitality can be overcome to a ercising care in the selection of seed. Soil conditions and water seem to affect the growth ar potato plants. Various soils produce a different effect on the vitality of tubers grown thereon which is noticeable when these tubers are used for seed. Heavy applications of water, especially on flat lands, also seem to hasten deterioration, consequently the origin of the seed which We expect to use should be ascertained. The type of the potatoes which we grow is just as important as the yield. The total tonnage, of course, is an important factor in the pro - duction of potatoes, yet the amount of good marketable tubers is more important. We may produce a large amount of potatoes, but if they are poor in quality and type they will not yield nearly as large returns as a smaller yield of good type potatoes. Good type is maintained thru good seed selection. This fact has been clearly demonstrated to me the past season. I have in mind two fields which were planted to potatoes last spring. These two fields which I refer to are located about a half mile apart. The soil texture is similiar. The same rotation system was used, as both growers used fields which had been in alfalfa for four C. C. Parrish. Minatare, Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p159">159 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE years. Good cultural methods and proper irrigation practices were used in both instances. These two farmers were good potato growers. Both fields were planted practically the same time, each enjoying the good growing season and suffering the hot weather alike. The only dif - ference between the two fields was the seed that was used. On one of these fields the grower planted seed that had been grown under irriga- tion for a number of years and little attention was paid This seed was purchased because it was cheap. The other grower disregarded the financial outlay and bought good dry land seed Potatoes from Good Seed Sell at Best Price At digging time the potatoes from both fields were placed in storage. By chance both lots were sold the same day to the same buyer. We into consideration the total yield per acre of these two w fields of potatoes. I am quite certain, however, that those grown from dry land seed out-yielded those grown from irrigated seed. What I want sider at this time is the general type and uniformity of the two The trade demands good, smooth potatoes, not degenerated, off- Consequently as I stated before the total yield is important. t of good marketable tubers is more important, as will the returns of the two lots of potatoes when they were market. The grower who used irrigated seed sold his undred and encountered much difficulty of dispos- t that price. The farmer who exercised care in the selection tatoes received $1.60 per hundredweight for his stock and it hat figure , because the trade always demands quality. As good potatoes brought 47 cents per hundred more than There was a difference of $9.00 an acre in the cost of seed two fields. The selected dry land seed costing that much yield was approximately 250 bushels per acre, therefore at a hundred increase in price, the grower who used good seed 25 per acre more than his neighbor received per acre. Con - an investment of $9.00 he made a profit of $71.25. Carelessness in the selection of seed potatoes seems to be a common practice among potato growers. More attention should certainly be paid to this feature of the industry. I should like to know how successful the beet-growing industry would be in this valley if the sugar company would leave the selection of seed to the beet growers. I imagine that some of the growers would buy un - tested seed because of its cheapnesa. In this event the beet-growing in - dustry would suffer jUBt as the potato-growing industry suffers in this valley, thru lack of the use of good seed. I thank you. </seg>

I That proves that the good seed nnd a proper system of rotation is the only thing to practice here in the irrigated country. If it is possible to raise seven or eight hundred bushels of potatoes per acre, as I have heard it was by proper seed selection and rotation, I think we can do it in this Valley. I am going to try it. If it is possible to raise from 25 to 30 tons of beets per acre, and I am sure it is, we can do it in this valley by proper rotation. So lets get away from this one-crop farming. We see it all around us. There are so many of these farmers that have all the way from 75 </seg>
            <seg id="p162">162 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to 125 acres of beets. Some seasons the yield is good and a large acreage can be raised at a profit but more often it is loss. We need the potatoes and we also need the beets but I do not think we need the one-crop farmer. We need the farmer who used the proper system of rotation and seed selection. POTATO PRODI 1 CTION FROM A BANKER'S VIEW POINT. S. K. Warrick. Scottsbluff, Nebraska Mr Chairman A banker is interesttd in potato growing, not only from the com - munity standpoint but from the successful operation of his customer. If the individual customer is successful in all of his undertakings, the com - munity will be prosperous and the bank will be prosperous. A community is made up of individuals, the bank is made up dividual customers, the men that do business with it. PiVhen it comes to growing potatoes, a banker is vitally interests the grower be successful. Some &amp;f you men may get the idea tha a banker is only interested in the interest he pets on the loan.

After thirty years' experienc I have found that you cannot do much unless you have a ma undertaking, the man is the foundation of all. The next would say is the soil.

We do not believe that we know all there is to know, and I hope that you people will never get into that habit of mind, because &gt;ne of us that know it all; if we do, we had better be buried. The subject I am expected to talk upon is "Potato Growing in Col - rado." When you think of spud growing in Colorado, you naturally think of Greeley, and what Greeley does, and what Greeley produces. Now that is not a correct impression. While the Greeley district produces a large quantity of potatoes, it is not the largest potato growing sec - tion of our state. We have in the south central part of Colorado, a large level valley ranging from seventy-five to eighty-five hundred feet ele - vation. It is at the head waters of the Rio Grande River, and is sup - plied with an abundance of water for irrigation. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE There is a story about this valley that you have probably heard, and which should interest you. However, I am not willing to vouch for it being a true story. To make the story clear to you, it will be necessary to explain their method of irrigation. The water table is close to the surface; the land is leveled and laid out in panels about 100 feet wide and desired length. The panels are separated by ditches. These ditches are kept full until the water from below creeps up to the surface. They call it sub-irrigation, and most of the potatoes are grown by this method of irrigation. Now the story goes that the farmer plants his spuds in the spring, Ews them a couple of times and cultivates them. Then it is time to te, and he turns the water into the ditches, and then he goes fish- When he returns the spud field is irrigated and he turns off the and returns to his fishing 1 . Raising spuds and fishing should make a very good combination and many of us would enjoy it learn in Colorado, and I hope that you have already learned it, and that is K raise varieties that will do well in a jriven section. Do not try to 57 varieties, but get down to one or two varieties. We have found by specializing in one section on two or three varieties that a r will come there with the intention of buying the kind of pota - toes that are raised. Thus we grow in the central western section, Russet Pearls and Downing. San Luis grows Brown Beauties and Russet Burbanks The Ktain sections and high elevations will grow Peachblowg (Red Me - s) and the Russet Rurals. Greeley section Pearls and Rurala. Apart from the story, the valley produces between seven and eijfh million bushels each year, and is capable of beintr increased to twenty mi lion bushels.

Second, I would consider the soil and climatic con - ditions. We have found in many of our potato growing sections during our hot August weather when we are irrigating viry heavily in order to make a large growth, that we are apt to have disease, principally Fusarium Wilt. I have seen field after field go right down to the ground in the space of two weeks. This is true when we have hot weather during the month of August and early September, and to keep a low soil temperature dur - ing this critical period is a problem. Another thing is that of honesty of the grower. I hardly want to touch on this subject because I have gotten into trouble before, and I al - ways try to be as close to the door as possible in case I have to beat a retreat. The farmer is not intentionally dishonest any more than any other </seg>
            <seg id="p169">169 REPORT (IK NEBRASKA STATE BOAJU) OF AGRICULTURE human being is, when his own interests are involved. In putting up his pioduct he hardly ever sees the defects in his products. Just like the ap - ple grower when he is grading and packing his fruit to be put into boxes labeled "Extra Fancy" or "Fancy". The wormhole is always on the op - posite side of the apple. He never sees it. Somehow the apple seems to turn so as to leave the hole on the opposite side, and the same is true about potatoes. We do not see the imperfections that we should see. We say that the other fellow does it and why shouldn't we. I believe that farmers should come to realize the importance of good grading, and the grower should not feel ashamed to put his name on the package. He should do the same as manufacturers do. When you go into the grocery store to buy a package of chocolate, you expect a pack - age of chocolate, and you expect a good product, and if you don't get it you come back on the grocer. Why shouldn't the farmer be willing to put his name on the sack of potatoes he has raised himself? It is true that under previous existing conditions the poor grower has gotten away with it, but it is not so any longer. We had a grading law passed last fall that required certain stan - ards in potatoes. There was opposition to the law as you would expect, especially in one section. I do not care to say which. The law has been in operation for a year. We have had lots of trouble because every grower hat his spuds are No. 1, and the inspector says they are No. 2, and jpector usually has the better of the argument because he happens and the grower usually has to take the grade that the inspect- What is this law going to do to the potato grower? It is going to urage better seed production, the raising of better crops, the market - of better grades. It is going to increase the consumption of pota- toes becausethe house wife when she peels a good potato sees no waste. Ladies do not swear, — but when she is peeling a poor potato that is scab- or full of black streaks, or has deep eyes, she is certainly going to nk a lot. On the other hand, if the product is of high quality and it is a pleas - ure to prepare it, then the consumption of potatoes will increase. Our consumption now is only about four bushels per capita, about four hun - dred million bushels. Why shouldn't we consume at least six bushels per capita? When we do that, which will come with increased quality of our product, there will be a greater demand, and more potatoes will be raised. All this is a question of development and education, and you have to bring this change about even though a loss is necessary. It is just like the story of a man who is sitting on a railroad car. He was talk - ing to a fellow passenger and he happened to be a man who had a little vacant spot, not vacant, but no hair on his head, — but he had </seg>

A cowboy was sitting behind them, watched him for awhile, then he called out, "Say Mister, why don't you chase 'em up into the clearing, then you can easily lasso them." That is the idea. Just chase these ideas out into the clearing and let people know what we are doing. Advertise your goods, but be sure your goods are worth advertising. In regard to the result that we have had with potato inspection. As I told you the growers are all satisfied except in one district. In regard to the fruit, we wert- up against another proposition. The fruit growers in Colorado were up in arms not because there was an inspection, but because the standards set were too low. They did not want a single spot on an apple that went into the first grade. The rule allowed two. They wanted an apple that was perfect for the first grade. We had to modify the wording so as to make that law stricter than we had intended to make it. Now when our growers get an idea like this, we are on the ri road and we will have it soon as the farmer realizes that it pays to f duce only the best kind of stuff and we all could produce the best kinc stuff, if we were willing to go to the troub We have, as I mentioned before a seed certification offi This year we did not certify one half of the amount that w simply because we happened to ship in some seed f Nebraska, but from another state, that had a lot of mosa as a result we turned down more than one-half of the pn plied for certification.

That seems to be a high price to the average farmer, when table stock is selling for a dollar or less. Yet it is not any too much.

People in other states do not believe it, but in the Greeley section and in fact some of the soil on our western slope, has too much nitrate. Our chemical department is now working on the problem. Q. How about crop rotation for fertilizing the soil? A. Most farmers believe that by rotating, that is by growing alfaifa, potatoes and other crops and keeping that system up that you can main - tain the soil fertility on your land. I want to simply whisper to you that you can not do it. While you do add some fertility by plowing under your alfalfa you are robbing the soil continually of the potash and phos - phorous.

That is especially true of the San Luis Valley, where the rotation consists in peas, hogs, potatoes.

This disease develops more and does more serious damage in the southern states than in the north. The term "Fusarium" is used to describe the diseased tubers and plants that show brown or black ring-like discolorations across the stem end of the tubers or in the stems of the plants. It may include several stem diseases that cauee wilt. The Rhizoctonia or black scurf disease is found as hard black specks the size of a pin head or larjrt-r. that are often mistaken for dirt, but which will not wash off.

In view fact that a small number of prrowers benefitted very much financial originally we deem it advisable to charge a fee that will to a large ex tent cover the cost of the inspection work. As the growers of seed pota toes have been making a very nice profit out of it they are glad to pay for the service. The fee has been fifty cents per acre at the time the application is made. That paid for the certification up to the time of the last bin in - spection. If the lot then passes inspection a fee of 2 cents per cwt. was assessed last season. That coven some of the earlier inspection cost, pays for the tags, printed lists, advertising and incidental expenses. That represents a cost of probably not to exceed $1.70 per acre un - less the yield is very high. Considering the fact that certified seed po - tatoes have all been sold for $2.50 per hundred or more when market stock has been selling for $1.50 per hundred, sufficient profit has resulted to make it worth while for the more active growers to take it up and take the necessary pains. </seg>
            <seg id="p189">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOAKI&gt; OF AGKICULTUKE 189 This year, in view of the unusual spread in price between certified dry land seed and common stock, I think that there will be a very gTeat rush in the way of applications for certification and we are going to make K gure 4.

Professor Howard in- ;pecteil a Held that everybody told him beforehand was a wonderful ield, the most wonderful field in Dawes county. After he had gone into he field a short distance he saw that he could not think of certifying he field. The vines were very large but the plants were pretty badly nfeitt-d with mosaic to the extent of about 20 per cent. (The maximum ■equirement was five per cent.) so we had to turn it down. That man Ml vitv sadlv disappointed. In order to avoid such disappointments, if you are interested in hav- ing certified seed next year, lor if any of your frineds are,)be assured that you must he mighty sure of the quality of stock to be planted. W« will not inspect any potatoes after they leave the hands of the original growi r who originally applied for the certification. If any deal- er want* to '.&gt;e sure of a lot of certified seed potatoes, if he wishes to contract early in the season with a lot of gTowers and then apply in his own name, we will inspect just the same as if he were the grower. We will not take a landlord's half or a tenant's half, but we will take the entire field or nothing at all when it comes to certification. Otherwise, if half the field passes one can say the rest is just as good 8* it comes out of a certified field, he may get the advantage without the responsi- hilitv. </seg>
            <seg id="p190">190 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE potatoes is men of the very best quality. If this work is developed as we think it should develop there will be no great necessity of any track side buyers for certified seed potatoes. A man who is 2000 miles away can, look over the Certified Seed Potato List and determine from that just the quality each man has, then he will expect the man to ship potatoes of that quality and it will not be necessary for him to come up from Louisiana or Texas and not get what he wants after all because one can - not tell good and poor seed potatoes apart in the bin. If you men who are growing certified seed potatoes will attend to the correspondence that comes to you, you will be able to build up quite a large direct sales business for your certified seed. I have had more than one letter this fall from men who wanted to know if there were any dealers who had certified seed potatoes, saying they never could do - business with farmers, as they never answered letters nor answered telegrams and it was impossible to do business with them. This certifi - cation business is one of the means of enabling you to sell your seed potatoes direct and if you will take advantage of it and attend to that one proposition carefully it will help in your direct seed selling. The growers of certified seed potatoes in western Nebraska probably received $30,000 more for their potatoes as certified seed potatoes than they would have received on the basis of common seed or No. 1 table stock. Growers in the North Platte Valley who planted certified Nebras - ka seed potatoes profited an equal amount, according to the statements presented to you yesterday by Mr. Sheldon. Quality counts in every thing. The certification system is for the purpose of encouraging and rewarding quality. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MOSAIC DISEASK IN RELATION TO SEED POTATOES R. W. Goss. Ass't Plant Pathologist, Nebraska College of Agriculture The Mosaic disease of potatoes to many of you, is probably a new disease. The disease, however, is not new to this country. It was first reported in Maine in 1912, and in succeeding years has been found in most of the potato growing sections of the country. The nature of the disease is such that it was easily confused with other troubles, or en - tirely overlooked, and it had probably been present for a number of years. Some growers heard of it for the first time when their fields were being inspected two years ago. After having taken all the precautions they knew of to prevent diseases in their crop, they were justly disappointed to find their fields infested with a disease they had never heard of be - fore. However, as the disease did not appear to be causing any great losses to their crop, they concluded that it was not as serious as we at - tempted to make out. I assure you, that if the seed growers of Western Nebraska underestimate the seriousness of this disease, they are going </seg>
            <seg id="p191">191 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE to have considerable difficulty in marketing their crops in the southern states. Some of you probably have the mistaken impression that the dry land seed potatoes of Western Nebraska are absolutely free from mosaic, but I assure you they are not. Your seed has gone into the south, it has been tested along with other strains, and it is not entirely free from mosaic. The southern grower knows this, and will use his knowledge in his selection of seed. Results of experiments carried out in Louisiana by Tiebout and Etl - gerton show that there is no direct evidence that one part of the country can produce better seed than other parts. These results do show, how - ever, that Nebraska can produce as good seed potatoes as other states. We do have certain strains that have a eomparitively small amount of mosaic, and it is only by careful selection that you will be able to keep them so. In this connection, I would like to say that when I speak of potatoes being free from mosiac, I do not mean resistant to mosiac. It is simply that you have grown a strain of potatoes that have been kept away from other fields infected with the disease. We have nothing as yet idic-ate that this seed, if grown in close proximity to a heavily infected would not become just as diseastd as its neighbor. Furthermore, seed selection should also result in higher yielding strains which you will have to have to compete with other states where selection of hitrh grade yielding strains has been going on for some years. f the peculiar facts about this disease is that we can inspect • carefully up here in Nebraska and find only a very small f mosaic present, but when the seed from these same fields is the south and grown under fr'ie very trying and unfavorable iitions of that rtgion, they show a much larger percentage a You might conclude from this that the disease is present in the soil f the south, but experiments have not indicated that the disease is car- ried over in the soil. It is a fact, however, that this disease under the average climatic conditions of the dry land section of Western Nebraska is rather hard to identify. The symptoms of the disease are such that they are masked by the type of plant produced, and in some seasons it is practically impossible with our present knowledge at least, to detect the presence of mosaic, except in the more advanced stages of the disease. These facts make it advantageous to look over the results of plantings with our seed in the south, to obtain a good index of the amount of mosaic present. To discuss the disease more in detail, I must first admit that the causative agent has not as yet been discovered. The organism, if it is an organism, remains to be found. We do, however, know something of the nature of the disease, its symptoms, infect iousness, method of transmission, and its effect on yields under certain conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p192">192 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Figure 5. On the left, a potato leaf affected with the mosiac dis - ease; on the right, a healthy leaf. (Courtesy Louisiana Agricultural Experiment Station.) The disease often causes the leaves of the plant to take on a mot - tled appearance. The healthy green of the leaf is spotted with small, scattered, irregular shaped areas of light or yellowish green tissue, sel - dom more than one-fourth of an inch across, and it is from this mottling that the disease obtains the name "Mosaic", which describes it so well. Usually, this will be accompanied surface, and sometimes this later contrasting dark and light green by a wrinkling or ruffling of the leaf symptom will be present without the areas. Ofter the disease is character- ised by a dwarfing of the entire plant, the leaves being curled downwards, thus the name "curly dwarf",' which is simply one symptom of mosiac. These plants may turn yellow and die before the normal time. The symptoms, as already related, vary considerably with the variety, and the climatic conditions under which it is growing, as well as with the severity of the disease, as we will take up in a moment in reference to secondary infections. Work carried on in this country, both of the Federal Government and the various experiment stations, has shown that the disease is trans - mitted by the tuber and that all the tubers from a mosaic plant wilt produce mosaic plants. The disease is infectious and can be transmitted by grafting or by transferring diseased t'ssue or juice from a diseased plant to a healthy plant. </seg>
            <seg id="p193">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 193 The disease is transmitted naturally in the field by aphids or plant lice. Potato beetles and flea beetles apparently are not capable of trans - mitting the disease. Contact between diseased and healthy seed, cut - ting knives, or soil have not been found to be agents in carrying the dis - ease. Thus, there arc really two distinct types of infection; primary in - fection, where the disease is transmitted thru the seed piece, and second - ary infection, where the disease is transmitted from the foliage of a dis - eased plant to a healthy one. In the secondary infection, the symptoms are slightly different in that usually only the leaves directly infected. and the ones which develop later show the disease, and very often in the north, when infection occurs late in the season, the disease does not show up until the next year. Thus, we can to some extent, account for the I resenee of larger amounts of mosaic in the fields the second year than our t-stimate during the growing season of the first crop would indicate. The Curly Dwarf type appearance is usually found when the disease is transmitted thru the seed, and eventually the plants produce small and worthless tubers. The effect on the yield is greater in the South than in the North, and believe, the chief limiting factor in the production of Bliss Triumph in the south. Often in the north, fields even with a high per - f mosaic will produce good crops. can be readily seen that this disease is rather a hard one to deal It is often hard to identify in the north, and unless present in con- i l le amounts, does not materially reduce the yield. There is no way st:niruishin-r the disease in the tubers, and because of these facts, is great danger of infected seed being planted, which would result gradual increase of mosaic in our fields, eventually causing consider - reduction in yield and making them worthless for seed purposes. uc omratting the disease, we are favored here in; \s to method We have some strains of Bliss from mosaic, and we should bend and even decreasing the amount Nebraska by two important factors. Triumphs that are comparatively free )ur effort* towards keeping them so A disease present. seed selection in the field is not practical because of the presence of a large number of aphids, and even a few mosaic plants means that the disease has probably been transmitted to many plants, even tho' the symptoms are not as yet apparent. In the dry land section of Western Nebraska, we are not troubled to any extent by aphids. I do not know of any survey having been made, but from my own and others' observatnns, there are not usually many aphids present in this section. This means that by careful hill selection, we can hope to greatly reduce the amount of mosaic present in our seed, and successfully combat the disease in this way.

In conclusion, I wish to emphasize again, the importance of this dis - ease, which is in my opinion, one of the chief, if not the chief factor in de - termining whether Nebraska dry land seed potatoes are going to be m success on the southern market SEED POTATO REQUIREMENTS OF THE SOUTH University of Louisiana, Baton Rouge, Louisiana Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen and fellow college workers in Nebraska: I want to say that this is rather a unique experience for me. I ought to be a whole lot better because this is the highest I nave ever been. When I was leaving Baton Rouge, one of the members of the faculty who was raised in this section told me that I had better watch out for the folks out there. I have changed the opinion that he gave me. You are a whole lot better than I expected; I think that is because you live in such a high altitude. I am something like the old darkey that was standing on the street corner. A couple of men passed by. One of them had a five-dollar bill that he wanted to change. He went up to this old "Uncle" and said, "Uncle, can you change a five-dollar bill?" "Good Lord, boss, me change a five-dollar bill? I'se only got a nickle but I thanks you for the comp - liment just the same." I ar.\ coming here with about a nickle's worth of information and you folks have asked me to change the five-dolar bill since you have five dollars' worth of information, but I thank you for the compliment just the same. I am glad to be here. It's a long «vays from home — two thousand miles, but I am going to be amply repaid personally for this trip. I hope that I can give you something that will help to bring about a better understanding in our good relations and our common troubles that we are havir.g. I belong to these college folks and as you know, we do not do much fanning ourselves, but we do have a chance to watch other folks farm «s well as do a little farming ourselves in an experimental way. I have been studying this certification problem for three years in cooperation with the Federal Government. Three years ago they came to several of the southern states and asked us if we would carry on some experiments in potato seed improvement work to find out if this certi - fied seed that you are growing and they are growing in other parts of the United States, is really worth while for the south. Also if it would be any better than the seed we would buy in the open market thru regular G. L. Tiebout, Horticulturist </seg>

In other words, better than ordinary seed that Ju«lil bought up here, brought to the south and sold to the fanners. We have run that experiment now for three years. The first year we had a very unfavorable season and did not consider our results of much value. The second year the season was a little better and we had one plot where we thought we could get a fairly reliable comparison. I have those results with me and if any of you would like to see them I should be more than glad to show them. Last year we had a very favorable season at the Experiment Station and we perhaps got as good a crop as we will ever have. We also had aa excellent opportunity to make a great many comparisons.

We do believe that, at least in some sections, not enough stress has been put on the mosaic situation. We also believe that this is partly due to the lack of information, as the pathologist told you, on the mosaic disease. During the early stages of certification the horticulturist may not have known quite so much about the mosaic disease as the pathologist so perhaps they did not stress that point as much as they should. We have had some very disastrous experiences on this account. It is such trips as this that bring about a common understanding and we should like very much to see you folks send a representative from this section to the south next year to look over conditions in Louis - iana. We feel that it i? imperative that we have an interchange of work - ers in this activity. ' ynfortunately last year as far as we know no certified Triumphs from Nebraska were planted in Louisiana except the few that we had for our test plots at the Experiment Station. We were extremely anxious to s^e "several cirs of Nebraska certified seed come to Louisiana and be planted under field conditions. You, however, asked a premium over what some of the other states were asking and we could not convince the jobbers that they should pay, perhaps, a little bit more for the Nebraska certified seed. We had Gome of the jobbers up to the point where they thought th*y wanted some certified stock but certification was certifica - tion to them and they bought th? cheapest certified &amp;tock. Your sellir.;; representatives were informed on this point by us aftd toward the end of ihe season competition from another *tate, Wisconsin, was met, but it was too late to pla?e any Nebraska certified rt»ck among the jobbers of Louisiana because they had already bought their supply We are extre.nely anxious to have the strains that we are grow the Experimtnt Station also growing under field conditions so th -tu can go &gt;ut and make observations on these strains. I hopi- t will bring some Nebraska certified stovk to Louisiana. We | y t cars already that are being shipped to Louisiana j we d know whether they will be distributed in Louisiana I do not know what you want me to talk about in particular. This is a big subject but perhaps I had better tell you a little about what w want in the south. We grow two varieties down there, in the main, the Triumph an^ the Durbank. One you are famiiiar with. The Burbank is a late white potato, which, I believe, you do not prow here. I know of a section in Louisiana that has practically abandoned the Triumph variety. They didn't know the reason why they abandoned it, I suppose, but as far as we can learn the mosaic disease was the dom - inant reason. They are growing mostly white potatoes in this section but I believe if that section could get some of these better strains of cer - tified Triumph seed they would try them. </seg>
            <seg id="p197">197 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Lafourche Bayou is a long stream a little west of New Orleans along which a great many potatoes and onions are grown. Alexandria is in the central portion of the state where Triumphs are gTOWn exclusively and that Section was the one that met with such disactrous experiences last year on account of the mosaic disease in a certain lot of certified Triumphs that were purchased. We are going to have to go there this year and con - duct some demonstrations and experiments to regain the confidence Of a great many of the jrrowers in certified seed. You good folks will con - tribute some of the stock for those demonstrations during the Coming season. We will also procure some certified stock from Wisconsin as well as lots bought in the open market in the spring. You will determine as to whether you would be interested in supply - ing certified Burbank seed. I believe there is a market for good burbank stock. At least two dealers asked me to try and find them a car of cer - tified Burbanks each. We don't errow very many potatoes in Louisiana. In 1919 the cen - sus report shows 1,600,000 bushels with a crop value of three and a half million dollars. 1 believe that we would grow a great many more po - tatoes if we had better seed as the industry would be more profitable. We are farming just as you farm, supposedly, to make money. We don't always do it. We grow a few Cobblers in Louisiana but the Triumph is our main ■ potato. As I told you we want high-yielding strains. We also de - the percentage of mosaic as low as it is possible to get it. As the Figure 7.

            <seg id="p198">198 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pathologist told you, a little mosaic here, or t low percentage, may mi a very high percentage in the south. We had one strain of certii Triumphs last year that showed 98 per cent. That strain yielded bushels to the acre. Now a great many dealers have asked me to get seed stock f^[ them. They want seed that is medium in size. I understand your irrl» gated stock runs pretty large in size but, of course, you are not including irrigated stock in your certification work. We had a lot of uncertified seed in our experiments last year tiuM - was supposed to have come from Nebraska. It gave a favorable yieUHj but as I remember, the tubers as well as some others were pretty larg« and did not cut with economy. Our growers are inclined to plant small seed pieces. We do not like to have them do it but we cannot change the system overnight. At the Station we use a one-ounce seed piece. Thflj Government wanted us to use a larger seed piece but we thought on* ounce would be sufficient departure from the common practice. We want Med potatoes that are as free from scab as possible. Before the mosaic disease came into prominence, — and, of course, the mosaic disease cannot be detected in the seed, — the common scab as a surface indication of low* quality was looked into more closely by dealers perhaps than any other; one condition. We can control common scab by the formaldehyde treat* ment if it is not too severe and if the pits are not too deep, but lots of growers expect certified seed to be apparently free from common Scab. We advise them, of course, to treat all of the certified seed with formalde - hyde. The trade conditions for seed potatoes in the south are deplorable. I COUld Cite Some startling instances in that connection but I do not think it well to go into detail. We have a great deal to do to raise the standards. When we go to a dealer and ask him to handle certified seed the first question is the price. We tell him that he must necessarily expect to pay a blight premium for certified seed. He immediately raises this ob - jection: Competing dealers are going to bring in uncertified seed which they will sell for a less price. The farmer who has never heard of cer - tified seed and knows nothing about it is going to buy the cheaper Seed. This is wholly within the facts in this connection. The white seed stock generally sells for less money than the red stock and the grower who is looking for "cheap" seed frequently buys it solely on the price. We also run up against a class of dealers who are simply dealers. They are handling seed potatoes for the profit they can make. Last year some dealers asked us if it were possible to get mixed cars, partly certi - fied and partly uncertified, so that they could introduce the certified seed as they were a little cautious about taking hold of a whole carload of certified seed. We were not able to satisfactorily Work out a plan along this line. I believe it can be done this year. </seg>
            <seg id="p199">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 199 I want to say just a word or two about the advantage of certified seed as far as yields are concerned. Last year, taking the peak yields of our plots, we found that the certified seed on the average just about doubled the uncertified stock in yield. That is a wonderful showing for certified seed. The year previous the proportion in favor of certified stock was not so great. I have with me charts and other information that I have already shown to some of you growers but I shall be glad to discuss any points with any others that may be interested. I should like very much to have every grower here get a copy of our bulletin No. 181. I have several copies with me and you can always get additional copies. This tells yon about the mosaic disease in the South and what we are doing with cer - tified seed much better than I can. There is another point that I should like to discuss. That is adver - tising certified seed in Louisiana and in the South. I know of no better way to advertise certified seed than to make some arrangement whereby we could send certified seed to the Boys' and Girls' Clubs of Louisiana. We have several thousand boys and girls enrolled in these clubs and should you wish to arrange to deliver some of the best of your certified stock to Baton Rouge, we will distribute it to the best members of these clubs. Parents are sure to see that garden and you know how "hot" the children make things for us when they get on a hobby. There is no bet - ter way to advertise than thru the boys and girls. I believe that if certi - fied seed thru this channel were placed all over the state of Louisiana it would only be a question of time before you folks could hardly produce enough seed to supply the demand. The way to get the dealer to handle Figure 8. Certified Triumph potato seed exhibit at the State Fair 1921. Shreveport, Louisiana. (Courtesy of G. L. Tiebout.) </seg>
            <seg id="p200">200 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE certified stock is to have the fanner go to the dealer and ask for certi fied seed. The next point, I am sure, will not be very popular with you because you want to get all the money for your stock that you can. On the other hand, if you could make some arrangement whereby certified stock could be gotten into the hands of the farmers at moderate prices, I think it would be to your advantage. I have asked several dealers if they would buy a car and distribute several sacks among their customers along: with the seed they customarily handled, but I have not met with success in that connection. Last year for the first time, I advocated putting exhibits at the State Fair in Louisiana and we want to work with you in obtaining ma - terial for exhibits of certified seed at the state fair. We perhaps can extend this work to include some of the Parish Fairs if we can get the seed stock soon enough in the fall. I want to mention just one point in this connection. If you send potato seed for exhibition be sure and wrap each specimen separately so as to get it to us in good condition. One man drove a lot of nails into the head of the box to support the head and ruined a great many of the tubers in that way, as the nails went into K r ield Tests: I have already stated that we are going to make a test in the Alexandria section next year and stock should be fur - d for that purpose. Trade Exhibits ii. the South: Perhaps you could arrar nr enough stock to your show so that the surplus could be used for a little show, say, in New Orleans. I believe we could get space without cost to you in New Orleans; if not we would be glad to have the show at the We would also be glad to have as many of you as can come down South and look over conditions for yourselves as well as meet the college people. If we cannot conquer the mosaic disease of the Triumph so that we can put that variety on a substantial footing in Louisiana, we must look for some other early varieties. We are beginning to scout around now and we may have a substitute in the King as you call it here. Florida grows a great many Spalding Rose No. 4 and they have the market already established in the event that Louisiana and Texas should substitute it for the Triumph. I might say that the Spalding Hose No. 4 out-yielded any Triumph strain in our experiments. Here is another line I would like to suggest to you. Furnishing seed stock for fall planting in the South. No work has been done in this connection except in a very limited way. I believe that cold storage seed from Louis vill? held over from the second crop has given good yields </seg>
            <seg id="p201">201 REPORT (IF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE in the South. We want to investigate that fact, if we can find any way of getting cooperation from this end of the line. We have a variety of potatoes produced especially for the fall plant - ing in the South, (ailed the Lookout Mountain. We are looking for sources of smi of this variety. Time of Planting in Louisiana. — As you know, the movement of seed to the south generally starts after Christmas. We usually plant (at Baton Rouge) the latter part of February or early part of March, — far - ther south correspondingly earlier. If the season is good they may get them in during the latter part of January or the early part of February but the dates that I have given are about the average. We can assume from the yield that certain white varieties of pota - toes are not so subject to Mosaic as the Triumph. I believe that the Spaulding Rose No. 4 is not so subject to injury from this cause. The strain of Spaulding Rose No. 4 that we had last year was from" Canada, and as I remember, did not show any mosaic infection. Question: — What relation has one field to another in your state, the Wisconsin strains to the Nebraska, if planted within a half mile of each th Answer:— We do not have the leaf hopper and we have very few arry the mosaic from one field to another. Our problem a primary infection. Question: — Do your growers buy seed or take it on shares? Answer: — As a rule the good potato growers buy their seed. Question:— How is the variation in price of seed to the farmer from year to year? Is there any sort of an average where it stays? Answer: — Seed price varies quite a good deal. Last year seed was very high and a great many of our dealers did not take hold of certified seed or that account. The price declined toward spring. However, prices now compare favorably with those that prevailed last spring. A dealer Hammond handled certified stock for which he paid $1.35 a bushel f. o. b. Wisconsin. He sold it in bag lots at $6.00 a bag; $3.00 a bushel; then he graduated the price according to the amount. We always have to pay a premium for certified stock. We have not enough information on that point to really give you a satisfactory answer as to what the difference in price is. Question: — What are the quotations in the South? Answer:— Nebraska stock thru dealers ranges around $4.50 delivered on certified stock. There is about fifty cents per hundred pounds differ - ence between certified and uncertified stock.

            <seg id="p202">202 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE HOW WE SECURE HEAVY YIELDS OF POTATOES IN THE NORTH PLATTE VALLEY Peter Jannsen, Morrill Mr. Chairman, Folks When they were getting up this program they asked me to Bay how to raise a big crop of potatoes. I asked them to leave me off. I have nothing new to tell you. I can point out men who have raised bigger crops than I have this year. That reminds me of a happening some fourteen or fifteen years ago in Colorado. One of our neighbors raised a big crop of potatoes one year and he got it in his head he knew all about raising potatoes. He was telling everybody how he was going to raise a big crop of potatoes. It only took him about two years after that to find out he didn't know anything about raising potatoes and he gave it up as a bad job. A great many of us at times have had good success and then again we fell down and don't know where the trouble is, but the State of Ne - braska and the United States Department of Agriculture is helping us. Mr. Werner is carrying on considerable work and trying to find out why we do fail sometimes in growing a large yield or good quality potatoes. I think we ought to be thankful that the State and the United States De - partment of Agriculture is helping us. We need a lot of information. In the first place we must have good soil to grow potatoes on. All soils are not good potato soils, and all climates are not adapted to pota - toes, but our climate evidently is quite well adapted to growing potatoes and SO is the most of our soil, especially on the north side of the river. The region north of here and around Mitchell. Morrill, Henry and Torring - ton, has very good potato soil, but the good soil alone cannot grow pota - toes. We have to rotate our crops, grow alfalfa and some other crops, but the biggest crop of potatoes we grow is produced on alfalfa sod. We have better success growing potatoes following alfalfa than following any other crops. I think that the soil has to be plowed quite deep. I think deep and thorough plowing is one of the main things. I believe that we have to have a good type of seed potato for growing a desirable crop of potatoes. If we do not have good seed we will not have good luck. We will have more off-type stuff and more tubers that push out of the ground and they would get sunstruck, or quite lik ly frostbitten before we dug them. Deep plowing and deep cultivation will help that to some extent. Some varieties will push out of the ground anyway, such as the Ohio and the Cobbler. Thus we must plant varieties of potatoes that are well adapted to our soil and climate. Along that line again we need a little help from the Experiment Station or from the men that the State provides for that purpose. For instance, up until four or five years ago we were growing largely the </seg>
            <seg id="p203">REPORT Of NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 203 Pearl variety of potatoes. A little later on the Pearl potato would grow rather large and rough and while it is still making a heavy yield it is not making the quality that we desire to grow and we have to take up other varieties. We have grown lately such varieties as the Russett Rural, the Kings and just the last year or two some growers have tried the Peachblow or McClure and it seems that the Peachblow potato is a variety that will set on hep vy and is not apt to grow rough potatoes and seems to be very well adapted to the heavier types of soil that are in a high state of fer - tility where some varieties would grow rough and not make a very good quality of potato. The King potato as I found it grows rather deep under the ground and there is practically no sunburn in this potato and practically no fall frosting. I think two years ago last fall our potatoes ripened up very late in this locality and a great many potatoes had not been dug when the heavy freeze came on the 10th of October. I had at that time about six acres of the King variety that were not dug and about two acres of the Pearls. The Pearls had pushed out of the ground very badly and the frost enti.ely ruined them. On the King variety we lest less than fifteen per cent, still leaving us a good crop of potatoes free from frost. If we had continued raising Pearl potatoes we would not have had any potatoes to sell that year, while some varieties like the Rural and the King still came out fairly well after the frost The Triumph seems to be one of the leading varieties, at least be - ause they are a little earlier and nice looking. I don't think they will yield quite as heavy as some of the other varieties. I would like to call your attention to one thing in the experimental work that Mr. Werner is carrying on. We find that some of the earlier varieties seem to show up better than some of the late varieties at dig - ging time, but these potatoes are all planted at the same time and dug at the same time and if we dig potatoes like the King and the Rural pota - toes the last week in September they are not matured and they would grow for ten days or two weeks and make quite an additional yield, where the earlier varities have their growth. And that is the point that ought to be considered. If we could dig the earlier varieties and leave the late varieties two weeks for them to mature it would show up a little different on the variety point. I think Mr. Werner will touch on that if he has not already at his time to speak this afternoon. The variety trial is quite valuable to us. It gives us quite a little information. We find in experimental work, and also by looking around a little in our own fields and our neighbors' fields, that good soil, deep plowing and </seg>

            <seg id="p205">205 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE good cultivation, all these things do not raise a good crop of potatoes if we do not have the right kind of seed to start. Here a few years ago when we were led to believe that the dry land seed was ever so much better to plant than irrigated seed some of us bought dry land seed. In a good many instances there were poor returns on that dry land seed. Not because it was dry land seed but because it was inferior seed. It was run down strains of potatoes which had not been raised for seed. The growers simply had been growing potatoes and they were not worth anything as seed. We had irrigated seed that had not been raised under irrigation for too long a period that did much better than some of the dry land seed. In my neighborhood one man bought dry land seed potatoes and will lose 75 percent of them before spring on account of dry rot. That is where seed certification will come in. If we buy good dry land seed it is undoubtedly better than the irri - gated seed but not all dry lend seed will give us good results. Last spring we were fortunate in getting one carload of certified seed into Mirrill territory anri a number of people in our locality bought some of that seed. Without any exception they are satisfied with that seed. I think one of my neighbors had nearly 450 bushels per acre of these triumph potatoes, of good quality and much better than had been pro - duced from home grown seed. So far as I have any knowledge, there has been no complaint on that seed that we got from Bushnell. Everyone that I have heard of was satisfied with it. I am thoroughly convinced that it pays to plant good seed potatoes because we cannot grow good 'tatoes without good seed. That explains the thing as far as we know this time We have to have the right varieties, the varieties well adapted to our natural conditions, and to give them a good cultivation, good, deep plow - ing. Pay very close attention to that in order to grow a good crop of potatoes. In irrigating I think that a good many people use too much water or. potatoes. We are rather fortunate in the ditch system we have in the V "alley. Here we have a great deal of storage water and it enables us to run a good deal of water on potatoes during the growing season. We find that if the ground is a little flat and the people use an excessive lot of water they do not get the good yields and they do not get the good quality potatoes. I think that most any of you people that have grown potatoes under irrigation have found that where the water drains off free - ly you had the best potatoes, possibly not in the earlier part of the growing season but before the growing season is over you have the best potatoes where the water drains off quite freely. Not so fast that it will cut down seriously between the rows, but a reasonable slope to potato ground is beneficial. I rather think that potatoes need to be irrigated quite often but not </seg>
            <seg id="p206">a heavy irrigation at a time. On alfalfa sod we find the vines growing's very rank and during the latter part of the growng season these vines! will lop down into the furrows. The water is held back to some extent V on the flat ground, too much so sometimes and it gets up too high on the I potatoes, on the ridges, and doesn't seem to do them any good. It is bet- 1 ter to keep the water down pretty low, particularly at the latter end of f the growing season. bOne year we had one batch of alfalfa that I had kept hogs on for a uple of years and the upper end of that was a feeding place. I used to ul a load of corn there and scoop it off. Feeding there and the wind had killed out the alfalfa and caused a depression on the upper end of the patch a little raise down toward the lower end of the lot. When we plowed that up we planted it to potatoes. Where the depression was in the ground the potatoes got a little too wet and we didn't get water thru the raise near the lower end as it couldn't get thru the rows. Later on in the season we watered these potatoes on the higher ground I think once from another ditch and that is where we had the best potatoes in that field. It seems to me that it is quite clear that we should not use an excessive amount of water in producing a crop of potatoes but that we should look out for the seed that we plant and prepare a good, deep seed bed for potatoes. I think that is about all I have to say at this time Question: — What rotation did you use? Answer: — We use what rotation we can get. Two years previous to the last season we had poor luck in getting a stand of alfalfa and we run short of alfalfa land to plow up and I planted potatoes on land that had been cropped for six or seven years. I have tried to seed it down to al - falfa but failed to get a stand for two years and put it back to potatoes. These potatoes yielded last year in the neighborhood of 400 bushels per acre. They were the King and Russett Rural varieties. If I could get a stand of alfalfa every time I tried I should try and use a rotation about like this: I would plow up my alfalfa sod to plant potatoes, following it with beets one or two years. One year beets if I hadn't any manure. If I had plenty of manure probably two years beets then I would seed that back to alfalfa with a crop of small grain. Good seed is not only beneficial for potatoes, it is also a big thing in producing crops of grain. A few years ago I got some barley seed from Mr. Holden of the Ex - periment Farm here, and planted it alongside the old variety and it oat - yielded it I think 13 bushels per acre. Two years ago that barley yielded t bushels per acre. Now, there w»s quite a little smut in that barley. it spring I treated my seed barley with formaldehyde solution and we </seg>
            <seg id="p207">207 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE found that we had no smut at all in the crop when we used treated seed. But unfortunately we had to replant a little piece of barley, and we took seed out of the same bin and cleaned it but did not treat it for smut and found later there was quite a lot of smut inthat crop where the untreated seed had been planted. I guess I didn't touch on the importance of treat - ing seed potatoes but I rather think it would pay any of us to treat the seed potatoes. It will hold down a number of diseases. We may develop some scab and some Rhizoctonia and some blackleg in potatoes that have been treated with corrosive sublimate but I think it is quite a help in holding down these diseases. At least, we had very little trouble with these diseases in our potatoes where the seed has been treated and I think it would pay any one to treat seed potatoes. The cost is com - paratively small and it does not take very much time to do the work. We use a stock tank that will hold a wagon box load of potatoes. I use two barrels to make this solution and fill the tank nearly full of potatoes, about live inches from the top. Then fill in with the corrosive sublimate solution until they are well covered. In stirring them I find that potatoes seriously affected with dry rot will float and you can pick them out easily. Some with only a small spot will not float By having them rise to the surface and treating the seed that way we have had no disease develop in the potatoes in our cellars. They seem to keep well. It seems that a good deal of dry land stock has not been treated for diseases. Dry rot develops in these potatoes, it develops in your own cel - lar in such potatoes. I bought some dry land seed myself one time and at the time I bought it I didn't see any dry rot in the potatoes. The man brought them down about two weeks later. By that time there waa a great deal of dry rot showing up in these potatoes. It pays any of us to keep our eyes open on the seed we plant It should be practically free from diseases and true to type. THE ACTIVITIES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE NEBRASKA AGRICULTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION Dean E. A. Burnett Director Nebraska Experiment Station, Lincoln, Nebraska Mr. Chairman; Members of this Potato Growers' Association: I am very giad indeed to be with you this afternoon. I am glad to see so much interest in the Potato Improvement Association and so much good work being done by this Association. It is very apparent that when any body of men like this begins to study the question of potato pro - duction they also begin to study all the other problems which are re - lated to their farm activities. The amount of interest which has been developed in this Association work and the good organization which you have, shows clearly that you are men who take advantage of the natural opportunities of this region and who add to tise general knowledge of the </seg>

I am very plad to know that there is so much discrimination in favor of good seed and I take it that so long as you keep the standards of certified seed high enough to show the advantages of such seed, you will not only extend your market at home but will extend your market away from home. As I listened this morning and yesterday afternoon to the discus - sion it occurred to me that the emphasis of the advantages of certified seed was being placed upon the advantage for some foreign market. ■ market quite a long way from home. I wonder whether the growers of this valley, the people in attendance at this Association, had given sufficient attention to the advantage of planting this seed themselves. That s co say, of planting seed of such quality and freedom from disease that you yourselves could produce maximum yields in your own fields. I am sure that this is a subject which \ou may very well study becaube if your seed has made g( od in competition with the certified seed from other regions, it is almost certain to be equally good at home. I antic - ipate that this advantage will become more and more apparent and that men who now question whether they can afford to pay the additional price or take the additional trouble in order to get certified seed will very shortly be convinced that it is the thing to do. I expect that these men rather than buy their seed will soon come produce such seed themselves so they will secure it at a minimum c and they will not only have advantage of the high quality of seed their own production but they will help the market at home which larger and more important than the southern trade. The eastern end of the state of Nebraska is in need of seed wh free from disease, from which the weak and degenerate tubers have eliminated and they will pay prices tqual to those paid by the south when once the value of your seed has been demonstrated to them. I not mean that the state of Louisiana might not compete for this but they do not furnish the only market outlet. I think while yc looking to that state you might develop the market nearer home I was looking over recently a report that is now a year old — from the Scottsbluff Station and one of the interesting things I noted was the relative advantage of alfalfa and manure upon the yields of sugar beets el of potatoes. I noted that plowing under alfalfa had a residual effect the sugar beet crop in the second year of about 6 additional tons per acre, and that the use of 12 tons of barnyard manure per acre had an equal effect. When you add these two together you get an increased yield on a six or eight year average of 10 additional tons per acre. In similiar experiments with potatoes the increase from the alfalfa sod was greater than from the manure, indicating that if a man is raising both potatoes and sugar beets he would get the preater increased yield by </seg>

I am told that within iff years, when nobody seems to be making money out grow, the idea has grown up in this valley, that pork w production cannot be carried on at a profit. I do not know how wide - spread that idea is, but I have heard it expressed by a number of individ - uals who are rather closely in touch with the farmers in this neighbor- ant to suggest that the situation which made pork production hi unprofitable in this valley in the last two or three years, is very largely changed and that today with the present prices of different crops, any farmer who grows alfalfa can well reconsider whether it is not possible igrain go into the hog business and make money out of it. We have carried on pasture experiments on this Experimental Farm h show more profit in pasturing hogs on alfalfa without corn than ade out of a corn crop or a wheat crop under the best cir - in any township in this valley. The profit such as was shown he pasture of hogs on alfalfa without corn certainly indicates *re other people who can afford to study that problem. understand me to say that I favor growing hogs on alfalfa The smallest profit made per acre by any method in use iia that experiment was made on hogs pastured on alfalfa without corn Still. 1 want to repeat that the profit shown by that method was greater than can be shown by the growing of corn or any small grain in this val - ley in any year, you selecting your own year. I do not mean that every farmer can afford to raise hojrs but he can afford to think about it- Somebody in his neighborhood must have made a success of hog raising and will know whether other men can do likewise. Of course, I can understand that farmers may have lost a lot of money trying to grow hogs in the last three years. In the forepart of 1919 hogs were worth in Omaha 23c per hundred live weight. Then they ran down the scale to about $7.00. In the spring of 1919 corn was worth more than $3.00 per hundred at your local market. When you feed corn here most of it has to be shipped in. Now corn is worth perhaps 90c per hundred locally. Alfalfa in 1919 was worth from $12.00 to $15.00 per ton. Back on the farms it is now worth about $4.00. The question of developing this Valley depends first upon finding the crops which are most suitable and which are most readily marketed. Potatoes is one of the most profit - able crops. Sugar beets bring an enormous amount of money into this </seg>

One of your problems is to utilize alfalfa either as pasture or as hay and get the most dollars out of it. On the new price basis pork production is likely to be profitable. At an Experiment Station one hundred miles east of here, for a period of five years, all of this prior to 1914, we fed corn to hogs on alfalfa pasture and on the average paid us a little more than double the market price for the corn fed to these hogs. We bought nearly all of that corn from farmers in the neighborhood and we sold these hogs locally or in the car lots at Omaha or Denver. I was looking recently at some results in the growing of winter wheat at four different Experiment Stations in this region, viz., The Experi - mental Farm at North Platte; Scottsbluff Farm here eight miles from you; at the Ardmore Farm which is just over the line to the north; at the Akron, Colorado Farm just over the line to the south and the aver - age results of these stations given in this review, indicating that dur - ing a period of six years, the best average results in th« growing of winter wheat had been secured by alternating it with corn. Not as much wheat was raised in the six years as by continuous cropping to wheat but they had raised it cheaper and for every additional bushel of wheat raised by continuous cropping of wheat they had lost five bushels of corn. This is to say, that in comparing alternating cropping of wheat and corn with continuous cropping of wheat, every additional bushel of wheat which they secured by the continuous cropping had cost them five bushels of corn so that the most practical method over the region covered by these four stations was the alternate growing of corn and winter wheat. Experiments were made at the North Platte station in the depth of plowing. They did not find any profit in plowing more than seven inches deep. They found that deep plowing paid in increased yields to a depth of six or seven inches, but from seven inches down to ten and from ten inches down to thirteen, the wheat always cost more than the depth of plowing exceeded seven inches. Now, of course, seven inches is deeper than the average man thinks he can afford to plow. There may be conditions under which it is deeper than one can afford to plow, but our results show the advantages of rather deep plowing, five or six inches at least, over plowing three inches, and consistently additional increased yields over the use of the disc as a sub - stitute for the plow. In practically all of these experiments on the yield of wheat per acre the yield was determined by the amount of moisture accumulated in the Mil. We were always able to produce larger acre yields when we could store op quite a good deal of moisture in the soil prior to putting in the crop but frequently the cost of storing that water was sufficient to cover the value of the increase in crop. </seg>
            <seg id="p211">211 REPORT CF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I do not know how much has been done in this section of the country in undertaking to develop the poultry industry. At our North Platte Ex - periment Farm we are undertaking to study that problem and we believe that anyone who is willing to make the same study of the poultry industry that you gentlemen are making of the potato industry, will find it very profitable. Local markets are not always suitable but anyone raising poultry on a rather large scale can always ship to the nearest terminal market. At our plant at Lincoln they are able to make direct shipment! in crates to the most favorable market. They also happen to be in the situation where it is possible for them during the low price season to put these eggs into cold storage so that they can be sold on a more favorable market than where necessary to sell locally. Even without these ad - vantage* poultry should prove profitable on every farm. Dairying has not grown in the state of Nebraska as much as one might reasonably expect. A good deal of trained labor is needed in con - nection with it and somehow in this regon when a man could grow wheat for four or six months of the year and make enough money to rest the other six months he has not been much inclined to milk cows. Now, going into other sections of the country where they have always milked dairy cows, it has proved the most profitable thing they could do. You find high priced land in these sections, you find a large aggregate revenue per acre. This irrigated valley is sure to develop a large and profitable dairy industry. Now, certainly when it comes to a question of how yon are going to consume this hay that is so cheap that it cannot be shipped to market on a freight train, you must convert it into some higher priced and more concentrated product which can be shipped to a suitable market. Now butter is one of the standard products into which this alfalfa and your best pulp and the roughness of this Valley can be converted at a profit and probably never at so great a profit proportionately as now. I understand that the average butter yield of the dairy cow, in the state of Nebraska is 150 to 160 pounds of butter per year. Such a cow will not be very profitable since it takes too much labor to get a little butter. I understand that only recently in this valley a Cow-testing Association has been formed. Without having ever heard of any of the results I will predict that one quarter of the cowa in these herds are being kept up with no profit on the food consumed and whatever profit is being made is on the other three-fourths. A cow testing association will tell you which cowa are msiirtg a profit Five or six yean ago we established a dairy herd at North Platte. Part of these cows were pure bred and part were grades. I saw a record which showed that ten of the best grade cowa in that </seg>
            <seg id="p212">212 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE herd made 500 pounds of butter last year. I mentioned the grade cows because it might be thought that the pedigreed cows may have been han - dled in a way that the fanner cannot afford, but these grade cows have never been put on a test, never been milked but twice a day or per - haps three times a day when they were fresh, and handled in just reasonably good conditions, and ten of these COWS made 500 pounds of butter, average and more than 11,000 lbs. of milk in a year against an average in the state of less than 5000. When we get a cow giving six or seven thousand pounds of milk we begin to think she is doing pretty well. That kind of a cow will make a profit, but in a region like this with its wonderful climate, with the finest feed that you can produce anywhere, alfalfa hay, beets and a lim.ted amount of grain, a farmer could easily equal the grade cows which we have in the Experiment herd. So that I want to suggest to you that this is one of the ways in which it is possible to develop this Valley. I know that there are other ways which I shall not mention. I am only under - taking to mention a few of the things upon which the Experiment Station was worked and in which it undertakes to offer help to the farmer. We have at the College of Agriculture men like Mr. Werner who spend their time in the field. Mr. Werner deals with the potato business almost entirely. Other men give all their attention to the dairy business helping to organize the dairy interests so as to increase the producton and profits of that region. We have other men interested in soil tillage. Still others are interested in poultry, in fruit growing, or in irrigation and drainage. The Experiment Station undertakes to work out of new lines which the farmer cannot develop; to furnish that information to the farm - er and then to ask him to form organizations to carry on the work. I hope before many years go by this potato growers' association will be able to promote its own work and can take charge of this seed certification re - lieving the Experiment Station of this responsibility. The expenditure of money thru the Experiment Station ought to be devoted to new problems and not to promoting commercial associations. A study of the potato diseases which we are carrying on for you could not be undertaken by any individual. It is too expensive. It costs money which does not bring direct returns to the individual, but the returns which it brings to the community at large justify the expenditure. I have in mind to tell you something about our work in animal dis - eases. We are working now on two or three types of animal diseases which are of importance to every stock raiser in the state. As an illus - tration of what has been accomplished by this department, any of you older stockmen can remember back to a time when blackleg was pretty hard to control. No individual could work out the trouble but the United States Department of Agriculture worked upon the problem until it got a blackleg vaccine which was practically specific. The vaccine prv </seg>

It is used very largely by the breeders of fine cattle who feel that the additional cost is more than paid for by the increased immunity. I believe our own Station is distributing a little of this serum but the credit of developing this serum belongs to Kansas. We are working on eontag-eous abortion, a disease that is very difficult to control. We fully believe that contagious abortion will yield to treat - ment some time. We are putting a good deal of time and expense of that type of work. The Rockefeller Institute in New Jersey is spending thous - ands of dollars on this disease. That is the type of work upon which we should spend our money rather than spending it in police work. I want to suggest to you that in this improvement of your methods nothing is equal in its effect to a gathering like this association where you can all get together and trade experiences. Each one of you who haa something to give can help your neighbors. That is the way to get in - formation out into the field. A thing which has been done in Nebraska must be applicable on your own farm. I want to congratulate you on having gotten such an effective As- sociation as you have in this Potato Association and I know it will be of great value to the individual growers and will help to develop the entire g RESULTS OK EXPERIMENTS WITH POTATOES IN WESTERN NEBRASKA DURING 1921. H. O. Werner, Associate Horticulturist Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station. Lincoln, Nebraska During the season of 1921, as during the several previous seasons, extensive experiments were carried on in cooperation with various farmers in western Nebraska and the Scotts Bluff county Experiment Farm. The experiments concerning which results of interest are avail - able at this time are: Variety trials at several dry land points and several irrigated points, Study of effect of irrigation as compared with dry land culture upon seed potatoes of several varieties of potatoes. Study of the effect of different amounts of irrigation water upon potatoes used for seed purposes, Strain tests of several varieties of potatoes, Distance of planting experiments under irrigation. </seg>
            <seg id="p214">214 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In addition to these experimental work has been started to determine the relative value of early planting vs late planting and early harvesting rt kte harvesting for seed purposes, and experiments to determine the effect of various degrees of culture on seed potatoes grown on dry land. C results of the latter experiments will not be available for at least more year. At this time we will attempt to give only a brief sum - mary of the results secured. Detailed data will be published soon in bulletins by the Nebraska Experiment Station. The variety trials indicate that under dry land conditions the Triumph and Irish Cobbler varieties are most productive of good results. The Early Ohio produced good potatoes but this variety ranked relatively low as far as yield of marketable potatoes was concerned. The Downing potato continues to seem desirable for the production of seed potatoes on dry land. There seems to be considerable merit for seed potato pro - duction in the Russet Rural New Yorker under most dry land conditions in western Nebraska and in regions having a relatively long growing Mason at a slightly higher temperature than the lowest prevailing in western Nebraska. The King may be desirable for dry land production. These late varieties are not desirable for the production of table stock on dry land. In the irrigated plots results indicate that the Russet Rural New Yorker should be tried out more extensively than it is being tried at the present time. It is a very promising variety that holds up well under irrigation. The Triumph is one of the most desirable because of the good yield of marketable potatoes and the certainity of a supply of dry land seed potatoes. The Downing variety produces very good yields but the scarcity of good seed potatoes is a very serious factor to the develop - ment of this variety in the irrigated section at the present time. On the heavier soils the King variety yields very heavy and produces but a low amount of culls. The Irish Cobbler variety is especially adapted to the lighter soils in the irrigated regions where it is a very desirable variety. On the heavier soils it is undesirable because the potatoes are of very poor type on such soils. Dtcct or iMMTicm jh Slid Pom™ vy. SuVwi &gt;»■«# O-.U-O — — •»&gt; O.U. ~ _ _ Figure 10.

            <seg id="p215">215 REPORT Of NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In the fall of 1919 representative lots of seed potatoes were selected from a number of the variety trial points in western Nebraska under both irrigation and dry land conditions of 6 varieties, — Triumph, Irish Cob - bler, Downing, Pearl, Russet Rural New Yorker and King varieties. These seed potatoes were shipped to Morrill, Nebraska and stored under uniform conditions. They were planted on an irrigated plot north of Morrill on the farm of Peter Janssen in 1920. The results during 1920 were reported at the potato convention last year. In the fall of 1921 similiar lots of po - tatoes were again sent to Morrill and were planted in the spring of 1921. The results secured during 1921 indicate that in almost every instance the dry land seed potatoes were superior to those grown under irrigation. The average results secured with potatoes of the various varieties grown on dry land for two years, grown on dry land one year, irrigated one year and grown under irrigation for two years are given in chart form in Figure 9. A study of this chart shows that when considering market - able potatoes (as shown by solid lines) there is considerable variation in the different varieties. There is very little dropping off in yield on the part of the Russet Rural New Yorker and King potatoes as a result of one year of irrigation. In the other varieties the yield dropped off^quite con - siderably in one year. In the case of all the varieties the yield decreased quite materially after being grown under irrigation two years. A study of the chart also indicates that the amount of call potatoes was very great in the case of the Irish Cobblers and Pearls on this farm. The con - ditions are not at all favorable for the production of these varieties on this farm which is very productive in so far as total yield is concerned. It is also of interest to note that there is considerably more scab on the Triumph, Irish Cobbler and Pearl varieties than on the Russet Rural New Yorker and King varieties. The type of the Russet Rural New Yorker and King varieties was better than any of the other varieties. In Figure 10 are given the average results from the various treatments. The average result with all lots of potatoes grown on dry land for two years were 331.7 bu. of marketable potatoes per acre. The lots grown in 1919 and irrigated in 1920 produced 298.3. bu. of marketable potatoes per acre and the lots irrigated in 1919 and 1920 produced only 234 bu. of marketable potatoes per acre. In other words the yield of the potatoes irrigated one year was 89.9% of the yield produced by dry land seed potatoes and the potatoes irrigated two years produced a yield of 70.7% as great as that produced by dry land seed. Last year results were reported that were secured with a strain of Triumph potatoes grown on dry land under irrigation for several years. In Figure 11 the results secured from this strain of Triumph potatoes are shown in a graphic way. The heavy black line in each case indicating the dry land yield at 100%. These results indicate that consistently the potatoes have broken down after being irrigated one year and they have continued to break down after each successive year of irrigation. In so far as it was possible to determine none of the potato diseases which are recognized occur in these plants. It is doubtful if any disease exists </seg>

Results of experiments conducted during four years with one strain of Triumph potatoes. The culture in 1919 on dry land and in 1920 under irrigation and on dry land was not as good as it should have been. That is probably the cause for the relative approach in value of the one year irrigated seed and dry land seed in 1920 and 1921. Yie'd from dry land seed each year is considered 100'.. in these potatoes. During 1921 there seems to be no difference between one year irrigated lots and dry land lots. This tendency is also some what apparent in 1920. The probable cause for this is that potatoes which were produced on dry land in 1919 and 1920 were grown under very poor dry land conditions which probably reduced the value for seed purposes. On the other hand in both 1919 and 1920 the irrigated potatoes were not cared for as they should have been and did not receive as much irrigation water as they had received during previous years. Consequently, it is quite likely that these irrigated lots yielded relatively higher in 1920 and 1921 than they would have had they received the same care as they received in 1918. According to an investigation carried on by the Minnesota Experiment Station, the cost of raising potatoes in Minnesota is approximately $53.95 per acre. When considering the fact that expenses are higher under irrigated conditions and allowing for these expenses in the way of extra land rental, water right, cost of irrigating, cost of hauling and sup - plying sacks for extra potatoes on the basis of the average yield in Scotts </seg>

On this same basis with the yield of 234 bushels per acre (secured from irrigat - ed seed potatoes) at $1.00 per bushel the gross income would be $234. The cost per acre would be approximately $110 leaving a net income of about $124 per acre. This would be a very good net income if it were not possible to make more on the same land by using better seed potatoes. When applying these same figures to seed potatoes irrigated one year the gross income would be $298., the cost per acre about $119, the net income approximately $179. While in the case of the dry land seed po - tatoes producing a yield of 332 bushels per acre the gross income of $332, the cost per acre $129 would represent a net income of about $203, per acre. When comparing this net income with the net income from irrigated seed we have a difference of approximately $79 per acre in favor of good dry land seed as compared with good potatoes irrigated for two years, on a acre field, the average field on an eighty acre farm in Scotts Bluff county, this would represent a net increase of approximately $1185.00 per farm in so far as the total net income from this potato field is con- erned. It is quite reasonable to expect that these results can be very losely approximated in actual results in view of the results secured in Scotts Bluff county last year with dry land seed potatoes. It is also safe assume that if these results represent returns from varieties which are not especially adapted to the conditions as well as varieties that are adapted, that with the best varieties coming from the best sources, these results could be improved upon. For instance the average yield of Rus- ?t Rural New Yorker potatoes with seed secured from Bushnell and hadron was 446.5 bu. per acre in 1921. The King potatoes from these two dvy land sources produced 382.9 bu. per acre an-1 the Downing pro- duced MCI bu. per acre. It is quite evident from these results that the farmers growing potatoes in the irrigated regions can very well afford very carefully study the seed potato question. During the season of 1920 about 75 potatoes were selected and were each cut into four pieces. One piece from each potato was planted in a plot that was grown without irrigation water. Another piece was grown on a plot that received light irrigation, the third piece was planted in a plot receiving medium irrigaton and the fourth received heavy irrigation during the growing season. Each hill was marked with wire stakes. At the end of the growing season the potatoes from each hill were put into a separate sack and stored after being properly tagged. In the spring of 1921 the potatoes from each hill were planted separately in an irrigated plot on the Scotts Bluff county Experiment Farm. The average results secured from these various lots of seed potatoes showed that the dry land seed potatoes produced 161.2 bu. of marketable potatoes per acre. Those receiving light irrigation 139.2 bu. per acre, those receiving medium ir - rigation 107.6 bu. per acre and those receiving very heavy irrigation 108.8 bu. per acre. Thus there was a difference of approximately 63 bu. between </seg>
            <seg id="p218">218 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the results secured from dry land seed potatoes as compared with potatoes receiving heavy and medium irrigation. As these potatoes were all from the i»mc original source, these results are worthy of serious considera - tion even tho they represent the results of only one year. It seems likely that fairly good seed potatoes can be produced under irrigation if very little irrigation water is applied. The potatoes referred to in the previous experiment, that were planted at Morrill all received a normal to heavy irrigation each year. This experiment will be continued for several more A number of strains of Triumph, Irish Cobbler. Downing and Russet Rural New Yorker potatoes were grown under irrigation on the Scotts Bluff county Experiment farm. We found that often there was some dif - ference between strains of potatoes of the same variety than between the different varieties, indicating that the place where the potatoes are grown and the selection that they are given are very important things to con - sider. A more complete report of the results from these strain tests will be published in the Annual report of the Scotts Bluff County Experiment Farm and a bulletin by the Nebraska Experiment Station. The distance of planting experiments were conducted with 3 varieties of potatoes. In the case of the Downing and Triumph potatoes the results very clearly indicated that it is very desirable to plant potatoes about 12 inches apart under irrigation on soils such as that at the experiment farm which is fairly representative of the soils in the North Platte project. In fact it seems desirable to plant Triumphs a little closer than 12 inches Even tho more seed potatoes were consumed by close planting the tota yield of potatoes after subtracting- the seed potatoes used, indicatec a that close planting was more profitable. In the case of the Rural X Yorker variety, the results were not quite so distinct. However t was probably due to the fact that the Russet Rural New Yorker potato were only partly mature at digging time Most of these experiments are being conducted f&lt; a years and other experiments are being added from time to time. The object of the various pieces of work being: conducted is to determine the best methods of producing seed potatoes and to study the potatoes grown on the various soils and under various conditions in western Ne - braska in so far as their value for seed potatoes is concerned. </seg>

A. Holden. Superintendent ScotU Bluff Experiment Farm The irrigated rotations at the Scottsbluff Experiment Farm were begun in the spring of 1912. Previous to this date there had been little or no experimental work done in crop rotations under irrigation.

The land was broke oat pped to oats the year before the rotations were begun. rotations at Scottsbluff there are 97 one-fourth acre plats ifii into 35 different rotations. In 15 of these rotations potatoes ire grown, 13 of which have now been under way since 1912, while the jther two were inaugurated in the spring of 1920. One of these 13 potato plats is a continuous crop plat — potatoes have been grown on this same plat every summer for the past ten years. There are six 2-year, two 3-year, two 4-year and two 6-year rotations. Two of the 2-year rotations, one of the 3 and one of the 6-year rotations re - ceives manure at the rate of 12 tons per acre.

For the first year or so the yield and quality of potatoes from this seed was good, but after that the potatoes began to decrease both in quality and yield until at the end of the seventh year they were so badly run-out that they would not have been recognized as belonging to the Pearl variety.

The yields from the continuous crop plats and from the plats in rotations not having alfalfa or receiving manure have decreased until the average yield for the past three years does not equal more than one-half the average yield for the first three years. Even the potatoes from the 2 and 3-year rotations receiving manure show a slight decrease in yield, while the potatoes following alfalfa show considerable increase. It would seem from this that the ideal place for potatoes is follow - ing alfalfa. Sugar beets do well on manured land.

This being true farmers who have both alfalfa land and manure and who are going to grow both potatoes and beets will find it more profitable to put their potatoes on the alfalfa land and ap - ply the manure to the best land. The rotation not only has a marked effect upon the yield but also on the quality of potatoes. After the first 2 or 3 years of the experi - ment the potatoes grown in the continuous crop plat and in the 2-and 3-year rotation became very scabby. Since then we have never yet harvested marketable potatoes from these short rotations, notwithstand- ing the fact that the potatoes are all treated with corrosiv mat before being planted. Potatoes grown in a 4-year rotation are much freer than those grown in a 3-year rotation, while those gTOWn in a 6-year rotation are fairly free from scab. There is no doubt but that the scab germ lives in the soil at least 3 years and to a less extent 4 years, but it seems that it dies out be - fore the sixth year. It is true that there is a little scab even in the potatoes grown in a 6-year rotation but it is doubtful if this amounts to more than would be on potatoes grown on land that had never been in them before. It sometimes happens that clean potatoes planted on new land after being treated with corrosive sublimate will have some •cab. It is possible that this scab germ is carried to the new land by wind or irrigation water. But the amount of scab fTom this source will be very small compared with the amount that lives over in the soil from one potato crop to the other in short rotations. The effect of the ro - tation on yield and quality is shown in Table I. It is evident from these results that a farmer in order to keep the •cab down to the minimum must plan his rotations so that potatoes will not come on the same land oftener than about 6 years. An ideal ro - tation would be for potatoes to follow about 3 years of alfalfa with enough other crops included to make a 6-or 7-year rotation. </seg>

It is a 7-year rota- tion. In this rotatioi: oats is seeded with alfalfa followed by 3 years of alfalfa; potatoes follow alfalfa the first year; two crops of beets then follow potatoes with manure applied to the second crop of beets. In a rotation there should be as many fields as there are crops in the rotation, so that the number of acres of each crop will be the same each year. In such a rotation and assuming that it requires 3 acres of each 80-acre farm for the farmstead, there would be each year 11 acres of small grain seeded with alfalfa, 11 acres of 1-year-old alfalfa, 11 acres of 2-year-old alfalfa, 11 acres of 3-year-old alfalfa, 11 acres of potatoes and 22 acres of beets. It is true that this rotation will not meet all conditions, but on many farms it could be followed to an advantage. See diagram of rotation. ROTATIONS Yield in Bu. per Ac.

This we know — that the financial situation is no worse than it was during August and September. About the middle of September, when potatoes were first ready for winter storage, nearly ten thousand cars more had been moved than were moved at that date a year ago and at a price much above the quotation at the present time. This excess went into immediate consumption and part of it in compe - tition with last year's big crop. This would indicate that the consumer will pay a higher price than he is doing at the present time rather than do without potato**. </seg>

Considering that the grower always ships his potatoes graded, either U. S. No. 1 or No. 2, in good new sacks, tightly sewed, properly and carefully loaded in the cars (this is the way it pays best today) we will consider briefly the question of time to market and to what extent does storage pay. First let us look at the population increase from 1900 to 1921 inclusive. In these 22 years the population has increased from approximately 92,000,000 to 110,000,000. an increase of almost 20' &lt;. From 1900 to 1902 inclusive the average potato acreage was 2,820,000 acres, the average production being 227,000,000 bushels, h the years 1918 to 1920 inclusive, the average acreage was :!. '.♦40,000, with an average production of 384.000,000 bushels. In the period while the population has increased 20'.. the potato acreage has increased 40'. and the total production has increased 69'.. In 1900 to 1901 the pro- duction of potatoes was approximately 2.33 bushels f and child in the United States, while in 1908 to 192C duction was 3.5 bushels. In 1900 to 1902 tht g&lt; was 57c while the average price during 191fr This would seem to indicate that the Amt potato consuming nation despite the rising price. A the U.

The average of th ever, shows that there should be a production of abou capita, that when the production is below this, the pri sistently during the winter and following spring. Whi is above 3.4 bushels per capita the price generally de&lt; digging begins and the market gradually weakens ur summer. On a basis of a consumption of 3.4 bushel per capita annually the people of the U. S. would require .55 lbs. of potatoes for each person dai'y, or a little more than one-half pound.

The poor quality of the Kaw Valley crop as the result of late freeze! and heavy rains just at digging time, was an important factor in creat - ing the demand for Nebraska stock in these central states; and the fail - ure, through drought, of the early crop usually grown near Minneapolis is said to have caused the demand in Minnesota and Wisconsin.

            <seg id="p271">REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 271 SUMMARY OF THE WESTERN NEBRASKA WHITE POTATO DEAL By 0. D. MILLER, Local Representative UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates in cooperation with NEBRASKA DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE Bureau of Markets and Marketing The planting's in western Nebraska in 1921 were considerably larger than in 1920. The acreage in the important counties raising potatoes on a commercial scale was reported by assessors as follows: In the dry-land area, Box Butte 17,774, Sheridan 11,266, Dawes 3,763, Brown 3,797, Kimball 1,463; in the irrigated area, Scottsbluff 6,520, Sioux 5,135, Morrill 3,299. The increase in the dry-land area amounted to 65% over that reported for 1920, and was almost all in Box Butte and Sheridan counties. In irrigated land it was more than 40% and showed mostly in Sioux and Morrill counties. Although at the beginning of the riiirging it was the general opinion of growers that the large acreage increase in the dry-land districts would be counterbalanced by the poor stand resulting from unfavorable conditions at planting time and the use of cull stock as seed, it developed that the average yield was near - ly up to normal . Yields on dry land ranged from 20 to 175 bushels an acre and averaged slightly better than 80 bushels, compared with 90 for the previous season. On irrigated land they ranged from 60 to 450 bushels an acre and averaged about 155, compared with 150 for 1920. The quality of the 1921 crop was somewhat below normal. The extremely hot summer weather, together with considerable rain, caused an unusual amount of fusarium wilt (developing as "stem-end rot"), and this disease disqualified for seed much of the stock raised for that use. The percentage of growth cracks and second growth in all districts, and scab as well, in the Central and Northern districts, was too high for much of the stock to meet No. 1 requirements. Of the shipments to November 15 (tabulated by grade), shipping point inspection showed 16% of the irrigated and 65% of the dry-land stock to have rolled as No. 2 grade. This does not mean that all the potatoes in the cars so graded were necessarily No. 2s. Since the state grading law requires that all carlot shipments of potatoes meet the requirements of at least the No. 2 grade and must be so designated unless they make the No. 1 grade, a car of No. 2 potatoes may contain stock which is anywhere be - tween the No. 2 and the No. 1 requirements. Because size was rarely a disqualifying item in western Nebraska stock this season, and because so much of the dry-land stock, though sound, was rough, making it necessary to call out from 20 to 60% from field run to make a No. 1 grade, comparatively few of the dry-land growers sorted their potatoes SEASON 1921 </seg>
            <seg id="p272">I 272 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE for a No. 1 grade. As a result, shipments designated as No. 2 con - tained all the way from 10 to 80% of No. 1 potatoes. This wide range in quality was the reason for a difference in price between cars within the No. 2 grade, frequently as high as 30 cents per 100 lbs., when the buyer saw the stock. Shipping point sales of No. 2s were generally satisfactory, but the variable quality made it difficult to sell them ad - vantageously by wire. The heavy movement of the crop was three weeks earlier and con - siderably more concentrated than usual. This was common to most &lt;&gt;f the important main crop potato states. The peak day for western Ne - braska was September 26, with shipments of 128 cars. For the week of September 25 to October 1 the total movement was 486 cars, which com - pares with 266 cars for the heaviest week of the previous season. In spite of the heavy shipments, the usual difficulty of a car shortage was not experienced. Money conditions forced many growers to dig and sell as soon as the crop was mature; and warm weather with the early harvest required the immediate shipping of much stock which would otherwise have gone into shipping point storage. Ninety cars were shipped in August. The early movement was from the Northern dis - trict, loading at points between Crawford and Ainsworth, and from the Irrigated district, loading between Bridgeport and Henry. Fields were much later in the Central district, because of later planting in an attempt to avoid scab, and digging there was not in full swing until September 20. Mitchell led in shipments to November 15, largely be- cause growers and shippers at that important point were not equipped •with storage facilities. On that date it was roughly estimated that there were 350 cars in storage at Morrill, 100 at Gordon, 75 to 90 each at Alliance and Hemingford, and lesser amounts at a few other points. Weather was too warm for efficient fall storing, which began in the first week of Octobor. A good deal of the stock placed in field pits for short storage developed dry-rot under bruised spots caused l&gt;y rough handling, and even that stored in cellars and warehouses showed ex - cessive shrinkage from heat. Other notable features this season were, cheaper farm labor; the building of more than 50 new storage cellars on the farms in the Ir- Tigated and Central districts; an increased use of field graders in the Irrigated and Northern districts; and decidedly more shipping in sacks rather than bulk, in the Central and Northern districts. Shipments from western Nebraska this season to November 15 in - clusive totaled 2543 cars, compared with 1340 to the same date in 1920, and 2767 cars for the entire season 1920-21. Of the 2403 cars shipped prior to November 16 this season for which destinations are available, 1130 went to points in Nebraska, 490 went into Missouri (many, prob - ably, to be diverted from Kansas City), 304 went to destinations in Iowa, and 119 to Kansas. Seed stock was shipped to Texas, Okla - homa, Arkansas, Louisiana and Colorado. </seg>
            <seg id="p273">273 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE More interest was shown in the growing of certified seed than form- erly. Growers entered 1085 acres for inspection; 566 acres passed the field requirements, and 44,885 bushels passed the third inspection and This represents about twice the acreage entered and were cert the atr rtified in 1920. Eight hundred bushels were Early Ohios were Bliss Triumphs. By counties, the acreage certified was: Box Butte 2:i.~&gt;, Kimball 139, Dawes 124, Sioux 61, Sheridan 7. November delivery sold at $2.40-50, for December de - and for January delivery at $3.00 per 100 lbs. f. o. b. shipping point. Uncertified Bliss Triumph seed sold at $1.60-2.00 in November, and $2-2.10 in December. Basis of sale in western Nebraska differ with the districts. In Irrigated district the usual method is for the gTOwer to grade and his car and sell it to a traveling buyer. The sale is frequently e in advance and the grower loads and ships as the buyer orders. ma Sales are quoted as "carloads f. o. b. cash track to growers". Several resident dealers buy on this basis and sell by wire, either "f. o. b. usual eiver assuming risk of damage in transit) or "delivered" term shipper assuming this risk). In the Central district, growers 3efl nostly in wagonloads. Buyers are either resident dealers who grade n the 8t&lt;»-k in a warehouse or car, or traveling representatives of out - side firms who buy wagonloads at the car door and supervise the load- ne. Tn the Northern district, growers sell both in wagonloads and car - r.ads, the latter basis prevailing especially in the smaller towns where juyers do not often stop. Consignment is seldom practiced except as v mergency measure. The market at the very beginning of the shipping was strong, and held surprisingly firm even under the unusually heavy shipments of September and the first two weeks of October. By October 15, dealers idlewestern towns which form the market for western Ne- V.raski potatoes were stocked up. Their country customers, who usually buy thoir winter potato supply in the fall, bought by the sack, rather than by the wagonload; and this hand-to-mouth buying (probably due w price of grain and livestock) was the chief factor mair contributing to the lifeless market for table stock during the rest of October and November. At western Nebraska shipping points, the wagonload price p:?r 100 lbs., bulk in the dry-land districts for No. 2 Early Ohios was $1.25-50 during the first three weeks of September. It dropped during the fourth week to a range of $1.15-40 and No. Is at that time sold for $1.40-60. Under pressure of the extremely heavy shipments for the country as a whole the price weakened gradually to a range of $1-1.15 for No. Is by the last week of October, and then the demand for table stock failed altogether. These prices for the Ma - son to November 15 were higher than in 1920, the general range for No. 2s this season being about the same as for No Is then, and No. It this season ranging 15 to 30 cents per 100 lbs. higher. In the Omaha </seg>
            <seg id="p274">274 I market, Nebraska No. 1 Early Ohios sold in job lots during the first half of September at a range of $2.50-3.00. The price weakened by the 22nd to $2.50, and by the end of the month to $2.25. By October 15 they were selling at $2.00, and by the 25th at $1.75. From then on tthe end of the period covered by this summary there were too few ;s to establish the market. The Bureau of Markets and Crop Estimates, U. S. Department of Agriculture, in cooperation with the Bureau of Markets and Marketing, Nebraska Department of Agriculture, maintained a field station at Alliance from August 24 to November 15, where daily reports of ship - ment information and market quotations were published and mailed free to a list of 1000 growers and dealers who applied for the service. On the following pages of this summary will be found informa - tion in a condensed form, on destinations of western Nebraska potatoes, shipments by gTade and loading: points, the potato movement from all important sections, and a table summarizing the shipping point in - formation by week*. </seg>

That we extend to our officers and to our board of directors jr thanks for the preparation of the very excellent program we ave enjoyed, and for the collection of the best exhibit we have yet That we thank the out of state men who have come here to it us in our program, and bring us in closer touch with our r states for the study of related interests. 4. That we recognize our obligations to the individual exhibitors who have so carefully selected the potato stock offered for compe- and who have placed our potato show on the high plane it now ys That we proclaim our Association is State wide in its scope 1 not a county or district organization, and that we approve of jur annual meetings visiting the different interested districts of &gt;ur state. 6. That we approve and endorse the interest which the Burling - ton Railroad has taken in the potato industry in sending this year for the second time a potato special into our state to better educate our shippers in the handling and shipping of potatoes. 7. That we approve and endorse the action of the Union Pacific Railroad in offering premiums for boys work in crop production, which cannot but stimulate the interest of the boys throughout the Union Pacific territory. x. That we greatly appreciate the recognition given the Asso - ciation by the State Board of Agriculture in increasing our allot - ment of state funds. </seg>
            <seg id="p286">286 9. That we would throughout the potato growing section bespeak from all of our members an interest in boys and girls potato cloba, that more of such clubs be organized, and that we as members of this association, and as experienced potato growers, express our willingness to assist these children to the best of our ability to make their potato plots a success. 10. That we bespeak a wider interest in the growing of seed po - tatoes in western Nebraska, that we heartily approve of the cer - tification system as it has so far been developed, that we recognize the great possibilities of this system for the future, and we urge upon all our members that the safe-guarding of this system is the life of the seed potato industry in this state. 11. That we acknowledge our appreciation of the work of the men from the College of Agriculture who are so ably assisting in the activities of this association and in the development of the potato industry, of the services of the County Extension Agents whose work has been plainly shown in the exhibits and in the fact that counties organized for County Extension activities have brought in the largest number of individual exhibitors. 12. That we commend the superiority of the present grading law over what we have had in the past, and we would especially com - mend the enforcement of this law by the State Department of AgTi - culture while we recognize that this Department had many obstacles to overcome, we believe that their enforcement of this law n a very potent factor in placing the potato industry of Nebraska on a higher level. 13. That we appreciate the advantage accruing to the grower in the publication of the daily market report of the U. S. Bureau of Markets and the State Bureau of Markets, and we urge its con- tinuation. Respectfully Submitted J. r. LAWRENCE JOHN COLEMAN J. M. TOLLMAN.

            <seg id="p319">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 319 WEDNESDAY MORNING SESSION January 4, 1922 The Thirty-seventh Annual Convention of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association met in the Dairy Building at the State Farm, Lincoln, Ne - braska, on Wednesday, January 4, and was called to order at 10:30 A. M - by the President, Mr. H. A. Morrison, of College View. THE PRESIDENT: We are glad to see so many men able to brave the storm and be in this building at this time. We feel we are especially privileged that the man who is to speak words of welcome to us has been willing to brave the storm and is with us. In introducing Mr. Zehrung, Mayor of the city of Lincoln, I de - sire to say he is one of the men who has been in the city for many years connected with business interests. He has been mayor of the city at a time previous to this, and we feel as a dairy association that we are especially privileged in having Mr. Zehrung speak words of wel- ome to us. (Applause.) A WORD OF WELCOME Mr. President and Gentlemen: From what you read in the paper, the farmer has been getting the worst of it, and I am glad to see some - thing coming his way today. They say what you want is moisture. From the prospects just now, you are going to get a lot of it. There is not any reason I should be here this morning except a desire of my friend, Mr. Frandsen, to compliment me by bringing me before you. If there is any man on top of earth who knows less about your business than I do, I do not know where he lives. I have belonged to an Association for more than twenty-five years that meets annually, and we have been addressed by mayors from San Francisco to Montreal, Canada, and from New Orleans to Boston; and when I sit in a conven - tion and hear a mayor get up and try to tell our convention something about our business, and listen to the way he gets it all mixed up and tells us nothing we want to know, and a whole lot of things in which we are not interested. I made up my mind if I were ever privileged to address a convention, I would not try to tell its members something about their business. I do not know anything about your business, and that is something everyone should know, because milk is the first thing we get when we come into this world and it is almost the last thing they feed us when we pass out. We are too weak when we come into the world to drink anything but milk, and the same way when we pass out. In the inter - vening time we drink milk with things in it, or drink things without Mr. F. C. Zehrung .Mayor, Lincoln, Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p320">320 KEFOKT Or NEMlAoK A oTATL BOArD KJT Ai&gt;K1 v L L I L Kl milk in them — (Laughter) aeptnding upon how much ability you have to drink the fusel oik that are going around over the country. So every man should know something about your business, but I do not know anything. I never was a farmer. That is one reason I will never be great. You always read the great man was once a poor boy and got up at four o'clock and milked the cows, and finally h€ gets to be President. You will readily see I will never be President — not even Governor. I do not know how it ever happened I was elected mayor for a second term. They got me out and then put me back again. I think this will be the end of my political career. I wouldn't want to be in Governor McKelvie's place, I will promise you that. (Laughter.) Yet I do not think there is a man in this world is more honest in what he thinks is absolutely right. I do not think there is a man in the State of Nebraska who more firmly believes he is doing what is for the beat interests of this State than Sam McKtlvie. I give him credit for being honest His judgment may be bad. That is not a political speech for the Governor, because he is out of politics. It is brought to my mind by a little incident that happened day before yesterday. You may have read General Pershinp has been here for a couple of weeks. A day or two ago Charlie Dawes — which is not a respectful way to speak of one of the biggest men of the country, but he is a Lincoln boy just as Pershing was — was here, and I attended a dinner and they got to talking about the budget. I presume you know General Dawes has just made a budget for the United States ander President Harding So the conversation went around the table, and something was said about McKelvie's budget. The Governor was there. He said to Charlie, "I wish you would come up and look over my budget and see what you think of what I am doing." The General, with his characteristic manner of speech, sai.t. "H— 1! What do I care about your budget? If you have as much trouble with yours as I have with mine, you will never want to see one as long as you live!" (Laughter.) Something was said about a man doing a thing to please the public. Charlie Dawes said, "That's the biggest mistake in the world. I am disgusted with the man who tries to do something to please the public. The only man who gets anywhere is the man who does what he thinks is right, regardless of what the public thinks. If he must wait for the public's approval before he does anything, he will not accomplish much". I do not think there is any class of men who know that more than you. If you had sat back and waited for public approval of how you should improve your stock and handle your product, you would never have advanced. It is because you have had the courage and industry and desire to labor hard enough to go out and do whatever is right. </seg>
            <seg id="p321">321 I do not mean you did not bave your President and Secretary and other people who could advise, or your school to come to; but you did what you thought was right. Edgar Howard said the other day that a near-great man was a man who would like to do right hut was afraid of public opinion. That is the way a lot of people are in this world. Thank God there is one class of people in this world who do not have to be afraid of public opinion I I refer to the farmers. Some of your work is mi{*hty hard. I said I never lived on a farm, but all of my relatives were farmers. I have three cousins who graduated from Ames and run ''arms, and another cousin who has an extensive farm in Iowa; so I have lived around the farm a great deal and I know far n work is not the most pleasant thing in the world, especially a morning like this. I have tried to ramble along and keep away from anything you could possibly criticize ine for the same thing I have criticized other mayors: trying t « tell you something I do not know anything about. I want tc say we are very glad to have you here. This week is * great week to Lincoln. Agricultural Week is looked forward to. It comes at a time when every merchant wants you to come. He figures ht has a chance to get some of your good money. While you hear about the farmer not having any money, you will notice about the only men who arc buying automobiles are the farmers. So we arc glad to have you here. We are very proud of our Univer - sity and of the people who are at the head of it and run this great in - stitvtion. It is a great pleasure to have you with us. I am only sorry the weather has been such so few could come. Those who did come I am sure will be amply repaid. It is a great thing to come to a con - vention and exchange ideas and get something from the other fellow. Every man can learn something from somebody else. None of us is M smart that there is not some other fellow who can tell us something that will be beneficial. If you get these ideas and go home and put them in practice, that is the thing that will build up not only the dairy industry, but every other industry in this country. I want to thank you in the name of the city for coming here, and trust your meeting will be both pleasant and profitable. I also want to express my thanks for the patience and courtesy with which you have listened to the few words of welcome I have been privileged to say to you. I Applause.) </seg>

            <seg id="p323">REPORT OF KEBKASKA STATE BOARD OF ACRICl LTl RE 323 RESPONSE The Mayor may have told you the truth when he said he did not know anything about your business. I would not question his veracity. But no man can come here and address you men without going out from this building- knowing something about the dairy business; so he never can tell that again. (Laughter.) The biggest question that is before the farmer and agricultural man and the dairyman today —the thing we have talked about the most — the loss that agriculture has had to take. When you stop to think the amount of fo:xl products put forth by our own splendid State and the rest of the states in the Union, and when you consider and know there are parts of the world that are in great need of those products and unable to get them, it tells to every individual there is something wn thr .&lt; lution of that great question that the men in our nation and our own men on the farm are undertaking to find today. And fie nutation of what we might term "good times" or the times that w« inarily expect to exist, depends a great deil on how that question olved or how soon it is solved. If you will go back with me forty years ago out on these prairies, there was never richer soil, fro n the standpoint of its ability to produce, than then. Yet it was not valuable. We may have all the other great I t&gt; . listing, but if we do not have the facilities for transporta - tht getting the thing to the place it is needed — the thing itself 1 i\ on;es valueless. An individual may know a great deal about the dairy business, but if he has not the a' ility to U32 it in that way — or ; t least the ability to give it to somebody else who may use it— it is not worth very much. with our food produ- ts. We may be able to get the food collected, but unless we have the other question thoroughly solved, we •e unable to meet the great need of the hour. There is another factor enters into this question. It is not only the financial condition of the farmer — and upon the condition of the farmer financially depends the condition of our country financially — but there is also the effect upon people's minds and hearts and characters. It tends to make anarchists and bolshevists to have these unusual con - ditions arise. So it is up to every one of us — to every farmer and dairyman in the State — to do his part, at least, to bring about that which we can build upon for the future in a good, strong way. I read a story the other day of a little girl whose parents had been poor, and all of a sudden they came into possession of a great fortune, and bought a large and splendid farm, all stocked. It had its horses and cows, its pigs and chickens. This little girl was showing a visitor President H. A. Morrison, College View, Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p324">324 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE about the place one day. The visitor asked if their hens laid a great many egga. "They can," replied the youngster, "but since we are in these new circumstances of ours, they don't have to". (Laughter.) Our soil can produce great crops. We have produced a wonderful crop of com. But most of the farmers feel in these new situations of ours, it does not make much difference. But the man who owns the dairy cow does not feel so much that way about it. The individual who has produced the corn feels he has produced it as a loss; so he is find - ing his way out by partially, at least, going into the dairy business. And so as 1 look over this country at the different classes of industry — I am speaking of the farming districts — I find the places affected the most by agricultural prices and where there is most depression are the sections in which they have depended entirely upon the products of the soil, sending them directly to the mill or shipping them out. But in such states as Wisconsin and some of our eastern states where they have been depending upon the dairy cow, we find they are moving along quite easily compared with those places depending upon the grain business alone. But the farrier is not the only man who is suffering. Go into our country banks or to the mercantile houses. Most of us know something of the problems they are having to solve. But there is no bank losing today on the dairyman. That is the thing the bankers tell us. If that ttrue, it ought to encourage us to go forward with our business and rn all we can with reference to it that we may produce more economi - cally; that we may come more nearly meeting the situation that is de - manded of us and that we may fulfil the need that is before us. Now, gentlemen, I should like to say to the Mayor that we greatly appreciate the words of welcome he has expressed to us for himself and for the city that he represents. Ard as we assemble here to help in this great agricultural problem— this preat national problem, too — I think we may congratulate ourselves that there is nothing that will come nearer solving this great question, as far as the farmers are concerned, than the good old dairy row. (Applause.) REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Mr. J. E. Palm, Lincoln. Nebraska Mr. President and Members of the Nebraska Dairymen's Asscia tion: I take pleasure in submitting my Annual Report. The past year has been a trying one in all lines of business, and especially so with the farmer. The one bright spot has been dairying, and I think that it has been the means of getting more farmers into the dairy game than anything else that could have happened. </seg>
            <seg id="p325">325 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Nebraska should be one of the leading dairy states, for here we have the roughage, cheap feed, and everything that goes in to making milk. There is not anything else on the farm that will pay as well a good dairy cow. Note these figures. A cow that gives 30 pounds of 4 per cent milk, which is a little less than four gallons a clay, with butter fat selling at 40 cents, will give you $36 per ton for your al - falfa hay, $24 per ton for your prairie hay, and $1.12 per bushel for your corn, besides the skim milk, a calf every year, and the manure for fertilizing your ground. Then why talk about burning corn and bemoan your fate that you can not get anything for your grain ? It is high time that we take a hunch and dig in and milk cows, and get more cows. Let us forget the grain for a while and make this a dairy State. We will make more money and live happier as well aa doing more for mankind, for there is no food known that will take the place of milk. In milk there is vitamine that is absolutely necessary for children, as well as grown folks. Statistics show that 40 per cent of the deaths in child life are due to the lack of milk. Do you realize that every time you feed your children substitutes you are robbing them of their health and growth? Let us remember that. Let us ad - vertise the dairy products wherever we go. Your Association is pushing the educational work constantly, creat - ing a heavier demand for milk and dairy products; but we need the in - dividual help of every man in the State. I hope that this coming: year you will take it upon yourself to further the demand for your products. If you do, you will be agreeably surprised at the results which can be reported here at our next meeting. There has been and is still a great demand for dairy cattle. In this connection, 1 would like to suggest that when you hear of any one looking for dairy cows, that you ask him to buy them in Nebraska in place of going out of the State for them. Let us keep some of this money in Nebraska. I would like to see you appoint a committee to take a census of the dairy cattle in the State, and get a list of those for sale, and also the names of those who are in the market; thereby through co-operation we can do all good. Your Board of Directors bought an exhibit — a mechanical cow, showing up various ways that milk can be used — which has been a great attraction. It is on display down town. It is constantly travel - ing, staying a week in each town. We feel that it has been a great factor in creating a dervand for more dairy products. The past year we had our usual display at the State Fair also our Dairy Parade, and it was even better than the year before. Watch </seg>

LThis year we want to do greater things than ever, and we ask your peration, for without your help it is difficult to accomplish as much as we should. Make yourself a part of the organization. One way you can all help is to get your neighbor dairyman to join our Association. Tell him to mail a dcllai to your Secretary and become a working partner in the Association, for in union there is strength. This is one Cthe oldest associations we have in the State, this being the thirty - venth year that it has been in existence. We hope that you will feel free to suggest anything that you hav» on your mind that will further the Association; for your officers ap - preciate suggestions, and will consider as a favor any criticisms you E»y have to give them.

JACOB SASS, Chalco: I move the report of the Secretary and Treaurer be accepted, the latter subject to the action of the Auditing Committee. The motion was seconded and carried. BUILDING THROUGH BREEDING. Mr. J. C. McDowell I nited States Dairy Division Specialist, Washington, D. C. A defeated candidate up in Minnesota found himself on the out - skirts of a crowd that had gathered to celebrate his opponent's victory. He was recognized and called upon to make a speech. At first he ob - jected, but finally was persuaded. He began by saying: "My opponents prophesied that I would be defeated and I was. They said that they would have five hundred votes to spare and they had. They said that they could beat me with a little yellow dog, and by George they've done it" Drouth, rain, hail, frost, wind and rust, or some other trouble over which we have no control often brings defeat to the wheat farmer, to the com farmer, to the cotton farmer, to the single crop farmer of any kind; but defeat seldom cornea to the man who diversifies his crops and who feeds those crops to high producing dairy cows. On the other hand, poverty, drudgery, disappointment, and failure are ever present with the owner of pour cows Everybody knows that profitable dairy cows must be comparatively large producers yet few people fully realize the remarkable rate at which profits advance as production increases. Figures obtained from the tabulation of the records of all the cows on test in 100 cow-testing associations show that as average butterfat production increased from 100 pounds to 150 pounds, the income over cost of feed advanced from $10 to $26, that is, an increase of 50 pounds in butterfat production gave an increased income over cost of feed of 160 per cent The next 50 pounds increase in butterfat production advanced the income over cost of feed to $42; the next to $58; the next to $74; the next to $90; the next to $106 and the next to $122. Briefly stated, as butterfat production increased from 100 pounds to 450 pounds the income over cost of feed advanced from $10 to $122, exactly $16, for every increase of 50 pounds in butterfat production or in other words as butterfat production increased 4V4 times che income over cost of feed advanced 12.2 times. These figures are approximate aa applied to any particular herd of dairy cattle, and they may apply only within a limited range of prodoc- </seg>
            <seg id="p328">328 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tion; yet within these limits they seem to hold true for all classes of dairy cows regardless of breed, age, weight, date of freshening, and geographical location. In one herd of cows whose records were tabulated by our division, the poorest cow, in one year's time, produced only enough income over cost of feed to buy a two-cent postage stamp. The owner is to be congratulated, because there are many cows that do not do so well as that. For his labor and miscellaneous expenses this owner had the manure, skim milk, and calf. An old Scotchman, when asked if he thought the manure, skim milk and calf paid labor costs and miscellaneous expenses, replied: "I'd rather have a wee bit mair." It may be that manure, skim milk and calf do pay labor costs and miscellaneous expenses, but intelligent selec - tion, breeding, and feeding should give us a big bit "mair." In one Virginia association, in 1917, there were 511 cows on test. Herd A, the highest producing herd, consisting of 16 cows had an average butterfat production of 306 pounds. Herd Z, the lowest pro - ducing herd, consisting of 91 cows, had an average butterfat produc - tion of 155 pounds. For herd A the average income over cost of feed was $75, and for herd Z the average income over cost of feed was 64 cents. The average cow in herd A produced more income over cost of feed than all of the 91 cows in herd Z. It would require 117 cows like those in herd Z to produce as much income over cost of feed' as was produced by the average cow in herd A. This is not fiction. These are actual records from real herds in a well organized cow-testing associa - tion. It pays to breed for high production of milk and butterfat. We now have the records of four years' work in the Grove City cow-testing association. The first year the average production of butter - fat was 225 pounds, the second year 261 pounds, the third year 280 pounds and the fourth year 300 pounds. The fourth year as compared with the first shows an average gain of 75 pounds of butterfat per year per cow. Multiplying that 75 pounds by the price and by the average number of cows on test gives the grand total of $15,887. As the price received per pound for butterfat the fourth year was one cent below that of the first year, that $15,887 may fairly be considered as newly created wealth due to the work of the cow-testing association. kin one cow-testing association whose records we have tabulated cows that freshened in April, May, June, and July produced an average income over cost of feed of $45. Those that freshened at some other time of year produced an average income over cost of feed of $60. In that association there were a few cows whose owners did not know the date of freshening. Those cows had an average income over cost of feed of $7.82. Somehow it pays to know. </seg>
            <seg id="p329">KEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 329 The dairyman who doesn't know what his cows are doing is the man who loses out in the dairy business. He selects by guess, he feeds by guess, he breeds by guess, and he is kept continually guessing as to how he is ever going to pay his debts. He works in ignorance when he might have knowledge. He flounders along in darkness when he might have light. He is like the ostrich, that buries its head in the sand and fears no danger. Finally when such a man loses out he blames the soil, the climate, or the cows, when in reality he should blame himself. There are several ways by which a dairy herd may be improved. The elimination of low producers increases average production, de - creases total production, and usually increases net profits. Better feed - ing of the cows we now have increases average production, increases total production, and may increase net profits. The use of better sires increases average production, increases total production and nearly always increases net profits. All dairy herd improvement due to better breeding tends to increase profits to the producer and to decrease costs to the consumer. It is one of the ways by which the world may become richer without decreasing the prosperity of any individual in it. Therefore, as I see it, the breeders of good purebred dairy cattle are among the world's greatest benefac - tors. According to the 1920 census only 10 per cent of the dairy bulls in Nebraska are purebred. In the entire state there were only 1951 purebred dairy bulls. The scrub dairy bull is doomed. The "Better Sires, — Better Stock" campaign has sounded his death knell. Scrub dairy bulls have done much damage in all parts of the United States, and no county has yet been able to report the complete elimination of the scrub dairy sire. Sometime soon some county will report the timely deaths of the last scrub and grade bulls within its boundaries. Then we'll make a map of the United States showing the district that is free of scrub sires, and proudly we'll label that district THE SCRUB FREE AREA. Scrub dairy cattle, in fact scrub livestock of any kind, can be sup - ported profitably only in those districts where there is a combination of cheap land, cheap feed, cheap labor, and good markets, and I defy any living man to find any such district today. There are at least three varieties of scrubs: the scrub purebred, the low-producing grade, and just plain scrub. According to locality, scrubs are known as scrub, native, mixed, common, mongrel, and piney woods cattle. A scrub cow has four legs, two horns, a hide and a tail. In all these respects she mpy resemble a dairy animal bat right there the resemblance stop*. </seg>
            <seg id="p330">330 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE OBLIVION. The chief editor of the U. S. Department of Agriculture said to the chief artist of the Department, "Draw me a picture of oblivion." Why did he want a picture of oblivion ? Because that is the place to which the Department of Agriculture desires to consign the scrub bull and all scrub sires of every kind. The chief artist called to his aid all the artistic talent of the De - partment and he is now at work on a most remarkable picture. In the foreground of the picture the pastures are green and beautiful but a little farther back the sands of the desert begin. A broad pathway leads off into the desert and disappears in the dim distance. All along the pathway are strewn the bones of the mammoth, the mastodon, the pterodactyl and countless other extinct animals that belong to the for - gotten ages of the past. For one reason or another each lost out and each has been discarded. The scrub bull has already left the green pastures and has begun his dismal journey into the desert sands. He looks back sadly and long - ingly but fate impels him on and he must go. Soon he will take his place among the extinct animals of earth and his bones shall bleach forever on the limitless desert of oblivion. Do you know that on July 1, 1921, there were in the United States, 452 cow-testing associations and that Nebraska hadn't even one? Do you know that in the United States there are 158 bull associations and that Nebraska hasn't even one? I sometimes wonder why? In bull associations, on July 1, 1921, Pennsylvania led all the States with a A total of 21. South Carolina was a close second with 20. Minnesota was third with 15 and Mississippi was fourth with a total of 12. I did not come here to urge you unduly or against your will to organize cow-testing associations and bull associations, but I believe it would be well worth while for you carefully to consider the advantages of two organizations that have done so much for the farmers and dairymen in other Districts. The people of Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Minne - sota, Mississippi and many other States have found that that kind of work pays them and I believe it may pay you. What is a co-operative bull association? A co-operative bull asso - ciation is a farmers' organization whose chief purpose is the joint owner - ship, use, and exchange of three or more high-class, purebred bulls. The typical association owns five or six high-class, purebred bulls. The territory covered by the association is divided into as many breeding blocks as there are bulls and one bull is assigned to each block which may contain as many as 50, 60, or even 100 cows. The bull is not owned by the farmers of the block but all the bulls are owned in common by the entire association. When a bull dies, or is discarded for any </seg>
            <seg id="p331">KEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRIITLTI RE 331 reason whatever, he is replaced by the association and not by the farmers of the block to which that bull had been assigned. To prevent inbreeding the bulls are interchanged, or moved from block to block every two years, and thus at a small initial cost, good provided for a period of ten or twelve years. Why, purebr really, it often costs less in money, and it always costs less in time and trouble, to own a share in a good pure bred dairy bull than to be the sole owner of the scrubbiest kind of a scrub. Through the co-operative bull association the cost of service is greatly reduced, the man of limited means is enabled to improve his herd and bulls of outstanding merit are kept as long as they live or as long as they are fit for service. Mr. Winkjer, who is in charge of the bull association work or the Dairy Division of the United States Department of Agriculture tells me that in one association, four $275 bulls were purchased at an average cost of $42 per farmer; in another association six $275 bulls yere pur - chased at an average cost of $53 per farmer, and in a third association four $1,200 bulls were purchased at an average cost of $240 per member of the association. Tne well organized bull association does not spread infectious abortion but it encourages sanitation that helps to prevent the spread of that disease. Infection conies largely through feeds soiled with discharges and afterbirths. There is as yet, no successful medicinal f cure for infectious abortion but it can generally be prevented through proper sanitation, the use of maternity stalls, immediate isolation of aborters and the segregation of all purchased animals until they are &gt;wn to be free of the disease. The tabulations of the records of the Carroll County, Maryland cow testing association for the testing year 1915-16 show that of the 17 daughters of association bulls, 16 excelled their dams in butterfat pro - duction. I suppose Bryan would say "That's 16 to 1." On an average, the daughters produced 1,144 pounds more milk than their dams and 26.7 per cent mort butterfat. For the testing year 1916-17, for the same association we have the records of 16 daughters of association bulls. In butterfat production, 14 of the 16 excelled their dams, the average increase of daughters over dams being 30 per cent. That in itself is a very good showing, yet it is only when the production records of all the daughters are computed and compared with those of the dams that a bull's true value to one generation can be known. In addition to this, his influence on production will be noticeable and valuable for many generations. A scrub dairy cow is worthless because she yields no profit A scrub dairy bull is worse than worthless because he quickly drags the remainder of the herd down to his low level. The following figures are on file in the Dairy Division of the United States Department of Agri - culture. </seg>
            <seg id="p332">332 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In one year's time a scrub cow produced 146.8 pounds of butterfat Her daughter, sired by a scrub bull, produced 1,263 pounds of butterfat and the granddaughter, sired by the same scrub bull produced 99.7 pounds of butterfat The owner finally woke up. sold the scrub bull and purchased a good registered bull. With respect to cattle, that farm is now a scrub free area. The registered Guernsey bull, Imp. Primrose's Billy of Waddington, was at the head of a grade Guernsey herd in the Leon Valley, (Wisconsin) Cow-Testing Association. After he had been in the herd a couple of yean it was decided to send him to the butcher to prevent in-breeding. "For a time," as the tester reported, "things looked bad for Billy aa he was headed straight for the block." Just in the nick of time six of his daughters furnished records at the ages of two and three. Figured to maturity the average production of the daughters was 7,886 pounds of milk and 397 pounds of butterfat On an average the daughters produced 1,918 pounds of milk and 105 pounds of butterfat more than the average of their dams. The cow-testing association records saved Billy's life and he is now at the head of a purebred Guernsey herd. The expression, "swat the rooster", applies to one farm enterprise and to one season of the year. The expression, "swat the scrub," applies to every class of livestock and to every season of the year. In speaking of our 10 billion dollar livestock industry, the 1919 Yearbook of the United States Department of Agriculture says: "Better breeding will save a billion dollars." If that is true it is a safe assertion that the scrub sire does more damage in this country each year than is done by lightning, hail, river floods and forest fires. Like weeds and rust, like plant disease and insect enemies, he is an ever present source of great expense and loss. That is true in connection with the management of every class of live - stock, but it applies especially to dairying. No matter what the average production of the dairy herd may be, the scrub sire will quickly drag the descendants down to the low level of his ancestors. It is dangerous, extremely dangerous to mate any untried bull with a large number of purebred, well-bred, high producing dairy cows. Sometimes even a well -formed registered bull, of good ancestry, is in reality a scrub. His appearance and his pedigree mislead and by the time he has producing daughters, he may have undone nearly all the work of a long line of carefully selected prepotent dairy bulls. This has happened over and over again in the breeding of dairy cattle. The herd advances for a time, then comes one fatal step and the herd slips back almost to where it was before. Many years ago, the New York Agricultural Colleee bought a purebred Holstein cow named "Glista." For five successive generations good built were used. Glista produced 225 pounds of butterfat in a </seg>
            <seg id="p333">333 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE year and her daughters averaged 272. The next generation averaged 443 pounds of butterfat, the next 394. the next 384, and the next 414. Then came the fatal step and the next generation averaged 294 pound* of butterfat a year: exactly 149 pounds below the average of the ances - tors four generations farther back. In average butterfat production that family of cows was almost back to ita beginning and all because no mortal nan can select with any great degree of certainty on form andi pedigree alone. If you sell feeds to dairy cows you have a constant market. If you sell feeds to high producing dairy cows you have a good and con - stant market. If you sell feeds to purebred, well-bred, high-producing dairy cows you have a double market; a market for calves and a market for milk. In dairying, the feed market is always exactly what you make it. Farmers of Nebraska what is to be the future of your dairy herds? Will your herds grow better or poorer as the years pass by? The wise dairy farmer is building today a dairy herd that will increase tomorrow's income. The owner must be ever on the alert to stamp out and to keep out all diseases of every kind and the herd most be well bred. Careful and intelligent feeding, care and management lift the dairy business to a certain level but the highest level can be reached only when to this is added careful selection and intelligent breeding. When all this takes place in every dairy district we will have reached the dawn of the great golden age of dairying. Whether that date may be near at hand or far way in some dim distant future depends upon ourselves. We have not been living up to the best we know: We have been picking up a few pebbles on the beach while the great ocean at progress lay outstretched before us. Let us be up and doing and in fifteen or twenty yean we can easily double the average production of our dairy cows and by doubling average production we will much more than double net profits. In conclusion, let me say, that I sincerely believe that the dairymen of Nebraska are engaged in a business of which they may well feel proud. It is fairly profitable, intensely interesting, and better than all else it furnishes an abundance of food for all our people. He who thinks only of the financial success of the business has fallen far short of our highest ideals. We all love wealth in some form. A few seek wealth in the form of power and strive for every high position. Some satisfy ambition more quietly by adding pages to the world's best literature. Many there are who prefer their wealth in houses, lands, and gold; but there are many people who are willing to pass by all these ordinary forms of wealth and accept the satisfaction that comes from a life well spent in the service of their fellowmen. That is the kind of service that was </seg>
            <seg id="p334">334 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE rendered constantly by our brave boys across the sea. May that idea of service be the aim, ambition, and ideal, not only of all who are assembled here today, but of every farmer, yes, of every citizen in the United States of America. PROFESSOR H. P. DAVIS: May I tell Mr. McDowell that whil we for some years labored in the bog of darkness, we now have a Cow Testing 1 Association in this State and expect to have more in the futun Mr. McDOWELL : I am very glad to hear it. MR. LYNN SHELDON, County Agent of Polk County: I was •wondering if it would be possible to get a copy of Mr. McDowells lecture for publication in our issues that we put out in the county? I feel as if the farmers as a whole, whether they be wheat growers or what, would certainly be benefited by having the privilege of reading; that lecture. It seems to me if it could be provided, it would be of great benefit to us to spread this information. THE PRESIDENT: All the talks are reported and published in the Year book. You can have access to that. It goes to every member of the Association. When we assembled a year ago at our annual meeting, we wen considerably disturbed as to whether or not we were going to hav&lt; anybody at the head of our Dairy Department here in the Agricultura College. While .ve lost the man we had, yet we did not lose him froir the State. I am sure we all appreciate that. So instead of having i one splendid man leading out in the dairy business, now we have tw I do not know what happened to Professor Frandsen — wheth was something held him from getting over the line or not. he sti'l is with us, and we are glad. We are also glad we have been able to import 1 the dairy business as the head of the Dairy Department of the Agri cultural College.

Methods of Marketing H. P. Davis Professor of Dairy Husbandry, University of Nebraska They handed me my topic to talk on. I do not claim to be an authority or. marketing. You see like Mayor Zehrung, I am going to five you an alibi. But I have found out a few things in looking at the problem that may come as new points to you, at least they came as new ones to me. </seg>
            <seg id="p335">335 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Mr. McDowell told you we needed better cows. That is the funda - mental part of the dairy industry and we can have them. In fact we have already many (food examples in this State of wonderfully developed herds We have dairymen of whose herds any state could be proud. The trouble is that the rest of us do not live up to that standard. We are only bnrting ourselves if we do not do it. Now is a {rood. chance to start in with the New Year and do that. But after we get this production increased, there still remains the big problem of marketing. In the early days the fanner's problem of marketing was simple. He produced, and then was his own con - suiver. Since h» was the producer and consumer, there was no difficulty about the middleman. But as our country grows larger and a larger proportion of our people go into the city, we must develop different methods of getting our products to them. Today it is not practical for every farmer to bring in his own milk. It is evident, therefore, that, as our civilization develops, a different kind of service to the consumer must be provided. Sometimes it is not realized, but the consumer demands certain services. In Lincoln he demands that a bottle of milk ut on his front porch at the same time every morning. If we are willing to give it to him, we are going to reduce the demand for at product, for service is a fundamental necessity in our system of narketing Somebody must collect the milk from the individual farmers; proc - it — because milk today is processed to a large extent. It must be I, pasteurized, and Uott'ed — all of which taWs time and labor lipment and skill. If you do not think so, just go out and try a milk plant a little while. We are still learning some things e at the Agricultural College and we know it takes skill to do it. Those are things very often not realized when it is said there are too many middle men. A certain service is necessary for the consumer. To do that service a middle man is needed. I do not say he may not be the farmer when he operates in a co-operative organization. But it is alon? othpr lines I am point? tn talk to von this morning. ther lines I am going to talk to you this morning. METHODS OF MILK MARKETING Department Dairy Husbandry, University of Nebraska Address before Nebraska Dairymen's Association, January 4, 192?. Practical profit from dairying depends upon two things, cheap or economical production and efficient marketing. Stress has been laid upon the problems of production for decades and there is still abundant room for improvement. Dairv cows todav nndou'tedlv produce on the average larger Quantities of milk and butterfat due to the improvement caused H. P. Davis, Chairman </seg>
            <seg id="p336">336 BEPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE by selection, breeding, and to better feeding. Probably today the average dairy cow would be considered a more wonderful animal if other economic factors such aa increase in land values, cost of labor, and feed had not risen so rapidly at the same time. Figures malign the dairy cow of today I believe when it places her production at the low figure of census and assessors' reports. If we were to believe them ever:.- kind of a bovine female must be classed as a dairy cow just because she orcasionally gives milk. Progress has been made however when we witness the fact that a Holstin cow has produced more than 37,000 pounds of ir&gt;ilk in a year or over 102 pounds each day. Nebraska has a cow that has produced more than fifteen tons of milk and two cows that have produced more than 1,000 pounds of butterfat. t While there has been a great advance in developing larger produc - dairy cows and more effective and efficient methods of feeding, re has not been the corresponding progress in that other necessary phase of profitable dairying — marketing. Successful marketing consists of disposing of a product so that producer and consumer both are fur - nished with convenient service and that producer shall receive and consumer get a fair return for money invested. The farmer of a half century or more ago had the ideal system, namely, he produced and in turn was a consumer of his own products. Times have changed. Agriculture has become and is constantly becom - ing more highly specialized. Consequently a farmer produces only a few products and is himself a buying consumer for many others. Marketing of dairy products has shown a gradual change in the last two decades. At first the surplus dairy products were disposed of as farm-made butter and to a lesser extent farm cheese. Then came the cream separator and stimulated dairying by increasing the market - ing facilities. Small creameries sprang up and these in many sections have been replaced by large centralizers largely because the small creameries did not have good marketing facilities for their product. Condensed milk, ice cream, and milk for city markets were comparatively recent developments as markets for milk. Today a producer of milk has the following possible markets for his product; market milk, milk for cheese, milk for condensing, milk for drying, cream for butter and for ice cream. Of course, all pro - ducers do not have any such choice of markets, the locality usually governing that. Now milk is produced in varying quantities by thou - sands of farmers few of which are so situated as to be able to deal direct with the ultimate consumer. An intermediary or middleman is necessary, therefore, in order to collect the milk, sort, grade, process and package it for the consumer's use. One middleman is the second shortest route from producer to consumer. But the service that con - sumer demands, ending with the delivery at his door of a uniform. </seg>
            <seg id="p337">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 337 well graded product of the highest quality, usually results in a succes - sion of middlemen. An example might be selected of a country creamery that buys cream, processes it, makes it into butter, packages it into tubs or prints. The creamery ships to a commission man in Chicago who in turn sells it to a wholesale grocery or jobber. From there it goes to a retail grocer and thence to the consumer's table. "Too many middle - men," you say. True, yet this system is the result of each class furnish - ing a certain service which we have all apparently been willing to allow and pay for. Middlemen must not be condemned entirely for they have unquestionably enlarged the market by furnishing the consumer with a ce&gt;t:iin service that increased the demand. When it is made easy to do so. ih ■ consumer tends to buy more of a desirable article of food. But in this development, very frequently the producer was pinched. His share of the product did not return a profit on the investment. That led to a demand for higher prices and the consequent blaming the other fellow. Producer viewed middleman and consumer with suspicion and the ill feeling engendered was returned with interest. Such all too frequently is the condition today. Producers of milk are interested in greater returns from their pro - duct. The question is therefore how to obtain such returns. Various schemes have been tried, some successfully, others unsuccessfully. There are two principles that have been used by the producers in an effort to obtain higher prices for milk which will be principally discussed, namely, Collective bargaining. Producers taking over the functions of the middleman. In collective bargaining, the producers by banding together in such numbers as to practically control the market supply have been able to have some voice in the price paid for milk by middlemen. They have never been able, and will never be able permanently, to set an arbitrary price for milk. A democracy does not believe in the exploitation of food products for private gain. Much good has been accomplished, how - ever, through collective bargaining. Trade evils have been eliminated and better feeling among all connected with the industry is evident. </seg>
            <seg id="p338">338 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE NEW YORK DAIRYMEN'S LEAGUE The methods of operating a collective bargaining organization and the plan of operation of typical ones might prove interesting. The New York Dairymen's League is probably the largest, and is one of the oldest of such organizations. The original plan of operation is as follows: It was started in 1907 and in 1909 was incorporated as a stock corporation. Legally the voting should have been according to stock holdings, but it always has been on the basis of one man, one vote. The membership covered six states and was distributed as follows: 70,000 in New York; 13,000 in Pennsylvania; and 10,000 in the states of New Jersey, Vermont, Massachusetts and Connecticut. Of the 93,000 probably 75,000 are now active producers. The territory was divided into 24 districts or units each one of which sent; a delegate to the annual meeting carrying the proxies of the members of that district. Individual members however might attend, and cast their own votes. The delegate and members agree upon a man whom they wish to represent them on the board of directors and this man's ele&gt; tion has always been assured. A quali- fication of a director was that he must be a milk producer. Tht mens' League had a signed contract with each member by wl w league was authorized to bargain for the sale of the mem a year. For this service the league received a fee of one dred weight of milk. The price of milk was fixed as at a r from New York City and the same price was named to e: the region covered by the league, three fourths of the milk to New York or other cities in the territory as market i mainder was manufactured into ice cream, condensed mi cheese.

Another fundamental weak means of handling a surplus and thus keepi A recent re-organization has been accomplished by the league. The new organization is called the Dairymens' Cooperative Association and has more than 50,000 members already. The differences in the new or - ganizaton are that it is authorized to collect the money for its members, blend the receipts, make deductions for expenses, collect working capi- tal, and to direct the producer to deliver his milk at any given point. For the purposes of sale, milk is divided into different classes: Clas3 1-Whole milk for market; Class 2-Milk for ice cream making; Class 3-Milk for condensaries; and Class 4-Milk for butter or cheese making. The di - vision into classes is an important st°p since it must be evident that all the milk produced in the territory covered could not be utilized as market milk. Milk that is used in the manufacture of other products has a lower value than market milk value according to the nature of the pro - duct. The highest price is paid for market milk while that used for cheese </seg>

TWIN CITIES PLAN laigaining organization is that in use in St. Paul Minneapolis, which we will call the Twin Cities Plan. Briefly it was stock organization with one share of $1.00 taken by a dairy - i*ach four cows. This organization operated for a time but f disolved by paying out $6.50 for each dollar paid in. It was ganized on the present plan with a capital of $50,000 and shares $50.00. These shares can be paid for by assigning 5 cents per ht of milk per month. One vote is allowed each milk and a limit of $1,000 is made on stock ownership. The stock nterest.

All the busi - organization is handled from a central office. All payment* alers are made to the organization which in turn pays the embers. The organization has some 4000 open accounts, sup- it cost, and contracts with the dealers for milk at a set w something more than $310,000 invested in plants for handlirir surplus, and a substantial sinking fund. The plants are run on a basis of cooperative creameries and the proceeds distributed in Under the above arrangement, some 13,000,000 pounds 1. of milk a month are handled in the flush season. Only one grade is made and t"iat is for 3.5 per cent milk with a premium for tests above that figure and a deduction for tests running under that. Of course it is un - derstood that only the milk of stock holders is handled. To them each month a statement is sent which gives in detail the operations and ac - counts for the month. The cost of operating under this organization of co arse varies but an average for each hundred weight of milk is 8.7 cents </seg>
            <seg id="p340">340 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE for general expense, 9.22 cents for plant operation, 2.17 cent* for sup - plies or about 20 cents per hundred weight. NEW ENGLAND PLAN In some ways the New England Milk Producers Association has dif - ferences that are worthy of notice. It covers a territory that has not only a large central market but numerous other markets of varying size. The association, which has about 24,000 members, 50 districts and 560 locals, covers most of New England. Under the plan of organization five or more dairymen may form a local; the county locals form a District, and the district elects a representative that meets to elect the vice president, treasurer, clerk, auditors, and the board of directors. The latter then choose one of their number for president and select a salaried manager who is entirely responsible for all help. The board further selects a central marketing committee of six to determine the prices for the Boston market. Each of the other principal markets in the territory has a local marketing committee of four and one member from the cen - tral association sits with them. The New England Milk Producers As - sociation is essentially a sales organization, each of the members of which contract with the organization to sell milk at one-half of one per cent of the fross receipts. The oriranization collects all funds and from the amount deducted pays the local unit 10% of all money collected from that unit and in addition 5 per cent of all district funds go to the district for their financing. Efforts are thus made to avoid too much centralization. Of course all the milk in this territory is not used as market milk. Much of it goes into manufactured products. In order to determine the quantity that is so used, the dealers report to the state commissioner of agriculture all purchase* of milk and all manufactured products. He, by means of a series of factors that have been agreed upon, converts such products into bulk milk. Allowing then for the cost of manufacture it is possible to determine the value of milk according to its use. The or - ganization and the milk dealers agree on the price of market milk and the open market determines the value of manufactured products. The territory is divided into zones, and the price to the farmer is the city price less the freight, can charge, and the country station charge for the zone. The price of milk in a zone is blended to take care of the manu - factured product which brings a lower price. In the territory there are 21 zones. The average ship to Boston is 200 miles and the cost, 3\ cents a quart for freight or express. In order to be in a still more favor - able position, the New Fne-land Milk Producers Association has acquired several of the lanrest milk distributing plants in New England paying for fhem slowly and rotating the stock ownership according to the patronage. There seems some likelihood that they will eventually take over the dis - tribution of milk in many of the cities in the territory. </seg>
            <seg id="p341">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 341 MICHIGAN PLAN The dairymen's association after a severe fight with the various hand - lers and manufacturers of milk has evolved a plan for setting the market milk price for Detroit that appears to be giving satisfaction. Briefly it consists of a commission of five, appointed by the governor; or. it are an ex-governor, the state dairy and food commissioner, the state director of the bureau of markets, the professor of dairying at the state agri - cultural college, and a member of the state board of agriculture. la addition, three other members from Detroit, a representative from the chtmber of commerce, a representative from the women's clubs of the city, and one from the federation of labor. This commission of eight haa access to producers' and distributors' books and employs an accountant the price to be paid the producer and the price to the consumer from month to month. The plans discussed do not by any means cover the entire field, bat are illustrative of the different types in actual operation. ESSENTIALS IN MARKETING MILK Producers have gem-rally felt that they were not receiving a fair pro - portion of the consumer's dollar. Doubtless in many cases that has been true. This feeling has led to the various forms of organization that have been discussed. In these the producers have first endeavored to obtain a better price through collective bargaining and later by taking over the function of the middlemen through a cooperative organization. Collective bargaining alone is effective when a large enough proportion of the supply i? controlled and when a proper and efficient method is devised for tak - ing rare of surplus milk and for such milk as can not conveniently be an the market without processing. The latter two point * have i hampered the success of the collective bargaining or sales organization, since unless there are means provided by the organization for to ■trolling r-.e supply there will be flood periods that will bring disaster. Gradually growing out of the original bargaining organizations are new organiza - tions that are acquiring milk processing plants — butter or cheesa "act- ones, condensaries and drying factories. By having these plants they can control the supply to any large city, keep it even during all seasons, and prevent flooding the market. Certain organizations are acquiring dis - tributing plants in the larger centers and when this is done, the producer will have complete control of his product until it reaches the consumer. The toll of the middleman will then go into the farmers' pocket. It should be possible by eliminating wasteful duplication to reduce ma - terially the cost of distributing milk. The way is not all rosy for the success of such schemes as may be witnessed the failure in different parts of the country of such cooperative enterprises. If producers would remember four important features, many troubles would be eliminated. </seg>

DAIRY EXTENSION ACTIVITIES Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I have been asked to discuu the extensian activities that have been carried on in this State the past year, and discuss briefly some of the projects we have worked on. I shall not go into them in detail, but I will be. glad to try to answer any questions. The general policy in carrying on our extension work throughout the State this year has been to outline and carry out our projects in co-' -er - ation with the Farm Bureau. We have worked with the organized ex - tension forces in the State in carrying out our projects. The main projects touched this year — those on which we have spent f our time — were the co-operative cow testing association, the co-operative bull association, boys' and girls' club work, and the inter - esting of farmers in dairying generally, bringing in a better class of dairy stock. Due to the financial conditions, for one thing, we wee not able to do much with the co-operative bull association; and when we did try to work it, where the prospects seemed most favorable for starting an association, the farmers said they would rather own a bull of their own. The market conditions are such that any number of good bulls in the State are going begging on the market. Due to the low price at which pood bulls could be bought, there did not seem to be a great deal if in - terest in bull association work, and we did not accomplish much on that project. Neither did we accomplish as much as we had hoped for with the cow testing association work, but we have one association — the Platte Valley Cow Testing Association in Scotts Bluff county — that is composed of 28 herds with 421 cows in it. It has proved very successful so far, and has Professor M. N. Lawritson, Lincoln, Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p346">346 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGR1CILTURE been quite a factor in increasing an interest in the dairy business in that section of the State. We are hopeful of getting at least two more such associations organized this year. The boys' and girls' club work has proved one of the projects in which we could do the most in a missionary way in creating an interest in the dairy industry in sections where it is not already practiced. I think it was David Grogan who said there is more discipline in the continued care of a cow than in many a term of school. At the time, he probably did not realize he was hitting the keynote of the newer education — boys' and girls' club work. This year we have had eight dairy calf clubs with seven dairy club members. Each member has raised a heifer of a dairy breed and taken * great deal of interest in the club work. Where we cannot parents through any other projects, they have become interest* the boys and girls. Our greatest handicap has been to get the breeders to co-operate with us to the extent of selling a heifer at a price the boys anc They usually asked prices that were prohibitive. We would rather se« them take grades than not get any start at all. If we can set the breed I Another thing we should consider for this coming year is the devising &gt;me means whereby the farmer can market his surplus milk at a profit, u confronted with this question every time I go out to talk dairying icreasing production. The Sist question the producers ask is, "How [ going to dispose of this milk after I do cot it? What is the use of easing the production when I can't get anything for the milk after I &gt; it?" They want to know what is the reason for this surplus and for price dropping. If we can co-operate in some way — either by putting on an educa - tional campaign teaching the value of milk as a food, or in some other way increase the consumption — it would help. It has been suggested we get ■e of the n-ilk condensaries to put in a branch plant.

These few said they could not afford to do it, so the plan fell through.

            <seg id="p347">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 347 amount of milk each day. The question arises: Is it wise for us to go ahead and get enough cows and figure on them coming in, or can w» devise some other means? We have letters coming in from farmers wanting to know where they can sell their milk. The places where they have been selling have ad - vised them not to ship any more. It seems to me one of the problems we can spend a little time on would be that of trying to work out a plan whereby this surplus milk would be taken care of. They have suggested a farmers' co-operative condensary in some sec - &gt;ns. Thi-y called the farmers together and we talked it over. I ex- it much ft would cost to equip a condensary, and that was the head. They decided there would be nothing to that if they invest $60,000 to get a small commercial condensary csent time we have no solution for this problem of disposing us milk. I should like to have the opinion of some of you, or as to how we are going to answer those questions as they are If you have any ideas as to what would be the best method JtfK ach I would appreciate hearing them. Mr. Boomer.) MR. BOOMER: I do not know that I can give a suggestion which &gt;uld be of any immediate help. There has been a great deal of talk in gard to the development of a local plant. They are handicapped in the tvay the producer is. They are not able to find an outlet for their t. That seems to be the difficulty in the way. There has not been very much done along the line of finding a market in a co-operative way for dairy products, that has come to my attention, in the State. MR. H. F. M.-IXTOSH, Omaha: Does not the sale of their cream satisfy PROFESSOR LAWRITSON: Yes, up to the time they informed them not to ship any more. I had a letter from Fillmore county where one farmer had been told by the Fairmont Creamery not to ship more milk. He wanted to know if we knew of some place where he could market hi* milk. A good many would rather keep the skim milk than sell the whole milk, and others are looking for a market for their whole milk. It depends on local conditions. Sometimes there is a shortage and again they have a surplus. The question that is put to me every time I advocate in - creasing production through the means of cow testing associations—cull - ing out the inferior cows— is, ''What is the use of milking more cows when we cannot get anything for the milk we have?" If we can figure out some way by which we help the farmers take care of the surplus, it seems to me we will have solved the biggest problem before us at the present time. Personally, I do not know of any way to get around that. </seg>
            <seg id="p348">348 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MB. NOYES: We are booming the business. We have no selling or - ganization and no way to get rid of the milk. Let me give you an illustration. I had a neighbor who last fall a year ago, when he was milking twenty cows, started to draw the milk to the creamery, selling as whole milk. He took it with his own truck. He in - creased his cows until by the first of Marcn he was milking forty-five cows, but his milk check had not increased a bit. The first of September this year he was milking forty cows and selling the milk as whole milk. Today he is milking sixty cows and getting the same old milk check. It looks to me as if we should stop booming the dairy business until we can market the milk. A dairyman went to a creamery and wanted a contract He said he would guarantee the delivery to them. They K, "We do not like to take so much milk from one man. You have 000 invested in your dairy and you want a reasonable amount of in - terest on that investment. We buy from the little fellow and he does not figure on getting any interest. If he gets enough to buy the groceries, he is satisfied. I think it is wise to stop booming the dairy business until we get to a place where we can market profitably and get interest on the money in - vested. MR. C. L. JONES, Colfax: I do not think we should stop producing better dairy cattle. The fanner needs education. He wants to learn to raise a patch of alfalfa and some Jersey cows; then have some cows that when he sells their off spring the butcher will buy them; then milk a good cow, and what is left over let the pigs have it. You will get some - thing besides the cream check. You will add fertility to your soil and have money at the end of the year. I do not think the average farmer has any idea of going into the dairy business, but he does need to be ed - ucated along the line of a better dairy cow which will make more money for the same amount of food. MR. SLOCUMB, Aberdeen, S. Dak. : I would like to know how fast can you increase dairy cows and get an over-production ? PROFESSOR LAWRITSON: It depends on what you mean by an over - production. MR. SOLCUMB: You can double them in about ten years PROFESSOR LAWRITSON: As far as an over-production of good dairy cattle in this State is concerned I do not think there is any im - rrediate danger of it. Our greatest need is better dairy cows instead of more dairy cows. Get rid of the poor one3 and replace them with good ones. Your poor cow takes the same amount of food and labor your good cow does; so why not have a cow that will return more profit? If we can get the farmers interested in getting better cows, they will build up the herd in that way. </seg>
            <seg id="p349">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 349 MR. SLOCUMB: We threshed these same things quite a while ago in our State. PROFESSOR LAWRITSON: Did you find any way of solving the pro - em of yetting rid ot your surplus milk? MR. SLOCUMB: We do not have this surplus milk. We cream separ - ate it on the farm. We cannot get enough of the skim milk to feed. If the n the fall and you feed your winter calves, by the time the pigs come along in May, your calves can wait if you wean them. You v.-an feed those pig3, and that is what you want to keep th^ cholera away. MEMBER: If you feed a calf you have something to sell. MR. SLOCUMB: A calf of the dairy breed will grow just as fast as the shorthorrs if you sjet the right kind. THE PRESIDENT: The question that seems to bother them is this: If we increase the production, how long will it be before the price of butter fat drops? MR. SLOCUMB: You want to figure on this: At how much lower price than you are now getting can you make a profit on your milk? We are paying ten dollars a ton for feed and seiling it through the cow for forty collars. That's profiteering. We can afford to sell it for twenty-five dol - lars instead of forty, if we can get help. We have a creamery costing $140,000. All the profit above expenses goes to the dairymen. We have 3500 producers. PROFESSOR LAWRITSON: That is the question put to me in different sections of the State— whether or not it is feasible to market in a co- operative way? But as Mr. Davis said yesterday, if you have all the things he mentioned, you would probably make a success of it. My observation has been the main trouble with the farmers of thia State in co-operative organizations has been that they might be com - pared with a group of small pigs on a cold day, huddled together for protection and warmth. That individual pig is not going into it for the benefit of the rest of them. So just as long as the individual farmer sees he is getting more than from an outsider, he sticks; but as soon as an oi'tsider offers him more, he loaves his organization and the thing falls through. If they could get some binding contract it might be that would be the solution of this problem. The trouble with the average Nebraska farmer is, he does not want to riiilk cows. He wants the calf to do the milking. He won't do it until he is right up against the wall. Then he will milk to get a little money, and as soon as he gets on his feet again, he quits milking cows. We can buy some of the best cows there are for sale and give them to </seg>
            <seg id="p350">350 these farmers, but if that is the way they operate, they will soon tear down these herds. It seems to ne one of the best things this Association ran do is to find some means to help the farmer (ret rid of this surplus milk at a profit. I have gone over these projects hurriedly. If you are interested in them in detail, I will be glad to furnish you with a typewritten copy so that you can go over it yourself. I will not take any more of your time unless there are some more questions. MR. W. W. JENKINSON, Monroe: I believe in petting the city people to use more milk. There are thousands in the city not using enough milk. There are enough of people in this State to take care of every hit of sur - plus milk we have, if it is properly advertised. The city children need milk more than anything else. They need it more than the pigs or calves. The calves and pigs will take care of the surplus, but let the city children have it first. I think an educational campaign would do nore than any - thing else. PROFESSOR LAWRITSON: Is it advisable to put on an iftwtiw campaign to teach the food value of milk? Will that take care of all t surplus? MR. JENKINSON: It will surely hel r MR. McINTOSH: When it t;-kes three quarts of the to distribute one quart to the consumer, it is pretty har consumer in the cities.

PROFESSOR LAWRITSON: How are you going a this middle man, if that is what we are to do.' No doubt the middle man is a necessary evil, if that is what you want to call it. Perhaps a fanner's co-operative association is the solution. MR. McINTOSH: The Farmers' Co-operative Association does not help out in Orraha materially. In «ome cities the distribution is worked out on a fifty-fifty basis;. Why can't it be put on that basis n the western cities? There is organized robbery going on in this country that is destroying production. PROFESSOR LAWRITSON: The question is, how are we going to elim - inate it? </seg>

I would II seme calves for calf clubs in this State if I can get them. If not, we vl have to go out of the State to buy. We have been criticised for going lrl other states. We would be glad to help you dispose of them if you wl list them with us. I have asked before that this be done, but it seem we have not been able to get the farmers to write in and list the catfl they have for sale, or those they wish to buy. If you will let us knol we will be glad to locate cattle, or help you sell them. We have beJ trying to buy some purebred calves, but the prices have been so muJ higher than what we can buy them for in Wisconsin and other daiJ states and ship them in, they are not interested in getting them in Nl braska. I would like to have a little co-operation from you breeders I help solve this problem. If we are not to go to other states to select tn cattle, then let us have them priced at home so we can afford to buy thein If a man can have them laid down here cheaper than he can get then from local breeders, you can not blame him for doing it. The averagl man who goes to a Nebraska breeder and asks for pure-bred heifers wil be told by the breeder they are not for sale. I should be glad to havi suggestions along this line. MEMBER: I do not think when we compare the State Farm with oui individual herd on the question of profit and loss, it is a fair criterion U goby. I have a certain amount of pasture and a certain amount of alfalfaj I could buy a few good dairy cows, but the expense of a good sire would come so heavy on me I could not afford it. If several of us would get to - gether and all keep the same kind of cows we would all make more money off that same piece of ground that we use for pasture and hay at the present tin e. I think that is what we should try to do. PROFESSOR LAWRITSON: That's the idea- If you belong to a co-op - erative bull association your share of the expense of the sire would be nominal. MEMBER: I am working alonp these lines all the time. The State Farm (roes to hundreds of dollars of expense to get a good sire to help us along these lines, so we cannot compare our figures with theirs. I keep three good cows. If I could get better cows I would make more off the same piece of jrronnd. That is what I am interested in. MR. SLOCUMB: They can buy those sires for less than half the money they could be purchased for a short time ago. I sold some thi3 fall. I have one I tried to offer for $60.

            <seg id="p354">354 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE MR. KIRK WOOD: I see the Dairy Association has arrived at a place where it can do itself some good. Tho thing to do is to weed out the ccws not paying their way and build up a herd worthy of your work and the industry you are following. The fanners and ranchers of this State are in need of more funds to carry on their operations. They must supply their table and little needs from the milk and butter they get from a few cows. They are milking en the ranches to quite an extent. That is why you are having a sur - plus. There is a man sitting by me who said, "I have cows in my herd not paying their way. I am on the Testing Committee of the Farm Bureau. Kick me out!" That is what you should do. Get your herds in shape for business. MR. W. M. SUTTON, Table Rock: Mr. President, Ladies and Gentle - men: I was a pioneer in this work in the organization of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association. Some forty years ago the only outlet for the dairy products of Nebraska was through the back door of a store at the price of soap grease, in exchange for a little tobacco or coffee. It is twenty-five years or more since I have attended this Association. I »m glad to be with you, although I do not recognize the faces of the old pioneers of forty years ago. I can answer in one word, perhaps, the crux of the great problem you are discussing — an outlet for your surplus. The facts of the matter are we have no surplus. Quality is what is the matter with the business. I would remind you at the time of the World's Exposition in Chicago, the Nebraska Dairymen's Association, through the local creameries, sent three carloads of Nebraska's dairy product and kept it on exhibition there for three months subject to an exact score by expert butter merchants. It scored to the top in competition with the world after a three months' test of keeping. I was manufacturing and selling at that time about two carloads of butter a week. The more I had, the better the price I could get, because we had created a demand for butter for cold storage pur - poses. It was said and thought the Nebraska butter would stand up In cold storage better and longer than from any of our great dairy states. We have the diplomas and the medals to prove that we had established a iating where such a thing as a surplus was not considered at all. We shipped goods from the Atlantic to the Pacific and got the top price. Ev - erything that graded as "Western Extra" brought the Elgin price here. Visit your receiving stations any day during the summer time and you will find in those shipping cans a product that is not fit for good hog feed! In the early days the large creameries based their price on West - ern Extra every week and paid for butter fat the price of Elgin Extra at your station. Now it usually runs eight cents below. I think but little of your butter grades up to 96 per cent, or as Western Extra. </seg>

You have not the fraudulent products to contend with we had in those early days. We spent days and weeks and years before our State Legislature and the United States Congress pleading for the enactment of laws that would protect us from those fraudulent products. You have those law* now. The trouble is, the quality of your goods is such that those sub - stitutes have taken to a large extent the place of good dairy products.

Van N.rman, President World's Dairy Congress, Washingtcn, D. C. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen of Nebraska: It is a strange sen - tion that runs through n-.y mind this morning to think that forty-two ars ago this month I arrived in this town. I saw a little something of U! Nebraska in the days the last speaker referred to. Times have changed and we have seen a lot of things happen. I just want to remind you .v two or three of the things that have happened in this State. You had three dairy leaders I know. Professor Haecker came into this t- years age and laid the foundation for the splendid college herd. Frandsen followed him, and under his leadership you built this building. I only know of one other state I have visits in this lat has as well built a building as this building we are in trday. 1 congratulate you upon having it. Now you have within the last few months brought another man to the leadership of the dairy interests te — a young mp.n whom it was my privilege to associate with work in Pennsylvania. I know he has it in him to do yon lieve you will find him a safe leader — a mar. who will help you. w the Frenchmen and some othtr nationalities cannot talk in \ hey cannot see their hands go. So I want to put the board up here. ME" "US" AND THE "GOVERNMENT' It nil three to make the team. There have been times in the mind the farmer when he thought his whole existence depended on the vernment. He was always looking to the government to remedy every- injr that was wrong. Yet we have just elected a President on the plat - m of "More business in government and less government in business." When sometimes we are inclined to turn around and want the government to correct all that is wrong, let us not forget we have had too much gov - ernment in some of our business, in the minds of a great many people. Now. then, I want to jump to the other end of the game. There are two </seg>
            <seg id="p356">356 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE kii ds of things to be done in this State, at this meeting, in your home, on your farm, in your community. We are all human. We have just as much selfishness, right here in our own home and community and family as over across the road or in the next state; and the thing that is need - ed, after all is said and done, is the thing that rises above the common faults we all have. When we are finding fault with the other fellow, let us remember he is human and we are human, and it is the fellow who is able to figure out a way to do in spite of all these things who will win There are two kinds of things to be done. One is the thing which I can do for myself, and the other is the thing I cannot do for myself, but we car do together. I gather from the talk this morning I should not say "as dairymen," because a lot of you are not dairymen. Some of you are a disgrace to the name of dairymen. We know we have them somewhere in the State if they aren't here today. A lot of us are just owning some cows. Today, because everything else is busted, we are looking at the old cow and wanting her to do everything for us we should have done be - fore. Somebody said there is a surplus. Why have you so much surplus ? The reason is, every fellow who hasn't anything else to sell is milking that old stripper cow three months longer than he would have been a year ago. She does not give much or good milk, but he sells it and gets a little bit of cash for it. Then he is going to milk that cow that comes fresh next month instead of letting the calf have it. The sum total in the difference in the amount of milk all over the country when a lot of fellows do that sort of thing really makes quite a' difference. That is part of the condition and we mi?ht as well accept it. What ia going to happen is just as soon as these things come up and the dairy product down, that fellow is (join? to quit. He won't pull teats for anybody! The things I want to speak about first are the thin i help myself. I wish I had some way of pounding that home because it seems to me when I ride around the country— and it has been my privi - lege to work in several states — there are so many men who have their eye on what the other fellows and the government can do to help them, in - stead of getting down to what "me" can do to help myself to get "me" out of the hole. How many of you drive an automobile, or the wreck of one? iLaugh - ter.) You start out somewhere. You know I think so netimes the courage of some men as I see them start off is simply beyond admiration. I Laugh - ter.) They must drive through mud and ford streams, and expect to get there with it' When he blows out a tire and thore isn't a house within a dozen miles, the man does not sit around and call for the government to pull him out of the hole. He goes to work and helps himself, and the amount of ingenuity the average man who drives a machine can work </seg>
            <seg id="p357">357 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE op! The old harness that needed repairs is nothing to a machine that can be made to go with average American ingenuity. Again we have had a war, and the conditions we are in today are the result of that war; and the way to get out of these conditions is to help ourselves the same as you did with that old machine. And first are the things you can do to help yourselves under your circumstances. When I see a man raising ten or twelve bushels of wheat to the acre when by proper methods within his reach he could raise fifteen or twenty, and when he is raising thirty bushels of corn and might have seventy, and everything else about the farm run on the same scale I think that man should be ashamed to complain of anything, because he has not done for himself and his business what he most do when he drives his machine. He must make it go himself, ard he has not made his farm business go with those conditions. You say, "What's the use of raising more ?" This is the reason: COST : PROFIT There are two ways to raise the profit. One is to get more for what you have. That is what 99V» per cent of all of you have your eyes glued on all the time. You are growling because you cannot raise the price to increase the profit. The price at which you sell your stuff is not fixed by "me" in agriculture. It may be in a retail store. You might just as well recognize it, for it is never going to be any other way. All the co - operation and Farm Bureaus and everything else are not going to fix the price of the fundamental products of the nation's food supply. This price will J«e fixed by the law of supply and demand. Why are corn and wheat cheap? Because there are more of them available than buyers and users for them. Why are dairy products rela - tively higher than wheat and corn? Because there are relatively more buyers for dairy products in proportion to the supply and they are pay - ing a higher price. I say we spend too much time with our eyes glued on prices at this time, forgetting if we cut a little off the cost we can add just as much to the profit. This part of the game is for me in my business to do. The biggest service the government can render is in helping 1 me to help myself to reduce this cost Why are the railroads laying off thousands of men and all these great industrial centers cold-bloodedly turning these men out? Because they must reduce this cost in their business in order to live. All these great business organizations are at this time doing everything they can to reduce their cost They cannot force the volume of business or the price, therefore they must reduce their cost </seg>
            <seg id="p358">358 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE </seg>
            <seg id="p359">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 359 Now as business men on our farms, we have the same problem. And all I am asking: you to do is to devote some of your time and brains and energy to the inspection cf your own atfairs to see whether or not you can reduce the cost of your business and thus help your profit a little bit. If there isn't any profit, reduce the loss proportionally. There are lots of businesses today in which the question has been to keep the loss hi. small as it could b-&gt;. In thousands of businesses, every time they save a cent on cost, they reduce the loss that much. Your speaker yesterday morning told you here the man who increased the production of his cows from 150 to 400 pounds, increased the net profit or the margin — I do not like the term net profit — between cost and income over ten time. Just think of it! He could increase the margin ten times. Now I want to say to you that in those great dairy states where to say agriculture means to say dairying, the men who have cows that average 400 pounds of butter a year are r.ot worrying very much about present conditions; because they have their business so efficiently conducted there is still a profit in it at present prices. I remember fifteen years ago a buyer for milk in New York City said "The farmer with a 6,000 pound cow is never complaining about the price of his milk; but you cannot pay the farmer with the 3,000 pound cow enough to please him." The things you can do to help yourselves are: Better feeding of your dairy cow, whatever she is; the elimination of the least profitable cow. If there is a man who must have the ten dollars the cream check brings in, he does not want to kill that one cow. But there are men in position where it would pay them to get rid of two or three of the cows, and have more net money on what is left. So we must look to the feeding and selection of the cows and the breeding of better cows. The man who ioking ahead to five years of dairy business can not afford not to take account tne raising of better cows That leads to the next thing. There are certain things that can only be done by "us" — by associated effort. I want to remind you that in the early days of this country, most of the men who lived on the land fed and clothed their own families from the product of their own soil, and protected their families with their own gun. Just think a mo - ment of what that means. Times have changed, and today less than 37 per cent of our people actually live on the land, and most of those who live on the land do not feed or clothe themselves with the stuff they produce on that land. The trade what they produce on that land. They trade what they produce to some other fellow for the food and clothing to bring back to the farm. How many farmers make their own butter ? There are thousands of farmers buying butter, or — more's the pity' — oleomargarine. (Laughter.) </seg>
            <seg id="p360">360 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Hiey are buying their own potatoes. They are buying all their cloth* ing, all their machinery and wagons; yet they used to be made right there at home. Not only has that change come about but these things are being done, not by the individual, but by great associations of people. What is the "steel trust" but a great association of laborers, bookkeepers, and managers and foremen and superintendents, using the capital other people have invested in that business through their stock ownership? It is an association of effort. We used to have a one-man stage coach carrying people back and forth. What have we here? Gigantic organizations — companies, we call them — trusts. The point is they are a lot of people working together in which the individual does not have a great deal of liberty of action. Isn't the brakeman on a train or the conductor on the little one-man street car a part of an association which lays down to him the rules by which he shall conduct his day's work Now that is going all through so - ciety. Our great department store or manufacturing or transportation organization is an association of effort which has superceded indi - vidual effort. I believe that agriculture has come into the period when association of effort is necessary in order to accomplish those things which may be done by "us" working together — things which cannot be done by "me" by myself. I think that is going to be the great development of this period in which we are a part: association of effort. Write it big on your minds that everything has its price and if you get the benefit of association of effort, a part of the price is to give op the liberty of individualism. I can not have all the liberty of the indiv - idual and get all the benefit of associated effort. Now presumably, theoretically — and I believe it works out in practice — each of the thous - and laborers working together in a corporation under the leadership of brains able to make the corporation a success, earns more than that indi - vidual — that particular measure of ability — could have earned off by him - self. In other words, the ability that made the president of that corpora - tion a president should increase the earning power of every man associat - ed with him; because he has his own brains plus the president's brains. Then it is apparent a necessity of associated effort if we should have able leadership. We only have one great general in an army. We have • lot of lesser generals and a great many captains, and so on down the line. Farmers' organizations must have leadership, and the individual must give up a part of his individualism and play teamwork with the rest behind a successful leader. Another thing: As individuals, you and Bill Brown can trade horses and be just as dishonest as the other fellow will stand for. You can shut </seg>
            <seg id="p361">361 KEPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE your eyes and tell him the horse is sound when you know he has every - thing flesh is heir to. If Bill Jones does not discover it until you have your money and he has the horse, he can whistle, and there is no harm done to anybody but the two of you. If he traded his bay horse for your black one there is nobody harmed. That was an individual enter - prise. But when you associate yourselves together as a group and one organ - ization tries to do business with another you cannot do business that way. The association must be right and work on right principles and methods. A great deal has been said in this day and age about the California Citrus Fruit Growers' Association. It has been held up as a shining example of successful association of effort commonly called co-operation. They have succeeded because they were, first legally right. They have been morally right. Now, I am perfectly willing to admit there are just as many men and women in this audience who will put the big apples the barrel as in any other audience of the same size. on th (Laughter! The individual may do that with apples or potatoes or or - anges he has to sell, but the association cannot do it. Then this California Association to which I refer has been economi - cally right And some of our organizations — notably some of our co - operative bureau associations — have unfortunately, from my standpoint not been economically right. They have tried to do something contrary to the fundamental economic laws of business and commerce and they have failed. Now we come to the last point. They must be wisely led, and follow the leader. These things are absolutely essential to associated or co - operative effort: legally right, morally right, economically right, and led right. Now until our American farmers get so deep into the financial mire they were ready to do anything, lots of them did not learn the lesson of how to work together. It took the club of adversity to force them to -work together. But we have made great progress, and we have today a great many successful co-operative efforts. I want to warn you against one or two of the things I think are the biggest rocks in the road of our younger agricultural co-operative efforts. The biggest one of all is the assumption of superior holiness on the part of the farmers — the assumption that we as farmers are all right and the middle man and all the rest have conspired against us. It is not worthy of the man who can drive an old Ford machine over rough roads to beg the question and say, "We poor farmers 1 Everybody is against us but we are all ripht." Remember "me" is the biggest thing. The next is "us". Let us get ourselves together. When we try to do business as a group with the other group give the other fellow credit for as much honesty as we believe we have in our group. I do not believe a thousand farmers </seg>

            <seg id="p363">REPORT (IF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 363 are any more honest than a thousand middle men. I know there are middle men who will cheat the eye teeth out of anybody when they get a chance, and I suspect there are farmers who will, too. On the other hand, when you get the middle men t itrether. they are only doing what you are doing. They are trying t ; make an honest living in their part of the game. Sometimes I think the middle man is making a living by render - ing an unnecessary service, and I believe some how, some way, society must eliminate that unnecessary service and shorten the route from the field to the table on a lot of our products. We are doing that. The chain store has come along, and the city man who is willing to go to a chain store can buy groceries cheaper than up town. I recently moved to Washington. I happen to have landed in a com - munity where prices are 50 to 75 per cent higher — so my wife declares — than anywhere she has ever been. Young lettuce was twenty-five cents a bunch in the store next our home. A little farther, it was twenty cent*. At the market it was fifteen cents. Then we went to the outside market where coons and a lot of those people go to buy, and it was ten cent* a bunch. Out on the street corner with the dago and the basket on his arm, you could buy lettuce for five cents a bunch. Don't you see? The system is gradually evolving. It is up to the city fellow to go down where he can get it for less. It is up to the individual to find the place that does business on his scale of ability. My wife says, "I don't like to carry it home." My answer was, "Then you must pay the other fellow for carrying it home. You go down and hire an automobile for two dollars and buy ten dollars worth of stuff, and you will save enough to pay for the hire of the automobile." But she has her eye glued to the two dollars she would spend instead of to the three dollars she might save. We get our eyes set on one part of the game and forget the other part. I do not know whether I have made clear to you what I have said or not. I will sum it up in a few words. A lot of our troubles, we, our - selves, must correct. "Me" is the big end of the game. There are some other things in which if we can associate ourselves with our neighbor we can help ourselves. Then there is a little bit the government can help us. Just now we are cursing a whole lot about taxes. The government fixes the taxes and tariff and the rates on the railroad. We are the gov - renment I thank you. (Applause.) </seg>
            <seg id="p364">364 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE THURSDAY AFTERNOON SESSION January 5, 1922. The final business session of the convention was called to order by President Morrison at 1 :25 P. M. on Thursday afternoon. "BETTER DAIRY METHODS" Mr. A. J. Glover, Editor "Hoard'* Dairyman", Fort Atkinson, Wis. Mr. President, Members of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association, Ladies and Gentlemen: It has been my privilege on a number of occa - sions in the past 18 years to discuss with you some phase of dairying. This has been a pleasure to me, and I trust some good has been accom - plished. I am to discuss this afternoon "Better Dairy Methods." It is quit* common, these times, to refer to our period of depression, and to offer some solution for bringing us back to normal conditions. It is easy to find fault; easy to point out the things that are not right; but it is quite another question to adjust our economic relationships. A great many people not engaged in dairying are trying to solve the dairyman's problems for him; but after all is said and done, it is the man behind the cow who must solve these problems. If each one of us will do our plain duty, be honest with ourselves and our neighbors, the quicker we ■hall get through the distressing period and be on the way with a great period in American history. There are three or four things prominent before the dairyman — things over which he has control. They are: The dairy cow; the quality of her product; organization for marketing and advertising the value of milk and its products. These are the things I shall discuss this afternoon. There is a movement, so I am informed upon good authority, to ad - vocate decreasing the production of milk in order to secure a higher price for dairy products. I cannot conceive of anything so valueless as a body of men attempting to decrease the production of dairy products when we are not consuming in this country one-half as much milk as our scien - tists say is necessary for the health of the people and for economy. The reduction of the milk supply is not the solution of our problem. Would - n't it be better for these men to direct themselves toward eliminating the poor cow and breeding better ones, towards establishing better dairy meth - ods than to attempt to decrease milk production in order to force up the price of dairy products ? I do not feel those men will get far with a cam - paign of that character. But I think they will be in the position like the old farmer who tied a cow's tail to his bootstrap because she was swat - ting him with it when he was milking her. She then started off and he was heard to remark that he had not been going around the barn yard more than a dozen times, the first on one end and then on the other, before he realized his mistake. (Laughter.) </seg>
            <seg id="p365">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 365 I do not want to see the dairy industry of this country attempt to do lething and then find it a failure. I would rather be a party to help these men realize their mistake before they undertake any such propor- tion Where is there a better market for farm products today than the" 4ky cow? When you produce corn in Nebraska you are looking for the best market; it may be the elevator, your hogs or beef cattle, or yonr dairy cow. It is safe to say there isn't a better market in the whole Unit - ed States for farm crops than the dairy cow. She will return you more than any other market. I do not believe the dairy fanners are going to' be stampeded into ignoring that market by any gTOup of men who would regulate prices of dairy products by reducing the number of cows. The farmer who has hay and grain to sell will have to be shown a better mar - ket before he will sell his cows. It is always in order to attempt to get farmers to eliminate a poor cow; to encourage him to keep high producing cowa. The poor cow loses him money and creates, in many instances, the surplus milk which helps to keep dairy products at comparatively low prices and to make dairy - ing unprofitable. When we compare the returns of the good dairy cow even at present prices, with those received for other farm products, we immediately see how short sighted, how unthoughtful it is for anyone to consider a campaign for the purpose of decreasing milk production. Let that effort he placed upon eliminating the poor, unprofitable cows; putting better ones in their places, giving them better care and feed, and to ad - vising the consumer of the importance and value of dairy products. No market will pay as much for farm crops as the good dairy cow and no one is going to get far in urging the farmers to dispose of that market unless he can offer a better one. In the annual report of the Fort Atkinson Cow Testing Association for 1920 some very convincing figures are found and they show what kind of a market good cows are for our farm products. The best herd in this association returned $2.61 for each dollar expended for feed and the 382 cows returned $2.02 for each dollar's worth of feed consumed. The poor - est herd returned but $143 for each dollar expended in feed. Feed was figured at the following prices: Pasture $.10 a day, silage $8 per ton, hay $24, stover $6, and grain $40 and the average price received for fat was $.70 a pound. One of the best herds in the association averaged 9,066 lbs. of milk containing 455 lbs. of fat. The cost of the feed per cow for this herd was $136.69 and the returns over the cost of feed was $184.88. The poorest producing herd in the 33 tested averaged 5,034 lbs. milk containing 183 lbs. of fat The cost of feed per cow averaged $80.68 for this herd and the returns above cost of feed $47.42. There is shown in these figures the tremendous opportunity of increasing the production of the cows even in this association which contains unusually high producing cows. The </seg>
            <seg id="p366">366 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE poorest herd averaged 183 lbs. of fat per cow in the year and the best 455 lbs. and the return above cost of feed was $47.42 per cow for the poorest herd and $184.88 for the best, the average for all cows in the Association being $97.55. The average cow in the United States produces about 130 lbs. of fat per year. Is it not better that we dispose of these low producing cows and put better ones in their places before we undertake a campaign to de - crease the production of milk ? Let us see what returns we can make now above cost of feed. A cow that will produce one pound of fat a day will require about the following ration: 30 lbs. of silage, 10 lbs. of hay, 8 lbs. of grain. If this grain is made up of bran, oats, and corn, this ration will cost about 25 1 4c, assuming that silage is worth $6 per ton, hay $20, bran $30, oats $20, and corn $15. One pound of butterfat is worth $.45 de - livered to the creamery and this gives a return of $.20 a day above cost of feed for a cow producing one pound fat It should be observed that all these farm products have been marketed at a better price than the ele - vator will pay. It may be stated here that some one will ask, "How about the overhead expenses, such as the labor to care for the cow, to markii her product, depreciation, and all other items that enter into the cost of making milk*" It iray bo said that upon the dairy farm which practices diversification and sells its butterfnt to the creamery or its milk to the cheese factory, that the calf, the skim milk, the manure, and the utiliza - tion of waste feed, which would be valueless without the cow, will pay this overhead expense. But that isn't all. The dairy cow provides a market for and crops that cannot bo sold otherwise and in doinjr so I u &gt;h the price of corn. Gluten feed is selling on the market for th ton. Alfalfa hay in Wisconsin is selling from the barn at twc lars per ton. In Idaho, with few cows, it is selling for two dolla Isn't it well for us, when we are considering the returns from the dairy cow, to take into consideration the market she makes for our pro - ducts; how she increases their price; how she utilizes waste? What would corn silage be worth if it were not for the dairy cow" Yet she is charged six dollars per ton for it. I sometimes feel we should only charge the dairy cow two dollars a ton for alfalfa hay, because that is all it is worth in Idaho. But that would hardly be fair. One problem before the dairyman is the getting of good cows. Wher - ever we can decrease the cost of production, we increase our profit. Thai is the way every legitimate business is trying to build up its profit. To at - tempt to control prices by cutting down production when we do not have enough dairy products is to begin at the wrong end, and especially when the good dairy cow is returning more for the feed she consumes than the elevator will pay. </seg>
            <seg id="p367">367 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In that cow testing association I mentioned, the best herd averaged 455 pounds fat per cow per year and the poorest averaged 183 pounds. The average cow in the United States makes 130 pounds. Can we honestly as dairymen complain of the price of dairy products when millions of such cows are kept? Can't we turn the light upon ourselves and say, here • a great opportunity for us to dispose of these cows that do not return enough to pay for cost of feed?" Isn't that a better way to tackle the pro - blem than go out in a campaign to create an impression that there is no - money in dairying; That we must reduce the output, when we are pro - ducing only one-half as much dairy products as we should? My way is to eliminate the poor cow. A man said the other day if we would put in all good cows and keep as many, there would be an over - production. That might be true. But it is better to milk fewer cows if that were our situation. Would it not be wiser to keep ten cows yielding 400 pounds each, than to keep thirty average cows ? You have just one - third the cows to take care of. There may come a time when the price of dairy products will be such that of necessity we will have to limit produc- tion in order to get a proper return for dairy products. But until we have a larger number of efficient cows in our barns we are not justified in any campaign to reduce the production of so important a product as milk. Now there is another way of reaching this problem, and that is to ed - ucate the consumer regarding the good value of milk and its products. Xot one person in ten appreciates that dairy products are essential foods and absolutely necessary for health, as well as the most economical ani- ds offered for sale on the market today. Producers and manufacturers of dairy products have been silent too ng concerning the necessity and value of their products. Thinking and Ting men of every age have recognized the superiority of dairy pro - as foods. A few nations have made milk the chief diet. We find that the Jewish mother under all circumstances will provide her children with an edequate quantity of milk, but our American mothers do not hold the same views, for if they did we would not have so many children who t receive any milk. In 1900 W. D. Hoard, in testifying before the House Committee on Agriculture in Congress made this statement: "Butterfat is found in the milk of all mammals. It is chemically and physically unlike any other fats in existence. It was designed by nature for the food and sustenance of infant offspring having the most delicate of all digestions." He took this position long before scientists discovered vitamines and before inves - tigations had been made to demonstrate the difference between milk fat and other fats. His reason and common sense told him what neither he nor the chemists could prove. Since that time it has been proven that milk fat does contain a growth producing substance not found in veget - able fats, oils, or in all animal fats. </seg>
            <seg id="p368">368 BEPOBT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE The British Food Journal, November, 1919, contained the foliow statement: "Dr. Holliday Sutherland, consulting tuberculosis, officer to the St Marylebone Dispensary, lecturing recently on The Early Diagnosis of Tub erculosis, made a strong plea for the abolition of the control of butter 'During the war, he said, "I have noticed more cases of acute form of tu berculosis than &lt;?ver before.

It is indeed up to the dairyman of the coun- general public as to the wonderful qualities of milk as crease the consumption would be to increase our quality, the consumer to buy that which he does not want any force your horse to drink if he is not thirsty. So I for every kind of product. Better Marketing surrounding every city of considerable size, the farmers organization to sell their products co-operatively in order that they be assured of getting full market price for them. I do not see how the individual farmer is going to cope with other industries that are organized. He must work with his neighbor and subserve himself to his organization that it may deal with other organization upon the right principles, and not try to do the impossible which always reacts upon the members of an association. A year ago the Wisconsin College of Agriculture and all the dairy and farm organizations of the state, together with the Department of Markets, called a marketing conference and outlined a plan by which the dairy industry of Wisconsin should be organized in order to market dairy products cooperatively. The plan is this: Every local cooperative enter - prise will be federated with other local institutions. It may be local creameries, cheeseries, or storage houses for cheese, potatoes or local shippers' associations, etc. We have in Wisconsin 3,700 cheese factories, condensaries and cream - eries, so we have the local development well established in that state. We do not desire to relinquish it. Several creameries or cheeseries can be fed - erated for the purpose of standardizing their butter or cheese, to establish a brand, and to ship in carload lots. They will be able to sell these pro - ducts to better advantage than when shipped individually; and by group - ing their volume of business, become strong enough to employ someone to look after it. </seg>
            <seg id="p370">370 BEPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE When these cheeseries and creameries are federated into groups and operating these groups will be federated into state-wide organizations. It is unnecessary for me to point out to you the power of such or - ganizations because they can do everything other organizations can do for their members if they have the proper manager at the head of each federation. And the farmer, by running his own local institution, whether it be creamery or cheesery, is the master of his own business — and if the group federation or the state federation of groups goes to ever last - ing smash-up, the farmer still has his market and is not particularly disturbed. The advantage of federation comes through the larger vol - ume of business by having each lacal institution associated with other factories. Let me use an illustration to point out the advantages of federation and a central storage. Last May the price of cheese in Wisconsin fell from twenty-seven to twelve cents a pound. So far as anyone could deter - mine, there was less cheese in storage than in May, 1920, and the prospec - tive supply was no greater than before; yet the price dropped in two weeks to twelve cents. That was a serious matter. Farmers received for their milk from 90 cents to a dollar a hundred, and it cost $1.50 or more to pro - duce that milk that went into cheese. It seems to me the people buying the cheese were masters in the market. They said, "Here's the season when Wisconsin produces the greater portion of her cheese, and we will put these prices down. They will have to sell, because they have no place to hold the cheese." If Wis - consin had had these several groups of cheese factories organized into federations, and each one of these groups had had a storage house built for curing, grading and branding their cheese, they could have held their cheese until the market condition for cheese had improved, and they would have been just as much masters of their business as Mr. Swift or Mr. Armour are masters of theirs. But are we not as farmers missing an opportunity I w some of the good practices that the packers set for us? Let us ac their good practices. We do not need to practice that which is quest able. I would rather a pood deal try to solve the problems il by looking at our conditions as they are, by attempting to follow out the right economic principles, than to waste my time complaining of what the other fellow is doing. Let us go ahead and do likewise. Had the cheese industry in Wisconsin done so, it could have held its cheese in Wis - consin through May, June and July, because July had not passed before it went to twenty cents a pound. The advantages of federation and establishing storage is evident. We produce most of our cheese in five summer months. It is not good business to put all that cheese on the market in those months. Why not </seg>
            <seg id="p371">371 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE welfth of the cheese on the market each month. This is orderly r and is sensible marketing. ma Leadership that we do not value leadership sufficiently. We appreciate the leadership of a Washington or a Lincoln or a Roosevelt or a Grant or a Sheridan or a Sherman; but are there not men needed in Agriculture today who correspond to our statesmen and generals, and should not these leaders be recognized as much as those men who excel in statesmanship and war? Too many look upon the leader as having an easy job. All he does, so some think, is to draw his check and let others do the work. That isn't a manager. A manager is a man who has ability to direct others, to lay plans and arry them out. He is a student of his business and he is r at work, whether in the office or on the golf field or on a railroad Until farmers appreciate that managerial ability is rare and demands good wages and the supply is limited — until the farmers understand this, &gt;ur cooperative institutions are going to suffer. The plan of organization .lies tint matter so much as the man who has the organization to manage. Let me illustrate what constitutes a manager by two incidents that have come to my attention in the past two years. A cooperative enter- ■wned by farmers picked up a man who had been a failure in his own business and hired him for $75 a month to manage their business for them. This institution was doing a good business. When the price of sugar reached 27 cents a pound in 1919, he bought a carload. By h&gt;' °ugar arrived it was selling for eighteen cents, and before it the it was selling for ten cents. The loss amounted to about was $7,000. Thf farmers said, "They have it in for us." It was the stupidity of their manager. Why not say, "If we had had a real manager, he would ve been caught I will cite another case of a successful manager who makes money by running a knitting factory. When he started in to knit socks and stock - ings, silk was worth $3.50 a pound. In 1918 silk advanced to $11 a pound and in March, 1920 to $18 a pound. He would not pay $18 for silk and he was informed he would be unable to buy silk any cheaper. He replied, "I am not going to pay $18 a pound for silk. I do not want to sell stockings for $6 a pair. They are not worth it." "The salesman said, "You can't get your silk later. You will have to take it now." To this he replies, "I can close my mill can't I?' Inside of six months he bought silk for seven dollars a pound. He </seg>
            <seg id="p372">372 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE saved his company thousands of dollars because he saw, in the study of economics, that this period of wild buying and blind leadership had to end. He is a manager. His factory is now working over time, because he has had no expensive product to work off and his price for stockings has been below the other fellow's. So when we sum up the opportunities to improve dairy conditions, to increase the returns for dairy products, we must not neglect the character of cow we keep. When the average cow is producing 130 pounds fat a year, and there are herds in Wisconsin averaging 400 pounds of fat there is large opportunity for improvement. The quality of dairy products must be uniform and good. This will cause increased consumption and create better prices. We must develop and encourage local cooperative enterprises — a local milk producers' as - sociation, local creameries and cheeseries and federate these institutions for selling their products cooperatively and so full market price for them can be secured. Leadership must be recognized as all important in the management of these institutions. If we will do these things, I am sure other things will be added unto us. I thank you. i Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: The Nebraska Dairymen's Association is hon - ored today.and we feel the state of Nebraska is hon.ired today; so I am going to present to you our own Governor, Samuel McKelvie, who will in - troduce to you the speaker of the hour. (Applause.) HON. S. R. McKelvie: Mr. President and Friends: It is always em - barassing to me to be called upon to introduce a speaker who is so much better known than I am myself. It seems that there is little that is new to be said about one who has occupied such a prominent place in tht public eye for so long a time and so recently. Perhaps I can better introduce the speaker by saying there is a bond of common interest between him and myself, in that he for four years served as the public goat of the State of Illinois, and I am finishing up my four years for Nebraska. And then, too, I have followed his leader - ship somewhat in that I have thought some of the things he did in Illin - ois were very good. They worked out well there and we put them into ef - fect in Nebraska, where we feel sure they will work out well, too. Bringing the matter more nearly home, I am reminded of a question asked me the other day by a newspaper man about what I would do when I got through with this office. I thought the first thing I would do would be to pull off my shoes and turn myself out to grass where I could be my own boss for a while. We have here a living example of a Governor who has done that I think he has come to seek the company of "con - tented cows," and I dare say he has found a peace that was not his when he was seeking to serve the people of his State. </seg>

Lowden, who now is a dairy farmer. Governor Lowden. (Applause.) FITLRE PROSPECTS FOR THE DAIRYMAN Ex -Governor Frank O. Lowden, of Illinois Mr. McKelvie, Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: I have listened with the greatest possible pleasure to Mr. Glover's address. He covered the whole subject so thoroughly and so effectively that it is really difficult for me to know what to say on the subject of the dairy situation, and so I think I shall have to content myself with some general observations on the aerirultural situation as it impresses myself upon my mind today. There is a great deal of misapprehension throughout the country, particularly in the large cities, as to the fabulous amount of money that has been made by the farmers of this country during the last half century. Men from the cities visit southern California and are told that southern California is populated exclusively by retired farmers, and it is pretty nearly so, in a way. They go back home with the idea that every farmer of America has become independently rich. That is one of the reasons why it is difficult to make the people of the cities and the industrial sections of our country understand the existing conditions. It true that perhaps America has more retired farmers than any other country in the world. This great aggregation of them in Southern California is indeed a fact. But it is also true that nearly every farmer in America who has made a sufficient competence to retire from the farm, has not made it by actual operations upon his farm, but by the increase in the value of lands. It is well to have that fact generally understood. The condition which made that possible in the past no longer exists. This rapid increase in farm values which has marked the last half century in the Mississippi valley will not continue. The retired farmer of the future must retire upon a competence which he has earned in the actual operation of his farm, or he will not retire at all. It follows from this that we must give more attention — and this applies to dairying and to all other kinds of farming 1 — to the details of farming than we have in the past. It means as I believe, also, that we must in a way today return a little bit to some of the practices which our fathers practiced, particularly in view of the greatly increased freight rates, which are not likely probably for a great many years to approach the level of freight rates which existed before the war. The old idea of our fathers and grandfathers who moved first from New England and New York and Pennsylvania to Ohio and Indiana and Illinois, and later to Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas and these other states, was that the farm was a place upon which to make a living, and the </seg>
            <seg id="p374">374 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE thing to do was to produce upon the farm as much as could be pro - duced which was necessary to sustain and clothe life. For that reason, all the pioneers sought in the first instance to follow this plan wherever possible, and were able to do so at least in those regions partly timbered so that they had fuel of their own and were not dependent upon coal; or in other words, until they crossed the Missouri River. They produced •ome sheep so that they were not dependent upon the cities for clothes, and they had their own smoked hams, and produced a much better quality of meat in those pioneer days than any of the packers in Chicago know how to make today. And upon a little stream was the mill. I do not mean to say we must return to all those old things, but I mean to say today that where you have agriculture diversified to a certain extent you find the community more properous. That is true even in your great dairy state. Those dairy farmers who raise a few pigs and have just a little bit of alfalfa to sell to their less fortunate neighbors, and just a little surplus of something are the ones getting along the best. We have gone in the reaction from the old methods of our fathers, where everything was produced upon the farm and where life was more rugged and simpler than today, to the other extreme where we are trying to produce just one thing. In the south it is cotton. In central Illinois, and in Iowa and parts of Nebraska and of Kansas, it is corn. In some other sections it is sheep, and in some, cattle. I want to call your attention to that in passing. Some way I feel we are going t regain an independence which our forefathers had on the farm, an which we have lost by limiting ourselves to one crop. Some way I thin we will restore our independence by raising lots of different things ■ that in a measure, at least, we are independent of the vicissitudes an fluctuations of this somewhat troubled commercial world. Another thing which should receive our very most careful considera - tion today is the Farm Bureau. I know this is not a Farm Bureau meeting. That is being held somewhere else. But when you permit brother Glover to exhaust entirely the dairy subject, you must permit me to discuss whatever occurs to me. (Laughter and applause.) The Farm Bureau, in my opinion, is the most useful farm or other organiza - tion the farmers have ever atempted in this country. (Applause.) We have had for many years the best agricultural colleges in all the world; in fact, America, young as it is, is the mother of agricultural learning. The Old World has imitated us in that respect. And yet, while we have the best agricultural colleges in all the world, as a rule we have made the least use of what they teach. (Applause.) I know I am on dangerous ground. I made a speech a number of years ago before a national farm organization in which I made a statement some - thing like this: "In manufacturing we do not have to apologize to any </seg>
            <seg id="p375">375 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE other nation in the world; in banking and commerce we can hold our heads proudly erect in the midst of the best commercial and industrial company in all the world; but when it comes to farming, there is not any nation in all the world that is so poor and forlorn." When I had finished that statement, a lady arose and objected. She was from California. A good many of you have been in California, and you know if there is anything in all the world a Californian does not like, it is to be told that there is anything anywhere on earth, from climate to raisins, that surpasses California. (Laughter.) So she arose and objected. She said I might speak for Illinois, but she denied me the right to speak for California. (Applause.) I am expecting in my discussion of this part of the subject, that somebody will say I may speak for Illinois, but I cannot for Nebraska. Yet the fact remains that because of the abundance of fertile land which we have had in this country in the past, but which is well-nigh exhausted, we have done the poorest farming of all the nations of the world, as a general propo - sition, so far as I have visited other countries. Take China. There is a great book written by one of your Wisconsin men — Professor King — called "Forty Centuries of Farming." When I read that book I formed a new regard for those people, because they are farming better over there now than we are in Illinois — of course' not better than you are in Nebraska! (Laughter.) We have the best colleges of agriculture in the world and we have made the least use of them. That is why I say the Farm Bureau is the st useful organization that has even been formed among farmers, my opinion, because that Bureau will take the learning from these lege walls out into the country and lay it upon the fields — apply it. I want to see a Farm Bureau in every county of every agricultural state in this country, and I want to see that Farm Bureau keep its head. There are a lot of people in this world who can keep their heads g as they are in modest positions, who when they get a little authority are likely to lose their heads. I want first to see the Farm Bureau inquire what the other organiza - tions in that county are. I want them to leam if there are farmen' elevators; to find out if there are co-operative creameries or cheese factories or co-operative livestock selling organizations, or testing asso - ciations, or granges, or farm organizations of any kind; and then just the moment the head of the Farm Bureau learns what other organized activities are in that county, I want him to keep his feet on the earth and co-operate with them and help them and not antagonize them. (Applause.) The danger today with the multiplying organisations of farmers, founded in the main upon correct principles — in fact, I agree with every </seg>
            <seg id="p376">376 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE word Mr. Glover has said to you — is that many of them are coming into collision with one another and are letting little jealousies spring up. There develop conflicts, and that is a crime against the farmers of America. I want to see the Farm Bureau set an example to these organi - sations. I want to see it get hold of any men who at any time have been interested in these movements, gather them together and see that they work together and that there is no friction among them. They are not doing that in all instances. Some examples have come to my mind in which they have overlooked that. I believe the Farm Bureau, if it will keep its head and stand upon correct economical prin - ciples, is destined to transform the agriculture of America as no other agency has that has been found in all the history of agriculture in this country. I want to say that wherever I have been consulted in my own or any other state and have found there are efforts to begin co-operation along these lines which Mr. Glover laid down to you a few moments ago, I have always advised them first to get in touch with the Farm Bureau of their county, co-operate with it, and let it be the clearing house of all other farmers' activities so as to avoid these pitfialls of which I spoke a moment ago. No one believes more in the principle of co-operation as applied to fanning than I. I have been preaching it for many years. But when any of us get together and say, "If we just organize on« great society, we can put the price of any farm product to any figure we please," we are making a mistake. The most powerful farm organization is still under the control of the operation of economic laws. Notwithstanding all the mistakes we have made, the best hope — I was almost going to My the only hope — for agriculture for the future in this country, to my mind, consists in the development of this co-operative movement. I visited Holland a good many years before the great war. I was interested in farming then. I had been farming a number of years and was just changing to dairying; so I visited a great many of their farms and the Agricultural College over there. The President of this College and I had a great dialogue, because he spoke Egnlish about as well as I spoke Dutch. (Laughter.) But I learned a lot from him and I hope he learned something from me. I visited their creameries and their cheese factories, and I found everything they did over there was done through co-operative societies. I never saw — I would not say anything in deprecation of Wisconsin, the leading dairy state of the Union, because I take my hat off when Wisconsin's name is mentioned — but I never saw in any state as fine cheese factories and creameries and dairy barns as I saw in Holland. I never saw such an evidence of prosperity as seemed to me to exist in Holland at that time. Their cheese factories were all run co-oper - atively. They purchased their supplies co-operatively, and not only </seg>
            <seg id="p377">377 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE that, but they have solved the problem of foreign markets through their co-operative societies. In Leeuwarden, the capital of Friesland, which is the heart of the Holstein industry of the world, they have a great warehouse operated by a co-operative export society. They sold a large part of their dairy exports to London and a large part to Berlin. They told me one interesting thing. There was a great consumption of Stilson cheese in England. In Holland they made largely Edam cheese. So they sent an expert to England from their export society to learn how to make Stilson cheese. They made it so much better than the English make their own cheese, they were practically con - trolling the English marlcet in cheese! They were not content simply to have an export society of their own, but they were in correspondence with co-operative buying societies in these great European capitals. They encouraged the organization of them so that these products could go direct from the producer on the farm to the home of the consumer in the largest capitals of Europe, so as to make the minimum of cost to the consumer and the maximum of price to the producer. Those things are all practicable. A lot of people think this co-operative movement only means better prices. That is only part of the story. If that were all, it probably would not be worth my while to be here. But it means better farming. They told me over there that the moment they organized one of these co-operative cheese factories, every farmer began to compare what he was doing with what the other fellow was doing; that the best farmer was setting the standard and the others worked up to him. A lot of men supposed they were getting the best results because they were doing as their fathers or grandfathers had done; but when they had to compare what they were doing with what the other farmers were doing, they found they had not nearly approximated what they should through all these years. We might just as well be honest with ourselves here. We each think we are about the best farmer in our community. We say, "Why make this change? This is the way my father did it. and the way I have always done it." The only thing that will break through our crust of self-sufficiency and self-satisfaction is to get into this co-operative movement where we must bare our operations and compare them with the operations of our neighbor. It not only means better farming but better living. Let the spirit of co-operation get into a community any - where so that the farmers and their wives and children are meeting around a common table upon some subject of common interest, and you will find more trees are planted in the front yard and the lawns are kept better. The first thing you know there is a new school house, and the old church is repainted. The country community begins to look up the moment its people begin to co-operate. </seg>
            <seg id="p378">378 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE There is not any reason in all the world why life should not be more beautiful in the country, anyway, than it can be under the most favorable circumstances in the city. I spent a number of days in Chicago recently. because of the demands of some business I had. Yesterday it was foggy, chilly. I come out here and look into the glory of a winter's sky. I want to tell you there is just as much beauty in the country in winter, if we are only attuned to it, as there is in the most beautiful day of June or October. This co-operative spirit is going to make us appreciate the advan - tages those of us who live in the country enjoy, because it will make a better community everywhere. I am discussing this at great length because I know some of these co-operative movements fail, or are failing. That is true. I do not want you to become discouraged when you hear of these things, because there is not as large a proportion of them failing as of ordinary business privately conducted. We are winning in a larger percentage of cases than private business is. But now is the time to inquire why we are failing, where we are failing. In the first place, as you have already been told by Mr. Glover, there are certain men who some way have worked out the proposition that if we would all agree on a price at which to produce a certain commodity, we could make that price as high as the stars, and get it If we have that idea, we are going to fail, because there is a lin of demand. That is a fact we must keep in mind. It does not folk w we won't get better prices than we have in the past I admit the efficacy of the law of supply and demand. I know through a series of years it fixes the price of all farm commodities. But when I see wheat selling on Wednesday of this week— for the pur - pose of illustration — I am not quoting any actual market — for fifteen cents less than it was on Friday of the week before, while I still have faith in the operation of the law of supply and demand, I am pretty certain that law is not working on one of those two days. ( Laughter and applause.) Now that is what the co-operative marketing organization can do. It can stabilize in a measure that price. It can market in an orderly way, and when wheat suddenly drops fifteen cents, the gentlemen who are holding that wheat can say, "We will wait until the law of supply and demand has had a chance to reassert itself." While I am on this subject of the law of suppy and demand, I am going to discuss it a little bit. All writers on economic subjects whose articles or books I have read say that law operates only when there is full freedom on both sides. There is not full freedom under modern conditions a large part of the time among the producers. They </seg>
            <seg id="p379">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 379 are relatively few in number, while the consumers are legion. There must be equality of conditions on both sides — on the side of the buyer and seller alike — before we can get the full effect of this law of supply and demand. We can only have that equality of condition on both sides when the farmers get together and organize, and when they have just as able a man at the head of their organization as have the gentlemen who buy They must be trained to know what the world's supply is and what the world's needs are. They must have brains to know the trend of trade currents just as much as the gentlemen on the other side, before you have that equality of conditions where you get a just price. Now, the most hopeful, the most significant, development of these co-operative enterprises during recent years is the very one described by Mr. Glover, in Wisconsin. They have the right idea — namely, beginning down in the small community. This thing of all in a minute getting up &amp; great organization that is going to cover all the earth and function, ie of the most difficult things in all the world. Did you ever stop to think how few great businesses were big in the beginning? Nearly every one is an evolution — a growth from something small. In that way they got sturdiness and quality and those things necessary to make them endure. That is why I am stressing the Farm Bureau, so that where you have these local organizations, they can get into groups, and the groups &gt;un ', iini! the county into the state, and the states into one 11 procetding along the lines of correct economic principles. Don t l a t fro of any farmer's elevator or any society organized ly for any purpese in this State, even if the times seem hard and have made the mistake which they made in Wisconsin and have a dub at the head of one of them. Let the manager go, but hold iri put some one else in; because it is out of these local are evolving in the rural communities that this movement ti perative movement — is to get material to bring it its I cannot forbear to discuss just a little bit some things about dairy - ing, although I almost promised you I would not because almost any - thing anybody could say would be a repetition of what Mr. Glover has already told you. But there is one fact that came to my attention the other day I want to remind you of. The President of the Federal Reserve Bank of the district which includes North Dakota, Minnesota, Wisconsin and Michigan, made a statement in which he pointed out that pratically all the bank failures in that district had been in that part of the district where they depended upon one crop; that the only portions of this dis - trict covering those four states where the communities were really pros - perous were the dairy communities. Wisconsin was singled out. He said. "We used the surplus in Wisconsin in times of stress to help out </seg>
            <seg id="p380">380 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE St. Paul and Chicago. Wisconsin alone was able to finance itself during that strain, and to have a surplus to help out these cities." According to the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of that district, that was because of the dairying done in Wisconsin. I have been trying to tell the people of my State for a good many year* that while I had the greatest respect for Wisconsin, I could not see wherein it had any natural advantages over our advantages for dairying; and I was bold enough to say I thought in some respects we had advantages over theirs; that I did not know of any reason why Wisconsin should so far surpass the adjoining states except for the fact that grand old man, Governor William U. Hoard, settled at Fort Atkinson, and not in Illinois or Nebraska. (Applause.) Now, Nebraska, famed as it is for its production of beef, for its production of corn — I am wondering if Nebraska has not made the mis - take Illinois has made in not giving more attention to dairying during recent years? I wonder if you would not be in better condition on these beautiful prairies — and there is no more beautiful state anywhere than yours with the sweep of prairie where you see almost infinitely away — if there were more silos and dairy cattle and dairy farms dotting their boundless expanse? Then we live in this country, anyway, just as if the world were going to come to an end when we are dead. We never think of the future. We do not have the vision which they have had in the Old World. We have denuded our forests of timber without taking the trouble to reforest In little Switzerland they have a forest which has produced an annual crop of pines since the eleventh century. Each year they have cut off a certain amount, and by the time they have gone over the entire area covered by the forest, the first strip has com - mercial timber upon it In the treatment of our farm lands we have been just as prodigal as with our timber land. We go on the theory when we are dead the world is going to stop, and we need not pay any attention to tomorrow. That is wrong. We talk of abandoned farms. The idea of a new nation r&gt; ours confessing it has abandoned farms. I visited at one time fields Europe which produced wheat which fed Caesar's legions, and they were producing better wheat on that land than any I saw in America. But these abandoned farms will continue unless we change our method of agriculture. I know of no way by which you can have permanent agriculture. t which you can maintain forever the fertility of the soil, except by employment of live stock. Even out in Nebraska, which is so new a state that many of us can remember when it was almost a virgin prairie covered with wild flowers. I have no doubt that when you take </seg>
            <seg id="p381">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 381 down an old fence somewhere and plow the land up, you find you are getting a better crop along that old fence row than on either side of it. That is true through Iowa and Illinois, which shows our lands, even in the newer sections, have not that wealth of fertility which they once had. There is only one way of restoring* it, and that is by combining the raising of live stock with farming everywhere. So I am making a plea for the dairy cow in Nebraska. When you produce milk, you have the satisfaction of knowing you are engaged in producing the only food known to science which alone and in itself is complete for the sustenance of human life. There is no doubt in the world but the health of the children of our great cities would be vastly improved if we could only make a campaign of education such as Mr. Glover described, which would result in their purchasing double the quantity of milk they do now. We like to feel in whatever occupation we may be engaged that we are really being of service to the world. That is the best compensation we get, after all. And in what way in all the world can you be of greater service than by furnishing this one absolutely essential article of human food to the babies of the land It has been a hard year we have gone through. There is no need to disguise that. I have been going up and down this land telling the business men for more than a year, wherever I have met them, they must recognize the fact that before you can get back in any industry or section upon the pre-war basis of prices,, you must restore the price of farm commodities to its natural relationship with the price of other commodities. You cannot have farm commodities selling below the pre - war level, as they do in some instances, and everything else from 40 to 100 per cent above that pre-war level; because this same old law of supply and demand fixes not only the price of any commodity, but the relative price of one set of commodities and the other set of commodities, in the end It has been a hard year, but the most inspiring thing about it all is the way we farmers ourselves have taken it. We have not been happy. We have not been amiable at all when we found we were the only people in all this country that took seriously this idea of readjusting thing-s to the pre-war basis; but as I say to my city friends, while I think myself the farmers have not been in quite as amiable a frame of mind as they used to be, they have not struck on their job or per - mitted their fields to lie fallow, although the crops they have just har - vested they still hold at a loss. They have gone on. Just as it was the farmers of America during the great war who, responding to the appeal made to them not only to feed our own people, but our armies in the field and the civilian population of our allies — just as they re- </seg>
            <seg id="p382">382 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ■ponded then, so they are responding now to this demand for read - justment. They have readjusted. They are waiting: for other industries to follow their example. And so I want to congratulate the farmers everywhere that their part in the readjustment following the great war has been as honorable and creditable to them as was their part in the winning of that war; because it was the farmers of America, equally with the soldiers upon the fields, who helped to win that great victory. I thank you. (Applause.) "WHAT THE MILK PRODUCERS' ASSOCIATION IS DOING. Mr. President, Ladies and Gentlemen: It seems to me after the addresses that have been delivered here, it would be a good proposition to call a halt on this program. When you put up such men as have occupied the platform recently, it appears to me to be absolute folly for a corn farmer to try to tell you what the Co-operative Association has dor Kthe first place, I am placed in an embarrassing position to fill Mr. Switzer"s shoes and to cover a subject whit [ more thoroughly than myself. Kam in an embarrassing position in other ways. I e present condition of the Milk Producers" AssocU ture will be. Permit me to say that what that Association has g be best described by using Sherman"s definition for war. W as a co-operative association, of course. All of us were enl because we thought it was the proper thing to do to market u products of the dairy farmers around about Omaha ii Sarpy counties. "A new broom sweeps clean." Everybc thusiastic at first, but things develop which they have not dissatisfaction creeps in. e The speaker before dinner dwelt very extensively along that line. He expressed my sentiments to a "T". But there are certain conditions which it seems as if it is impossible to overcome in these organizations. The reason is hard to tell. The main point is loya'ty to the Association by its members. On the other hand, we found unfair competition. That is what we are up against down there. I had always thought business men would treat one another in a business-iiki' way, and not resort to tricks and treachery; but since this Association has been in existence and they have injured us to the extent of as high aa $18,000 a month, I have changed my mind. Mr. Charles Grau. Bennington, Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p383">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 383 I might cite you an instance and use the words of the manager of that association that started six months ago. He told us what his com - petitor had done to keep him from getting trade. When he and a sales - man would go to a customer in Omaha, his competitor would follow them up and say, "Why do you want to patronize this new concern? They haven't the money. It will only be a short time until they will have to quit business. Their plant is not sanitary, and they are up in the black belt. They cater to the niggers." I am pointing out what disreputable methods some people will resort to in competition with their fellow men. He was at a loss to know what to do. He used to be in the employ of the older company. He, together with several employees who followed him, decided to go into a business of their own. In order to get even with that kind of competition, he thought, "You must fight the devil with fire." He secured a couple of affidavits from prominent men in Omaha and handed them to the clergy of the colored pulpits and requested these men to read them from their pulpits the next Sunday morning; and they did. It was only a few days until the competitor said, "If you will quit, we will call a halt. We will compromise." That is one of the conditions the Midwest Milk Producers has run into the last two years. I could go into the history of this, but it is abso - lutely unnecessary. It is simply unfair competition. Although it has been pointed out here today that farmers' co-oper - ative enterprises are the proper means of marketing farm and dairy products, it seems to me — and I have good reason for the belief — there are certain interests antagonistic to farmers' co-operative associations. I believe every one will have to admit that is true to a large extent. I will cite one incident the Midwest, went up against. One big restau - ant man was a customer of ours. He took about one hundred dollars' worth a day. The manager of the Midwest was on his vacation and had called me in to take his place. About seven o'clock one evening the assistant manager called up and said, "I have a telephone call from the night watchman at the plant that this restaurant man has sent word he did not want any milk the next morning." He did not give any reason. The supposition was he has received lower priced goods. The next day I learned he had the impression that our Association was going to be a baby starver — that its main object was to control the price of milk in that territory. They used that as a club, and yet nothing could have been farther from the truth. Did anybody ever hear of a business man treating another business firm in that manner? And that is only one of the things. On the other hand, we have run up against) this: Our Association was only a short time in existence until our competitors commenced </seg>
            <seg id="p384">384 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE raising the price in the country. The farmers had been getting- a low price up to that time. The idem of our Association was to sell this product and prorate everything back to the producers, less a certain per cent to be put into a sinking fund, and the auditor deducted $700 to create a sinking fund. Some how it does not take the producer long until he bites on that bait of higher prices offered by a competitor. That is one thing you must contend with. Then, too, they are continually underselling you in the city. You can see it is a hard row of stumps to hoe in a big city. My experience the past two years has led me to believe it is about the meanest business a person can get in to. Another Association called the "Cow Exchange" started in the State. The idea of better cows is all right, but the idea of producing more milk without trying to get a greater outlet for the product, it seems to me is the wrong road. I think it would be better to put on a campaign to use more milk, and the farmers would soon attend to their end of the business. Governor Lowden has spoken of the law of supply and demand although he questions whether it is functioning at all times. So it is not a question of producing. The first thing is to have a better outlei for your milk. (Applause.) I would like to go into other matters, but I feel it woul justice to the Association to do so right now. The Midw a- hat you might call "upon the rocks." Why? Because the stockholders hav« not been loyal to their own Association, but have bitten on the bait the other fellow has held out. One business firm in Omaha said: "It is the greatest eration the movement has ever had in the State if the farmers of Dougls and Sarpy counties won't save this institution, but let it be sold at receiver's sale." Somebody is going to buy a cheap plant in Omaha i the near future. I thank you. (Applause.) REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON RESOLUTIONS (No report was given.) THE PRESIDENT: I think we have been able to bring to this Association the very best talent that can be found in the United States on the topics presented to you by these men from out of the State. I admit this meeting has been one round of pleasure; but now I have come to the most pleasurable thing I have had the opportunity of doing, and that is to present to you your new President, Mr. Furry. (Applause.) </seg>
            <seg id="p385">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 385 PRESIDENT-ELECT FURRY: Thi» is rather a surpriae to me. I do not believe I have anything to say this afternoon, as the hour is fretting late. I thank you. (Applause.) THE PRESIDENT: We will hear from Mr. Furry next year. He will be carrying the burdens, and I am sure he will be equal to the occasion. Give him your support. Upon motion, the convention then adjourned. BANQUET Thursday Evening, January 5, 1922. The Thirty-seventh Annual Banquet of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association was held at the Lindell Hotel, Lincoln, Nebraska, with Mr. H. Frandsen, of Lincoln, acting as Toastmaster. TOASTMASTER FRANDSEN: Mr. President, Ladies and Gentle - : The President told me a little while ago that this Association &gt;sed the most interesting and most successful session it has He said we had discussed at the rgular meeting everything ce covering technical dairying and everything that ought to the Association had really been said. Then he added, "Won't act as Toastmaster tonight?" (Laughter.) As 1 said, practically everything one might wish to hear about work has already been said, and emphasized. We heard his afternoon about the importance of dairying. Every while we hear people talk about the tremendous amount of nets we have on hand, and the danger of a surplus that can- are of, what we have in dairy products. In looking up a few along this line, I notice that from the last census report we credited in the United States with having produced last year about billion pounds of milk. Most of us are hardly qualified to readily distinguish between billions and millions, and it may be well to put it in different form. Should we construct a canal and run the 89 billion pounds of milk in, it would fill such a canal ten feet wide and ten feet deep and 2,639 miles long. That is some "Milky Way". In fact, this milk canal would reach practically across the continent. However, if you do not like the canal way. let us load it on freight ars. Supposing we put twenty tons in a car, that amount of milk ■wou'd fill a train 16,000 miles long, or about as long as five times the distance from New York to San Francisco and back to Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p386">386 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE While we are figuring, let us suppose we wanted to build a fencJ around Nebraska. As I calculated, there is enough milk produced in! this state — 200 million gallons — to make a canal five feet wide and rive feet deep from the north to the south line of the State. If we put iff in cans and set the cans side by side, there is enough milk to make si fence five times around the state, or to build a wall eleven feet higJ entirely around Nebraska. But for fear some may conclude that there must be a big surplus,, let me remind you that in spite of the fact that this amount of milk' is being produced in the country, you can go into a number of cities where there are still thousands of children not getting milk to drink. I came back recently from a visit to a state not far to the south of us, where 43,000 children of school age were not getting milk in their diet. So despite the fact there are some adults daily learning of the merits of dairy products, our consumption of milk and cheese is below that uf other countries, and I believe far below what it will be in this country when we have educated our people to the real merits of dairy products. So in spite of this milky wave and the apparent abundance of milk, there really is not now enough to take care of the demands that we should have for dairy products. ■[ saw a little story the other day on this milk proposition. N to Johnnie, "Johnnie, the stork has brought you a little sister. "Aw, go on," said Johnnie, "it was the milk man who brought her. Doesn't it say on the wagons: 'Families supplied daily'?" (Laughter.) I suspect Mr. Roberts would say, "Our wagon passes your door." I hope that before long some milk man will stop at every home. The speaker I am about to call on is doing a lot of A She likes her work and attempts to answer all questions put to her, and she has a lot of such questions from her boys and girls. Recently I am told some schoolboy asked her, "Why does a red cow give w when she eats green grass?" Our speaker quickly replied: "I same reason that a blackberry is red when it is green She is so proficient in answering questions about milk that I hope you will ask her a goodly number of them. As a starter I am going to ask her, "Why the Milk Diet?" I take peculiar pleasure in introducing to you Miss Florence J. Atwood, University of Nebraska Extension Food Specialist. (Applause.) </seg>
            <seg id="p387">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 387 "WHY THE MILK DIET?" Miss Florence J. At wood, Lincoln Mr. Toastmaster and Friends: to give this talk this evening, the request was because if you looked ment for milk. When Professor Frandsen asked me only reason I could think of for his at me, I would be a good advertise- To make sure he wasn't giving me anything new to talk about, I thought I would hunt through the Bible to see if I could find any quota- milk. I found Judges 4:19: And he said unto her, Give me, I pray thee, a little water to drink; im thirsty. And she opened a bottle of milk, and gave him drink, vered him." That was not the only one I found. There are many of them there. So from that I drew my conclusion that milk in the diet is as old Time itself. In discussing this subject, it seems to me it would be better for us nquire why we eat. I think you will agree with me our reason for eating is the same as that of the animals. In the first place, we eat to bui'd tissues and muscles, and we depend on certain foods to do this ng, such as proteins, vitamines, and minerals. In the second place, we eat to replace the waste of our bodies that ontinually being torn down, and the foods we depend on to do this exactly the same ones that build up our bodies. In the third place, we eat to produce heat and energy — that is, the food taken into our bodies is chemically burned. 'The energy that is produced is used to give us power for work or play, as our activities of life may be. Then fourth, we eat to maintain health; and the foods that give us. this function are again the vitamines. If you will turn to the composition of milk, I think you will agree with me that aside from water, we find exactly the same kinds of food I mentioned as necessary for our activities of life. We find it contains protein, fat. carbohydrates, and the vitamines and minerals. So that is one reason for this question: "Why a milk diet?" It is because it is so nearly a perfect food. Dr. McCollum. of Johns Hopkins University, felt that milk should be given a particular prominence among food stuffs because of its unique value as a protective food. He feels milk is one of the biggest factors in nutrition work, and that many things we have accomplished we could </seg>
            <seg id="p388">388 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE not have accomplished without milk. You people who live in Lincoln will recall the work done in our schools along that line; that at the time they started the weighing and measuring tests, so many children were found underweight. Dr. Wolfe decided the undersized ones should be supplied with a bottle of milk in mid-morning and afternoon. The agi - tation among school children was so great, they began using more milk in their diet at home, and the results were marvelous. We found the same condition in the rural schools where we have been doing some health work and encouraging the use of milk. Where it is available, the children make marvelous improvement with more milk in the diet. So we draw the conclusion our food must not merely satisfy the appetite. It should maintain health for us. Milk is one of the things than can do this because of these protective substances we are finding out more and more about every day. Many of our foods are lacking in these substances that keep us well and produce growth, but we do have two common foods that contain them in abundance — milk and green vege - tables. The protective substance of milk is better suited for the develop - ment of mankind than that of the green vegetables, because it is easier to consume the milk in the amount needed. So that we would get enough of growth-promoting propertie another positive answer to our question: "Why the milk diet?" Again referring to Dr. McCollum, who believes the achievements of any nation in literature or art or science depend upon its consumption of milk, he says it depends more upon milk than any other one factor of their lives. Take the Chinese or Japanese or people in the tropic*. and they depend mostly upon vegetables for their growth-promoting properties. You will find some of the characteristics of these people are they are small in stature, have rather a short span of life, high infant mortality, and usually follow the same occupations as their forefathers. You will find a Japanese baby takes from two to three years longer to develop than our American child where it is given milk, and a Japanese farmer of sixty years of age usually corresponds to an American farmer of eighty. So I believe we have another answer to our question: "Why the milk diet?" Diseases such as beriberi or pellagra or scurvy or rickets are caused by faulty diets. They can be readily cured by the use of milk. Much tuberculosis is quite closely related to faulty diet, and in districts where there is high mortality from tuberculosis, usually we find that there has been a small consumption of milk. In institutions where they are M successfully treating this disease, milk is one of the most important factors of the diet. So we have another reason for our question: "Why the milk diet?" ' In the last few years we have talked a great deal about substitu- </seg>
            <seg id="p389">389 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tian, and I think we have learned we can make some substitutes for meat, and milk is a good substitute for this. I like to think of it as being more than just a substitute for our meat. I think we should think of it as being; improvement, for several reasons. In the first place, it will reduce our food bill. Second, it will mean better health for us. Third, it means greater capacity for work, and fourth, an increased joy in life. So that also has added something to our answer: "Why a milk diet?" I am wondering if I will be criticised by the meat producers when I say a reduction in the use of meat and an increase in the use of milk are desired. I think we might say it would be desired in the interest of health and also in the conservation of our national food supply. To be sure, meat is an excellent food when used in moderation, but too often it is used excessively. I know I have been criticised for not suggesting more meat in the diet, but I think we should encourage the use of milk more than meat. Meat is more liable to putrefaction in the intestines than any other kind of protein foods. We have an example of this in a cat's diet. The cat will thrive on a meat diet, but with the kitten, a meat diet results in convulsions. If it it not good for a kitten, it should not be for the growing child. Milk feeding will do away with this putrefaction I speak of be - cause it is more easily digested. Then why not include more milk in the diet 0 Another reason for withdrawing meat is because it satisfies the body in such a way that we do not seem to have a desire for the milder protein foods. Too often it will replace the milk that is necessary. Another thing, meat is poor as an ash constituent. It is entirely lacking in plasma that is one of the things we find in abundance in milk which is needed in growth. The high seasonings of the meat we should not neglect, because they are very stimulating, and I believe in health our organisms should not be whipped with a whip which is the way these stimulants act. So we have several reasons as to "Why the milk diet?" Possibly I should mention the fact that meat does have some advan - tages. It teaches the art of mastication which I think every one should be taught, and it is a good source of iron. But we can get those things from other sources without the meat. The housewife can, with plenty of milk and cream, furnish to her family the most nutritious foods available. I think that is one thing we should encourage — the use of more milk in cooking. We know farmers like to feed milk to their pigs and chickens, and just in like manner, it is just as healthy for children as for pi»s </seg>
            <seg id="p390">390 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE «nd chickens. So we have another answer to our question, "Why the milk diet?" Now as to my point of food conservation: I think the dairy cow can help us to utilize economically our food resources. She can take products that we can in no way handle at all, and bring to us a food that is very nutritious — one of the best foods we can mention. So again we have another answer to our question, "Why the milk diet?" However, in emphasizing the use of milk in diet, I do not want to be misinterpreted, because in one way milk can be considered as an ex - pensive food. If you want to think of milk as being used as a fuel food, it would be expensive. If a man depended entirely upon milk as a fuel food, he would have to consume seven to eight quarts daily. Milk has its advantages in being a real food, first, in its ability to repair our waste tissues; in the second place, in supplying minerals for growth; third, to keep the body machinery in good working order; fourth, to keep it running smoothly. I found a little message in a Toast on Milk that is not original. I would like to read it to you and leave that with you as my message for this evening: "Drink milk; drink more milk. Pure, fresh, rich milk is a food fit for the gods. Babies cannot live without milk, and growing children grow faster for it. It gives vitality to youth, power to middle age, and to old age it brings a goodly portion of the health and strength of former years. It should be used more largely by people of all ages, classes, and conditions. It excels coffee, and with it it is not to be compared. We may drink it at meals and between meals. It is one of Nature's best gifts to man. Come, let us drink another glass of milk". (Ap - plause.) THE TOASTMASTER: Miss Atwood feared some might criticise her for urging the more extensive use of milk in the diet. I think I can assure her that not only will the dairymen present not criticise her, but they will admit everything she said is perfectly true and should be advocated. I am thinking of a man who for a number of years held positions as dairy instructor in different institutions of this country. He resigned to become an editor. Later on he went into politics and was successful. Eventually he died, and it is alleged that further reports from him were to the effect that he had gone to the place where none ofl his friends had hoped he had gone, but it was said that the change was so gradual that he never noticed it. Let me call your attention to the striking similarity between that story and the life history of the next speaker. </seg>
            <seg id="p391">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF ACRICULTURE 391 (Laughter. I I happened to know he has held worthy positions on the dairy faculties of at least two or three of the state institutions of this country, and he left that work to become an editor. I also happen to know that he has been in politics, for he has been a school director for a number of years in his home town, and I am sure most of you know that he could not continue to be a school director unless he were something of a politician. Recently he has been spending considerable time in Madison, the capital of his home state, tryinsr to get certain concessions from the legislature. Nobody but a politician would attempt that! But I am going to ask him to tell it. Ladies and gentlemen, I take much pleasure in having the privilege of introducing to you Mr. A. J. Glover, editor of Hoard's Dairyman. (Applause.) "FILLED MILK AND OTHER THINGS" MR. A. J. GLOVER, Editor of "Hoard's Dairyman": Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen: I feel a good deal like Pat did. He was crossing a pasture with a cradle on his back, going to the field to cradle grain, when a bull saw him and took after him. Pat started for the fence and he ran as fast as he could. As he reached the fence, the bull helped him over. Pat began to dust his clothes and pick up his hat, and then he looked at the bull, which was on the other side of the fence pawing; find Pat said: "To h--l wid yer bowing and schrapin' and many apolo - gies. D-n yer sowl, ye did it on purpose." (Laughter.) So, my friends, in that elaborate introduction which spoke of my being in several institutions — I am not so sure that was a compliment, if man moves from one place to another. It only reminds one he is getting d when a speaker goes back over the history of your life. But I am to talk to you for a few minutes on a dry subject — "Filled Milk." Here again I find myself in much the position of Bill Jones, ive in Saginaw county, three miles from a little grocery wh store that in early days handled liquor. Bill was thirsty one afternoon and thought he would go to town, although the mud was deep and the roads bad. He got the liquor and imbibed too much. When he started home, it was a dark night and thundering. Bill was having a hard time to find the way. Now and then there would be flash of lightning. The thunder roared and rather exercised Bill, and he finally got down on his knees. Listen to his prayer: "Oh, Lord, if it's all the same to you, I wish you would give me more light, and less noise." (Laughter.) So as I look at this body, I wish for a little more light and less subject I am glad to be here tonight and discuss this subject, because I presume many of you wonder what "filled milk" is. It is composed of </seg>
            <seg id="p392">392 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE evaporated skim milk and cocoanut oil. It contains the same percentage of cocoanut oil that evaporated milk contains of butter fat Let us put it in another way. Filled milk is a product made from skim milk, after the butter fat has been removed and cocoanut oil has been put in its This product is sold under various trade names, such as "Hebe," Nutrio," and so on. There are a dozen brands at the present time. It is a product that sells as milk on the market, notwithstanding: the fact it is labeled plainly it is composed of evaporated skim milk and cocoanut oil. When it sells as milk it is a counterfeit. Laws have been passed in several states requiring: it to be labeled and sold as "filled milk," or "milk compound." or as "cocoanut milk," or "cocoanut com - pound." In Wisconsin we passed a law the last session of the legislature which prohibits its manufacture and sale, and that law is now being: tested in the Supreme Court to determine whether it is constitutional. It may seem to you rather drastic to ask for legislation to prohibit the sale of what is considered a wholesome — and it is wholesome — and nutritious product. Skim milk is wholesome. It is nutritious. Cocoa - rut oil is wholesome and nutritious. These ingredients are combined into a product and sold on the market under its trade name. Then yon say, "Why hasn't it a right to be sold?" I think this is the first food product I have ever objected to having: ■old on the market. One man said to me: "You object to the sale of filled milk, but not to the selling of oleomargarine." I said, "Those two products are different. I want oleomargarine sold for what it is and served to the consumer for what it is. When it is sold or consumed as butter, it is a counterfeit." It was through the struggle of the dairymen in pas oleomargarine was made to stand upon it own feet and be genuine in its character. That has been the fight upon the part of dairymen against the manufacture of oleomargarine. Now, when it comes to filled milk, what is the difference? Just this: Miss Atwood told you in substance the difference. Milk is our fundamental food. It has been the fundamental food of all civilized nations, clear back in the times of the Bible, as she quoted you some Scripture to prove. The Jewish people, from the time Moses led the people out of the wilderness and towards the Promised Land, were con - sumers of milk; and Dr. MeCullom has said the nations of earth that have produced the inventors and educators and law-makers, and the greatest civilizations of earth, have been the people who consumed milk. He has demonstrated by experiments that animals do not grow properly — that boys and girls do not grow properly — without milk, or the sub - stances found in milk. </seg>
            <seg id="p393">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 393 While you can get these substances in green vegetables and in liver fat and kidney fat and cod liver oil, but who is going to send the boys and girls to get these substances in order to have a complete ration ? Now milk being that fundamental food, there are many of us who. have taken the position that no one has a right to manufacture a product which so resembles the genuine product the consumer cannot tell the fraudulent or substitute from the genuine. The Supreme Court of the United States in testing a case brought before it, said in substance that the Constitution of the United States does not extend the privilege to any citizen to manufacture and sell a product which so resembles the genuine it is difficult to tell one from the other. The State of Ohio has a skimmed milk law which does not permit the selling of condensed or evaported skim milk. In this product, "Hebe," which is being sold in Ohio, a case was instituted to see if they could not stop the sale under this law. The Supreme Court of the United States held this: that because cocoanut oil was added to the evaporated skim milk, it was nothing more nor less than evaporated skim milk, and therefore could not be sold under the Ohio law; and it further de- the Ohio law was constitutional. After this decision, we made up our minds in Wisconsin we could pass a prohibitory law prohibiting the manufacture and sale of 'this product. The law was passed, and it is being tested in the Supreme Court of our State to determine whether it is constitutional. We must admit that is drastic legislation which will stop the manu - facture and sale of a wholesome, nutritious product. But I hold it is right in consideration of the future generations of our people. I am far more concerned about the development of the American dairy farmer and the American people than I am about the farmer of the South Sea Islands, with no investment except a strap for climbing trees to pick cocoanuts. I do not know how we are going to build up agriculture in this country and educate our people unless we establish a permanent sys - tem of agriculture, and unless we produce the best food products we know how to produce. It seems to me our Supreme Court of Wisconsin is likely to uphold the constitutionality of this law, because the Supreme Court of the United States sustained the Ohio law. We must admit that decision was an advanced step in determining what food products may be sold and what should not be sold. It must be admitted evaporated skim milk is a wholesome, nutritious product; yet the Supreme Court held the label upon the product does not protect, having in mind in reference to filled milk that the consumer, although he knew he was buying or using this product, did not know in the skimming process 80 per cent of the rita- </seg>
            <seg id="p394">394 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE mines — perhaps 90 per cent — had been taken away. The label does not tell that. UThe Supreme Court had in mind, I am sure, that when the American ler goes to the store or to her milk man, or wherever she purchases milk, and asks for milk, she expects milk. She may not know why milk is such a good food. The Jewish mother, from the time history is re - corded, used milk, but the could not tell why it was so good. It took a scientist to do that. But as a rule, the practical man precedes the scientist, and the latter come along and tell us why. Dr. McCullom has said that milk was good. The Jewish mother knew it was good. In this country, wherever you find a colony of Jews, you will find they have liberal quantities of milk for their children, regardless of price. The label, as you can readily see, does not tell what we know about milk. The manufacturer says it is for cooking purposes only. Do you know it has the same composition as evaporated milk, and when you sell it for cooking purposes, it is necessary to add as much more fat; -that there isn't enough shortening in this product to make cake or doughnuts ? If they wanted it as a cooking product, why didn't they put in enough Eanut oil to make it a real shortening product? If they did that. I reasonably certain it would show it is an entirely different product i evaporated milk. They have it exactly the same composition as whole milk. The housewife knows that milk alone does not contain suffi - cient shortening for her cake. She uses a little lard or butter. So the argument it is made just for cooking purposes falls by the way. They say it saves the laboring man; that he uses this skim milk which is going to waste on the farm. It does not go to waste if the man knows how to feed it to his chickens and cows and pigs. You can buy on the market as much powdered skim milk as you will find skim milk in this can of "Hebe," and as much butter fat as there is in cocoa - nut oil; and the butter and dried milk powder which will be equivalent to what is in the can in fat and milk solids will not cost as much as this filled milk compound. Then where does the economy come in? In other words, you can take butter and pure skim milk equivalent to th» amount of cocoanut oil and solids in the can of filled milk, and it is cheaper than the product they sell you. So the laboring man has not saved anything. He has been deceived. The filled milk is labeled, but in thirty-four stores out of thirty - five in Wisconsin handling the product, that were visited — a man went in and asked for a can of evaporated milk, and thirty-four stores sold this compound. There was only one storekeeper who said, "We have no evaporated milk, but I have a compound made of skim milk and cocoa - nut oil " </seg>
            <seg id="p395">395 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We found University graduates using it who thought they were using evaporated milk. One of our State Assembly men went to a gathering of students one evening to have a social time with some of the boys from his home. They were telling this man how cheaply they were operating, and said: "We buy everything by the case — even our evaporated milk." It was "Hebe." If University graduates and stu - dents will buy it when labeled and use it as milk, and when thirty-four grocery stores out of thirty-five will sell the product as milk, or some - thing better than milk, how are we going to control it by law? It is an artificial product which is aimed to take the place of a fundamental food, and it seems to me the only thing to do is to say the product shall not be manufactured and sold. I realize this is rather a dry topic for a banquet, so I am going to quit before I get myself in the position of Ole when he proposed to his girl. They were out riding one June morning. The birds were singing sweetly, and the girl looked a little nicer to Ole than ever before. He proposed to her and she accepted. Then there was a long silence. The .girl became worried, and finally nudged him: "Ole, why you not talk?" Oh, ba Yove. Ay tank Ay have said too much alretty." (Laughter.) I thank you. (Applause.) THE TOASTM ASTER: I am sure we greatly appreciate the oppor- tunity we have had to learn about "Filled Milk." It is a question that -will soon be up for serious consideration in Congress. It is almost impossible nowadays to pick up an agricultural paper but what you will see notice of the remarkable achievement of some dairy cow. I ran across a description of one of these remarkable cows in a local paper. She happened to be for sale: "A cow for sale that gives ten quarts of milk, besides two grindstones, a lot of farm tools, and a set of harness." (Laughter.) A school teacher had had occasion to punish Tommy, who talked too much in school, but apparently without any effect. Finally she re - sorted to the sending of a note to Tommy's father, with the monthly report card. Underneath the monthly report she had written these words: "Tommy talks a great deal." She waited to hear from Tommy's father. In due course of time the monthly report card came back with the signature of Tommy's father, and underneath was this remark: "You ought to hear his mother!" (Laughter.) I think whenever any good Nebraskan has succeeded in making a new dairy record that the maker should have opportunity to tell us about it and so I asked Mr. Jenkinson if he would not come to our banquet and tell us about this new Nebraska record cow. He came back and said. "You had better ask mother." (Laughter.) </seg>
            <seg id="p396">396 ■ErUKT Ur .NtBKAsKA MAIL DOAJCil Ur AOKll LL1I Kt Now, I have had some little experience with making records and know they are not easily made, even under Dairy Department conditions. That being the case, I can easily realize that to break a state record under ordinary farm conditions is an achievement that ought to be worthy of the approval of the Nebraska Dairymen's Association. So I thought it fitting that some one should tell us of this cow, which in the last year produced more milk than any other in the State of Nebraska. I am very glad to have the opportunity of presenting Mrs. Jenkinson of Monroe who will tell us about this really wonderful farmer's cow. (Applause.) "A FARMER'S COW. " Mrs. Lizzie Jenkinson, Monroe, Nebraska Fellow Dairymen and Women: I think Professor Frandsen rather took advantage of me because he thought I was going to have the last word when he said what he did. I will admit I do a little talking up to our place, but I do not do it all. (Laughter.) He spoke of milking cows under the conditions of a Nebraska institution. We are a Nebraska institution. Both my husband and I were born in Platte county — a son and daughter of Nebraska pioneers — and our home is a Nebraska insti - tution; so it is a pleasure to us to give to Nebraska her first 30,000- pound cow My part of the work has not been quite so strenuous as my hus - band's; but as "Lizzie" is a name we give little machines supposed to work hard and not get much credit, so instead of calling me Sarah Elizabeth, the folks knew what was coming when they called me Lizzie. (Laughter.) If I could change this subject, I would change it to "A Farmer's Cow in a Vision." It is just whatever the farmer himself wants to make it. I believe there are a number of good cows in the state and more breeds than the Holstein. If at the time my husband started farming, there had been a pure bred Jersey sire in the community, we would have been breeding Jerseys, and good ones. His father had a pure-bred Jersey cow. I was up there one time before we were married. They were threshing. His mother took me out to the tank. She began dipping out the cream and kept dipping. She had a gallon can. I said, "You surely have gotten into the wrong can." "No," she replied, "this is our Jersey's milk ■We had a daughter of this cow for our first cow, but the daughter not as good as the mother cow. We had other cows in our herd. </seg>
            <seg id="p397">397 REPORT OK NEBRASKA STATE BOAKD OF AGRICULTURE My husband had been at the Farmers' Course the winter before we were married and he had the vision of what a real cow can be. We did not expect to milk cows. We were just going; to keep one cow, and have a good time, too. We did not settle down to it all at once. But we found out if ever we were going 1 to have a home and the things we ex - pet-ted to have some time, it was going to be from some other source than a grain source; so we began getting more cows and milking them. My husband had heard of a publication while down at this School "Hoard's Dairyman." We subscribed for that. Among other things, he had learned to test milk, so we got a little tester and began an asso - ciation of our own. He had a very fine grade of producers as they were. but he still had other ambitions and wanted to be a producer of pure breds; so he went to a sale at Omaha and bought a beautiful little heifer calf — a sister of Clema Wayne (Butter Queen.) We named her Hope. Hope took pneumonia. She got well, but afterwards she drank much milk she made a hog of herself and died. But not our determU in He went to Central City and got a pure bred sire and a heifer calf. Then we got another one from Stevens Brothers. All this time we were breeding Holsteins. Then my husband got some young heifers from Nelson Brothers. On those we did our first official testing. We had the junior three-year-old record for seven days on Thilda De Kol Pontiac She also was the first cow in the State under full age to give 20,000 pounds All this time my husband had been using better sires, such as King Segis Pontiac Plus and Colantha Johanna Lad Plus, son of Colantfaa Johanna Lad. Before we had one of our own, we hired the services. Then we decided we would have to have another sire. In the breed papers there appeared the notice of a sale of a herd in Wisconsin. We had a full set of the Blue Books. We got a catalogue and looked things up to see if the records were as quoted in the catalogue. My husband stopped at the sale and found these animals were just as beautiful as they had been advertised to be. and gave much promise. He bought Oak Lodfre (Corona Clyde) and also her sire, Beauty Walker Pietertje Kinp, and some others. That is how we got Corona. I do not know whether I am telling family secrets, but she is not for sale. We got her for $200. Don't offer us that today. She freshened before fair time in 1917 and my husband brought her down here, and cleaned up in the Junior butter contest open to all breeds. She made 5462 pounds of milk and over twenty pounds of butter afterward on official test. In her thirty-day record, she had over 2,000 pounds of milk at this time; so this wonderful record was indicated early in her life. I shall not spend much time in giving you figures with which you a*e </seg>
            <seg id="p398">398 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE at least in part familiar. She averaged for the year a ten-gallon milk can daily of milk, and ever three pounds of butter each day. We agree with Mr. Glover that you can produce milk on the fan much better than you can buy it in tin cans. I presume the question almost everybody is most interested in is, "What did you feed her?" There were no secret rations. In our first testing work we bought all the different kinds of things -oat meal and hominy, etc.— and we thought we must fix them up just like they did back east. Later we found out the Nebraska foods were the best; so Corona was fed practically all the foods raised on the farm, excepting oil — and cotton seed meal and salt. The ration was 200 pounds of oats and 100 pounds of corn, ground together; 100 pounds of bran; 100 pounds of oil meal; 35 pounds of cottonseed meal, and 10 pounds of salt. Up to June first she was fed 41 pounds of grain daily. She was milked four times a day all through the year. Each milking she was fed three - fourths of a bushel of beets, and until she learned to eat them readily. my husband pared the beets. She had all of the fourth cutting of alfalfa she wanted all the time. His only trouble in raising alfalfa i&gt; that it is not all fourth cutting! (Laughter.) I compiled these figures because several people have aske&lt; much grain Corona got for each pound of milk. She got one of grain for each two and one-fourth pounds of milk until Jum The latter part she was given one pound of grain for each tw ach tw two-fifths pounds of milk. In the summer, in place of the bee husband chopped green corn for her. •he would drink. She was watered each ir In June she began coming down We put her on th was producing so heavily and the green grass was so succulent w she could not get enough nutriment from the pasture, so we back into the barn again. My husband ordered an electric fan for her. We had one in th house, but it was not quite so big as the one he ordered for Coron and he was afraid to take the old fan to the barn for fear I wou claim the new one when it came. (Laughter.) Her stall was screened He put the fan in the stall not only to make it cooler, but to provide circulation of air. P Corona gave seventeen times her weight in milk in a year. She hs about 1.900. And we still have Corona. We also have two of daughters, and one of them — Loup View Corona — unless there are E figures in since we sent ours — is the junior champion in the 305 - division. She carried a calf 198 days during test, and is due to ien in March, so she will qualify within the fourteen months spe- </seg>
            <seg id="p399">RFPOKT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 399 cified. We also have two of Corona's sons. One is in Denver, and one we have at home. Loup View, Corona's youngest son, is in the Nelson Brothers' herd at Stromsburg. We received a letter from the firm where my husband bought her. In it they said there was a great deal of interest in Wisconsin about her. Her mother has two other daughters, and has herself over a 20-pound record on a three-fourths' udder, losing one quarter with mammitis; so she also was quite a cow, and they are showing the stuff back there with great success. We have done prac - tically no showing. The story of Corona is just the story of planning and thinking and working and wiggling to do it. And that is nothing but what anyone else can do. There have been more 30,000-pound cows developed this year than ever before. When LaMay made her record, she was the ninth cow in the world. Corona, with her record of 1,009 pounds of fat, was ranked the thirty-fifth cow when she made her record; so times have changed. There are now twenty cows in the world that have given 30,000 pounds. Corona stands fourteenth. Times are changing, and if we are to keep at the head of the pro - cession, it behooves everyone of us to everlastingly wiggle. I will close with a little bit of original verse: The Dairy Man of 1921. (In contrast with the farmer.) The dairyman sat on his milking stool At the close of the summer's day, Thinking how profits of fields of corn Would surely be slipping away Were it not for his herd of fine Holsteins Which put the coin into his Jeans. The dairyman said to his eldest son, A lad with a freckled face, "We have milked our cows, both night and morn, For months in the same old place; Though prices may drop on hogs and steers, Our weekly check can cause no tears, "I have always felt that this day would come, So I watered and salted and fed. And my savings in that bank account Have never been written in red. So the squirrels that are up in the old oak tree Will never indeed for a nnt take me." </seg>

With the dairy cow the battle's won, Nothing can be left to Fate. (Applause.) THE TOASTM ASTER: I noticed when Mr. Glover made his talk, he stood close to Mrs. Jenkinson. I am wondering how much he paid for that Hoard's Dairyman ad? (Laughter.) Boys are quite prone to brag about the dignity of their dads, but sometimes girls have the same failing. They tell a story of a group of little girls who were enthusiastically bragging about the dignity of their respective parents. One little girl talked about the clothes. She had exhausted the subject of furnishings, and finally she said, "Do you know, every piece of mail that comes to our house is marked 'D. D.'?" "That's nothing," said the little daughter of a doctor, "I package that comes to our house is marked 'M. D'." "Huh." said the little new-comer, who so far had not spoken. " nothing. Every package that comes to our house is labeled 'C. O {Laughter.) I would not be surprised but what the next speaker will hand n a C. O. D. package. I think we all admit in spite of the wonderfu things we have done in dairying here, that at least along certain lino of dairy work, our European friends have excelled us. Possibly no on thing has contributed more to their superior dairying: over there tha some of the things accomplished in the conference* which they hold an nually. They have conferences for workers in every phase of dair work. They call them "dairy congresses," and they were held quit regularly before the war. It was deemed a peculiar privilege for every one in Europe engaged in dairy work to have an opportunity to atten those congresses. It has been the hope of American dairymen at some time to get dairying on such a footing in this country and organized in such a way that it would be possible for us to invite the official nations of the world to a dairy congress here; and it has been the hope of our dairy interests here to get together so that we could do this job in a way befitting the dignity of the country in which we live. It has been a difficult thing to work this matter out, for we have not had the organizations that usually handle work of that kind. bTwo or three years ago, some of our farsighted dairymen thought itions were about ripe for such a congress to be undertaken.

It it that love has of doing something that makes life worth while. To that man who works for wages alone, eight hours is a long day. To the man who works for the joy of accomplishing something, sixteen hours is not a long day. We need more of that thing for our young people on our farms to give them that vision that makes it worth while to "work, and plan, and think, and wiggle." I cannot refrain from adding that word. Applause We have in this country three national organizations of the dairy industry. They have three big jobs to do. One is the National Dairy Association, which gives an annual exposition of the year's progress in dairying. We have the National Dairy Council, whose job it is to tell the world — our own people — what a wonderfud product we have in these products of the dairy cow, and how much more necessary they are to human welfare than many people know. That is the educational work of the industry- Then we come to the newest and last organization — the World's Dairy Congress Association — whose task is to bring about an international exchange of the never knowledge on which progress is dependent Progress is ahead of published record. I wish you could write that down and remember it after you have forgotten me. I do not care how good "Hoard's Dairyman" is, or any other paper. The newest thing has not yet been written. The written page cannot keep up with history. It is always behind. Therefore if you want to know the newest thing, you must see the fellow who is doing it and learn it from him; and then in return tell him the newer things. That is what makes possible this </seg>
            <seg id="p402">402 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE wonderful list of organizations we have in America — these wonderful winter gatherings such as you are having here this week, in which you come to hear the newest things in your particular line that have not yet been written. It is true we hear some things that have been written, because we have not yet grasped them. We must hear them with our ears and see them with our eyes. L Europe gave us the separation, homogenization, pasteurization, and beginning science of dairy bacteriology. We, on the other hand, have taken those things and developed them. Europe gave us the cow testing association, too. We have better cows than Europe ever had, I believe. We are making better records than Europe ever made. We have developed the machinery of manufacture — the business organiza - tions of the dairy industry— I am told in advance of anything other countries have. We have developed the wonderful city milk distributing organizations and the method of handling great volumes of milk. Think of one company running fifteen hundred wagons in one city, distributing hundreds of thousands of gallons of milk daily! Think of what it means to wash all those million bottles every day, and cap and fill them, and cool the milk, and put it on the consumer's back door step, and collect a little money for it! It is a big task, and America has developed the facilities and methods by which we do these things. Not only have we done that, but we have developed this wonderful new knowledge of milk in relation to the national health and welfare. And at the risk of boring you, may I say that in one of our California cities — and I would not be a Califomian if I did not ring that into my speech somewhere — they examined 55,000 school children — weighed and measured them — and found 40 per cent were underweight and under - height. They paraded those figures before the school board. These wise old fathers sat back and said, "What of it? Aren't they good kids?" bThat took the starch out of the investigators, and they went to eir records to find some answer. They found that in every grade from e kindergarten to the eighth, not only were the non-milk-drinking chi'dren shorter and lighter for their age, but not so far along in their school work. In other words, the milk drinkers were younger in everv grade than the non-milk-drinking- children They finished the eighth grade two years younger than the non-milk drinkers; so milk not only made tight and stature, but brains. And we have other spectacular evidence ng the same line. America has learned this newer lesson of the relation of milk to the health of her young people. And we have not only learned that lesson. </seg>

Other countries are beginning to look to us to learn how to teach young people these lessons. The Ambassador from Rotterdam has said he does not care whether his farmers raise steers or cows, but he cares whether the children drink more milk or not. He has issued a pamphlet show - ing how we in America teach our children how to drink more milk. Bom - bay, India, is asking us to send a man to their city to show them how to develop a city milk supply. Hongkong is importing from Australia, milk powder and sweet butter, and emulsifying it in American homo - genizers and converting it into ice cream with American ice machinery, and selling it to the "heathen Chinee!" Stockholm, Sweden, has had a man in this country learning how we protect our milk supply against milk epidemics in order that the cities may be well fed. London is putting into the largest milk pasteurizing plant in the world all American machinery, peak of these things to show America has reached a place where we have something to give the other fellow. While we have developed in these ways, Germany, France, Denmark. Holland. Sweden, and Belgium have their men doing the more intensive work in making the more critical scientific study on which progress is made. It took the scientist seven years to learn this truth of the science of milk. It took Babcock a year to discover the Babcock test. So we we much to the scientific man for his help. This World's Dairy Congress is planned and designed to bring about an international exchange of the newer knowledge all along the line; and not only to bring about the new knowledge, but to give publicity to that which we already know. I talked with Mr. Hoover about this thing, and he said, "There are two great values resulting from such a congress as you have in mind. One is the exchange of knowledge, and the other is a wider distribution of what we already know." </seg>
            <seg id="p404">404 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE There are two great conditions. One is the fellow in the front rank hunting for new truth, and the fellow behind who ia trying to get the rest of the people to do half as well aa we already know. If all the farmers in Nebraska were doing half as good work as our friend here, we would not hear one-half the hard luck stories we do about the un - profitableness of agriculture. So we have one group hunting for new truth, and other trying to get the rank and file to act upon half of what we already know. So the Congress will have two purposes: To get new truth, and to get the people to use what they already know. bThe suggestion of the Congress came to us from South America, came to the State Department and they referred it to the Department Agriculture, and they brought it to the Dairy show. As president, it fell to my lot to find out whether our dairy people wanted it. We held a meeting and called in representatives of fifteen different national organ - izations. They said, "Let's go ahead provided Congress will authorize the President to invite foreign nations to take part" You see we wanted class to these things! I do not know whether you will have to hire dress coats or not. (Laughter.) On the other side they laid a great deal of stress on the kind of coat worn. Some of our delegates had to rent dress suits. When they got to the function, they found two of them had only one pair of gloves. Each wore a glove and kept the other hand out of sight. (Laughter.) The gentleman who told me this said, "When in Rome, do as the Romans." Congress has given the President authority to invite these people. It was changed from 1922 to 1923 before Christmas, so we are ready to send out our invitation. We did not have anybody to speak for the dairymen in this country, so it was decided we should have an organiza - tion with special organizers which would take charge of this matter, so there has been organized the World's Dairy Congress Association. It takes money in America to make things go — even a farm. The question was, "Who is going to pay for this?" We said, "We will ask Congress for some help." It will help a little bit, but if we want this tiling to go, we will have to pay for it ourselves. There were three men at the first meeting who would each put in $100. I was asked to find if there were one hundred such men or organizations or associations in America. I called on thirty-six men and have $30,000 promised. I know the next thirty-six are not going to do as well. You pick the cream first. When the patch gets thin, it takes longer to fill the pail. We have $70,00 subscribed out of the $100,000 we started to get. About next December we will go to Congress and ask for help. This is not an assessment of the industry. It is an opportunity which it has been my duty to present to the biggest men and com - panies and organizations in this country. I want to tell you that has </seg>
            <seg id="p405">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 405 been gome job! My wife and I have lived in a couple of auit cases and stayed in hotels in thirty-six different towns in this country in the last few months. I have had the pleasure of meeting, I think, the president of each of the largest manufactories of dairy machinery, the largest creameries, the largest milk condensaries and milk compound concerns and ice cream concerns and plants and individual men in the Jersey, Holstein, Guernsey and Ayrshire breeds of cattle, and quite a number of our state associations. I want to say to you it has been a liberal education to find as fin* a lot of men scattered in these different businesses as in any business in America. This Congress is a sort of bringing together of these leaders. I cannot call on a hundred thousand people to get a dollar from each. So we chose the other way to find the men who could afford to contribute to this thing and would do so because they believed it was of value to the dairy industry of America. Did you ever stop to think that progress in every branch owes a great deal to the unselfish people who do something without hope of immediate reward? Who are the men who have made your State Asso - ciation a success? Have you paid them in cash for the services they have rendered, or must they take their pay in satisfaction? I suspect the latter. So this Dairy Congress is not going to be paid for by all the people who will benefit, but by the smaller portion who can afford to help. I had the privilege of presenting this matter to the Creamery Men's organization of this State. To the surprise of some of their members and the gratification of the rest, they promptly voted to join and con - tribute their thousand dollars. I presented it to the Milk Producers' organization of San Francisco and the Dairymen's league of New York, and they said they were glad to help. I presented it to a little bunch of Guernsey breeders around Philadelphia, and they said, "We will help." Somebody said, "Let's pass the hat and get it done with." They raised $750 in twenty minutes. One woman said, "I will put in $100 for my daughter." I do not know whether the production side of the dairy interests of Nebraska wish to help with this work or not. I do not know whether they are able to help or not. Your Chairman asked me to present the opportunity, and it is yours. If you want to help make this thing possible, and if you want the name of the Nebraska dairy interests associated with the World's Dairy Congress in literature that goes out around the world, your co-operation and support will be welcome. I am not like the missionary home on a begging enterprise. I am your hired </seg>

I do not know whether you wish to do anything with it or not. In one sense, it is immaterial. I know the work is going across and going across big. Do you want to be a part of it? I thank you for the pleasure I have had in being here and hearing the program and speakers today and yesterday. I congratulate you on the development that is being made. I believe the dairy industry of this State and of America has a wonderful future ahead of it. Our big prob - lems will not be solved by the individual, but by groups of individuals with wise leadership, and in a spirit of co-operation. Do not be discouraged, but go ahead in the spirit which makes for American accomplishment I thank you. (Applause.) THE TOASTMASTER: I am sure we are grateful to Dean Var Norman for having given us this view of the work. The meeting wil soon be back in the hands of the President, and perhaps he will have something further to say relative to this matter. Dr. Schwab says the most interesting story he ever heard was at boy who left his brother on the farm to do the work, while he wei to the city. The city boy wrote back to his brother out on the fan telling of the joys of city life, in which he said: "Thursday we autot out to the country club where we golfed until dark. Then we motort to the beach, and Fridayed there." The brother on the farm wrote back: "Yesterday we buggied i town and baseballed all afternoon. Then we went to Med's and pokere until morning. Today we muled out to the cornfield, and gee-haw i until sundown. Then we suppered, and then, we piped for a while. Aft&lt; that we stair-cased up to our room and bed-steaded until the clock fived (Laughter.) That reminds me of the dutie if the average dairynr Looking over the topic assigned to the next sneaker, it makes one think of dairy work. When we see what an easy time boys in the towns have, when they work short hours for good pay, we may justly wonder how it is possible under those conditions to interest any of these boys sufficiently to get them interested in dairy work. That is the subject assigned to the next speaker. I am glad at this time, not to introduce — because most of you already know the new head of our Dairy Department — but to have the opportunity to present officially at a dairy banquet Professor H. P. Davis, chairman of the Dairy Husbandry Department of our University, who will now ad - dress us on the subject: "Our Dairy Husbandry Department". (Applause.) </seg>
            <seg id="p407">407 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE "OLR DAIRY HUSBANDRY DEPARTMENT" PROFESSOR H. P. DAVIS, Lincoln: Mr. Toastmaster, Ladies and Gentlemen: There is only one way to follow the schedule Professor Frandsen has outlined for both city and country. That is to take Miss Atwood's advice to drink milk, and drink lots of it. It may interest you to know that "Toast to Milk" was originated by one of the speakers with you tonight — Mr. McDowell. At the time he originated that, I labored with him to get up a good toast, because it was a good subject. I believe he originated a real Toast to Milk, and I wish we had him here to give the toast. Now, milk is not only a good food, bat a good drink. We cannot chew it That is one reason, I think, many people do not drink it. They must have something to work their teeth on. You cannot work your teeth on milk, if it is good milk. (Laughter.) — Not unless it is processed in the many hundreds of ways miik can be processed. Milk has a soothing effect on civilization. Somebody has said all the inventive geniuses come from countries where milk is an important part of the diet. I would like to take that a little further, and I am going to copy from a man who originated the idea. I will give him credit for it, but I think it is a unique idea and well worth thinking about. We are talking about less armament. Why can't we prevent arma - ments at all? Milk is a good food. Maybe it is a peace promoting sub- Stance. I rather think it is. Think of the countries where dairying is a leading industry. Think of Denmark. She has not been at war for years — certainly not since the dairy industry has developed to any great ex - tent. It is hard for any of us to remember when Switzerland was at war, and Switzerland certainly has developed the dairy industry. Holland — another dairy country — has been rather peaceful for a considerable period. Maybe there is something in a milk diet that makes for peace. Mr. Rabild, a former member of our dairy fraternity, said that and the newspapers the country over said, "It is the one cause for disarma - ment." Maybe it is. We should drink more milk for other purposes and possibly it would help us to be more peaceful in our homes. I do not know whether after drinking a bottle of milk you would feel pugnacious or not, I have never seen it on the diet of our famous prize fighters. Milk certainly is a wonderful food. Being a wonderful food, it can be handled in so many different ways that the intricacies of the business are hard to master. I do not believe very many of you realize how many different dairy products there are. We know there is milk — whole, and skimmed, and evaporated, and condensed, and dried — and cheese. People say, "Yes, there is cheese," as if it covered everything. There are nearly five hundred varieties of cheese, and most of you cannot name twenty-fire. </seg>
            <seg id="p408">408 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE We do not know much about our industry — about the products into vrbich milk may go. We ought to know more about it. Yet you put up to us the job of telling all our students all about the dairy industry' I know some of you come up and think it is surprising we do not know absolutely everything to be known about the business. We do not know it all. I wish we did. If we did, I am afraid our heads would burst with th( knowledge. But we are representing you and your institution, in your service trying our best to teach your boys and girls something about this big, magnificient industry. It is a bit; industry. The mere taking care of cattle is a complicated business in itself. If you do not believe it. just talk with some of the people who have taken care of these high-producing cows. It is not just going out and shoveling a little feed in every morning and more at noon and night. It is the observation and the knowledge and the keenness that go along with it. How are you going to know when the cow gets off feed? Those are the things that make the business successful. If we could always tell — and Nels Anderson will bear me out in this- — when a cow is going off feed twenty-four hours beforehand we would never let her go off. That is just one phase of the industry. We do not know very much about cheese. We manufacture very few varieties of cheese in this country. Lately we are manufacturing Swiss cheese which is fully equal, I believe, to the best manufactured in Switz - erland. It is the result of scientific work — a complicated science. We are going to be able to master other foreign cheeses whose peculiar flavor may not appeal to your taste, but on the market will bring a high Een the market milk business in itself is one of the most technical nesses. It sounds easy to bring milk in and run it through a pas - r and through a bottler. But how are you going to control the cream line and keep it even from day to day? If you know the answer. you can draw a magnificent salary from some of the milk companies in this country. Those are some of the problems that come to us. We are trying to ■olve them. Our duty is to try to be of service to you in the State through your boys and girls who come to the College, and through our Extension Service, as Professor Lawritson tries to take our work to you and the various county agents and farm bureaus, to bring the informa - tion we have gathered to you and try to represent, to the best of our a - bility, a centralized place where we can all come and talk over and advise with each other on the problems of dairying. I hope we may have that conception in this State — that you will feel free to talk things over with us. We do not know it all, but maybe by swapping experiences we can make this industry one of the great names </seg>
            <seg id="p409">BEPOBT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 409 in Nebraska agriculture. I hope for that. I think it is entirely feasible. Then we will not have the depression we are now having because so many of our folks have labored with one or two crops. A more diver - sified farming, a little more dairying, and we will have the prosperity that has gone with our dairy states. Prosperity does not always go with fertile soil. If you have ever been over some of the counties in Wisconsin, you will wonder why any of the people ever settled in that country — Mr. Glover will pardon me if I say that — when there is so much good land the world over. The real reason Wisconsin has come out so well is because those people have had to dairy in order to get a good living on much of Wisconsin's soil. Nature is too good to us out here, and every now and then she takes a little slap. She gives us a bumper crop, bat the consumer gives at very little for it. Mrs. Jenkinson brought up a point we must not forget. Our im - provement in our dairy cows conies from selection, from breeding. Where are we going to get that improvement if not from the great sires We cannot tell where they are. We must develop them. When we do, let us hope we can use them to the best advantage. I hope there will be a fraternity among the dairymen for getting good sires that we may have the benefit of the use of such an animal. We have had the benefit of a few at the University in years gone by. When a sire can add three thousand pounds of milk to the daughters over the dams, let us promote that part Let us work together and all push, and instead of sitting back and waiting for other people or forces to help us in dairying, let us all get behind and push; and let us take an active part, not only in our stats work, but in our national work in promoting dairying — the best of all forms of livelihood. (Applause.) THE TO ASTM ASTER: They tell of a colored man who was sup - posed to have been in one of the battles of the world war. Sambo was caught running away as rapidly as he could well run. Someone seeing him run, yelled, "Sambo, where are you running from?" "I ain't run - ning from anywhore. I is just trying to get away from where I's at." (Laughter.) If I were on a toast list and had a subject entitled "Ripe Ol - ives and Wood Alcohol," I would want to get away from it as fast as possible. I am sure you are going to enjoy the treat there is in store for you. The speaker I am about to introduce is one of the Lincoln Rotary Club's best entertainers, and I take pleasure in introducing Mr. Risdon, who will talk on the subject of &lt;; Ripe Olives and Wood Alcohol." </seg>

Ladies and Gen - tlemen: I owe that reputation to Professor Frandsen. It was he who guve me my first opportunity in Rot&amp;ry. When he called on me for my subject, I used that which was uppermost in my mind: "The Relation of Ripe Olives to Wood Alcohol." I think that was the subject he first as - signed me . After listening to the wonderful talks this evening I have decided to changre the subject. Although I have acquired a reputation as an after-dinner speaker, that reputation has been far overshadowed by one I acquired for having been arrested for being the first one to have been found with liquor in his possession after the- State went dry. (Laughter.) The story is this: I fired the office boy and he beat it to the police station and told them I had liquor in my possession. They sent a search warrant and found down in the water cooler two pint bottles of beer. They read me the warrant I ■went to the Judge and asked him to read the law. He did. I said, "How much." "One hundred and five dollars. I paid it. Then I beat it to the state "Journal" and "Star" and tried to suppress it, and they gave me the horse laugh. "Did they use the story?" Well, yes; so much so I had letters and telegrams of condolence nee from all over they country. I read of the incident in all kinds of Ian guages — even in a paper published in the Swedish language in Connecti cut That's the story. The Rotary Club took it up, and I believe Profess or Frandsen was responsible for that. They said they did not want any body in their institution who would raise the price of beer from a dollai a quart to fifty-two and a half dollars a pint! (Laughter I told them I was in the same position as the Kentuckian who re - turned home to look after his votes. They gave a dinner for him. When he sat down to the table he saw he was down for a toast, and the sub - ject was "Water". He said: "I have seen it in the eye of Youth; I have seen it trickle down the face furrowed with age; I have heard its sweet music in the early morn mingled with the ice in the pitcher that the boy brought up the hall; I have seen it gush from the mountainside and wind its trail through hill and vale where sweet birds sitting upon dripping branches would lend their sweetest notes to the rushing waters. I have heard it beat upon the rocky shores of the Penobscot and the Golden Gate where the sun is wont to set in its rainbow splendor; and in its oxygenic form I have known its sustaining elements to bring back tn life one stilled in death. In youth I waded in it; in age I have had it massaged into me. I admit </seg>

(Laughter.) but as a beverage — it isn't worth I am pleased to be with the ladies this evening, because I owe what little success I have in my life to my mother — to the early training and education and confidence my mother instilled into me when a mere boy. I have been very successful, because I measure success entirely by th* friends I have made and not in dollars and cents. You know, my mother was my pal. The last time I told about my call back home at the time she died, the description I gave of that meet- inp filled my audience with such emotion I said I would tell it never cpain. But I cannot help thinking of her because My mother had two lovely eyes, As lustrous as the evening skies, And looking in, I always saw My image, perfect, with no flaw. Safely stored within my heart Lies her image, my sweetheart. My mother had such lovely hair, Combed around with her own air Of tender care, soft and brown. Coiled around her like a crown; Twisted round with dainty touch. Not too little nor too much My mother had a perfect mouth, Warm as breezes from the south, Like the joyous birds of spring Were the songs she loved to sing; Drooped aeainst her loving breast. My head found a perfect rest. My mother had a charming face, Circled round the neck with lace; The softest cheeks, the daintiest ears Listening to my hopes and fears; Pearly teeth, as white as milk, Lips with kisses soft as silk. My ir other had the sweetest chin. With little dimples dotted in; And her eyes, so soft and mild, Gazing tenderly at her child; My mother was my dear, my friend; We chummed until the very end.

The next morning at the breakfast table I was just about to leave when a gentleman said, "I beg your pardon. I understand you are a memory expert." Then he handed me a long slip of paper on which was a poem. He said, "Here is some - tiling you should commit to memory." I looked at it and saw it was something I knew. I stood and read it through, and as I was reading, I would pass my hand over my forehead tragically. (Laughter) Finally I handed the poem back to him and re - cited it. Poor Old Dad You can scarce pick up a paper and its poets' corner greet, 'Cept you'll find a pretty poem of a sainted mother sweet. But you'll have a time of searchin', eyes will be achin' mighty bad Ere you run across a poem at this time for Poor Old Dad.

He is bent and wrinkled, and I know 'twould make him glad If when you're praisin' mother, something's said for Poor Old Dad. (Applause.) As I went out of the door, the big fellow said, •'That's absolutely uncanny'" (Laughter.) Going back to the subject the Professor assigned me — the liquor question — all evening I made up my mind when I got home I would beat it to the refrigerator and get a good big bottle of Hunter's milk. (Laugh - ter.) I am satisfied that had Edgar Allen Poe fed up on milk, he would never have written "The Raven" for he wrote it while he was drunk. But he was goaded on to do those things from the fact he was underfed. I am satisfied if he had lived at our present time he would never have writ - ten the poetical works attributed to him. He wrote "The Raven." It is a wonderful thing, if you stop to think »bout it, where he says: </seg>

We did not know at the time that we would be privileged to keep this representative with us un - til our banquet, and for that reason his name does not appear on oar toast list; but it is a traditional thing with the Dairy Association that we always measure out a better and larger program than we publish. So we are triad to have this opportunity of calling on Mr. McDowell, who talk to us or. "The Farmer of the Future MR. J. C. McDOWELL, Washington, D. C: Where he left off i« re I would like to begin. A. fellow farmer had two sons, John and George. Both desired to ) college, but their father found it necessary to keep one at home. In order that the boys might have equal opportunities, he decided to send John one year while George remained at home, and the next year send George while John stayed on the farm. In that way each would fin- a college education During his first year in college, John made rapid progress, and in tion to his other achievements, he became engaged to a very beauti - young lady. As he was about to go back home he told his sweet- arrangement his father had made, and said he hoped she things pleasant for George the next year. ?orge came and enrolled and began his class work.

'Laughter.) And for just a few minutes I would like to talk to you about "The Farmer of the Future." We have heard a great deal at these meetings about the dairymen of the present. I would like to talk to you about the farmers of the future, and especially the dairymen of the future. The dairymen of the future will maintain soil fertility, and on ac - count of the better soil fertility, he will grow big crops and feed these crops to high-producing dairy cows. The soils of Nebraska vary greatly ; n chemical composition. Every fanner should know something of the food requirements of the crop* be is producing. With this knowledge he would know what crops can be </seg>

The farmer who sells the article that will bring the greatest finan - cial returns may make money for the time at the expense of succeeding generations. There was a farmer in South Dakota who had sold so many farms and moved 80 many times in a covered wagon that when his chickens saw a covered wagon, they would hold up their feet in order to be tied and thrown in. (Laughter.) What constitutes soil fertility? Prof. Cyril Hopkins says we mint maintain the chemical composition of the soil and guard against loss. Hie idea has been advanced that each crop poisons the soil against itself. Some say weeds make the trouble, and others that we should conserve the soil moisture, and others emphasize the tremendous losses that come from plant diseases transmitted that invade the soil. Alkali soils are common in the west, and exist as well in the central western states; but the absence of humus in our soils is the greatet prob - lem, and the dairy cow will keep the soils well supplied wih humus. The dairy farmer of the futurt not only will grow big crof feed them to high-producing- dairy cow*, hut he will sell the milk to advantage than we are selling milk, because he will advertise bette we are advertising. A certain Professor in the Ohio Agricultural C tells how he acquired a taste for shredded wheat biscuit wher were first placed on the market, he saw an advertisement of sh wheat biscuits. He tried them out but did not like them. Ht E Hoover of our Department, who has charge of the milk cani - irk, says there is more undernourishment among the children of than amoner the children of the poor; that there is more under - ient among the children on the farms than among the city chil- tome to his dog but the dog did not like them. The next day he ;-ai advertise lent again, and he l&gt;ought more ihiuddtll wheat list aits. day the Professor liked them a little better, hut the don did not like at all. The Professor kept seeing the advert isements and trying out, and finally he learned t&gt; like them; Imt the fcg never did. He the difference was he could read and the dog couldn't. ( Laughter. "It pays to advertise." Do you know an acre of land will produce more food in the for milk; that a ton of hay and a bushel of grain will produce more in the form of milk, and a dollar will buy more food in the form of than in the form of any other animal product? Do you know you can run as far and climb as high and work as on a quart of milk as on a pound of .beef? The farmer of the future will use more milk than is being used b farmer of today. He will be the gainer by it. </seg>

We had a picture taken to ustrate this Toast of a little girl with a glass of milk in her hand. As he holds it up to the other children gathered around her, she recite* hese words: A Toast to Milk that sweet, rich drink, Gives strength to work and power to think Then give us milk, so pure and mild — A quart each day for every child. About a year and a half ago 1 was asked by the Boy Scouts of Amer - [&gt; write a booklet on the subject on Dairying for the Boy Scouts. In writing it I took the opportunity to do a little advertising for milk by writing the Scouts' Toast to Milk. We had a picture of a Boy Scoot holding a glass of milk. As he addressed the other Boy Scouts about him said: That I may be a healthy Scout, strong, vigorous and active, I must milk. I love to drink delicious milk fresh from a healthy cow, be - i it is good, sweet, and pure, and because it gives me a clear eye, keen brain, and powerful muscles. The bony framework of my * Jy is built from the lime and phosphates; my muscles from its pro - n. Its sugars and fats keep me warm and give me power, and its lime* ike me grow. I like bread and milk, mush and' milk, and milk toast. But I like best when it is served alone. me, then, fellow Scouts of America, come, let us have another milk." (Applause.) Mr. Toastmaster, I am handicapped for lack of words. If I had the eloquence of Demosthenes I would write the story of milk in words of gold and illustrate every page with pictures of healthy children, and use photographs of laughing babies to give it a halo of glory, and send it forth into every nook and corner of this fair land of ours to teach my fellow countrymen milk makes children gTow. (Applause.) The farmer of the future will not only use more milk and set a better table than the farmer of today, but he will have more money with which to provide better schools, "hurches, and h^mes. </seg>

I travel quite extensively for Uncle Sam, and I have seen farmers living in comfort on the swamp lands of northern Minnesota.

I think it was Dean Van Norman who said to us today this group of men is not more honest than other groups of men; that they are not more honest than those engaged in other kinds of business; that we were not more fair; that we were not less selfish. I would like to say this tonight: We ought to be. A lady visiting a farmer's home came out very indignantly to the farmer and said, "You are just as bad and as dishonest as all the rest </seg>

"What do you meant" "I saw it with my own eyes. 1 saw your hired man drive the tow to water just before he milked them this morning." (Laughter.) If this group is not more honest and less selfish, it ought to be. In connection with that — speaking of our Dairy Association — 1 think of t State of Nebraska. Nebraska is not a dairy state; but it ought to There are many things that have been told you, and 1 can go over a number of those, telling you why it ought to be a dairy State, but we will not take time tonight. When the number of dairy cows is quoted and statistics in this State compared with the dairy cows in other states, I am sure in this State they count anything that is milked in that number; thus we do not get a fair comparison of the dairy cows of Nebraska with those of our dairy states. I would like to see a census made of dairy cows only in this State, with their amount of prodi I am sure it would be a real encouragement to our State and to thi tempting to develop this business. The farmer today is coming into his own, so far as his pla society and in government is concerned, and he is beginning to it he has at last a splendid power in the control of these things. When we stop to think there are more men engaged in this busi - ness than any other business, we ought to realize our power still further. Some of our farmers and possibly some of our dairymen sometimes think that the other lines of business are getting their hands into our pockets. It reminds me of the story of the man who boarded a heavily loaded car in New York City some years ago. He had to stand. After he got in. he began to think about pickpockets and remember he had a large roll of bills. He slipped his hand in and found another hand. He said, "Scoundrel!" The other said, "Pickpocket!' They stood holding hands. There was another man who had been quietly reading his pap* Finally he said. "I would like to get off at this next corner. W you two men please take your hands out of my pocket?" ( Laughter. &gt; I think it is true, generally speaking, the farmers are saying to other linefe of business, "Will you please take your hands out of my pockets?" Now, ladies and gentlemen, I want to close with just this one thought. There was a young girl just getting into society in the town who had never been in the country. Her girl friend in the country invited her city friend to visit her. The city girl's mother was very particular, and her daughter went on to tell of the splendid things in that country </seg>

The girl turned to her mother and said, "I never thought to ask; but I heard her speaking of the Holsteins and Guernseys. That is all I know." The mother said, "That doesn't sound bad. I believe they will make good associates for you." (Laughter.) So I want to say to you tonight to have your association with the Holsteins or Guernseys or any of the dairy cows and I believe it will be approved. A few years ago the Kansas farmers started a race as to who could raise the largest hog. One man put out a unique poster in front of his farm. They were all hunting for the largest hog in the State. The poster said this: "If you want to see the largest hog in the State of Kansas, stop and see me." (Laughter.) would like to say, and I believe the business is worthy of it, that our own Dairy Association and the dairy business in the State of Ne - braska ought to be able to say in a few years to come: "If you want he best and greatest business in this State, come to visit us." hank you.

It is up to us whether we care to participate in this so that the Nebraska Dairy Association will be a part of this Dairy Congress work. It is almost too late to discuss this.

If you can raise a thousand dollars, we can give each one credit for a membership. If on the other hand, you only raise $200, we would be disposed to put it under one name. There is no ironclad rule about it. We want this list of names to stand fur the more important part of our industry — a list of five hundred or a thousand names being selected from all the hundreds of thousands of possible memberships has a good deal of prestige. A list of a hundred thousand names would not have much prestige. We want the prestige of personnel as well as the mere finances.

Two years ago last November I sold my farm, stock and tools, and gave the man I sold to possession January 1 following. As soon as we could we packed and stored our house-hold goods and started on our trip January 21. A few days before we started, one of the Stewart Land company's agents invited us to go on an excursion as their guests to visit the Rio Grande valley in the extreme southern part of Texas. I dec'.ined to accept their invitation, telling them that while I intended to visit this valley I preferred to go by myself, and in telling you about this visit I am expressing my opinion, and from what I observed and from what I was told by people living in the valley I think that my opinion is about correct. Many of you, no doubt, have had invitations from representa- tives from this land company, or some other of a similiar natur these excursions. They have been known to make up whole tr of people and take them down there. Somehow the agent ie other end know how many puests are aboard and automobiles sufficient in number to carry all the guests are provided. These guests are not landed in town, but are taken to the country and switched onto a siding, and as the passengers alight the autos line up and they get into them and away they ?o across country to tY It is a beautiful place, in beautiful grounds, wt.ll cared closed with a high fence, with gates at the entrance and gate k at these gates, and if you want anything outside of the entrance, the only way to get it is to make it known to your host and he will get it for Eu, but you are not allowed outside if they can help it — and they help you are their guest and they don't mean you shall see anyone outside of their company for fear you may get a word from an outsider and spoil a trade. You are entertained royally for that night, and the next morning you are again loaded into automobiles and taken to a splendid farm represented to be owned by the occupant, but I was informed by people there that it was owned and operated by the land company and was called a demonstration farm. Oh, they were beautiful spots, lovely flowers, ripe tomatoes in January, and the oranges were magnificent. You were allowed to talk to the operators of this demonstration farm, and they would tell you whatever he could do, you could also do, and all that, and after hearing a little speech from him you were loaded into the </seg>

The water conditions there are not safe and never will be until the government takes hold of the matter. If you are going into an irrigated country, go where the water is safe The agents will tell you there is al - ways water in the Rio Grande. There is, but it has to be pumped and it is possible that the pumps cannot reach it or the pump may fail. There it no water so many times just when you must have the water to make your crop. There are so many fraudulent conditions connected with this land deal, and I got so disgusted I didn't know what to do. I have wanted time and again to have the opportunity to go before the young men of Nebraska and warn them, as I have this morning, on this occasion. From southern Texas we went through the southern states to New England and didn't stop except in Louisiana and Washington, D. C. In New England we spent two months and a half. We traveled in New Eng - land over 4,000 miles by auto, and although I was born and raised in southern Vermont I felt I was never acquainted with New England until I had taken this trip. New England conditions are very much better than they were 30 or 35 years ago when I lived there. Agricultural operations are a great deal more progressive. A great many so-called abandoned farms have been re-occupied and are being built up, and I was glad to see the prosperity there. I don't know whether this is the proper time for me to mention it or not, but perhaps it is. The dairying all the way from the north to the south and from the Atlantic to the Pacific predominates. Dairying is the predominant power in southern Texas and dairying is the predomin - ant power in New England and in New York State. I found these farmers, once disconsolate and homesick, turning the tide and building up their once beautiful homes and improving them until dow they are prosperous once more. Go where you will, there is no more beautiful scenery on every road and every street in the summer time than in New England, I care not where you go. In southern Texas, where I stopped in the town of Lyford, the cashier of the bank was formerly from the north, and he invited me to go with him to buy a carload of cowa for himself and customers. I asked him if he didn't loan money to the cotton growers, and he said, "No, not by any means." And I asked about the truck garden grower, and he said, "No, the only farmers we loan to are the good, honest dairymen, and we loan money to buy all the cowa he wants." We went to Falfurious, 80 miles away, and bought cows, and perhaps it may not come amiss if I give you a little description of this dairying farm in Falfurious, Texas, where I didn't suppose I would find a dairy cow. There I found the largest dairy farm in the United States. Ed </seg>

In all my experiences in visiting many universities and colleges, in Massachusetts. California, Colorado, Iowa, and Oregon, we have got to take our hats off to Ed Lassity as a systematic dairyman with 3,000 Jersey cows. He was milking 900 when I was there, and I think he has got them all beat for system. He had to use cheap help as a rule, and his milkers were allowed to milk only 20 cows a day and every milker must keep an accurate record of the cows he milks (every cow has a number) and set down the amount of milk to the credit of the cow. Most of the milkers were Mexican women. His farm is divided into eight dairys with a superintendent to each dairy. The superintendent takes the record book or sheet that shows how much the cows are producing, and [joes down the line, he knows where each cow is and what each cow is pro - ducing. Right over each cow is a little blackboard. The superintendent writes on that board how much and what kind of feed that cow must have that day, and anybody who can read figures knows how to feed that cow. He has silos with a capacity of 64,000 tons, and he cannot grow alfalfa or corn but has to gTow kaffir corn and such as that. And yet Ed Lassity almost went into bankruptcy until he picked up a little old Jersey cow and went to milking, and now he is one of the moat independent fanners in the United States. From New England we came home through New York state, by auto, jming through Wisconsin, southern Illinois and home. I stopped in Illinois among old friends and noted the price of their land and the con - ditions there as best I could. It was surely wonderful to see those Ill - inois farmers and I made inquiry as to the money they made from the farms and how they were progressing from a financial standpoint. We came through Iowa and on home. Then on the 19th day of January, a year ago, we again started, this time for the west and California. We started by rail, but after visiting a few days we found we could not get around as we would like, so bought a very good second hand car and I told Mrs. Chase we would continue to drive until it played out or we played out. We went the entire length of California, except a little in the south - ern part. There are only two highways on which you can go the length of that state. We took the inner route, by San Joaquin Valley. I was surprised to nnd California such a poor agricultural state. I had ex - pected to see a rich alluvial soil and I didn't find it. There are some Kttle spots down near Ontario where the soil is rich, bat as a rale it is very poor and it costs lota of money to keep up the elements of fertility. Fertilizers are bought by the carload to enrich those orange groves and vineyards.

He goes out there and he must have an orange grove no matter what it costs. A land agent sells it to him and then another tenderfoot comes along and he sells it again for a little higher price until the prices are enormous. I saw a 10-acre orange grove that a man bought for $6,000 an acre. These orange groves, walnut groves, and vineyards range in price all the way from one thousand to six or seven thousand dollars an acre.

Then we went north to the seaside and Astoria and the entire length of the Columbia river highway up the Colombia river. To you tourists who are contemplating a tour, if it is possible for you to take this trip up the Columbia river, by all means do not mss it. It is the greatest scenic route in the United States and I don't believe it can be beat in Europe. From there across the Blue Ridge to Idaho, with two and a half months spent on an irrigated farm on purpose to see the crop grow. And it surely does grow. The first thought was, "Here is the garden spot of the United States. See those potatoes and alfalfa and the wheat and the corn prow." It looked good. I have always wanted to get to a place where, when I planted something in my garden I was sure to get some - thing out, and there it was. If one doesn't have a good garden out there in Nampa, Idaho, it surely is his own fault. But there are many dis - advantages of an irrigated section. It is not all lovely.

Near where I was in Idaho man went in debt for 20 acres of his farm at $275 an acre at x per cent interest. Now figure up the interest and then figure what he for the use of the water to water that tract of 20 acres, and e taxes and everything. It amounted to $27.50 per acre lung as he didn't reduce the investment Alfalfa was $3.60 he could grow about four tons per acre, the cost of putting it op was subtracted from that. Wheat made a little over 50 bushels per acre. S27.50 an acre has got to come out of it. And all the time vel over your shoulder end boots on, you are going about to w water trickles down over the field all right or not. I saw \vK e in one place a patch of about two acres with the crop all dead. I stigated and found the soil about two inches high. It had not been ugh water, had dried out and died. I walked down to another crop was doad. There were two or three acres, it was tars and one-half inches too low, and an over amount of water had run on there and killed it all. That is the condition you must confront when you go into an irrigated country to farm. You must be there with a shovel on your back to see whether the water trickles down the row just right to get the maximum crop, and if you don't get the maximum crop, where are you? From Idaho we went through Yellowstone, and home. Now, in conclusion, after traveling in an automobile across the con - tinent over 17,000 miles, and visiting these different places, I have come to this conclusion.

I came to Nebraska, and I wouldn't go back for anything, and I found a young man who was born near my old home two yeai&gt; after I left there. He is now 34 years of age, and smart enough to own over 400 acres of land. I left there because I wanted to better my condi - tion and he thinks there is not another spot in the world to equal it right there in Vermont. He is contented and saving his money. Lin southern Texas I saw men doing well, yet many were on the verge bankruptcy and would sell out for half what their possessions cost them if they could get away from there. The same condition existed through New York and the same condition exists in California and in Idaho, and in that wonderful Boise valley. There are plenty of men there who, if they could sell out and get their money, would not stay there.

We will draw a line commencing on the Atlantic coast at a point north of Portland, Maine. Draw this line west north of Buffalo, north of Chicago, about through the center of Wisconsin, on west through South Dakota, southern Idaho, and the Pacific coast, following very nearly parallel with the 44th degree of latitude. Let us now go back to the Atlantic and draw another line, commencing this time at a point sooth of Richmond, Virginia, going west south of St. Louis and Kansas City, through central Kansas, southern Colorado, and still on west to the Pacific.

Remember that in selecting a place to locate. Now I want to mention just one thing locally. I have seen in the last month or so a great deal in the papers about curtailing the acreage of corn. I don't believe in it. Corn is king, alfalfa is queen. We have great piles of corn scattered all over Nebraska and I tell you they look good. It used to be more corn, more whiskey, more whiskey more demo - crats, but now it is more corn, more hogs, more poultry, more dairy cattle, more debts paid off. Don't let them fool you into the notion of iK less corn. The more corn you have, regardless of price, the bet - ff you are every time. Corn is low; in my 37 years of experience ■re never has been a time in Nebraska when there could be as much ney made feeding corn to dairy cattle, hogs and poultry, as there can That is the way to market it. Market it in concentrated jgh the stock and not through the elevator. Use cows, pigs. would not object to a few sheep at the price they are now. r me cent tax on gasoline as yet I don't believe is just right. The snri high license seems to me ought to be enough on automo- biles. The automobile is a matter of business with the farmers. They have to have it. They must employ every moment of their time on their land to make it produce, and they must have the automobile to help them do it. Another proposition that may not please you. In all my travels, the worst methods of cultivation I found were in Nebraska. New Eng - land could not raise the salt they put in their butter if they fanned as we do. California and Texas have better farmers, and so has Illinois. We are inclined to have too many acres and we don't produce at the ends and sides of the fields. There are too many weeds in them. I admire the ambition and energy of our Nebraska boys, but they are inclined to let their energy get away with their better judgment. I admire your energy, boys, in trying to farm all you can, but you are not farm - ing the acres you have control of to the best advantage. In Illinois there is a full stand of corn clear up to the fence and producing on every foot of ground. Here there is a greet big turning row and a big space around the buildings, with nothing on it. Think of that, and make every foot of your land produce something. </seg>

It is not meant that he should work blindly and in the dark but rather ha should work efficiently, pet - ting the greatest result possible out of Mi efforts. Nor is it expeeteil \pect&gt; that the farmer should become a miser or be niggardly toward his fa ily, but whatever business is transacted should be done with irreati economy. The term work has always been synonymous with tht farmer and to admonish him to continue to dc his almost iiesiiit point. But in times like these there is a tendency for one discouraged, in other words, "lie down on the job." To be sure tht farmer l^as every CMM to quit when he remembers that doina everything to win the war, he willingly permi price to be placed upon his wheat and none upon flour and other wr rectly affected, it is a different proposition. I have always, in rr lative work been a strong supporter of the workir to solve his working conditions under, in many instances, unfavorable rumstances. But, now, when everyone must accept his loss in order the business of the ration may again become normal, it is, beyond q tion, wrong to call a strike. To strike in a time like this the working man is losing the support of his best friend — the farmer. If the working man would honestly join forces with the farmer and in a time like this take his loss with the farmer, there is no question but that in the end conditions would be made better for both. The farmer has always had to battle with the trusts, corporations and other interests in order that he might secure remunerative prices for his products and the working man £had to contest with the same elements to secure living wages and rable working conditions. Not until the working man appreciates fact and expresses his willingness, by his actions, to cooperate with the farmer will he be able to bring about the conditions he desires products, and also a minimum, which proved to be equivalen U imum. price upon his hops and none on pork products.

In other parts of the rn belt, there may be a necessity for an action of this sort but eastern part of Nebraska it is apparently not so. This conclusion is based on two facts. First, should there be a short crop through the drouth, such as befell the major portion of Nebraska in 1918, during the next year or two, all the reserves would be entirely wiped out and local communities would be required to ship in grain to feed their own stock. The past two seasons have been abnormal in way of big yields of corn. Not in many years have the farmers been able to boost of yields on excess of fifty bushels to the acre on good land, twice in succession. Second, the matter of acreage is taken care of largely by the farmers themselves. After the big crop of 1896 the acreage was immediately cut down and has hardly been as large since. In other words, the acreage proposition tends to automatically adjust itself. Right now, a large a - mount of the former corn ground is sown to fall wheat in this section of the state. If the grain farmer decreased the size of his corn fields, his only resource would be to sow more wheat. But I hardly think that </seg>

After all the amount of corn available depends for the most part on weather conditions during the period of growth.

He has always been thrifty for had he not been so, he would not now possess the home of which he boasts. Of course there are some who have not paid a? strict </seg>

It is a settled fact that the fanner who owns a sightly place with the premises neat and clean and the buildings in good repair is not the one who is continually hanging about his home town or burning up the road in effort to stay away from his farm work as much as possible. The thrifty farmer has little time for anything but the daily duties about his home. He has his reward in the yield of big crops and in the healthy growth of his stock. When prices were high there was a strong tendency of investing igh priced machinery — especially tractors which have not provided as successful as it was hoped they would. As a result, a lot of these machines are standing around, the farmers feeling that they can't afford to run them especially when gas is so high and horses and feeds are so cheap. The sad feature of the whole situation is — the note in payment of the tractor is past due and no morey to meet the obligation. To be sure, the farmer with lots of surplus cash was not materially affected but it was the man with moderate means who had other needy placei for his Ordinarily, the purchase of a tractor, purely for tractor pur - not a sound economic principle in a country of diversified farm- p ing.

It has not proven to be a suc - cessful grain saver in long straw with light grain. In addition to this, too much time is consumed in finishing a large job. Last season when so much rain fell, proved their death knell and next year will see larger machines in their place. </seg>
            <seg id="p448">448 The farmers have on many occasions expressed themselves as favor - ing the purchase of the least amount possible of ordinary farm machin - ery. It is their intention to use the old as long as possible and when required, neighbors intend to exchange with each other. This illustrates tow strongly the saving habit is taking place in farm life. Community buying through the Farm Bureau or other farm (irgai - izations is effecting a remarkable saving. While it is not ihe intention of the farmer to destroy legitimate business, yet this method of procedure has a tendency to cause the retailer to quote bed-rock prices. Through the efforts of the Farm Bureau the price of local Hour in Washington County to members of the organization dropped from $2.25 to $1.80 a sack. When local nuivhants found out what had been done they pushed down the price of th&lt;- .same flour from the regular price of $2.25 to $1.75 a sack in order that they might not lose any of their trade. That is the sort of work that counts. What future arrangements for saving that will be made, rests with the exertions the members of different organizations will put forth. Sending to catalog houses is a good method to help keep During the high prices for grains, farmers were justified in breaking out and fanning a maximum of the farm land but since conditions have changed he will undoubtedly find it profitable to have more stock. the local retailer in line. However, the farmer does not do thi&gt; often except when he is compelled to do so by prevailing hijrh prices of his necessities of life. In conclusion it should be remembered that success is never attained except by hard, continuous work, never shirky, never deserting a duty. No matter what adversity appears, always stick to the chosen post, hew to the line and the greatest of difficulties will be surmounted. Never was there a time in the Nations history whin the farmt-r should cling closer to his rural home. The great country which has made it possible for him to sit in council with the rulers of the world needs his help more than ever before. A Government resting so firmly upon a foundation of intelligent farming cannot help but pass through a financial crisis like this and emerge from the encounter successfully. In spite of the load he has to bear the farmer must raise up his chin, throw out his chest and smile optomistically. He must work unceasingly and save as he has never saved before. The destiny of the county rests with him and without a shadow of doubt he is equal to the trust. </seg>

Regretting that I can not be present in person, I must give what little I have to lay, by means of the written page. Ordinarily when a lot of farmers meet together for discussing their problems they find, or at least think they find, that they have about as many problems as the proverbial dog has fleas. Ordinarily, however, even this multiplicity of problems centers around the one great idea of making money through increasing production, cheapening production, and, to some slight degree, the bettering of quality. Assuming that a fairly just balance exists as between the farmer and other industrial ele - ments of society, such discussion is thoroughly good effort. Just now, on the other hand, the farmers' problem is not in bettering' quality, decreasing cost of production, or, least of all, increasing pro - duction. His real, and only great problem, just now, is the restoring of the aforementioned just balance betveen the farmer, and the non-farming' ements of society. In order to meet his expenses and obligations, and &gt; decently keep his family, the farmer is still primarily concerned in the central problem of "making money." He is not concerned, however worth mentioning, with the problem of making more money through the time honored means of better production. That time has passed — passed A-ith about the date of September 1, 1920. When it will return I do not now ripped of non-essential verbiage the struggle ahead of the farmer, in eastern Nebraska or western Nebraska, a farmer in Nebraska, inner in Maine, is a sore of class struggle. I do not mean by this i ilass struggle in the ordinary sense of this term, a struggle of poor igaimt rich, or of the masses, against the classes. I mean by this, that ' has come to the point where the farmer must be "trade conscious" or occupation conscious" and must fight his economic battles largely along that line. He must organize and market and legislate as an occupational class or element. The present crisis on the farmer's economic life has merely brought home the fact, far more clearly than decades of ordinary experience would have done, that if the farmer is to survive as an indus - trial element, very much above a sort of serf, he will have to do it almost entirely by his own efforts. These efforts will, in the long run, have to be at least as largely directed against the eggression and privileges of other industrial elements as against his ordinary occupational problems. In the present emergency, as I see it, his one great immediate problem is simply </seg>
            <seg id="p450">450 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGBICULTURE in bettering: his strategic position as against the positions already held by other industrial elements. Without attempting to cover the whole list of occupational elements with which the farmer has to deal, let me call your attention to the existence of several of the more important, or most numerous, of such elements: The capitalists, or money lenders. The manufacturers of necessities. The jobbers and retailers, or dealers in margins The landlords, or people receiving: ground rent. The artisan and laboring men, those who work with their hand* The professional men Of course the lines between all these elements are not distinct. The average farmer himself is a errand, but, at the present, unfortunate mixture of most of them. The men, however, making: up these other ele - ments are usually trained specialists, and as specialists the world over. they are experts in their line, and carefully look out for their own class interests as well as th&lt;»ir own individual wellfare. tN'ow. as I see it, these other elements are practically always strong y nized alone their occupational lines. I do not mean to say that sup - ind demand plays no part in their lives, or that there are no natural is which at least somewhat restrain their cupidity. A country doctor nstance, who charged $10,000 for giving farmer corn-tassel's wife a acetanilide tablets to relieve her headache would probably have a rather light practice in the average rural community. I do mean to say, though, that within certain limits, the greed and self assertion of one occupational element is ordinarily held in check only by the same qualities in other occupational groups. When these organized occupa - tional elements come into collision with an unorganized occupational group, the result is a good deal like what would take place if a flying wedge of trained football players should lunge into a crowd of bystanders. To my mind, this is the main trouble with farmers today, and es - pecially in this crisis of deflation, retrenchment and reconstruction. They are an unorganized mob trying to hold their own in the face of organ - ized occupational groups on all sides of them. On all sides the farmer is surrounded by groups who somehow have the power .and do not hesitate to use it, of determining their operating expenses and then adding to that at least a good living profit. Could the farmer do that, would Iowa farmers be selling oats at from 17 to 25 cents and Nebraska farmers corn at from 17 to 30 cents this very year? That farmer in Faribault County, Minnesota, who this fall ran a full page advertisment in a local </seg>
            <seg id="p451">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 451 paper offering a "Great Sale of Farm Produce", 2500 bushels of corn &lt;tnd 1000 bushels of oats which he would sell at cost, that farmer, I say had a real sense of humor. Probably also he had at least some sense of justice, or shall I say "sense of injustice?" The other day, while at the home of an Iowa farmer, the farmer told me that the clip of from 6 to 8 Angora goats had been bringing his children from $5 to $8 pec year. He showed me a check for this year's clip. The freight, not express, to Chicago was 80 cents, the commission firm charged 32 cents, the little children, who had spent the biggest part of a Sunday clipping; the goats, received 18 cents. The same farmer showed me a very or - dinary little boys sweater which had cost him over $4, and this too following a year when wool could scarcely find any market at all and when finding sale, was sold for 25 cents or less a pound. Eighteen months ago a farmer could sell a bushel of corn and buy 4 of the common cre - osoted posts widely used in my home county. With a local feeder market for our corn, it now requires 1% bushels of corn to buy one post. With no feeder market in many localities in Nebraska it would require 3 bushels to buy one post. In other words, measured in corn that we sell, creosoted poete are today from six to twelve times as dear as they were less than two years ago. Two years ago the extraordinary demand for farm products made up for the fanner his organizational weak - ness, and probably gave him some slight advantage. It is reported that a committee of the Chicago board of aldermen found on investigation that the prunes for which Chicago consumers were paying 40 and 45 cento per pound brought 6 and 7 cents to the farmers who grew them. Go to any hardware store and you will get from two to three name straps for the priee of a cowhide. Coal is prohibitive in price. And so one could expand on these things indefinitely. Non agricul - tural products are in strong hands, hands upheld by monopoly organiz - ation and gentlemen's agreements. Agricultural products, I mean agri - cultural products as they leave the farmer, are in weak hands, hands un - organised, competitive. We are told that no expert markets are what is hurtinp the fanner. As a matter of fact, recent governmental statistic* show clearly that exports of farm products are among the very highest iur whole history. Yet farm products are ruinously low. Exports of manufactured products are extremely low, one of the low - est periods in our history, yet things manufactured and non-agricul - tural, are ruinously high — to the consumer . Even most agricultural pro - ducts by the time they reach the consumer through the ordinary closely guarded channels of trade are pretty high, to the consumer. Can you beat it? While working in Iowa, I eat usually at medium priced cafes, I eat ordinarily plain meals. If compelled to sell on the ordinary shipper's markets, as many Nebraska communities do, I eat the monetary equivalent of from three to five bushels of corn per meal. My appetite is probably average ; or a little better, but such destruction of perfectly good corn seriously upsets my mental digestion. </seg>
            <seg id="p452">452 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Some months ago, I was in a doctor's office. Pasted on the wall was a card on which was printed the regular, prescribed fees which, by gentle - men's agreements, had been decided upon as perfectly right and proper, by the Southwest Nebraska Medical Association. It was so much for a broken arm, so much for a broken rib, so much for this, and that and the other. As I remember it if there were any complications on some of these important matters, the fee was higher, of course. Just recently, I found in a bank in an Iowa town a schedule of charges agreed upon by the "County Bankers' Association." I took the time to copy some of the items. Yet the one case is just about as fair as the other. The only essen - tial difference is that bankers, doctors, and other professional men do those things and farmers don't. Mind you, I am not especially blaming these intelligent people for acting in a perfectly natural and intelligent manner. They know what they want and they go after it and get it. We farmers also know what we want, namely a decent living for our - selves and families, together with earning power enough to meet our ob - ligations and expenses. At least we know this in a dim way, but as a group we are too individualistic, too blindly selfish, too unloyal one to an - other and to our group, to go after it. These organized groups respect each other, all right — having each felt the other group's collective strength. Till recently however no one has respected us. Even now they do not respect us, or fear us very much. They all know perfectly well the farmer's history, at least thus far. They know that while individually we have some strength and some wisdom, collectively we have been the easy Clerking of «ales: Up to $4,000 1 per cent. Kxces* of $4,000. K per cent extra. Leases $1. Contracts $1. Mortgages $1 . Doubtlessly these scheduled prico cover cost and at least a fs profit. Yet would not these bankers' eyes bulge out and would not on they, but all other non-farming elements as well, at once begin yelpii "Bolshevism", "UnAmerican" and "'Pro-German" if an "American Fan ere Association", hy agreement, would for instance announce to a startl woHd: Oats, 75 cents. Eggs, 50 cents. Good eggs. $1. </seg>
            <seg id="p453">453 RtPOKT Of NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ictims for every organized group who chose to prey upon us or fatten at our expense. Other groups know, for instance, that if farmers raise so much corn that the price gets so low that no corn grower can make a living at it, they will pitch in all the harder, at least for a while, and raise more corn. The age-old, standard farmer-remedy for low-priced farm produce is to raise more produce. We had a beautiful example of this in the 1920 and 1921 com crops. It is entirely possible that the 1922 com crop will exceed that of 1921, unless indeed, the miraculous should happen and the farmers use their heads more and their feet less than it their wont. The restricted cotton crop of the south this year — a fact which saved untold numbers of southern farmers from ruin, would hardly have been possible had not southern bankers refused credit to planters who would not restrict their production by some 20 to 30 per cent. All manner of southern business men encouraged the move. We northern people think the southerners pretty slow and dense. Maybe they are, but they certainly have the laugh on us Northerners this time. So much for the principles and the arguments involved. Let it not b« iinderstood that ordinarily I favor restriction of production. I would in- finitely rather live in a world where everybody works hard, produces his attermost, organizes by industrial groups only for social, educational and fficieney purposes, and let great natural tews like "Competition", "Sup - ly and Demand," "Survival of the Fittest", and such pretty much take their course. Possibly that is the condition which will yet be reached. Unfortunately organization, monoply and similiar human forces have as - serted themselves to the great advantage of the favored ones and to the tremendous disadvantage of those not so favored. Just as Lincoln said, "No nation can continue to exist half free and half slave." So no society can continue half organized and half unorganized. I bear no real ill feeling toward those who have organized. That is their idea of self pro - tection. Possibly they are right, I do not know. I do feel, however, that with practically all other important elements completely or nearly com- anized, agriculture must also organize in sheer self defense. In fact we ourselves have gradually been organizing for thirty years r more. Our first efforts, such as in the Grange and the Farmers Alliance were crude, feeble efforts, though of course, well intentioned. Politically, farmers in large numbers have been behind the Greenback Party, the Pop - ulist Party, The Bull Moose Party, and even more recently the Non Par - tisan League. Nearly all these movements have left some very good results. The more hopeful lines, however, are educational, cooperative and economic. Political reforms, such as have at various times been advocated by "farmer" parties, have in many cases been necessary to se - cure co-operation and economic opportunities, and doubtlessly this need will continue. The nation has been governed for nearly fifty years by a bipartisan government dictated largely by tariff barons, financiers and captains of industry. We farmers did not appreciate the fact, but we </seg>
            <seg id="p454">454 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE have for half a century had government by what was essentially an in - dustrial block, mostly Republican politically, and geographically center - ing in the North Atlantic states and Middle Atlantic states. Yet includ - ing; in recent year Bourbon Democrats from southern industrial regions or from the industrial regions of the West. Finally the farmer congress - men from the center, west and south, regardless of party, decided to form • Woe of their own in congress. They have formed their bloc all right and about got all the things they went after. With one cry, however, the press of the industrial east, which has for fifty years blindly obeyed every dictum of its industrial masters, has suddenly taken up the cry "Govern - ment by bloc is Un-American and Intolerable." As regards what the individual farmer can do on his own farm in the way of organizing his activities to meet this period of depression, I do not see that there is any essential difference in what we westerners should do, as compared to farmers further east. I feel that our proper course for individual action is the same everywhere, and personally I decided on this course over a year ago and I have been consistently and deter - minedly carrying it out. My whole policy, however, can be summed up in one sentence. I am doing all I can to bring back a reasonable parity be - tween what I sell and what I buy. To secure this end I am decreasing not only my production but my consumption as well. I am carrying out several, definite concrete propositions which may strike some of you as radical. Ordinarily I, too, would disapprove of some of them as wrong and unsound. Under the existing situation, however, I feel that every farmer should do likewise, or worse, as far as his conditions are similiar. I am decreasing production by: 1. Using the least possible amount of hired labor 2. Letting certain parts of our ground lie idle. This is land that would have required a relatively large amount of labor and expense to farm it. It includes strips about the alfalfa fields where hoppers have killed the alfalfa, also one piece of rather clayey land two and one half miles from the house. Thus out of some 265 acres of plow ground and alfalfa, I have let about 40 acres lie perfectly idle, not even consenting to rent it. 3. I have not cultivated thoroughly all the land I did farm, though tending it as well as I could with what help I had available. 4. Such crops as I could hold off the market, I have held. I have practically all of the 1920 and 1921 crops of corn on hand yet, about 8,000 bushels in all, also nearly 300 tons of hay, mostly alfalfa. Feeling that the hay would probably remain on my hands two years or more, I built the stacks as large and high as I possibly could, put good tops on them, covered such as I could with old wild hay or fine cane and weighted all down carefully with wires and weights. Where </seg>
            <seg id="p455">RfcPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 455 I could not get the stack* to suit me with one cutting- of alfalfa, I put two or even three cuttings on the same stack. Several of the stacks contain 25 to 30 tons and one has probably 40. A Jenkins Mammouth Automatic "Swinging: Stacker" proved a biff help in arrying out this plan. The uncertainty of crops in our section makes this course probably much safer and better with us than would be the case in sections where crops are more certain. I have to use some borrowed money to do this, but I borrowed on land to do it. Had I sold all my crops they would have brought pitifully little money anyway. I am also selling my winter's labor to a commercial concern, so that thru my earnings I can more nearly hold my crops. This last, of course, is hardly a thing: which very many farmers could do. I have reduced my consumption and my expenses to the uUeiwuas. 1 . I buy nothing I can possibly get along without. Even if I feel that I can make the thing pay well to get it, as machinery for instance, I go without it if I possibly can. I patch and repair, and if I can possibly substitute something I already have for something I would otherwise have to buy I do so, even if the substitute does not fit just right. For instance, I needed a cultivator. Learning that the 1921 price was the same cs in 1920, I decided that I did not want a culti- vator. 2. We live almost entirely upon our farm products. Groceries still cost a great deal. We are learning to make heavy use of milk, cream, butter, eggs and cattle as well as greatly increased percent - ages of chicken meat, home butchered hogs, flour and garden stuff. We planted and carefully tended a large garden, neglecting field work somewhat, where necessary, to take the best care of the gar - den. My feeling in this matter was that the field products would be worth very little anyway if sold soon on the market, but that in as far as we could live from our garden we were sparing ourselves the buying of a lot of expensive groceries. 3. For piece work labor, like corn husking for instance, I do not pay the prices demanded by huskers early in the husking season. Last ysar with corn selling for 30 cents and below, huskers were demand - ing 10 cents and even more and getting it. I refused to pay this, and the most of our corn was still unhusked long after New Tear. Fin - ally, however, we got excellent huskers, good, clean men, who were glad in midwinter to husk for 6 cents. This year huskers with us have been demanding 4 and occasionally 5 cents, and getting it. Except as a local feeder market helps the price of corn in our section, elevator men could not pay more than 20 cents for corn. For normal corn, I have been offering 3 cents for good clean huskers, and tho most of </seg>
            <seg id="p456">456 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGR1CILTURE our com is still unhusked, I believe that after the New Year gets in we will be able to (ret good huskers for 3 cents. When I left home feeders were paying- about 30 cents, and 3 cents for husking follows the 1-10 rule. 4. I don't intend to burn corn as long as we can keep warm with cobs, wood and trash, but when we would otherwise have to buy coal which is about $14 per ton, we intend to burn corn. Of course I have little idea how this program consistently carried out by a few scattered individuals is going to finally work out in practice. The plan, however, practiced by large numbers of farmers can not fail to help us tremendously. As to results of such policy on the few individ - uals courageous enough to practice these plans in earnest regardless of what others do, much depends upon future weather, which no one can, of course, foretell. But the future is anybody's guess and I have told you ALFALFA MANAGEMENT IN CENTRAL NEBRASKA PVe, of central Nebraska, have different conditions to contend with they do where the previous speaker lives. Alfalfa is the big crop of our county. Nebraska ranks first in the United States in alfalfa pro - duction and Dawson county ranks first in the counties of Nebraska. The farmers there feed alfalfa, but primarily they raise alfalfa to ship. The time may come when we will consume a larger per cent than we do at the present time, but for the present in the Platte Valley our big cash crop is alfalfa. The tonnage is about three tons to the acre and this year even the alfalfa is bringing in more money than any other crop, as it is selling for from $6 to $10 per ton, F. O. B. track. What information I have has been gathered from growers over the county. I want particularly to tell of the experiences of E. E. Youngs of Lexington. He has raised alfalfa for the last twenty years and has sowed twenty to sixty acres of alfalfa each year. He has sowed all kinds of seed, in all kinds of years, and under all conditions and has overcome a good many of the obstacles. What I will give you is largely the con - clusions he has come to after these years of experience. He contends that tke earlier you can get your alfalfa sowed in the spring the better off you are. He plows the ground six or eight inches deep and then goes on the ground with a disc, weighted down with two or three hundred pounds, packing the ground down deep. He does not believe much in surface packing. He next harrows about enough, and then harrows that many more times. He harrows until he says the mules' feet will only Alvah H. Hecht. Lexington </seg>
            <seg id="p457">457 REPORT Of NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE sink in the ground very slightly. Then he overlaps two planks which h« weighs down fairly heavy, which tends to smooth the ground on the sur - face. We have a little alkali in our county and if the ground is very bad with the holes from that alkali, before he goes on with the disc he tries to level it as much as possible. But under ordinary condition* with the float he gets the ground as level as is needed for ordinary cutting* of alfalfa. He finds that a press drill is preferable in seeding. He doe* ex - actly the same thing as the previous speaker in that he puts it in deep -enough so that he is sure it has enough moisture to sprout and still not too deep to smother it. If he can get the ground prepared and seed sowed n March he things that is best. You may think it will freeze out after he alfalfa comes up but he has never lost a crop yet from freezing out, en where there may had been snow after the alfalfa came up. The handling of the crop the first year he finds to be of vital im - portance. There has been a good deal said in farm papers and by different people as to whether or not alfalfa should be cut the first year, how high it it. how often to cut it, and all that sort of thing. Now what is it want the first year? I believe primarily the thing is roots, and the way you will get root growth is by getting the plant gTowth. If you can get along' without cutting the alfalfa, and if the water grass does not k like it was going to smother it out, it is better to let the weeds gTOW the year through. That looks like shiftless farming, but if it will t you a good stand of alfalfa why worry about the weeds. They protect e young plants from the sun in July and August, and the practice of wing a nurse crop does not go with us because the temptation is too reat to cut the nurse crop. I know a farmer who has sowed alfalfa for %-elve years and he has never cut the weeds off of his first alfalfa crop is never lost a seeding. If it rains any time during the year e plant gets the same amount of growth that the weeds get. summer I went into fields where the weeds were so high you ; see the young plants, but underneath there would be a fine alfalfa. By letting the weeds grow you also get rid of the grass- rs which eat the alfalfa when it is cut off. By leaving the weeds on :&gt; prevents the alternate freezing and thawing, which would kill out falfa. In the early spring when the wind is blowing fairly hard lay before the alfalfa is up, you can touch a match to the weeds. If you are afraid to do that, go out after them with a hay rake and that is all that is necessary. In managing the hay the second year, Mr. Youngs believes in cutting the alfalfa when the new growth start* re - gardless of what stage the bloom is in. He nearly always gets four good crops. The last crop of hay is left on the ground and is raked and han - dled and hauled into the barns as it is needed. The first crop is not sold on the market but is fed on the farm. A good many of our men are going to build hay sheds on the largest alfalfa fields. They will buck the hay up to the hay shed and there have an over shot stacker where the hay slides on a plank and is dumped into </seg>
            <seg id="p458">458 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the barn. It is a good practice to handle it right into the barn. Where it is sold in the market it is stacked in the field. One difficulty in marketing the hay is to convince the average person to whom we ship that the greatest feed value is in the brown bay and not in the green hay. Lin the matter of cultivation, I think we all agree that if you do not ve grasshoppen, it is not a good practice. Where we have grass - hoppers, we must do a little cultivation, which is done with a harrow, setting the teeth straight and weighting the harrow down just enough so that when it is pulled over the ground it will scratch out the eyes. Try this and you will notice a great difference in the number of grasshoppers next year. Another item you may be interested in is the varieties of alfalfa. Five years ago alfalfa was alfalfa in our country; no one thought of more than one kind, but we find, in driving over the country and talking with farmers, that there are many different varieties. One fanner had a field that had been standing for twelve years and he also had a patch along side sowed four years ago which had died out. The Farm Bureau Board de - cided that we could have a tour and visit these fields and we found some very striking things, which we could scarcely believe. We found one man who told us that he had four varieties of alfalfa. I know that we have one field that has been sowed for eighteen years which has just as goo&lt; stand today as was there the first year They have 250 hogs runn thru that alfalfa and it is good right up to the path where the hogs thru the field. MR. WELDON— How does that alfalf a MR HECHT — If anything, it is a little below the common alfalfa in hay. No really experimental tests have been made of it, just observa- MR. KIRKW00D — Your manner of preparing the soil was only for hard soil and I would like to hear about the preparation of sandy soil; we h*ve lots of trouble in getting our alfalfa started in Rock county; it is hard to do that in the sand and it is very seldom we get a good stand to start with and it means a great deal to us to get a good stand; I sup - pose I have seeded twenty times and got nothing and I would like to hear about the preparation of sandy soil. MR. HECHT— I can not tell about the experience in sandy soil. MR. LUTE— You said you let the weeds grow, don't you lose the stand on account of the drying: out of the soil by the weeds in dry </seg>
            <seg id="p459">BEPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 459 MR. HECHT— No, we found in dry weather it will not lull off half m quickly if you le*ve the weeds grow. MR. STEWART— I know that what Mr. Hecht has told you about leaving the weeds on the field the first year is a very common and suc - cessful practice around Lexington. Last summer I visited a number of ch fields and talked to the owners on this point. Men who had tried it -ind it a good practice. They have, however, certain local conditions bly make this practice only of local application. First, all wl- I when this was practiced were in the Platte Valley and subirrigated. nd, the soil had a rather alkali content in most places. Possibly with lty of subsoil moisture, here is what happened. Normally, the soil sture would come to the surface and evaporate leaving a crust of white alkali salts in the lower parts. Where the weeds were allowed to grow, this moisture was caught by their roots and transpired thru their cs. keeping the alkali salts from accumulating on the surface. This ii i &gt;- a guess on my part but I do know that under the conditions as j that good stands of alfalfa are secured MR. BOCH — I don't understand about the high and low crown var- u mentioned. MR. HECHT — There is a low crowned alfalfa, that is the crown is buried lower in the soil. Where you have the low com, you also have the side roots and less of a distinct tap root. The Grimm variety is supposed to be of this type. In regard to the roots, a man who came from the iment station in South Dakota told me that they had run a number tests on the number of times of cutting alfalfa, and he said the size the root and the length of root corresponded adversely with the num- ber of times you cut the crop. The oftener you cut it the leas root growth have. MR. CLAUSEN— What do you know about catching grasshoppers the alfalfa fields MR. HECHT— We have found that bran mash is the best way to loll them; we have used different systems but the bran mash is the only thing you can use aftor the grasshopper has shown up. The only thing to do is to fight him when he is little and has no wings. They will hatch along the edges of the field and around the stacks you will get ninety per cent of the grasshoppers. Harrowing the fence rows, pastures and waste places will help to destroy the eggs. This harrowing should be done just as soon as the frost is oat of the ground. </seg>
            <seg id="p460">460 REPORT UK NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE ALFALFA AND THE CROPS THAT FOLLOW John Krause, Adams After the fine flown speeches we heard this morning, it puts me in a very embarrassing position to appear before you. I want it understood that I am just a farmer. Those of you who are subscribers to The Country Gentleman, possibly recall a number of cartoons depicting what a farmer really is, (in the last several issues.) I have had no education, all I know is just what little I have learned as I have gone along, and I hope that you will not expect a great big nice long fluent talk. I have often been impressed by the fact that when our fatht mothers years ago, settled and homesteaded in northeastern Nebraska, spite of the hardships they met with, had one great heritage which n ture had provided for them, and that was that very good fertile soil. Th tell us that most anything they planted did well and that whatever cultivated generally made a good crop if the weather was at all favor - able. As we have erone on we have squandered this heritage, we have rob- bed ourselves of this good fertility and we are producing possibly only half or less than half of what we should, if that former state ty was still there. This fact is becoming more and more apparent to us each year. But even we today have a heritage which is not only capat bringing back this soil to its former state of fertility but is also capable of bringing the best of dividends during the time we are bringing back this fertility. I leave it to you which one of the two you w have; for my part I do not wish to be put back : nto th« fathers were in when they started with the fertil w take my change today. The crop that is jrood for f cattle, hogs, chickens and she?D is the one of which I speak, alfalf is, indeed, one of the finest crops and one of the finen things that nat has prepared for us. All I can do is just to mention good ordinary things that you all know. I feel almost ashamed to present them to you. But the first thing that came to me about alfalfa is the getting of a stand. We have read so much about getting a stand of alfalfa that I feel the only advice I can give will be from my experience The first thing is to properly prepare the seed-bed, and when you have done that there is only one other thing that you can do and that is give it another dose of preparation, and then go ahead and sow your seed. The different methods of sowing are many. I have had the best success in getting a stand by preparing the seed - bed and waiting until the moisture was in the ground and then using a press drill, putting it down deep enough to get the moisture but not deep enough to smother the seed. Then oftentimes after we have done our very - best we don't have a good stand, and the next thing is what to do with </seg>
            <seg id="p461">REPORT )F NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICl LTIRE 461 an imperfect stand of alfalfa, and I believe there is only one remedy and that is to plow it up and give it another dose of seed-bed preparation,. some more good seed and a drill. And then another thing with alfalfa that is much discussed is the cultivation of it. All I have to say here is after you have once got a good stand, if it needs cultivation I not found it out, and if it did need it you would not have time enough U cjive it between the cuttings. If you have quite a little alfalfa arm you will agree with me. In western Nebraska it might pay but in southeastern Nebraska I do not think it would. We have spent y for alfalfa cultivating tools but I believe we can spend oar advantage in something else. )ne big mi.- take the farmers make in a dry season, I think, is that if Haifa has not grown up big enough for cutting to just let it go. My experience is that it is a big mistake for two reasons. If there is on the ground to start with the new crop even under favorable and good moisture cannot come through and make as good * that little short crop was out of the way. Another thing, if falfa i3 not cut at the proper time it will lose its vitality. At one time e sowed a field of alfalfa on our farm and we had several sacks of when the alfalfa came up we found part of it was red clover and urse of two years the clover was gone; and on the other side of lother spot of alfalfa and this little patch was always neglected sometimes it was cut and sometimes it would not be cut at all, and I id in the course of a few years that little patch of alfalfa would not luce anywhere near what the other fields would that had been cut y in the proper season; so if you have a good stand of alfalfa and keep it and keep its vitality, it should be cut when the time is Another thing, I have this against seed production, generally when et a crop of seed about ready something happens to it, it gets too wet dry or the wind blows it away. I don't believe we get quite as crop of alfalfa either, as if we cut it when it is time for the hay. The one other little question is the handling of alfalfa. I judge we had a little different experience along this line. I have observed that most of us are inclined to let our alfalfa hay lay in the field too long and get too dry rather than to put it up too green. I am talking of the alfalfa used on the farm. From a heating stand-point I believe there is not much danger of putting alfalfa into the barn or stack too green, but be careful and do not allow it to get rained on after it has been once thor - oughly dried. When we feed alfalfa ourselves it is much cheaper to haul it right into the barns when we first put it up. I find that I can have alfalfa hauled from the field first-hand cheaper than I can have it hauled from the stack into the barn in winter time, consequently all til* cost of putting it into the stack in the summer-time is lost. </seg>
            <seg id="p462">462 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE I guess most of us believe in hay loaders, but there are some things about them I don't like. I have two boys ten and twelve years old and I can send them out to rake and load hay. If you send two hired men out to load hay with a hay loader there is a vast difference of opinion between tman that sits an the front seat and does the driving and the man at rear end doing the loading. We don't all look at things alike you know. We have had difficulty after difficulty and we finally quit the loader and today we rake it up as soon as possible and let it dry in the windrow. Then we pitch it on the wagon and haul it in. There is one other little trick I have learned; we used to use forks at the barn, and that was not fast enough and we went to using hay slings. But I am doing better than that; somebody has invented a kind of a sling with two ropes on it. If you have not tried that you should give it a trial. They are the best thing for putting hay in the barn that has ever been put out, in my opinion. They are just as common and simple as can be and all you need in order to use them is a little common sense. Another thing I wanted to mention is this, on our farm we almost always salt our hay. In the spring when we start to put up alfalfa we haul three or four or five barrels of salt for this purpose and it always seems to me that the hay is not quite as harsh and hard and we don't need to bother with salting the cows during the winter As to the length of time to leave a stand of alfalfa I would say w it begins to lose its vitality it is time to plow it up. Then as to the crops to follow. When this alfalfa should be broken up, depends entirely on the crop you want to put in next. In southeast - ern Nebraska the most common crop to follow alfalfa is corn. If we have a dry season you won't (ret a good crop anyway and if it is a wet season or very wet you won't get very much wheat. If you want to plow the ground for wheat it should be given a good preparation to avoid rust. A crop that will make a fine large cutting of hay the first of June and will re - peat that in every four or five weeks for the entire growing season for five or six or seven or eight or ten years, would make us think that at the end of that time the soil would be exhausted, but when we have studied what this alfalfa would do in producing forage crops and seed crops we have only learned half; the soil after alfalfa has been raised on it is in better condition than ever before. We have on our farm one field that was sowed to alfalfa probably seventeen years ago and it produced seven or eight crops of alfalfa and was then plowed and since that time it has raised better crops of wheat and corn. Growing alfalfa was all that was ever done to it. On our farm there is always an abundance of fertilizer. You all know that where there are lota of cattle there is lots of fertilizer, and we have experimented with this manure on the alfalfa. We find that </seg>
            <seg id="p463">463 RLPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE after land has been in alfalfa for five or six or seven yean it doet not need any other fertilizer for other crops. One other thing I want to mention is my experience with alfalfa on ground that had formerly been in alfalfa. Last spring we sowed 00 acres of alfalfa and trot a good stand. A part of this field had bean sown to alfalfa years ago and had produced probably ten crops of alfalfa and was then plowed and after that produced fine corn and wheat. The last season this ground did not produce the hay that other ground did that had never had alfalfa on it. I hope you men have had different xperience. It is heavy soil but the difference was so great I could not ielp but see there was something: there that was not right I have towed alfalfa on ground that had been broken out for only a year or two, that new ground, and I have found that on this there is a change in the One thing more I wish to say and that is I believe there are many farms in Nebraska where there is no alfalfa but there should be some alfalfa sowed and I believe that there are farms that have alfalfa on them that should have more. I believe that it is one of the best things we have. I believe that we should have the things that make us enjoy life and have the pleasant things among the men and women and the boys and girls hose occupation is to till the soil MR. HEWITT — In rotating corps it is my experience that the first or two after you have had alfalfa on the ground for five or six s it produces a great quantity of fodder, but not the proper material •nrn because of the stalks. I am just adding alfalfa for the fourth rop in my rotation, and I am wondering how long I could let the alfalfa id avoid that immense amount of stalks or straw. Can anybody that? MR. KRAUSE — I believe if the gentleman would attempt to eliminate this one thing he would also eliminate other things and would not obtain what he is really after. That is alfalfa builds up the nitrogen content of soils and it is this excess nitrogen that causes the great vegatative growth. Letting the alfalfa stand for fewer years would help some. QUESTION — How many tons of manure to the acre do you use? MR. KRAUSE— We take a John Deere manure spreader and we put it down to the lowest notch and spread it thick. MR. SNODGRASS— I would like to give you oar experience in spread - ing manure. I put it on just as thin as I can and get just as much out of the manure. You have not lost any of the manure's value and 70a are not subjected to the heavy growth of fodder that you would other - wise have, and you will get the grain. </seg>

Dawgon My subject being Sweet Clover in Madison County, I take it that you ivant some concrete statements of what has been done up there, so will u some facts The first noticed of sweet clover in our county was some twenty odd l ago. when it was seen growing along the road sides. Some said it was an obnoxious weed and worthless, that nothing would eat it, while others said all it was fit for was for the honey bees. n some of the cattle were seen to browse on it as they went Then about 18 years ago a farmer out in the middle of the county nme which caused considerable worry among some of the farmers were afraid it would over run the country. Later finding only suits from what had been sown a few others sowed it but there msiderable interest taken in it till about 1914 when the largest sown in the county up until that time was put in, amounting to an bought white clover seed of a seed company but when it :he second year it proved to be the viney variety of the r he was much pleased that he did not get the white.

We plowed these stalks in the spring of 1918 1 to corn again. In the spring of 1919 it was put to bushels to the acre, altho the grain lodged badly and all ut.

It was pretty dry and as the subsoil moisture had all been taken from the soil the wheat dried out, so I furnished him some spring wheat to again sow this same ground the fol - lowing spring, and some barley to sow the balance of the alfalfa ground.

Right beside this alfalfa ground I had 40.8 acres of stalk ground that I sowed to spring wheat the same spring putting in about five pecks of seed to the acre. After the wheat was sown, disced, and harrowed I sowed twenty pounds of yellow sweet clover seed to the acre on it and harrowed once. I cut from this land twelve bushels of spring wheat to the acre. The following summer, 1919, I cut the first crop of this sweet clover for seed with a binder, shocked it, and a week later threshed six and one-half bushels of seed to the acre. The spring of 1920 part of this land was sown to oats right on the sweet clover stubble, disced and harrowed, going forty one bushels to the acre, while other land in the vicinity was making 23 to 27 bushels to the acre. Clover was coming thick in the stubble so I left it and in 1921 this oats land produced a voluntary crop of sweet clover which was cut for seed making 5.8 bushels to the acre. The balance of the 1919 sweet clover land was put to corn in 19*20 and to oats in 1921, and after the o«ts were cut the sweet clover appeared thick in the stubble though the corn had been cultivated three times the prev - ious season. Sweet clover is becoming more and more popular as a pasture crop for livestock. I sowed ten acres for pasture in the spring of 1917 without a nurse crop adjoining a wild grass pasture that had run largely to blue grass. It has been reseeding itself ever since and is still used for pasture. The cattle most pass through the other pasture to get to it and they will go </seg>

It will pasture more than double as many head to acr is the ordinary pasture, as it can be pastured late the first i early the second. For a permanent pasture it is advisable to some seed the second year so one will have early and late pasture year. We have some in the county mixed with timothy and bromus sow it makes a fine pasture or hay crop. A good start can be pastures by sowing the bare spots or along the creek banks spring, even when the snow is on, and letting the cattle tramp ear stock like it from the first and others soon learn to like it, f turned onto it early in the spring when it is young and ten- der. It should be pastured heavy enough so it will not get rank and hard but not to such an extent that there will not be enough seed to ripen to re- seed itself. Hogs will do as well on it, and some think even better than on asture, as they are very fond of it. &gt;ne man reported he had put it up for hay and when he came to feed he winter he gave the horses and cattle both sweet clover and alfalfa hay at the same time and they would first eat of one and then of tile other. Stock will eat the straw after threshing for seed, and horses especially like it. It is a great land builder and unlike many legumes, sweet clover will make a good growth on soils too depleted in humus for a profitable crop production. It adds much humus to the soil by the decaying roots together with the stems and stubble, when plowed under. In common with other legumes it has the power of fixing atmospheric nitrogen by means (if nitrogen gathering bacteria in the nodules of the roots. A splendid plan is to plow it under green as li.te in the spring of the second year as possible to allow time to get corn planted. This fur - nishes much humus. There are those who think it will improve the land as much in one year as alfalfa will the first three years. Sweet clover enriches the land on top where we farm it while alfalfa goes down over twenty feet, which is far below where we can cultivate. Then again it does not rob the land of the subsoil moisture the way alfalfa does. A stand is much easier obtained in sowing sweet clover than with alfalfa. It is a hardier plant and can be sown with a nurse crop to good advantage. I compare it with alfalfa as you would rye with wheat or a mule with a horse, just a little hardier, and can withstand more </seg>

It will not enrich it as deep, but as deep as needed. The roots penetrate the soil to a depth of three feet and better, and die in four to eight weeks after the crop is cut the second season, and then the land plows up mellow like millet ground. Alfalfa does not attain its best till the third year but sweet clover has enriched the soil and it is producing other crops in that time. Kansas has more acres of sweet clover than any other state in the union, but Nebraska is fast gaining on her. We hope to increase Madi - son county's acreage very much this year. The ordinary quarter section of land does not produce enough manure each season to cover ten acres as it should be, but by rotating with sweet clover one can cover the whole farm in a few years without losing the use of any of the land, and in the mean time have the best of pasture. One can keep more stock because he can nave more and cheaper pasture land which will not dry down in the middle of the summer as does our blue grass pasture, and blue grass is taking all the wild pastures that were left. It enables the farmer to keep and milk more cows, and the farmer who does keep a lot of cows is the man who always has some money jingling in his pockets, for his harvest is every week and not just once n Sweet clover pasture on the Upland in Cheyenne county 1921 </seg>

MEMBER — If you were sowing it with fall wheat, when would you put MR. DAWSON— Early in the spring and harrow it. I have one man who sowed it right on the snow in the winter and did not harrow it or do anything else to it and it permits the hard seed that you find in all grasses to soak up while it is cool and there is no burning sun to kill it after the plants get started and that makes a very good stand.

I Heve sweet clover is the best crop. It does plow up mellow and after the second year, when you can not plow in the alfalfa becaus is too dry. MR. CLAYBAUGH — It has been my experience that sweet clover is like the little girl, when it is good it is very, very good and when it is bad it is awful. Our trouble is keeping a stand and not having it go back on us during the critical period of the summer when the hot dry winds come. I am from Clay county. MR. DAWSON— My experience has not included summer killing. Of course, it is hard on a crop sowed with a nurse crop and taking the nurse crop off and leaving it bare. But if we have any rain in that season of the year, it grows on. If you sow sweet clover in the fall, it will go to ■eed the second year and you only get one year, while if you sow the spring you get two years of it. MEMBER — I wanted to ask if you find this more definitely a two year crop than red clover, which sometimes makes a crop usually you get simply a one year crop. MR. DAWSON — This is a two year crop and is better than red clover. It is usually too dry for red clover with us. Last year some pastures were perfectly white with white clover and lots of red and other kinds of clover. In dry weather the sweet clover is better than the red and it enriches the ground much more than the red clover. MEMBER — My sweet clover did not live thru the second year at all and I didnt have a good stand when with red clover, under practically the same conditions, I got a good stand. In the first place it was good but it didn't live thru. It was seeded with oats but a good share of the field was gone before I got the oats; then what was left I used for pas - ture and the cattle seemed to like it better than the grass mixture in the same pasture.

The Iowa Ex - periment Station is advocating annual clover from Alabama, I think they call it Hubam clover but that is very expensive at the present time. I think it sold as high as $1.00 a pound, there is so little of it and I never had any experience with it If that is what you got that is why yon lost it the first year.

Burr, Nebraska College of Agriculture I don't know that there is very much to tell; the annual sweet clover has been very widely advertised for the last year or two. The history of this particular strain of annual sweet clover is that it came from Ala - bama and was selected and developed by Mr. Hughes of Iowa. The name is a combination of the two. Hubam. The U. S. Department of AgTicul ture has a number of selection of annual sweet clover. It is not a new plant to them. I recently saw a letter from Alabama saying that the people there had grown the annual sweet clover for some time but did not consider it as valuable as the biennial and had i.ot given it much at - tention. The question we are interested in is what it will do in Nebraska. Small quantities of seed have been sold in this state at $1.00 ind $2.00 * pound. The data from these tests have not been assembled and we don't know exactly what the plant will do. There is an interesting arti the Country Gentleman of December 17th on this subject. The meri is claimed for the sweet clover is that it makes a big growth the first It may be true that it will make a big growth provided conditions orable but we should not expect anything marvelous in this or any plant. When we see a statement that a certian plant made a wonderful growth with practically no rainfall, we may expect that it was drawing water already stored in the soil. All plants must have waU Sweet clover will stand a lot of dry weather but will not live without water.

For Nebraska conditions, wi part of the state where one can seed clover as a catch crop as Mr. Daw son speaks of in Madison county. It it makes a larger growth the first year, it will give a larger amount of organic matter iv ur soil will, therefore, build up more quickly. Experimental evidence is lack - ing to show that Hubam has any great advantage over ordinary sweet clover in the actual amount of vegetation produced One other matter that has been mentioned I would like to bring up again and that is the seeding of clover in oats or grain. The mcm of that method we all know depends upon climatic conditions. When there is a shortage of rainfall with only enough moisture to produce one crop we generally lose the clover seed because the grain is more vigorous Bthe young clover.

Nebraska College of Agriculture Kanred wheat is the product of a single head selected in 1906 from a hard winter variety that had been introduced into the United States from Russia by the United States Department of Agriculture. It is very similiar to our ordinary Turkey Red winter wheat but has a few differ - ences. It has been outyielding the ordinary Turkey Red wheat about four bushels. It seems to be more rust resistent and ripens from one to three or four days earlier than ordinary Turkey Red. It is somewhat more hardy and everything considered it is distinctly an improvement over the Turkey Red wheat. Due to its increased yield the spread of Kanred wheat over the winter wheat belt has been very rapid. Since it is a new variety, many claims were made about it, some of which were favorable and others rm - favorable. One important point of contention has been the milling qual- ty In order to get some information on this point the Nebraska College of Agriculture collected fifty samples of Kanred and fifty samples of Turkey Red that were directly comparable. Twenty-one of these sets of samples came from farmers who grew the wheat side by side on the same farm. We analyzed these and found that the Kanred ran 0.4 per cent higher in protein on the average than the Turkey Red. So far as the protein or gluten is concerned, there is no evidence that Kanred is inferior to Turkey Red wheat. It takes more than a simple chemical analysis, however, to detern.ine the milling qualities of wheat as other considera - tions in addition to protein content or gluten enter into this. However, the complaints against Kanred have been based largely on the gluten content. The data that we have shows that there is no foundation for the statement that Kanred is inferior to Turkey Red in gluten or in but that they are practically the same. Much confusion has, no doubt, resulted from the fact that Kanred and Turkey Red wheat in the threshed form are indistinguishable. There - fore, when wheat has come in rather light colored and bleached it was often called Kanred while dark wheat of good color was identified as Turkey Red. Such superficial identification standards, of course, would favor the Turkey Red variation. In addition to confusion in identification the effect of climate and soil was not fully recognized. A sample of Tur - key Red from Cheyenne county, for instance, might be compared to a sample of Kanred from Gage county, and naturally the Turkey Red would be higher in gluten. In order to be comparable the samples should be from the same field and, therefore, having had uniform soil and climatic conditions. The Kansas data would also indicate that there is no ap - preciable difference between Kanred and Turkey Red wheat grown side by side under the same soil and climatic conditions. </seg>
            <seg id="p474">474 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE WATER EROSION OF NEBRASKA SOILS P. H. Stewart, Nebraska Agricultural College Soil erosion is the most important soil problem of eastern Nebraska. The loss of soil fertility thru this source is commonly estimated to be greater that the fertility removed by cropping. According to careful government estimates more than 400,000,000 acres in the United State* has been damaged more or leas from this source. The National Con - servation Commission found that in the United States 16,597 square miles of farm land had il ready been abandoned and that 6,076 square miles or 0.2 per cent of the entire area had been devastated by soil ero - sion. This abandoned area of 16,597 square miles or 10,622,060 acres is equal to the average yearly acreage of corn, wheat and oats in Nebraska and is approximately equal to the area of New Hampshire, Rhode Island. Delaware and Connecticut combined. The fact that part of the abandoned area or 6,076 square miles or 3388,640 acres is considered as destroyed for future agricultural purposes is thought provoking. This area would form approximately 100,000 farms. Such a loss thru national invasion or sim - iliar process would precipitate immediate war, but by virtue of the fact that it is slow and gradual, but yet largely avoidable, the public fails to recognize its importance. That there is danger in this loss is shown clearly by great areas of land in such countries as Palestine, Greece, Spain, and western China where erosion has virtually destroyed thousands of acres of once good farm and forest land. In the United States after a relatively short period of cultivation, large areas of erosion damaged lands are found in Pennsyl - vania, Georgia, Kentucky, Alabama. Missouri. Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. Many other states have increasing averages on which ero - sion is becoming a menace and needs attention. This is true not only of the prairie states, but also of the timbered areas, where reckless des - struction by lumbering has exposed thousands of acres to weathering. Since southeastern Nebraska has the heaviest rainfall, we naturally expect this section of the state to wash the worst and this on the whole is true. The more rains, particularly of the gully washing type, the hard - er it is to prevent erosion. Altho the western part of the state has fewer rains, the per cent of the total rainfall falling as torrential rains is prob - ably as high or even higher than eastern Nebraska. In addition, the hard pasture lands which make up a considerable portion of the western part of the state shed water more than the cultivated soils of eastern Nebraska farms, thereby causing more runoff. Weather records show instances where as much as three inches of water fell in as many hours. Such rains are bound to cause damage and start gullies regardless of what we may do to prevent it.

            <seg id="p475">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 475 Whenever rolling farms have been farmed for a number of yean without provisions having been made to keep up the organic matter in the soil, there we find the erosion beginning. Observations over the state show almost without exception, that farms and fields most dam - aged by washing are low in organic matter, having been grain farmed for a number of years and not having been seeded down or manured. Many such farms are rented ones where the one year lease has been the common thing. On such farms longer leases with rotations which include red or sweet clover, or alfalfa are badly needed. Low organic content of the soil is then the first cause of erosion. Until provisions are made to keep up the soil humus, methods of com - bating soil erosion such as dams, terracing, and other means are likely to do but very little good. In many parts of the state farmers are us - ing sweet clover to an ecellent advantage in building up run-down farms. They are finding that in two or three years sweet clover will build up much of the nitrogen content of the eroded lands and will at the same time restore a large amount of the organic matter. In such areas as we find in Dawson county in the hills north of the Platte valley, sweet clover is being used very extensively for such purposes. Contour farming in which the rows run nearly at right angles to the slopes may be used to a good advantage on rolling lands This is particularly true where climatic conditions require that the corn be listed in In many cases strip fanning can be used in which case rather long narrow fields are laid out at right angles to the slope. Alternating strips of corn, alfalfa and small grain will do much to prevent gullying and sheet erosion on long slopes. In many cases the beginning of gul- Much of our rolling land that has been grain fanned too loaf is showing the effects of soil erosion. In Dawson and other counties) of Nebraska much land of this sort is being seeded to sweet clover. </seg>
            <seg id="p476">476 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE lies can be traced back to careless fanning in which dead furrows were left up and down the slope to gather water and start washing. One farm in Otoe county was found where ditches ran into the four corners of one field all of which could be traced back to farming operations where the turn row had been left lower and offered a place for the water to gather and start eroding. Even tho considerable care is used in keeping up the organic matter of soils with rotations, addition of manure, straw and the raising of live stock on the farm, still under certain conditions gullies are very apt to start. When they have just started is the time to begin work on them. One of the best wtys to combat a newly formed gully is by the use of straw or manure of which the gully is filled full and dirt thrown on top of this from the sides. Occasionally, a number of small ■takes should be driven at intervals in order to hold the fill. Corn cobs, corn stalks and material of that sort can occasionally be used to good advantage. One often sees across such gullies dams built by driving in two or three stakes across which a couple of boards are nailed. Or - dinarily such methods are not effective, as the water cuts around one end or underneath and goes merrily on. Straw piles can occasionally be used to go.&gt;d advantage in stopping gullies but very often they are ineffective as th^ ditch cuts around to one side or the bottom of straw pile rots out and the water often brush is seen piled in gullies runs underneath the straw.

            <seg id="p477">477 HEPOkT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARI&gt; OF AORICULTI'HE In the work thru the county agricultural agents and the county farm bureaus, considerable effort has been done along the line of dem - onstrations of various methods of erosion control. The use of brush has been particularly effwtive where correctly used. In one instance in Otoe county a ditch from four to six feet deep and as many feet ■wide cut diagonally across a six acre alfalfa field, dividing it into three parts all of which had to be cut and handled separately. A series of brush dams were built in this gully in the spring of 1920. These brush (A) Brush dams installed on farm of Albert Siemers in Otoe count dam- w-.-re built by packing rather fine brush into the ditch with the tops down stream. A row of stakes were driven across the brush and heavy wir. 1 stapled on after which the stakes were driven on in so as to tighten the cross wires. Such dams were installed near enough to - gether so -hat each one would fill back to the one just above it. The aiftance apart, therefore, would depend largely on the steepness of the slope of the dith. Unless they are put close enough together so as to fill to the one just above, there would be holes left unfilled at which plates the ditch can not be crossed. It was found that by using brush in such diuhes that they could be filled in about a year's time. At this particular place in Otoe county, one year after the dams were in - stalled the ditch was entirely full of soil washed in from the hillsides. It was then disked up and seeded down to brome grass. Many other illustrations along this same line which are working out with very d success could be cited. </seg>

In installing suck dams it is nece« - sary to compute the area draining thru the gully in order to determine by means of tables what size of pipe to use. Ordinary sewer pipe or cement tubes may be used, the latter being considerably cheaper when a large tube is needed . Care must be taken to build the spillway in such a way that the dam will not undermine and wash out. The dams should also be built higher than the land on either side so that in case of a flood the water will run around the dam and not over the top and cut it out The soil for building the dam ia ordinarily obtained by scrapping out a hole on the up stream side which temporarily increase* the storage capacity for water but which soon fills in with sediment. Several such dams have been installed in various parts of the state. The Richardson County Engineer, Mr. Relf, has saved the tax payers of his county a considerable amount of money by installing soil saving dams in many places where dry gullies intersect the roads. In many such instances long bridges have been built in the past across gullies which carry water only during rains. These are being replaced now with soil saving dams. In such cases, the county, with the cooperation of the farmers owning the land on the upper side of the culvert, has ■&gt;ut in soil saving dams which have filled in the gullies to a surprising extent In one such case, more than twenty feet of soil has been caught ebove a dam in a little more than a year's time. In another instance, Mr. Relf took out an old sixty-two foot bridge which had been installed across a ravine twenty-one feet deep and draining only forty acres and A large soil saving dam in Cass county, eight feet of soil has been filled in thia gully in a year's time.

Besides saving several thousand dollars on this job, the gully was stopped on the upper side and further erosion prevented . Other counties in eastern Nebraska can well afford to consider soil saving dams on the roads. In many eases farmers have used the dirt dam without any pipe merely letting the water run around the sides of the dam in the case of extremely heavy rains. Such dams are cheap, there being no cost involved but the labor and on the whole they are working out very well. There is considerable trouble in preventing small gullies from form - ing on long slopes. These small ditches are very inconvenient in farm - ing and at the same time the fertile surface soil is washed off and the heavier subsoil exposed. Under such conditions the broad based graded Mangum terrace has been found very beneficial. These terraces, unlike the intricate bench-like terraces we think of in old countries are very simple and easily built. They should be laid out by an engineer so as to have a certain fall from the upper end toward the outlet. The ter - races are built up by back furrowing several rounds with a plow and then following with a grader or v-scraper. Several terraces, depend - ing upon the length of the slope, should be built. These should be in- stalled in the fall so as to have a chance to settle during the winter before the season of hard rains. They can best be built after a small grain crop has been removed. The next year they are cropped with no particular attention being paid to their presence excepting to set that in plowing or cultivating that they are not broken down. When pos - sible the rows should be run parallel to the contours.

The principle of such terraces is to catch the water back of the ridge and hold it until it is taken up by the soil or until it flows along behind the ridge and is discharged at the outlet. Such terraces, while new to Nebraska, have long been built in the south and even in such neighboring states as Missouri and southern Iowa where they are jjivinp excellent satisfaction. Terraces like any other means of erosion control can not be built and then forgotten. They take continuous supervision just as is necessary in the case of brush dams, soil saving dams or any other method for controlling erosion. Farmers of southeastern Nebraska who have built terraces on their firms predict that in the next ten years a high per cent of the rolling farms in eastern Nebraska will be terraced It is well established, that we need more carefully planned and executed rotations with continuous watchfulness for gullies and immediate action in controlling them when orce they start. If there is any place where the old saying, "A stitch in time saves nine" is true, it is in the prevention of soil washing. </seg>

Talmadge Some fourteen years ago, I bought in eastern Otoe county a farm which was badly cut up with ditches and gullies of such depth as to hide a horse or cow. The fields were cut up into many small irregular pieces which were very unhandy and annoying in carrying on farming operations. Due to ditches, I found at the time I took possession of the farm, that it was necessary for me to travel nearly one quarter of a mile to get into a field which was right in front of my farmstead. I began at once to work on this farm. The first step I took MM to seed down to red clover and alfalfa as much of the farm as I could. The land was low in organic matter and my first effort was to get it back in shape in this regard. I also started to build dams of variois kinds. With a slip s-rapiT 1 built numerous dirt dams ir. the gullifs making these wide and packing them down well by driving over then repeatedly.

Those of the corn rot diseases which are ommonly prevalent in the corn belt have been found and identified present in our Nebraska corn. Tht se diseases are caused by certain parasitic fungi which may be j nt in the sped corn when planted and merely need favorable growth itn ns in order to grow and develop within the plant. Or, on the other appears that the plant may become infected thru the soil. It is y some investigators that these diseases account for much stunt- lging, barrenness, nubbiny ears, and partially decayed ears in our elds. It is further stated that their presence in seed corn may y certain prescribed germinator tests and that it is a pract- H-cdure to individually test all seed ears and to eliminate hose ears which give a disease reaction. «et information regarding these diseases under Nebraska ve tt ~ts wef" made by the Nebraska Experiment Station From amone 14.~ifi tars of two standard varieties, Hogue's Yel- low Dent and Nebraska White prize, 167 ears appeared entirely disease free.

The original corn served as a check and was planted after every tenth p'at. Careful counts were made of the field germination, stunted plants, barren stalks, lodged plants and other plant characters that might be involved. No material difference what ever was noticed for the average of the two gr &gt;ups in any of these characters.

It does not create wealth; it dots not make money in the sense that thrifty men and women make money. Every dollar that the government has was obtained from some one who paid it as taxes, except of course the relatively small returns from the public lands. As the case stands today, the Federal government, which represents us owes about $24,000,000,000 and has pledged the resources of the na - tion to the payment of the debt. Every bushel of grain in America, every ton of coal in mine or bin, every acre of fertile soil, every office build - ing, your home and mine is a guaranty that the debt will be paid. The questions which interest us, are "How will these debts be paid, and who will pay them?" For many years a large portion of our Federal taxes were raised by levying- a tariff on imports and an excise duty on tobacco and alcoholic liquors. Previous to the passage of the Income Tax Law in 1913 direct taxes had been levied but few times. In fact some of the opponents of a protective tarriff maintained that extravagent appropriations were en - couraged by the men who wanted a high tarriff in order that there might be a demand for all the revenue produced. The passage of the sixteenth amendment and the subsequent en - actment of an income tax law ushered in a new era in taxation. At first the rates on incomes were low, but the necessity of raising funds for prosecuting the war resulted in the enactment of a Hew revenue law in 1917 which placed heavy burdens upon large incomes and excess profits.

New York State alone paid 24.58 per cent of all internal revenue taxes. No better example could be given of the tendency of wealth to concentrate in the great commercial centers. Not only were the major portion of these taxes paid within a few states but they were paid by a relatively small number of persons. Tariff and excise taxes are an indirect tax upon consumers. They are paid to the government by the importer or manufacturer, but passed on to the consumer in the form of an increased price charged for the goods. They are therefore paid by all who consume goods subject to such a tax. Income taxes are a direct tax which cannot be passed on, and are therefore paid only by the men most able to pay. It is not surprising that the men who had enjoyed relative freedom from Federal taxation for so many years objected to the income tax, par - ticularly to the supertax and the excess profits tax. The following table ws corporation profits for the years 1913-1919 inclusive: Corporation Profits 1913-1919 1 After paying excess profits taxes the amount of net income remain- Tom 1917 to 1919 was as follows: $9,100,000,000 ,100,000,000 ,300,000,000 r.n The excess profits tax has been repealed effective January 1, 1922. Many arguments were urged in favor of the repeal but the only one of real weight was the fact that it was being circumvented by many cor - porations. A decision of the Supreme Court permitted companies to is - sue stock dividends and to base the per cent of their earnings upon the par value of all outstanding stock. Not fewer than DC important corpor - ations, among which are included the Standard Oil Company of Nebraska increased their capital stock not less than 100 per cent. Many com - panies on the list increased their stock 200 per cent or more, the top limit reached being 2000 per cent. When a company increases its capita] stock in order to avoid payment of the excess profits tax, the general public is apparently justified in believing that profits have been excessive $4,339,551,000 3,940,000,000 5,310,000,000 8,766,000,000 10,730.000,000 9,500,000,000 8,500,000,000 </seg>

The claim has been made that the excess profits tax was not pro - ductive. The facts are that despite the dodging of the tax the returns have been good as indicated by the following table. A study of statistics quickly shows the fallacy of this argument which is sometimes made that the excess profits tax pyramids the cost on the consumer. The price of commodities rose from a level of 100 in 1913 to 161 in March 1917 and had reached 181 in October 1917 when the excess profits law was passed. The level continued to rise after the reduction of the tax in 1919 until it reached 260 in April, 1920. The expense of collecting the income tax and excess profits tax low, being but 54 hundredths of one per cent in 1920. This is abc one-sixth the cost of collecting customs. Perhaps the most ingenious argument offered against the ex profits tax by men who pay it, is that the tax is shifted to the i •umer, and repeal urged because of sympathy for the consumer, is safe to say that if the tax could be shifted as excise taxes or U duties are shifted that the- objection to it would cease. It stays wl w it is placed. A few men really thought they were shifting it, becai the demand for goods permitted them to set a monopoly price. M men would have set this price had there been no tax. If the income tax is kept sufficiently high, it w secure from individuals the tax that has been lost by the rep excess profits tax. The demand for a lowering of income been strong, and nothing but the urgent need of revenue coul fluenced congress to retain a surtax as high as is now in v.i ranges from one per cent of the amount by which the net income ex - ceeds $5000 and does not exceed $6000, to 50 per cent of the amount by which the net income exceeds $200,000. The normal tax is 8 per cent of the amount of the net income in excess of the credits allowed, except that upon the first $4000 of such excess amount the tax is 4 per cent. The man whose taxable income is under $4000 therefore pays only 4 per cent, while the wealthy man actually pays 58 per cent upon that portion of his income in excess of $200,000 and a smaller per cent upon the different divisions of the taxable income of less than $200,000. The most important argument urged against the income tax is that it retards the accumulation of capital, and in that way injures business. .917 .918 919 2,400,000,000 1,200,000,000 720,000,000 920 les 450,000.000 </seg>

Small investors are ■hintf an unusually large per cent of bond offerings at the present For example, there were 67,912 subscriptions for bonds of the H issue recently offered by the New York Telephone Company, subscriptions 54,000 were for $5000 or less, and over 25.000 The argument that a high surtax deprives us of investment capital not seem to be founded on facts. There was never before as many jyers as we have today. The surtax does retard concentration of That would seem to be a strong argument in favor of such a ax. It is better to have a country where a large part of the people lave accumulated property than to have a country where a few men h and the large mass of workers are very poor. ncnts of the income tax law have been pointing out the large venue through the tendency of wealthy men to invest in tax unties . The income from all securities issued by any state, city or school district is not taxable. Such a tax exempt se- which returns five per cent, is as satisfactory an investment for from which the returns would ordinarily be taxed fifty per cent, investment in stock paying ten per cent, the income from which t to tax. The obvious remedy for this form of tax dodging is peal of the income tax, but an amendment to the constitution 11 income subject to the Federal income tax without regard the mm from which it is secured. The large volume of tax exempt urities already issued would naturally remain exempt, but the in- from all future issues would be taxable. It is very essential that ould put an end to the loss of revenue from this important source. The recent amendment to the income tax law increased the personal xemption from $2,000 to $2,500 and the exemption for each dependent hild from $200 to $400. This relieves from the tax a relatively large number of men whose savings are necessarily small. The wisdom of the change at the present time, when the purchasing power of the dollar is increasing, is open to question. In the enactment of revenue laws, Con - gressmen should be governed not by what they would like to do for each class of tax payers, but by what they must do in order to raise the nec - essary revenue by methods that will be just to all. Before the income tax can be lowered further some substitute must be found. Nearly all cornbelt farmers are somewhat familiar with the nefarious Nolan Bill that proposed a direct tax upon the men who hap - pened to own land, without regard to their ability to pay. Fortunately the Farm Bureau Federation, the Farmers' Union and other thinking </seg>
            <seg id="p490">490 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE farm organizations helped to buy this dream child of the single taxer and wealthy tax dodger. The substitution of a general sales tax for the major portion of the income tax is now being advocated by Senator Smoot and other men of wealth. It was originally proposed to tax all sales, but the plan has been modified so that it is now planned to place the tax only upon sales at retail. It is urged that such a tax would be a good producer of rev- C, that it would distribute the tax burden very widely, and that it d be an easy tax to collect. Granting that these statements are true, the case for the sales tax :s far from proven. The fact that the tax is levied upon all retail sales would make it bear much more heavily upon the person of small income than the person of large income. A one per cent tax on the purchases made by a person whose income is $100,000 per year would bear down very lightly, but a one per cent tax on the purchaser made by a person with an income of $1000 per year would be a very noticeable tax. Such a tax does not take into consideration a man's ability to pay. It should be treated for what it is — a device proposed by men who now pay large income taxes to shift a portion of that tax to someone else. A sales tax is not a bad tax merely because it is a sales tax. We have had taxes for many years that are essential sales taxes, such as the tax on tonacco. This differs from the proposed general sales tax in that it is a tax on a luxury. If a man does not wish to pay it, he need not purchase tobacco. The general belief that the use of tobacco should be discouraged rather than em-ouragcd has kept this tax high Many men who oppose a general sales tax believe that the prin - ciple of taxing luxuries could be utilized more widely. The levying of a tax on such articles as chewing gum, silk stockings, and fur coats should produce considerable revenue without working a hardship upon anyone. The simplest method of collecting such a tax is to collect it from the manufacturer in the same way that the tax on tobacco is collected. The levying of a tax upon gasoline is a tax of this type. The man who uses the gasoline pays the tax; a man who does not wish to pay the tax has merely to refrain from the purchase of gasoline. In so far as gasoline is a necessity to people of small incomes, such a tax is a burden but in so far as gasoline is a luxury or semi-luxury such a tax b an admirable means of raising revenue. It seem particularly fitting that the proceeds from such a tax should be used for road construction since the men who manufacture, sell and drive pleasure cars have been most insistent upon the rapid development of a good roads program. Such a tax is working very satisfactorily in several states. The chief objection urged against it is that the road tax now paid by the landowner will be shifted to the cash tenant, who is at present having </seg>
            <seg id="p491">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 491 sufficient trouble without our adding anything to his burdens. This is a valid argument, but before accepting this as the deciding factor, we should study the incidence of the present tax. All property is now taxed for the building of state highways but not all persons who own property use state highways. For example, I know a man past 60 years of age who is paying for his home from what he can savt out of a salary of $80 per month. He haa never owned an automobile and has no expectation of ever becoming an auto owner. He is a type of thousands of men who pay taxes from which they get no direct benefit. The man who purchased farm land during the inflation period and borrowed money for a considerable portion of the purchase price is in &gt;ad a position as is the cash tenant. In fact any farmer who owe* in part for his land is doing well to meet his interest payments, and pay his portion of regular taxes without helping construct roads for joy rid - ers. Kvcn if he drives a car he will doubtless be very willing to pay a small tax upon the two hunderd or three hundred gallons of gasoline that he uses necessarily in order to be relieved of a portion of his taxes upon his other property. On the other hand we find many persons who own no real estate, and but very little other taxable property who own big cars and drive them thousands of miles each year upon roads for which other people pay. Is there any reason fundamentally why the local joy rider, or the trans - continental tourist should not be taxed for the construction of roads in proportion to his use of the roads? Is there any reason why the man or firm that engages in trucking, using for that purpose a public high - way, should be excused from making a direct payment toward the high - ways ? As matters stand now we tax the railroads to help pay for the construction of highways upon which both freight and passengers are carried in competition with the railroads. The public is paying a fairly heavy tax in order to furnish free highways to all who will travel. On the whole I believe that any disadvantage of the tax on gasoline are far outweighed by the advantages. Personally I am willing to pay for my share of road construction in proportion to the use I make of the highways. In levying taxes, we should remember that some taxes are always shifted to someone else while others must be borne by the person who them. Among taxes readily shifted are excise taxes, tariff duties, and taxes on store buildings and dwellings which are rented and stocks of merchandise. Some taxes which cannot be shifted are taxes on land, on all farm property including land, buildings, and equipment, on house - hold Roods and incomes. In levying a part of these taxes such as all excise taxes and sales </seg>
            <seg id="p492">492 REPORT (IF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICIXTIRE it is always understood that the tax i? passed on to the consumer. For example, no one questions that a tax of one cent a gallon on gasoline will be added to the price charged the consumer. In the same way, a mer - chant considers his taxes as a part of his overhead expenses, and neces - sarily adds enough to the selling price of goods to include the tax. A tariff on manufactured goods ordinarily adds to the pric-e at which such goods are sold to the consumer. On the other hand, in the United States a tariff on corn or wheat does not ordinarily affect prices since we pro - duce a surplus of these grains and the export price practically determines the price paid by local consumers. It will be noticed that the farmer is in a particularly disadvanta - geous position since most of the taxes paid by him cannot be passed on to any one else. It is therefore very important to him that no changes shall be made in our laws which will permit the shifting to him of any heavier taxes than he now bears. Twenty four billion dollars is a debt well worth shifting. No man Eoup of men ever played for higher stakes. What part will agTicultu ke? Shall the fanners sit by quietly and take whatever may be handi to them? Shall the farmers wait while capital and labor develop ti schemes and content themselves with objecting to the other man's pr gram, or shall farmers make a tax program of their own, fashioned &lt; justice and equity, and halt not until it is pushed through ?

Crawford UWhen the comparative small group of delegates representing the ven important grain producing states in the union gather for the first annual convention of the U. S Grain Growers, Inc., to be held in Chicago beginning March 21, they will have the solemn duty of determining the future destinies of cooperative grain marketing. Much depends on the constructive acts of this convention. Chief among the policies to re - ceive attention will be to provide financial means for the orderly market - ing of grain under contract, action looking to the early establishment of zone sales agencies at the principal marketing centers, and consider - ation of forming other necessary subsidiaries. When the initial session of the March meeting is called to order by President C. H. Gustafson, his home state, Nebraska, will be represented by over 8,000 members coming from over 230 shipping points. The Ne - braska delegation will be distinctive in that its membership campaign is surpassed by no other state in efficiency or relative importance. In ex - cess of 4,000 members secured by the close of business on January 17th prior to which time all members would be given representation at the annual convention, are concentrated in congressional districts one and four, including 18 counties in the southeast corner of the state. Another important feature of Nebraska's accomplishments is the fact that of the elevator contracts signed thus far, 225 of them are held by strictly co- operative houses. The co-operative elevator is the foundational unit of the U. S. Grain Grower plan as early established by the Committee of Seventeen. To review the Nebraska campaign would result in the revamping of a mass of details already told. A hasty resume, however, brings to light several important features. Chief among these are; the universal sup - port of state farm organizations, the consistent weekly increase in grower and elevator memberships, the endorsement given by state leaders and, last but not least, the amateurish and decidedly inconsistent attacks waged against the organization by the radical element of the Omaha Grain Exchange. This latter feature has had a wholesome influence on the membership campaign. Each outburst from Omaha grain interests has been reflected in immediate membership increases. One of the stimulating factors in advancing the Grain Grower cam - paign in Nebraska, as pointed out above, is the large number of promi - nent landowners who have given study to the plan of the company and followed this up by attaching their names to grower contracts. Among these are; Governor S. R . McKelvie. Leo Stuhr, Secretary of Agricul - ture; J. M. Matzen, State Superintendent of Schools; J. N. Norton, Pres - ident of the Nebraska Farm Bureau; C. J.

Filley, head of the rural economics department of Nebraska University; A. J. Weaver, President of the state constitutional convention, and others. With the campaign limited to a restricted area thus far, work is now being: opened in fruitful territory in the northeast, south and western parts of the state. Early reports from progress in these new fields are entirely satisfactory and there is every reason to believe, weather per - mitting, that the campaign can be successfully continued during the remainder of the winter and spring. The work will be continued until the principles of the U. S. Grain Growers have been presented to every grain grower in Nebraska. The layman may rightfully ask in hearing of the activities of the U S. Grain Growers, "What is this giant that has affiliated in a few months time over 1,000 farmers elevators and grain growers associations and over 40,000 members, representing in excess of 100,000,000 bushels of grain. By what economic right did it come into existence? Who are its leaders and who oppose it? What are its aims and purposes? What effect will it have on me as a consumer?" To answer these questions one must study the history of agriculture for some thirty years beginning with the time when a small group of farmers formed the first cooperative elevator and took a definite stand against the unfair practices of the grain buyers at local stations, espec- ially where controlled by line elevator systems. For years the farmers had been the victims of price manipulators, forced to take whatever price al buyers might give, either individually or by agreement, collectively. When the cooperative elevator movement was launched agriculture witnessed one of its greatest economic struggles. On the surface, how - ever, it did not appear as such. Grain buyers and old line elevator own- aw in the cooperative elevator a movement to take enormous prof- ts from them. They put up a solid front and fought bitterly. They ipposed the farmer in securing sites for an elevator, encouraged car dis - rimination by agreement with station agents, and artificially raised the price to a point where the farmers' concern faced immediate failure. Line elevators were able to pursue such a program of paying over the market in order to freeze out farmers' elevators by paying under the market where no farmer competition was presented. To relate in detail this history-making fight would take volume*. Briefly, it is sufficient to say that, even in the face of discouraging odds, the cooperative elevator has succeeded until today over 5,000 of these towers of agricultural prosperity, speaking in things economic, are found in the grain belt of this country. What is more they are maintaining their integrity during the present period of depression. The cooperative elevator succeeded because, economically, it is right. It has been said by </seg>

To say the least they have created a wholesome competition at the local station and corrected the most flagrant abuses. They have brought about, in a measure, a greater degree of prosperity and content - ment in the business of farming-, developed the fanners' confidence in his ability to conduct his own business, furnished a splendid example of the profits which accrue from community organization and set a solid foundation for a national structure of farmer-owned grain marketing fa - cilities, when his confidence in himself and his disgust toward those who have failed tc protect his interests has impelled him to perfect his own marketing machine. The U. S. Grain Growers. Inc., proposes to do for the farn trminal what the cooperative elevator has done for him locally. That the story, tersely told. Briefly stated, the U. S. Grain Growers is a farmer-owned, farmer-controlled, non-profit, non-stock cooperative cor - poration, designed to take its members grain to the markets of the world w to be sold at the highest price obtainable under the natural laws ply and demand— every cent of it but no more — and return to 1 ducer the full market value less the actual handling charges 1 so it has no particular fault to find with the present system keting grain other than certain unfair prat iarticula speculative phase, which have crept in and extort m ] nually from the producers. It has no hopes of system of marketing, but is designed rather ■n competition at the terminals which will eliminate u ui tion, inefficiency and waste. It does not ask for cial favors. All it asks, and it is rather insiste privilege of organizing and doing business. A brief review of history during the past year and a sarv if one is to understand the origin of the U. S Grain Gowc July 23 and 24, 1920, for the first time in the histc rganized agriculture, a truly representative group of grain growing farmers from •11 different farm organizations, and from all parts of the United States met in a national get-together marketing conference in Chicago. Time and time again some farm leader with a vision had made an attempt to unify the efforts of different cooperative farm organizations. And time and time again, the aims of such a cooperative movement failed. Selfish organizational purposes or personal ambitions on the part of leadership made difficult the progress of national cooperation. Out of this Chicago conference there came the Fanners' Marketing Committee of Seventeen.

Myers, national secretary of the Farmers' National Grain Dealers Association was chosen secretary and Wm. G. Eckhardt of the Illinois Agricultural Association, treasurer. Offices were established without delay in Chicago and in sixty days time the first organization work was in progress. The numerous details, policies and perplexing problems connected with such a huge movement prevented a mushroom growth. Organization work now has been initiated in a total of eleven states. One of the serious problems that has confronted the directors of the Grain Growers was the matter of developing the Farmers' Finance Cor - poration, — a $100,000,000 fiscal department that was designed to furnish credit that the national company would need. The problem of devising a plan that would assure control of the company always remaining in the hands of farmers offered a problem that challenged the best minds of the organization. This was finally met with a proposal to issue preferred stock in (100 shares with no voting power. In addition 21 shares of com - mon stock were authorized without value but holding voting power. The common stock was to be held perpetually by the parent company and voted by it. When this plan was announced farm leaders in several states objected to the idea of the Grain Growers' directors controlling the company, taking the stand that cooperative sales agencies handling products other than grain should be guaranteed fair treatment. In a number of states steps had already been taken towards the formation of a local finance corporation and leaders objected to sacrificing their plans for a national body. The situation was further complicated when security commissions in some states frowned upon the plan of control proposed ers' Finance Corporation. It became evident that farmers were not united on the question of a finance corporation, so about the time the War Finance Corporation en - tered the field and thus removed the necessity of immediate action in this direction, the directors of the U. S. Grain Growers decided to take no further action in the matter until the annual convention in March when the membership will express themselves. No sooner had the infant U. S. Grain Growers been measured for its first suit of rompers than did the grain merchants of the country set up a vicious attack on its principles and proclaimed the efficiency of the existing system of grain marketing. This attitude culminated in calling the now famed Cincinnati meeting, under the direct auspices of the Grain Dealers National Association, where the radical and speculative element of the organized grain trade convened and pledged the $250,000 slosh fund with which to fight the growing cooperative tendencies on the part of farmers and particularly the Grain Growers. R. I. Mansfield, connected with the Chicago Board of Trade, was made chairman of a "special legislative committee" with full powers to go full steam ahead and soon gained the title of "propagandist extraordinary." </seg>
            <seg id="p499">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 499 The first line of attack which Mr. Mansfield employed was to at - tempt to brand the cooperative movement as radical and to attach the stigma cf socialism to the U. S. Grain Growers. Glaring posters were scattered broadcast over the grain-belt warning farmers against connect - ing themselves with such a movement and using the words "Remember North Dakota — Remember the Non-Partisan League." Such action on the part of the grain interests had a wholesome effect on the organization progress of the farmers' company. It encouraged farmers to study the principles of the Grain Growers. They did so and joined by the thousands. Mansfield continued his campaign and his every action acted as a boomerang. The grain interests soon recognized the folly of such a course and at the annual meeting of the Grain Dealers Na - tional Association, it was announced by Mansfield that the U. S. Grain Growers had failed in its organization work and hence the Chicago office would be discontinued and remaining activities, incidental to embalming and burying the U. S. Grain Growers, would be conducted from the Toledo office of the Grain Dealers National Association. But as recently as November 5th his organization sent out a warning to all elevator companies telling them how speedily the Grain Growers was soliciting the support of the thousands of farmers and asked them to contribute $10 to keep up the propaganda. In the final analysis the consumer need little fear the activities of the U. S. Grain Growers, even from the most adverse angle as painted by the radical element of the organized grain trade. It is generally recognized that certain costly practices prevail in the present system of marketing grain. If the farmer can take his products from the source of production to the consumer more efficiently than it is being done today, it is the best for all concerned that he should do so. If he is unable to do so, then the U. S. Grain Growers will not succeed. There is nothing in the purposes of the organization that smacks of a monopoly or a price - fixing machine. But should the organization ever advance to become such a controlling factor, public sentiment and the courts of the country would declare it a trust and wreck the cooperative movement for all time. All the farmer asks, and he is justified in his attitude, is the privilege of taking his products to the ultimate buyer and let the normal law of supply and demand govern the purchase price. He is willing: to let consumptive demand set the price his products should bring and •hare the profits accruing from economical and efficient marketing with the consumer. He holds that the present marketing systems operate to the disadvantage of both the producer and consumer. He object* to a price registering theremometer that frequently is controlled by applica - tions of a hot water bottle or an ice pack. </seg>
            <seg id="p500">500 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE EAR-TYPE SELECTION AM) YIELD OF DENT CORN T. A. Kiesselbarh, Nebraska Agricultural College, Lincoln The subject assigned the writer in this symposium was at one time of greater importance in the minds of agronomists and others than it is today. In the latter part of the nineteenth century a rather arbitrary a priori doctrine for ascertaining productive excellence of the seed ear was evolved from the mistaken line of reasoning that high shell - ing percentage and grain yield of the seed ear was synonymous with relatively high acre production. Thru associating this belief with the evolutionary teaching that like begets like this ear-type perfection was to be preserved thru purity of breeding and selection for uniformity. Aside from the qualities denoting soundness of the grain, with its very obvious value, practically all of the points featured in the early score cards, devised as a guide for selecting seed ears, have their origin in the above reasoning P These new teachings aroused great interest in corn and a nu ion workers and practical corn growers planned experiir establish their significance The outcome was to suggest that th cal ear characters of dent corn fall into two definite groups, th' Knonutilitarian and those tending to be utilitarian. As on of progress in public sentiment the tendency in some St been to revise the corn score card, fron m emphasis to important utilitarian considerations, such as adaf soundness. The other type considerations appear to be large rations at itarian. from the seed standpoint It may be observed that no j&lt; corn exhibits has yet been devise wher itarian considerations. The former attaches about 80 per perfect score to soundness, viability, and freedom from disease. T latter gave approximately 70 per cent to soundr ty, a tation. The ear characteristics which have received chief consideration by corn enthusiasts are: 1, adaptation: 2, soundness; 3, maturity; 4, size of ear; 5, trueness to type; 6, uniformity of ears; 7, uniformity of kernels; 8, shape of kernels; 9, space between kernels; 10, depth of kernels; 11, total weight of grain; 12, shelling percentage; 13, shape of ears; 14, color of cobs; 15, color of kernels; 16, character of butts and tips of ears; and 17, straightness of rows. 1.

            <seg id="p501">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICl'LTl RE 501 The essential requirements of seed corn are that it shall be sound and that it shall be well adapted to the conditions where planted. The degree of adaptation depends upon the degree of harmony between the plant requirements and its environmental growth conditions. The highest degree of adaptation is regarded as that resulting in the max- f sound srrain per acre. The most pronounced environ- mun nental factors correlated with the growth habits of corn plants best uited for any region are climatic. Wide hereditary differences in na- tive corn types are found in response to variation in climate. Thus, omparing adapted Lancaster County, Nebraska, corn with adapted Kimball County, Nebraska, corn, when both were grown under favorable conditions of Lancaster County, the former ripened 18 days later, pro- duced plants which were 40 per cent taller, bore the ears 150 per cent iigh-r above the ground, had 138 per cent greater leaf area per plant, Droduced 100 per cent greater total dry matter per plant. The were 123 per cent heavier, and had a 10 per cent higher shelling ntage. These are inherited differences, which may be ascribed pri - y to the normal climatic differences of the two regions. Comparing mate of Lancaster County with that of Kimball County, the temperature of the corn-growing season is 7° F. warmer, the ■ee period is 35 days longer, and the precipitation is 13 inches, Tit, higher i of such differing growth habits commonly have distinct grain and ear. The special adaptation is more or less re - the ear. Smoothness and shallowness of grain, low shelling age, small ear circumference, and a low number of rows of er ear suggest relative earliness and small vegetative growth. Rou«-h. deep grain, high shelling percentage, large circumference, and hijrh number of rows on the ear are rather characteristic of late aturity and large plant growth. In a general way in response to adaptation, the more adverse the growing conditions are for com, the more nearly does the corn approach the small stalk, low leaf area, ender ears, and smooth, shallow kernel of flint corn. This adjustment l often spoken of as "running out" of the corn, whereas it is an actual betterment for the prevailing conditions. The so-called utilitarian ear characteristics have significance only so far as they are linked with inherent vegetative growth habits f the corn plant. The exact nature of these plant characters and de- Tee to which they will reproduce themselves can not be reliably judged by a mere examination of the ear. The correctness of such judgment is greatly enhanced by a previous knowledge of the source and purity of breeding of the corn. Thus, a small, smooth, shallow-grained nubbin of Boone County White grown in Indiana might very closely resemble an average ear of Marten White Dent corn which is well adapted to the short and dry season of western Nebraska. But if the two ears </seg>
            <seg id="p502">502 were planted side by side in Indiana, the one would produce plants about twice as large and five weeks later in maturing than the other. It appears to be an almost universal practice on the part of the corn grower to pull somewhat against the natural law of adaptation by growing corn slightly too large and late for his conditions. This is in large measure brought about by an effort to approach the ear characteristics of corn grown in the most favorable corn districts of the country. This has been especially evident in the settlement of the western and northern frontiers of the corn belt. Newcomers found that the corn which they brought with them from more favored sections assumed more and more the dwarfish characteristics of adverse con - ditions. They believed their corn to be running out and replaced it from time to time with imported seed, or selected for planting the ears which most nearly approached the original characteristics. Thru experience, however, the corn grower is coming to recognize the ad - vantage of modifying his conception of ear type to harmonize with the environment of his locality. Then- is no such thing as a universal best type. It is the purpose of this paper to present a brief digest of the available published data from the various agricultural agencies, in - cluding some unpublished results at the Nebraska Agricultural Exper - iment Station. It was thought that by bringing the important data to - rier in this compact form, the reader would be aided in drawing own conclusions. The experimental data are classified largely by States or institutions, since this avoids a frequent restatement of the methods or nature of the tests. Ohio Experiments Williams and Welton (18)* report results from the Ohio Station as follows: In a 9-year test with three varieties, tapering ears outyield - ed cylindrical ears 2.3 per cent in grain production (68.3 against 66.8 bu.). As an average for 7 years, smooth ears of the Clarage variety yielded 2.7 per cent more grain than rough ears (65.3 to 63.6 bu.) Ears with bare tips having 1.2 inches of exposed cob yielded 0.3 per cent less grain than ears with well-filled tips (62.4 to 62.7 bu.) aa an average for 8 years. During 10 years the long ean (averaging 9.2 inches) of four va - rieties exceeded the short ears (6.8 inches) by 2 per cent in grain yield (89.5 to 68.2 bu.) In a 5-year comparison of 14-rowed and 18-rowed ears the former exceeded the latter 1.7 per cent (60.9 to 59.9 bu.) ut Wooster and 6.4 per cent (57.6 to 54.2 bu.) at Germantown. In a 6-year comparison of Clarage corn at Wooster, ears with high per cent (88.2 per cent) of grain yielded 0.6 per cent less than ears 'Reference by number is to Literature cited, Page 621 </seg>
            <seg id="p503">503 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE of low (76.4 per cent) shelling percentage (64.6 to 65.1 bu.) The shelling percentage of the ears grown from the two lots was 86.1 and 80.8 per cent, respectively. The Ohio experiments suggest a possible slight advantage for the long, slender, smooth ears, altho there is no very material difference between any of the types. HcCall and Wheeler (13) have calculated the coefficients of corre - lation for extensive ear-to-row tests between grain yield and the length, weight, circumference, and density of the seed ears. The yield tests cover seven years, 1905 to 1911, by the Ohio Agricultural Station and four years, 1906-1909, by J. W. Cook at Forrest, Ohio. No significant correlation was discovered. Kansas Experiments Table 1 presents data based on extensive ear-to-row tests, reported by Cunningham (3) of the Kansas Agricultural Experiment Station. The tests cover nine varieties during six years. Altho the ears planted were all of fair length they were divided into three groups, long, medium, and short, for which the respective grain yields were 48.2, 48.4, and 48.2 bushels per acre. Ears having 16, 18, and 20 rows yielded, respec - tively, 43.5, 41.4, and 39.9 bushels per acre. This is 3.6 bushels between the extremes in favor of the 16-rowed ear. The small number of rows would seem to be correlated, to some extent at least, with small ear cir - cumference. Ears with relatively large, medium, and small circumfer- elded 47.9, 49.3, and 49.6 bushels, which is 1.7 bushels in favor e most slender ear. Ears with shelling percentages of 88, 86, 84, and 82 per cent yielded 49.6, 49.9, 49.8, and 50.8 bushels per acre, re - spectively. The lowest shelling percentage yielded 1.2 bushels more than the highest. The yields of very rough, medium rough, and smooth - gTained ears were 49.2, 52.6, 53.5 bushels per acre, respectively, which is 3.3 bushels more for the smooth than the rough ears. Ears with well-filled, medium-filled, and poorly filled tips yielded, respectively, 51.7, 51.8, and 51.8 bushels per acre. Poor and partially rounded butts both yielded 51.0 bushels per acre compared with 60.7 bushels for well - rounded butts. Little relation between type and yield is shown by these Kansas data, aside from suggesting superiority for the rather slender, smooth ear of low shelling percentage. </seg>

These figures suggest that ears with a medium number of rows are superior under Illinois conditions.

            <seg id="p512">512 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In addition to the authors, Carrier (2) has interpreted these data as confirming the practical value of the score card in seed-corn selection. There may be some doubt, however, as to whether the score card differences indicated in Table 7 should be assigned as the underlying; cause of this wide difference in yield. The superior score of the ears harvested from these high-yielding plats may perhaps, be no more the cause than the effect of high yield. The causes may be entirely foreign to ear-type considerations. Variations of as much as 5 per cent in the perfection and uniformity of ear and kernel development and 25 per cent in yield per acre may easily result from soil heterogeneity and stand variations within a series of 200 or 300 short corn rows. Any adverse environmental factor is likely systematically to reduce both the yield and score of en ear-to-row plat. The manner of comparison reported in this test does not appear to provide for the random and ac - cidental distribution of inherently hiph and low scoring types in the field. The method employed permits the combination of any yield factors, and the most adverse combinations, whether seed or environ - mental, determine the opposing groups of plats. The more adverse combinations commonly result in the lowest scoring ears harvested. In a test of this character it would appear that the aim sought Rough ear and long, slender, smooth ear of Nebraska White Prize corn.

A lot of rather long, slender, sirooth ears with grains of only medium depth was selected from a general lot of Reid Yi ilow Dent corn harvested in 1904. The ears were grown in 1905 in comparison with the original standard Reid. During the -three succeeding years this test was continued, selecting each year the long smooth ears grown from the long smooth ears of the previous year (14). As an average for the four years' test (Table 8) the long smooth type surpassed the standard type, with its greater circumference and rougher and deeper kernels, by 7.8 per cent in yield. Table 8. — Average yield in bushels per acre obtained from long smooth ears of Reid Yellow Dent corn compared with the standard medium rough type of that variety at the Nebraska Agricultural Ex - periment Station during the four years from 1905 to 1908. Yea 190; Avera In 1909 five prize-winning show exhibits from Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio were compared for yield with ordinary corn of five varieties, ob - tained in Nebraska at a distance of fifty or more miles from the ex - periment station, and also with seven varieties secured locally. The show character of the seed from other States in no way offset the more important consideration of local adaptation (15). The average yields of these three lots of corn were, respectively, 39.8, 45.6, and 48.8 bushels per acre. In 1910 five yellow and five white exhibits of good show type and five exhibits of poor show type were obtained from the Nebraska State Corn Show. When these three lots were compared for yield at the ex - periment station, they produced, respectively, 56.1, 55.8, and 56.9 bushels per acre.

Condition of corn at Moisture in grain Germination of Length time of first frost. gathered on corn gathered on of kernel The Nebraska type studies indicate superior yields for shallower and smoother type selections than is customary in the more favored corn sections of the State. The sorts worked with were all standard full season varieties. I am not inclined to believe that this increased yield is due merely to the difference in ear type, but rather because it represents slightly earlier maturing and less rank growing plants. Whether a corn grower may effect the greater improvement in the ield of his corn by selecting the smoother or rougher type of ear will probably depend upon whether his corn is now somewhat too small and early, or whether it is too late maturing and rank growing. In farm practice this adjustment of plant type to local conditions may be grad - ually effected by either selecting seed from the plants in the field which possess the desired characteristics or else by selecting for seed those ears which suggest greater or less earliness and vegetative growth. In well-adapted corn it will probably prove advantageous to select for seed a mixture of ear types. Fancy ear considerations, such as perfect tips and butts, cylindrical ears, and uniformity of ears in size and shape, unformity of kernels in size, shape, and indentation, and straight - ness of rows, are nonessential from the yield standpoint. In general, for most Nebraska conditions at least, and probably for all regions not more favorably situated, distinctly deep-grained and rough ear types should be avoided. A distinct change in sentiment has in recent years taken place among some of our most prominent corn men in Nebraska, and they assert that experience has taught them to get away from the old-time rough, deep-grained corn and to follow a middle of the road policy.

            <seg id="p518">518 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF ACRICLT.TURE i Ear Type and Disease* It would appear that investigations of the root, stalk, and ear rot diseases of corn have not progressed sufficiently far to warrant con - clusions regarding their significance in connection with ear-type per - formance. Disease may be one cause of rough, starchy, and '- - hnify kernels. But rough, starchy kernels are certainly not necessarily a criterion of disease. We probably can concede that the deep, rough, starchy kernel is at least as well adapted to the highly favored corn district of Franklin County, Ind., which is noted for its superb corn of this type, as some other type might be. Ears bearing evidence of di- sease or low viability should not be chosen for seed. The recent work of Hoffer and Holbert (5, 6) and others will doubtless stimulate more general investigations along these lines. Extreme Uniformity Objectionable In general, the principle of selecting for extreme uniformity in es type or other plant characteristics is faulty. Com is normally a con plex and crossfertilized crop. Artificial inbreeding of corn in whic an ear is fertilized by pollen from the same plant greatly reduces ru ceeding corn grown from the inbred seed. After four or five years I a such inbreeding not more than one-fourth the normal produc be expected. The plants and ears, however, all come to ba u type.

This procedure with strain No. 64 has been continued each year, with the result that, as an average for the seven years 1 1911-1917 1 when grown in a yield test with the original Hogue Yellow Dent corn, from which it was once se - lected as the premier, it has yielded 47.7 bushels as compared with 53.6 bushels per acre.

            <seg id="p520">520 REPORT OP NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Summary A review of the available data indicates that, within reasonable limits at least, variations in each characters are rather neutral in their effect upon the yield of dent corn, except when they are definitely linked with special adaptive growth characteristics of the plant. Thus, slender ears with smooth, shallow kernels tend to be produced on earlier matur - ing, smaller and less rank growing plants than are large, rough, deep - kemeled ears of the same variety. In the States of Kansas, Nebraska, Ohio, and Illinois, where the tendency has been to grow too large and late maturing corn types, selection of the rather long, slender, medium smooth ears, with kernels of medium depth and medium shelling per - centage, results in somewhat increased production. Ear and kernel characters, aside from those known to indicate soundness and special adaptation, have little significance as indicators of high producing seed ears. There are indications that close type selection, if long continued, may even reduce productivity, thru an approach toward gametic purity for the selected characters. This may also account in part for increased yields sometimes obtained from F, variety hybrids. Many institutions and individuals have practiced continued type selection in order to achieve uniformity and have perhaps unwittingly introduced an element of dose breeding. It has recently been proposed that the root, stalk, and eai diseases are somewhat associated with dull starchy kernels and discolored or shredded shank attachment. Further and more genen vestigations may disclose the full significance of ear characterise disease indicators. The proposed control of these corn diseases &lt; a new and important field for investigation </seg>

Officers or members of the association delivered addresses at 35 ve stock meetings over the state daring the year. "Better Sires" was the subject under discussion. The live stock meetings of organized agriculture during the first week in January were staged under the auspices of the association. A total of 2500 men and women attended the week's meetings. The association has been very active in boosting the State Fair Baby Beef Calf Club Show and club work in general. The first steps have been taken to bring the county breeders' as - ■ciations into closer contact with one another. Mainly because of financial depression this project has not been pushed as it will be in the future. Aid was given in promoting the showing of more Nebraska-bred sheep at the State Fair. General live stock projects have been under way. A great deal f publicity has been sent to all county papers. The main scheme of the publicity has been the economical importance of better sires on Nebraska farms. </seg>
            <seg id="p536">536 REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE HOME ECONOMICS SECTION— ORGANIZED AGRICULTURE- LINCOLN, NEBRASKA January 3-5 "United Efforts for Better Health" was the general theme for the three days program given by the Home Economics section of Organized Agriculture. Dr. Hedger of the Elizabeth Memorial Fund who had been with the Extension Service for the Annual Conference of Agents and Specialists for a series of eight lectures, was the main speaker. Her talk at the joint meeting for men and women on 'The New Era" im - pressed all alike that the child of today is really living in a new era of civilization and his care and training must be adequate for the age in which he is to become a part. Miss Margaret Noble of the Home Economics Department of the University added emphasis to all of Dr. Hedger's lectures by her demon - stration of a Nutrition Class. Farm Bureau Day was characterized by delegates reports from 40 Farm Bureau counties. These women gave most interesting accounts of the Extension programs carried on in their counties by Home Dem - onstration Agents or Specialists. Boys and Girls Club Work was em- phasized by Miss Maude A. Bean, Club Agent for Dawson County Mrs. Vera Buseik Schuttler, member of the Executive Committee of the American Farm Bureau Federation give two splendid talks on "The Farm Bureau Problems and Womans Place in the Farm Bureau". Other interesting members on the program were greetings from the Nebraska Federated Clubs by Mrs. Edgar B. Penny, State President. Review of the work of the 1922 Legislature by Mrs. H. H.

            <seg id="p537">REPORT OF NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 537 NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION Activities for the Year Ending January 1922 During the year of 1921 the Nebraska State Poultry Association, under the secretaryship of Mr. Chester Bonsall of Fairbury fought its way through rather stormy waters to a very happy and successful year ending. In spite of a shortage of funds, as compared with previous recent years the association ended its year practically out of debt, in fact a small balance of $7.10 was on hand at the close of its 37th annual ex - hibit held in the city auditorium in Lincoln, though a later checking did disclose a few small unpaid items which quickly consumed this bal - ance plus an income of $20.00 derived during January from receipts ir new members. At this writing June 10th the association is without cash on hand unpaid accounts amounting to $56.00. However at this season funds are not badly needed and the day is not long off till a portion of our 1922 State funds will be available. The association held two general meetings last year. The first was the regular semi-annual meeting and was held at the State Fair grounds during State Fair week. This was a well attended and a very unusual "peaceful" meeting. In addition to routine business much good and practical results were obtained through the medium of the "open rum" discussions of important poultry farming matters. During the reprular annual exhibit held in Lincoln the first full week of January the association held its regular institute meeting in the auditorium at the State Farm with Vice President Peterson in the chair. This meeting was well attended by representative farmers from all sections of Nebraska. The speakers were Prof. Bettenbender of the Iowa State Agricultural College and R. F. Palmer of Holdrege, one of the judges at the show. A paper was read by one of Nebraska's best farmers who lives at Crete, in which he pointed out "How He Had Stolen His Wife's Profitable Side Line". It was very plain that now poultry and egg farming was indeed a "main issue" on this farm now. The 37th annual exhibit was one of the most successful ever caged by this or any western association. There was an increase of about one hundred entries of the show of 1920 held in Holdrege and this in spite of an increased entry fee. Fowls were exhibited from seventy nine different localities in Ne - braska and from three neighboring states. The judging was done by James A. Tucker of Royal Oak, Michigan; Earle Smiley of Seward, Ne- Russell F. Palmer, Secretary </seg>
