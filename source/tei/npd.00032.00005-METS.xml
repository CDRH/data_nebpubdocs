            <seg id="p003">SECRETARY OF THL STATE BANKING BOARD III State of Nebraska, Department of Banking, Lincoln, February 8, 1915. EHis Excellency, JOHN H. MOREHEAD, Governor, HON. \VM. H. SMITH, Auditor of Public Account HON. WILLIS E. REED, Attorney General, Members of the State Banking Board I beg to hand you herewith the Twenty-Third Annual report of the Department of Banking, covering the period from October 21, 1913, to October 31, 1914. In this report will be found comparisons, tabulated summaries, computations and analysis of the banks under your supervision for the period above described, showing in summary and in detail the conditions dis - closed by reports submitted by these banks at the close of business October 31, 1914. Bim pleased to report to your honorable body that the general cmidi - i the banks of the state under your supervision is very satisfactory, rule they are coiiservati\ ely managed, and a disposition shown to / with the requirements of the banking law. There is no longer any question as to the value of a practical banking law and general supervision of banks in keeping tie state free from dis - astrous failures, such as marked the earlier period of its history. Since my last report to you there has been one failure of a state bank, the First State Savings Bank of Superior, which was taken charge of &lt;&gt;y State Bank Examiner Van Home on the 18th day of February, 1914, and placed in the hands of Receiver George M. Seetnakn on the 10th day ot March, 1914. A statement of the resources and liabilities of tlv.s bank at the date of its suspension will be found elsewhere in this report. The failure of this bank was due entirely to its too close association with an ill-managed national bank, and is the first and only one since the guaranty law into effect March 30. 1911. The first draft made on the guaranty fund, amounting to $54,526.17. together with the available funds in the bank, paid all the depositors in full. The greater portion, if not all of the amount with - drawn from the guaranty fund to pay the depositors of this bank, will likely be returned to the fund, unless the First National Bank of Superior, with which it was associated, wins its suit in the Federal court involving approx - imately J47.000.00 of the assets of the Savings bank. I wish to repeat the recommendation previously made by this Depart - ment that authority be given the State Banking Board to refuse the issuance of a charter, when after a thorough investigation, in its judgment such refusal is justified by conditions that appear to make the venture of questionable honesty of purpose, or where the people proposing the new venture are disqualified by reason of want of business experience, or where a bank is promoted for the apparent purpose of blackmailing an institu - tion already established, by disorganizing the business of the community to such an extent as to compel the other institution to buy them out at a premium. Such power should be (riven to the State Banking Board not only for the protection of the community where the proposed bank is to be established, but for the additional purpose of protecting the guaranty fund, which all the banks are arbitrarily taxed to provide. It seems only fair and reasonable that such power be given. Supervising authorities in other state above this power, and it is exercised by the Comptroller of the Currency at Washington. The usual objections that this power may be user arbitrarily and to an unreasonable degree is not borne out by the practice used r V!\!^ve r nt a 1:om n pe e tSon ' '"' "" inSta " Ce "*'" !t k " "*" </seg>
            <seg id="p004">IV FVnother recommendation that I desire to repeat is that the banking be so amended that there can be no question as to the ownership ot guaranty fund in any bank where it is deposited, and which the bank taxed to create, should such bank liquidate. The opinion of this Department is, that when a bank liquidates, this fund should belong to its stockholders and should be returned to them after the depositors are paid in full, as it was clearly created as a purely protective fund and when the depositors are paid in full the hazard to all the fund is reduced in the ratio that the fund withdrawn bears to the total fund, and no injustice is done to the persisting banks. Where the stockholders are denied this fund when a bank liquidates they are penalized unjustly to the amount held by the bank. It is different from the ordinary insurance in that it costs the beneficiary, the depositor, nothing, but the cost is paid by those fur - nishing the insurance or protection. That provision of the state banking act which limits the loans of a bank to ten times its capital and surplus, should, in the opinion of this Depart - ment be repealed. There is neither reason nor sense in such a restriction on the banks under state supervision, and where they come into competition with national banks, upon which there is no such restriction, it places them at a disadvantage which is unfair and unreasonable. Under the provisions of the state banking act a bank can only invest one-third of its capital in banking house, furniture and fixtures. This pro - vision should be amended so that at least fifty per cent of the capital could be invested in a banking house and furniture and fixtures. This restriction could probably be justified by the values existing at the time it was originally made, but conditions have changed and values have increased to such an extent that it is now unfair and unreasonable. To Your Excellency, and also the retiring members of the Board, Hon. William B. Howard, Auditor of Public Accounts, and Hon. Grant G. Martin, Attorney General, I desire to express my sincere gratitude for the uniform co-operation and assistance rendered me, and to whom is largely due what - ever success has attended the administration of this Department. To the examining, and also the office force, and to Messrs. E. E. Emmett and E. H. Mullowney, who retired from the service sometime ago to engage in the banking business, I extend my hearty thanks and appreciation of the effi - cient and faithful performance of their duties.
