If one wishes, for example, to read all of the reports on livestock feeding it will be necessary to read not only the material under 'the heading;' Livestock Feeding" but also the| reports of the various sub - stations. There are other cases of overlapping. Some work on bindweed is reported under "Agricultural Engineering" and some under "Field Crops and Weeds." Some work with poultry rations is reported under "Agricul - tural Chemistry'! in addition to that reported tinder the heading "Poultry." Such overlapping is due to the character of trie work, and cross references are used as:an aid to the reader. ' ¦... I :". The report attempts to summarize progress briefly. If a publication is available! it is cited. Publications give full details, whereas this report can only indicate the character of the work and summarize the progress. The report 'covers the calendar year 1939 so far as the experimental work is concerned. The financial report at die back covers the fiscal year which ended July 1, 1939. i &#132; ¦ Two general problems that face the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station are the problem of adjustment to conditions of drouth and the problem of adjustment to changing economic conditions. In all the various phases of the work at the Experiment Station, some attention is being given to these general problems. Progress cannot be accurately measured, but can be observed. Methods of soil management, crops and cropping practices, methods of feeding, disease and pest control, farm business and home management are continually being studied and modified. Prog - ress is being made toward greater cooperation among states and federal research agencies in experimental and research work for the betterment of our national agriculture.

S. Department of Agriculture. During the year 1939, the work started in 1938 has been continued and expanded in several respects.: The principal idea involved is to make a more efficient use of the rainfall by keeping the land covered with crop residues and culti - vating tie soil by a system of subsurface tillage. The results, particularly on uncroppejd land, have been less striking during 1939 than in 1938 as a result of a much lower rainfall which did not give normal opportunity for storage of water. The difference has been mainly in degree, however, since a] small amount of water was stored by applications of two tons of straw iper acre, whereas the bare cultivated </seg>
         <seg id="p010">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station 6 soil had practically the same amount of moisture in the fall that it hl^ ' in the spring. All of the rainfall during the season was lost throuf&gt;' ci evaporation from these plots. Where heavier mulches of -straw wA m: used (up to eight tons per acre) there was an accumulation of watl?' during the season of 5.5 inches, which was 43 pec cent of the rainfcl coming during this period. l.h The wheat yields from plots seeded in the fall of 1938 with differed crop residues and tillage treatments gave average yields as follows: 241-c bushels of wheat where the straw was left on or near the surface, 20.1 bushels where the land was basin listed, 17.2 bushels where straw wall plowed under, and 10.5 bushels where the land was plowed but no stra\f I applied. 11 The corn yields were low because of dry weather and grasshoppel damage. However, on land covered with straw in the fall and subtillecl with the straw left on the surface during the growing season, the yielcl was 26.6 bushels per acre. Where straw was applied in the fall and the lancl basin listed, the yield was 17 bushels. Where the straw was applied in the fall and plowed under, the yield was 9.6 bushels. Where there! was no straw and the land fall plowed, the yield was 6.6 bushels. Other! plots where straw has been applied between the rows, both in 1938 and! 1939, have indicated that surface protection of corn land greatly reduces! the amount of runoff and erosion and during these seasons has increased! the yield. Corn planted on land having a coating of debris, with no I seedbed preparation or cultivation except the use of a subsurface tillage I sweep, leaving much of the mulch on the surface during the entire season, I gave 18.5 bushels per acre, whereas similar land plowed and cultivated I in the ordinary manner produced 9.6 bushels per acre. From the land I having the surface residue there was no runoff and no erosion during the I season. On similar land nearby, severe erosion took place. I Special studies on the rate of intake of water by soils have been con- I tinued from last year. This intake is determined by sprinkling small plots artificially and determining the rate of runoff and intake from different rates of application. The results obtained in this work further emphasize the fact that cultivated bare soil loses very high amounts of water during applications equivalent to rainfall. Land covered with some type of debris such as straw or stubble will absorb water in quantities three to five times as great as will the bare soil. Soil protected by a rye stubble and debris amounting to only 850 pounds per acre absorbed water 4.5 times as rapidly as bare soil, and the bare soil gave 35 times as much erosion as did the land protected by the stubble and debris. Grass sod is probably the most effective method of controlling runoff and erosion from land, but where land is cultivated it appears that the maximum protection can be given by a covering of crop residue. Special studies have been conducted on the effect of mulches on the rate of evaporation. The heavier mulches used in field tests, particularly where they were undisturbed, have greatly reduced the rate of evapora - tion over a considerable period. With the lighter applications, the amount </seg>
         <seg id="p011">Fifty-third Annual Report £ evaporation has been reduced for a limited time, but where the dry weather continues 1 the soil dries out more quickly beneath the lighter mulches, particularly where there is subsurface tillage to prevent weed ;rowth. This tillage gradually covers and destroys some of the mulch. Special attention is being given to the development of field equipment hat can be used more satisfactorily in maintaining a mulch on the surface f the soil while'cultivated crops are growing. Attempts are being made :o seed small-seeded legumes and grasses beneath protective mulch cover. Publications: Effect of Soil Type, Slope and Surface Conditions on Intake of WaterJ by F. L.

Agron. 31:703-9. ; , I . : ; . : ¦¦•'¦ Commercial Fertilizers Cooperative field-plot tests of treble, superphosphate, on wheat, barley, and oats ( were carried on in seven southeastern counties and four north - central counties in 1939. As in the previous year in nearly half of the tests on wheat the phosphate increased the yield to a profitable extent (4.9 to 19.9 bushels), while the remaining tests showed smaller effects, which were therefore considered to bf unprofitable. As a result of dry weather in ktej spring, most of the tests on spring grain failed to show profitable increases in yield. -¦ \. ; ¦ • . Revegetation of Abandoned Land The succession of vegetation after abindbnment of farm lands pre - viously cultivated in Kimball county, NeWaska, was found to be broadly limited by the climatic and soil condition*, and is influenced in the first three years after abandonment by the cropping system previous to aban - donment. Beyond these three influencei the time-variation m species composition is controlled chiefly by! the changing relationships in the plants' competition for water. Annual fprbs first occupy the land, fol - lowed by annual grasses, which predominate in the third year, after which the perennial | grasses, led by western wheat grass (Agropyron smithn), increase rapidly. At 10 to 15 years nearly all of thereover is composed of the perennial grasses; the climax short grasses, buffalo grass [UucMoe dactyloides) and blue grama grass (Bouieloua gracilis), constitute 14 per cent of the total. j ¦:¦ . -¦.":.¦ , , . Grazing of native grassland allows an influx of most of the successional species -)A larger percenuge of forbs occiirred in grazed native areas than in fields abandoned 10 years or more, but the climax short-grass species made up four-fifths of the grazed nativ^ population compared to the 14 per cent on ithe 10-year field. i ' ¦•;? . _ l Lands abandoned four to six years dr more may be productive of hay and pasturage. After five years, the yield of hay often exceeds 0.75 ton per acre in moderately wet seasons. ' . </seg>

Studies on the Solubility of Soil Phosphorus A study was made on the effects of the decomposition of organic matter on the solubility and fixation of phosphorus by alkaline soils. The results of this study were published in a research bulletin: Effect o) Organic Mailer Decomposition on the Solubility and. Fixation of Phosphorus in Alkaline Soils, by H. F. Rhoades, Nebraska Agr. Exp. Sta. Res. Bui. 113, 1939 (24 pages). It was found in this study that the nitrification of urea or ammonium sulfate had no appreciable effect on the phosphorus removed from calcareous soils but caused decided increases for the noncalcareous alkaline soils. Urea accelerated the fixation of applied phosphate. Crop residues increased the soluble phosphorus in all the soils studied. In general, the increases were greater for those materials with higher phos - phorus contents. The presence of organic materials retarded the fixation of applied phosphate. The results of these studies indicate that the in - creases in soluble phosphorus due to application of crop residues and manure to alkaline soils are largely due to the phosphorus released from the organic materials and not to any increase in the solubility of the native soil phosphorus. Factors Affecting Permeability of Soils to Water The special subsoiler used to channel the soil between rows of sugar beets in 1936, 3937, and 1938 was again used in 1939, in three fields. The soil in Fields 1 and 2 was fine sandy loam. The beets in both fields were irrigated and the soil was moist at the time the subsoiler was used. No increase in yield was obtained from these fields. Field 3 was sandy clay loam and contained several slick spots. It was not pre-irrigated. The subsoiled areas yielded approximately one ton per acre more than those not subsoiled. An attempt was made to determine the rate of infiltration of water on subsoiled and nonsubsoiled areas. Water was applied at different rates at the heads of the rows and the flow of water in the rows was measured at 100-foot intervals. The data recorded are not sufficient to justify conclusions. An article entitled "Slick Spots in Nebraska," by J. W. Fitts, H. F. Rhoades, and E. S. Lyons was published in the J. Amer. Soc. Agron. 31:823-831.

It was found that the vValkley-Black method, in which no heat is used except that evolved in he mixing of concentrated sulfuric acid with an aqueous solution of dichromatc, results in *a less complete oxidation of organic matter, but the data are as closely correlated with those from the hydrogen-peroxide method as where extraneous heat is used; In a study on the relative contents of black pigment, humus, and organic matter in soils, it was found that the ammonia-soluble humus content was highest in podzol soil, foljowed in order by the gray-brown forest soils, the red and yellow soils, the chernozem, and finally the laterke. The relative pigment content and humus Icolor, excluding the surface few inches of the podzol, were greatest for thej chernozem soils, followed by the gray-brown forest soils, the laterite, and the red and yellow soils. The laterite and the red and yellow soils were fairly high in humus content but low in relative pigment' content. Publication: W. S. Gillam, "The Geographical Distribution of Soil Black Pigment," J.

Field Crops and Weeds ¦ ¦ :,.¦ " Corn Improvement ; The season of 193? marks the sixth successive year of complete or nearly complete corn failures on the Experiment Station farm at Lincoln. Drouth has been the chief limiting factor, although grasshoppers also have done serious damage. The average corn yield at the Experiment Station in 1939 was only five bushels per acre and most of the experimental tests were not harvested. Extensive performance tests of experimental single and double-crosses and certain size-of-seed studies were located, as in 1938, on a farm in Burt county, .where conditions were more favorable and yields up to 50 bushels per acre were obtained. The results indicate distinct progress in the development of superior hybrids involving new Nebraska lines. O£ the 18 official Nebraska 1939 corn variety and hybrid tests planted in the spring, nine survived the drouth and were harvested. Three of these were under irrigation in central and western Nebraska, while six were distributed over eastern Nebraska on dry land. The tests were com - prised of 30 to 50 entries including Nebraska certified hybrids, privately controlled commercial hybrids from various Corn Belt states, several experiment station hybrids from other states, a number of Nebraska Experiment Station experimental hybrids, and four to five standard open - pollinated varieties. The advantages of locally suited hybrids was well demonstrated. Considering the hybrids in general, in comparison with the varieties, the increase in yield of the hybrids averaged 17 per cent for the 10 tests, including an Experiment Station test;on bottom land in Ncmaha county. Compared with the varieties, the increased yields from </seg>
         <seg id="p014">NhBRAsKA AcRICfLTURAL EXPERIMENT STATION the !0 highest-yielding hybrids in each of the tests averaged 32 per cent tor all 10 tests. Striking differences in yield of individual hybrids stress the importance of getting acquainted with a number of hybrids and adopting those for local use on the basis of past performance. Suitable, adapted, superior hybrids have been recognized and available for the eastern fifth of Nebraska for a number of years, and also for the irrigated sections of central and western Nebraska. The use of hybrids elsewhere in the state is still in the experimental stage. Of the hybrids that are certified in Nebraska, lowa 939 has yielded 9 bushels or 22 per cent more than standard open pollinated varieties as an average for all tests during seven years. This would seem to be a sock! indication as to what may be expected from a superior hybrid over a long period. As a general principle, it should be recognized that smaller and earher-npening hybrids should be grown on dry land northward and westward in the state to offset the change in latitude and precipita - tion. To serve as a guide, later hybrids than lowa 939 should not be recommended for the North Platte Valley under irrigation, and this hybrid is definitely too late for dry land in that region. Corn growers should consider other favorable plant characters aside from yield in deciding what hybrid to plant. The use of seed picked from the commercial crop of hybrid corn is practiced by some farmers, apparently without realizing its inferiority to the first-generation seed. As an average for six years in Nebraska Experi - ment Station tests, .the first-generation crop of double-cross hybrids av - eraged 51.5 bushels per acre compared with 41 bushels for the second generation of the same hybrids. At a market price of 50 cents per bushel for corn, the difference would amount to $5.25 per acre. Since a bushel of seed will plant approximately 8 acres, the loss for each bushel of second - generation seed planted would total 84 bushels or $44.00 under these conditions. Use of second-generation seed fully offsets the advantages to be gained from hybrid corn. Further testing in the fall of 1939 of the effects of artificially drying seed ears in relation to their moisture content confirmed the results of the previous year. Drying seed ears exceeding about 40 per cent of moisture content at a temperature as high as 110" F. may completely destroy the power of germination or materially reduce the vigor of seedling develop - ment, whereas corn of lower moisture content withstands this temperature without injury. Heat endurance in the artificial drying of seed corn appears to be in inverse relation to the moisture content of the grain. Yield tests with various commercial shapes and sizes of hybrid seed corn showed no significant yield differences for large, medium, and small seed of both flat and round shapes, when planted during the usual corn - planting season. / Publications: L.

Che. 143 (mimeographed). Winter Wheat Improvement In the fall of 1938 there was sufficient moisture in the soil to allow the seeding of winter wheat at the normal time. Germination was rapid and fall growth.fairly good although not normal. Winter weather was mild and no winterkilling was noted. Lack of moisture became an important factor early in the spring and this condition continued until harvest, caus - ing short straw, rather low yields, and poor grain quality. Almost no rust developed and there was no insect damage to winter wheat at Lincoln. For a ten-year period, 1930-39, Cheyenne has the highest average yield at Lincoln while for the five-year period, 1935r39, Nebred ranks first with an average yield of 22.5 bushels compared with 21.2 bushels for Cheyenne. Nebred was grown on farms for the first time; from many observations it seems that the variety is not highly tolerant to hot, dry weather in the spring and early summer. Because Nebred was subjected to such condi - tions in southeastern Nebraska it did not yield well there, but farther west in the state it did much better. It is probable that the variety will have a place oh Nebraska farms because of resistance to bunt and ability to outyield Cheyenne under rust conditions. The winter wheat breeding nursery was seeded on fallow in the fall of 1938 in an attempt to obtain better growth. Straw was heavy but there was not enough moisture available to finish the crop. Observations were obtained on the reaction of; varieties and strains'to heat and. drouth. A number of selections of Oro x Tenmarq, Kawvale x Tenmarq, Black - hull x Cheyenne, and Tenmarq x Cheyenne showed considerable promise. As a group the Hope x Cheyenne and Hope x Nebraska No. 1069 selec - tions seemed to be injured by drouth more than other varieties, although one or two were outstanding. Considerable effort is being centered on developing a rust-resistant winter wheat for Nebraska. Since the Hope hybrids are not promising to be entirely satisfactory other parents are being used in crosses. The improvement work on winter wheat and other small grains is cooperative with the Division of Cereal Crops and Diseases, U. S. Depart - ment of Agriculture. ' I . Publications: T. A.

Time of Planting Winter Wheat Seven years of planting three varieties of winter wheat at six dates in tilt fall, ranging from early to late, have been completed at Lincoln. As an average for this period the maximum yield of grain was obtained from planting September 23, although the yield was only 0.8 bushel less with delay until the Hessian-fly-safe date, September .50. Yields have been gradually lower with delay after September 23 to little over half a crop for October 22 as shown in the following data: Planting Sept. 16, 21.8 bushels; Sept. 23, 23.7 bushels: Sept. 30, 22.9 bushels; Oct. 8, 19.9 bushels; Oct. 15, 16.5 bushels: Oct. 22, 12.5 bushels. In earlier years when the Hessian fly was prevalent, planting September 30 gave the best results. Adhering rather closely to the fly-safe date which is announced each year by the Station entomologist appears to be sound practice. The most severe shortage of surface and subsoil moisture on record prevailed in the fall of 1939 throughout most of the state, and as a result much of the seed planted had failed to germinate by January 1. Based on vernalization studies and 13 years of planting Turkey wheat throughout the fall, winter, and early spring, the conclusion has been reached that one-third of a crop is possible in eastern Nebraska following such delayed germination provided the seed germinates by about February 15 and moisture conditions thereafter are favorable. If germination is delayed till after March 20, the wheat plants usually fail to joint and head normally. Planted seed frequently germinates in the field during warm periods in January or February as the minimum temperature range for sprouting is U to 3H F. The resultant crop is likely to ripen 10 days to two weeks lattr than a normal crop and therefore is more subject to heat, drouth, and rust damage. Less loss normally results from delayed germination in western Nebraska. Manner of Planting Winter Wheat Several practices in connection with the seeding of winter wheat have been tested over the past seven-year period. Averaging the results, the following comparisons are available. Surface drilling 5 pecks per acre with rows 7 inches apart yielded 27.6 bushels per acre, while furrow drilling "5 pecks per acre with the rows 14 inches apart yielded 23.9 bushels. Corresponding surface drilling with the rows 14 inches apart yielded 25 bushels. Thus, standard surface drilling would appear ad - vantageous under average conditions, at least in eastern Nebraska. Drilling &lt;eed .it the rates of 3, 4, 5, and 6 pecks per acre during this seven-year period averaged, respectively, 25.8, 27.2, 27.6, and 27.6 bushels per acre. During the last eight years grading and planting the large heavy seed gave a yield of 24.4 bushels compared with 23.7 bushels for seed planted as threshed without grading. </seg>
         <seg id="p017">Fifty-third Annual Report .... Seed Treatment of Winter Wheat for Stinking Smut As an average for nine years, in which six degrees of smut infection were compared annually, the high negative correlation 0f—.919±.014 was found between the relative grain yields and percentages of smutted heads. When the growing crop/contained 1.1, 10.4, 17.5, 25.7, 36.0, and 43.4 per cent of smutted heads, respectively, the corresponding grain yields were 26.9, 24.4, 22.7, 21.2, 19.5, and 17.0 bushels per acre. Of various fungicides tested for three to eight years, copper carbonate and New Improved Ceresan dust treatments applied by standard procedure proved most practical and are highly effective in control of this smut without causing'seed injury. A solution of 1 pint formalin to 40 gallons of water, applied by either immersion or sprinkling, gave effective control but caused sufficient seed injury to lower the grain yield significantly. Re - moval of the smut balls from the seed by means of a fanning mill in connection with the seed-treatment program during four years materially lowered the percentage of smutted heads found in the ensuing crop and accordingly increased the grain yield; Deep planting of heavily smutted seed increased the smut in the resultant crop by 40 per cent and lowered the grain yield 38 per cent, as compared with shallow planting; This result is attributed to the temperature of the soil being more favorable for the smut development at the greater depth. Results have been published as follows: T. A. Kiesselbach andW.iE. Lyness, The Effects of Stinging Smut (Bunt) and Seed Treatment upon the Yield of Winter Wheat, Nebr. Agr.Exp.Sta.Res. Bui. 110,22 pages. ¦'&#132;/ . : j . • Varieties of Oats ; . The yields of the oat varieties grown in plots were less than half those obtained in 1938, for the most part the result of dry weather. The highest yields were recorded for Fulton, Marion, and Columbia. Fulton is a new hybrid recently released in Kansas, and in all Nebraska tests in 1939 made a^very good showing. Burt 518, Brunker, and Trojan yielded slightly lower than Fulton. For the five-year period 1935-39, Brunker, Columbia, Burt 518, and Trojan have the highest average yields. Brunker is thought to have straw that is a little too weak for eastern Nebraska but other than that is a good variety. A supply of pure seed of Burt 518 is being increased and will probably be released in 1941. Nursery work with oats was almost a failure in 1939 because of dry weather; Few data were recorded and in some cases it was difficult to harvest sufficient seed to carry on the lines. Some information was obtained on the smut and rust reaction of many of the strains. Improvement work is. cooperative with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. . j ¦.' : 1 .;¦¦'.

         <seg id="p018">Nebraska Acriclltlral Experiment Station furrow drilling in 14-inch rows yielded 28.] bushels or 1.5 bushels less. Corresponding surface drilling in 14-inch rows yielded 263 bushels. Broadcasting on double-disked ground at 10 pecks per acre averaged 26.4 bushels compared with 29.6 bushels for drilling. Plowing cornstalk ground followed by single disking and drilling yielded 29.9 bushels compared with 29.6 bushels for double disking without plowing. These results with spring grain indicate that the less expensive seedbed preparation without plowing is most profitable under these conditions. Time of Planting Spring Grains During the past three years barley and several varieties of oats have been planted annually at four dates in the spring, ranging from early to late. The yields have been as follows: Spartan barley: planted March 20, 34.4 bushels; March 30. 33.0 bushels; April 10, 31.7 bushels; April 20, 23.2 bushels, logold oats (spring type): March 20, 43.9 bushels; March 30, 41.9 bushels; April 10, 37.2 bushels; April 20, 27.2 bushels. Burt oats (spring type): March 20, 42.4 bushels; March 30, 43.4 bushels; April 10, 41.0 bushels; and April 20, 35.7 bushels. Fulghum oats (winter type): March 20. 423 bushels; March 30, 39.3 bushels; April 10, 26.6 bushels; April 20, 15.9 bushels. The advantage of early seeding with both barley and oats is apparent. Fulghum yielded nearly as well as the spring type, Burt and logold, when seeded very early but its yields decreased much more rapidly with delayed seeding. This relationship had been estab - lished in earlier tests with Kanota representing the winter type. Barley Varieties The yields of the barley varieties were about one-third as large as those obtained in 1938. The drouth caused the straw to be very short, in many cases making harvesting rather difficult. In addition grasshoppers caused considerable damage to the late varieties. Yields ranged from 16.2 to 3.7 bushels per acre. The varieties having the highest yields in 1939 were Lico (a new strain from Colorado), Spartan, and Flynn. The so-called malting types, Wisconsin Pedigree Nos. 38 and 37, yielded about half as much as the better sorts. The later types, such as Glabron and Manchuria, gave relatively very poor yields. Based on long-time records Flynn and Spartan are the best-yielding varieties for Lincoln. Other high-yielding strains are Trebi and North Platte No. 1. For a shorter period Club Mariout has given a good average yield. The barley nursery was very poor. A few composite hybrid selec - tions and some strains of Atlas x Vaughn showed to the best advantage. Some of these may prove to have promise for growing in Nebraska. Barley improvement work is cooperative with the U. S. Department of Agricul - ture.

Plowing cornstalk ground, followed by single disk - ing and drilling, yielded 22.1 bushels compared with 23.3 bushels for double disking without plowing. -j. ; ' Spring Wheat Like other spring grains, spring wheat was very poor, as a result of late seeding, lack of moisture, and grasshopper damage. The tallest variety averaged only 29 inches in height, while Thatcher and Reward averaged 20 inches. Test weights ranged from 58 pounds per bushel down. The highest-yielding varieties were Pilot* Reward, and Kearney (Java). Thatcher and Geres yielded less than these. For the last four years Kearney &lt;Java), Mindum (durum), Thatcheiy Ceres, Pilot, and Reward have given the highest average yields. On the Box Butte experimental farm at Alliance, Komar, Ceres, and Thatcher have the best yield records. Some of the new varieties from northern spring-wheat states that are being tested are Pilot; Rival, MeriCarid Premier., All are selections from hybrids having different'parents and combine resistance to bunt or stinking smut and rust. It is hoped that one of these will prove to be adapted in Nebraska and can be recommended in place of Ceres and Thatcher. Kearney (Java) has been crossed with Hope to combine rust resistance and yielding ability. In the rust nursery the fourth generation of the cross was grown and some selected lines seem to have resistance to both leaf and stem rust, and to be better adapted to Nebraska than is| Hope.

During 1939, the first year these five viere planted for seed increase, a substantial amount of seed was obtained. Final cold and wilt resistance tests are being made on these five strains with a view to compositing those which meet certain standards. All five are rather similar in adaptation and it is thought that compositing will give a broader genetic base for a new variety. There will also then be a larger amount of seed with which to start increasing the new variety. Since there is great need for such a new variety in the Corn Belt states, </seg>

During the past year seed yields were obtained on over 10,000 individ - ual plants in the alfalfa hybrid nurseries. The results indicate that hybrid v ijjor is beinj: manifested in seed productivity as well as in previously re - jwtcd forage production. From this large group of plants individuals have Keen isolated which produce, respectively, black, brown, green, and white seeds as compared to the yellowish-green color ordinarily found. f-urther studies are being made of the seed color, flower color, and other character!, which may lie of value in breeding or for use as "markers" on new varieties. In the summer of IWJ an unusually good opportunity was afforded to study seed-setting in a number of the commercial alfalfa seed-producing areas. These observations supplemented detailed data from the alfalfa breeding nursery located at the Scottsbluff Field Station, Mitchell, Ne - braska. The primary purpose of these field observations was to determine whether alfalfa flowers require tripping before they set seed. It was found that rarely do flowers set seed without tripping, and in addition it is neces - sary to have the flowers tripped by insects, chieOy the Megachilc sp. Thus indications are that more emphasis should be laid on the tripping phase in seed-setting investigations and on the possibility of beneficial insect activ - ity in fields which are to be left for seed. Hybridization with the so-called "spreading" or pasture-type alfalfa plants has continued with promise of a favorable outcome, but at present there are no seed stocks of this type available for distribution. Additional information on cold resistance of Argentine alfalfas has !&gt;een obtained by means of artificially controlled cold tests. These cor - roborate the results reported in the Fifty-second Annual Report in which all lots proved to he considerably inferior to Grimm and Hardistan in their ability to withstand cold. During the year all of the experimental data on alfalfa obtained in Nebraska for the past 20 years has been summarized for publication in a Nebraska bulletin. The results bear out former conclusions that alfalfa seed from the southern states and most foreign countries is unadapted for Nebraska conditions. The strains or varieties which proved best over this period were Hardistan, Ladak, Grimm, Cossack, Baltic, and Nebraska and other northern Commons. In years when severe winters were not encoun - tered Kansas and Utah Common proved to be high-yielding varieties. Publications during the year 1939: H. M. Tysdal and T. A.

Fifty-third Annual Report Permanent Pastures and Native Meadows This work is cooperative with the Division of Forage Crops and Diseases, ijnited States Department of Agriculture. Selection and progeny testing of grass species and strains is being continued. For this purpose, approximately 25,000 seedlings of 10 species, including bromegrass, blue - grass, switchgrass, side-oats grama, big bluestem, and buffalo grass were transplanted during the spring months. On older stands of seeded and transplanted plants, seed was harvested for continuation of the more prom - ising individual selections, and for continuation of strains through mass selection. JA wide variation in seed yields was found in selections of crested wheatgrass, bromegrass, side-oats grama, and switchgrass. Specimens of a number| of the more prevalent rusts, smuts, foot rots, ergot, and other diseases have been collected for identification from these older stands. Most of these have now been identified by state and federal pathologists. An attempt at evaluating the seriousness of these diseases on forage grasses is being undertaken. -'-','; ' ¦- More intensive breeding work was conducted with two-year-old spaced plants of bromegrass. Approximately 230 superior individuals were selected out of a' total population of over 7,000. These plants were selected for superior] forage and seed production and for freedom from disease. (The chief disease on bromegrass this year was characterized by a blackening of. stems add pedicels, causing the failing off of spikelets and a lowering of seed production. It has been identified as being caused by a bacterium, Bacterhlm coronafaciens atropurpureum.) : The plants represented four major plant types and were selected from 50 of the 150 selections and seed sourcesjfrom which the populationfwas derived. Within 38 of these lines, attempts to secure selfed and closebred (sibbed) seed were made by _. en - closing) panicles in long vegetable; parchment sleeves supported by light stakes and plugged at each end with cotton. At the time of pollination, pollen from sister plants was introduced into some of the sleeves. A com - parison of seed set per panicle on enclosed selfed panicles, with seed set on enclosed sibbed panicles and on open-pollinated panicles of the same plant, has been made. f ¦••";¦ A {wide variation in seed setting was found between individual plants both outside and inside the sleeves. Many plants set no seed from their own pollen but in most cases seed setting was increased with sibbing. A few individuals set a large number of seed per selfed or sibbed panicle, approaching the number set with open pollination. The average seed set - ting from five or more panicles varied with selfing from no seed to 78 seeds per panicle, and in open pollination from no seed to 254 seeds per panicle. The data indicate that the bromegrass population is made up of individuals varying widely in degree of self-fertility.

Of the 13 introduced and native grasses which were seeded during the spring of 1938 at Lincoln for the purpose of obtaining forage yields, eight survived the drouth of 1938, so that yields could be obtained during 1939. Forage yields were obtained under conditions of harvesting which sim - ulated grazing conditions. Hay yields were also obtained which corres - pond closely to those simulating grazing conditions. The range studies of a typical area of sandhill grazing lands in Cherry county were continued. These studies were extended to typical "hardland" grazing lands of northern Cherry county. The chief emphasis was placed upon determining the productivity and palatability ratings of the more important forage species. Other work included a study of the grazing habits of cattle, the determination of the density of the vegetation, and the derivation of a more accurate and applicable method of measuring the carrying capacity in animal units of range lands.

Where sweet clover was sown without a companion crop better stands were main - tained when the plantings were clipped about 6 inches high for the control of weeds whenever the weed growth exceeded 12 inches. In grazing tests, cattle have shown preference for early first-season fine - stemmed varieties of sweet clover, which in 1939 were eaten closely to the ground before any intensive grazing of the coarser-stemmed varieties to which the] catde also had access took place. The same preferences were observed in eariy. second-year growth, when fine-stemmed types were grazed tola height of about 4 inches, and coarse-stemmed types to a height of about. 6 inches. To what degree these preferences were due to fineness of stem or to the amounts of coumarin present in the plants must be determined from more comprehensive tests.

         <seg id="p024">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station- Grain and Forage Sorghums While a satisfactory early growth was produced in 1939 by most of the sorghums, the absence of good fall rains lowered their yields appre - ciably. The grain yields from varieties in the main yield test ranged from 5.7 to 24.5 bushels per acre. Chinch-bug injury and the late summer drouth caused considerable lodging in many of the sorghum varieties. In cooperation with the Agricultural Extension Service, county farm bureaus, and farmers, yield data were secured from 46 outlying variety tests. As an average of these tests, Early Kalo yielded 22.9, Sooner 21.6, Day 19.7, and Colby 17.5 bushels of grain per acre. Complete dala arc reported in Extension Circular 144, listed below. To supplement a smaller test, which has been conducted for three years, a comprehensive date-of-seeding experiment was established in 1939. Four varieties were seeded at 10-day intervals, beginning April 15 and ending August 3. Yields were increased with delay in planting until after May 25, when chinrh-bugs became a factor. Susceptible varieties seeded later than May 25 were severely damaged by chinch-bugs but when seeded before that date they escaped injury and were able to produce a crop. Data from the spacing test indicate that there may be considerable stand variation without materially affecting grain yields. During a three - year period, the average grain yields of Early Kalo from spacings of 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, and 18 inches between plants in 42-inch rows have been 20.9, 22.0, 21.9, 22.3, 20.0, and 17.9 bushels per acre, respectively. In seasons of severe drouth, the closer spacings have given definitely lower grain yields. Forage yields have been greatest from the close spacings. One hundred eleven introduced varieties and strains were grown in nursery rows for observation. In addition, 25 samples sent in by farmers and agricultural agents were grown for identification. In the breeding nursery there were 99 selections in the fifth genera - tion and these lines are now sufficiently homozygous to be entered in performance tests. To permit the determination of lines resistant to sor - ghum root rot, they are all being subjected to infection with Pythium arrhenomanes in the greenhouse. Three hundred thirty-nine rows o{ material in the third generation were grown and a number of selections were made for advancement to the fourth generation. Publications during the year 1939: R. L.

Drouth affected all of these crops very adversely and grass - hoppers also did serious damage to the soybeans and torn. In cooperation with the (Agricultural Extension Service, county agricultural agents, and fanners, tests of seven varieties of soybeans were planted in 12 localities in eastern' Nebraska. Because of unfavorable conditions the crops in seven of these tests were essentially failures and yields were determined for only five J localities. The best variety, in the most productive test yielded 15 bushels per acre compared with 65 bushels for corn under the same conditions. ,i» .:";.- It has been officially estimated that 15,000 acres of soybeans were planted in Nebraska in 1939. Only a small portion of these were harvested and threshed as a grain crop. This acreage is double that of any previous year and reflects a growing- interest in the crop. During II years since 1922, annual forage yield comparisons are avail - able for|soybeans, alfalfa, and sorgo on the Experiment Station Farm. As an average for all years the respective yields of these three crops were 132,2.23, and 4.63 tons per acre (15 per cent moisture basis). For [satisfactory weed control, soybeans normally require more field labor tfjan any of the standard cereal crops. In eastern Nebraska the use of cultivated rows spaced about 36 inches apart with the seed dropped 114 to 2 inches apart in the row is recommended. Thorough seedbed preparation designed to kill several crops of weeds before planting, fol - lowed by well planned tillage to prevent weed growth, is important. Publication during the year 1939: T. A.

         <seg id="p026">.\hBR.\SK\ AcRK.I LTIRAL EXPERIMENT STATION Clean cultivation proved to be the most reliable and economical method of eradication where cultivation was feasible. Frequency-of-cultivation -&#132; tests indicated that it is not necessary to cultivate immediately after j emergence of new top growth but that more efficient results are obtained / when the plants are allowed to make several days' growth. Cultivation 8 I days after each emergence was the most effective interval tested. Root reserve studies have shown the reason for the increased efficiency of the delayed-cullivation method. It was found that reserve foods, chiefly sugars and starches, decrease rapidly from 6 to 10 days after emergence of new growth, leaving the plants in a more weakened condition than at first ( emergence. Cultivation treatments started in May or June proved to be more effective than those started after July 1. The lack of sufficient soil moisture to promote normal emergence of bindweed after harvest resulted in little root exhaustion when cultivation was started after removal of a small-grain crop. Experiments with so-called "smother" or competitive crops such as alfalfa, liromegrass, cane, and Sudan grass indicated that these crops alone cannot be expected to eradicate well established stands of bindweed. However, these crops may be used to weaken or hold the bindweed in check until such time as the cultivation program may be started. The use of winter wheat or rye in combination with clean cultivation was effective. This method prolonged the eradication program but pro - vided a cash crop in alternate years and is probably suitable for handling extensive infestations. Such an alternate crop-fallow method resulted in 97 per cent reduction of the bindweed stand in three years and complete eradication in some cases in four years. During the same four-year period a continuous crop-fallow system with cultivation only between harvest and seeding time decreased the stand of bindweed about 50 per cent. In 1939 a study was begun to determine the most effective follow-up treatment for control of seedlings after eradication of the old stand had been accomplished by cultivation. Experiments relating to the use of sodium chlorate were concerned primarily with methods, rates, and dates of application. Dry applications of sodium chlorate at the rate of 3 to 4 pounds per square rod during September or October gave the best results. Spray treatments were only slightly less effective but involved more danger from fire. Broadcasting the chlorate on the surface without previous or subsequent tillage was the most effective method of application. For maximum effectiveness the treated area must remain undisturbed during the following year. Disking rhe land lightly to work the chlorate into the soil was found to be advantageous in reducing loss of chlorate on rolling land. Dry chlorate spreaders proved to be more suitable for distributing the chemical than ordinary grain drills. Experiments show that it is seldom possible to get complete eradica - tion with a single application of chlorate regardless of the quantity used; therefore a moderate initial dosage followed by individual treatments of </seg>

Potassium chlorate, j sodium thiocyanate, "pentox," acid arsenicals, and "chemi-cote" were | tested but were found to be inadequate. Carbon bisulphide was effective but too expensive except for very small areas. . ; . Horticultural Crops ; . •¦ ¦ ; Orchard Culture ' Production and growth records are being continued. In spite of the ) removal of filler trees at Union the permanent varieties in this section of the orchard present a less desirable appearance than those in the section where no fillers had been used. This again emphasizes the undesirability of close planting. Mulching continues to be a satisfactory method of ' influencing fruit size. As in 1938 dropping seemed to be increased some - what by the mulch treatment. . ' Sioil samples from the mulched and cultivated blocks in the vineyard reveal a further reduction in the reserve of subsoil (moisture. While the change in the mulched area was somewhat, greater than in the cultivated one, the average moisture content of the upper 30 feet is 23.2 and 16.3 per cent respectively, as compared with 24.7 and 16.7 per cent a year ago. In . the mulched soil changes in moisture content were confined largely to the upper five feet but in the cultivated block the loss occurred mainly from the 20-25 foot level. . : •.".":'".¦ Supplemental Water for Orchards in Eastern Nebraska During the 1939 pumping season—March I to December 30—approxi - mately 625 acre inches of water was pumped for use on the Union orchard. Studies of moisture storage encourage the conclusion that in seasons having a rainfall of 30 inches or more and without abnormal temperatures . or prolonged drouths, there may be sufficient moisture available to supply the needs of the tree if none is lost by runoff. It is of interest to note that moisture withdrawal was more or.less general throughout 30 feet of soil. Fruit size was again compared for a few varieties when grown with and without irrigation. Extensive comparisons were not made, however, because of rather severe early-season hail damage and also because of the very! heavy drop of the early winter varieties.

Control trees in the home orchard were not sprayed with a tungicide of any kind. The number of lesions on the control plots indicates that 1939 was not a severe scab year. The second treatment ranked first in efficiency, fol - lowed by the fourth, third, first, and fifth. The difference in efficiency of the five treatments is apparent but not appreciable. This experiment will Ik- continued for several additional seasons. Fruit Stocks Growth and yield data of the previously planted trees on known root stocks have been collected. Planting at both Union and Lincoln has in - cluded trees ol Virginia Crab which are to be top-worked to various com - mercial sorts and next spring Hibernal will be added as another sort to use as body stock to get away from winter injury in the crotches. Several years will be required to complete this part of the study. A study of the trees during the past season shows that the Whitney Crab is not a desirable root stock. Nutrition of the Potato Plant Production of blossoms by potato varieties, inbreds, and hybrids as influenced by intensity of light, length of photoperiod, and nutrition was continued. All studies are carried on with daytime temperatures below n F. and night temperatures between 55° and 65° F. During the year a machine was built wherein plants may be subjected to any desired temperature at several wind velocities, at different relative humidity percentages and in darkness or in light of various intensities. Uniform conditions for every plant are secured by moving the plants con - tinuously through the heat chamber by means of a track around which the plants are drawn by a slowly moving chain. Attempts have been made to study variety differences in capacity to remove water from the soil by determination of soil moisture from replicated blocks of five varieties planted in western Nebraska on dry land. Further work is needed. An effort is also being made to find a relatively simple method for determining differences in metabolic efficiency or different strains or varieties of potatoes.

In J' addition about 450 lines from the 1938 seedling plat were grown in 10-hill ¦•f plats at Scottsbluff and 150 lines from previous selections and breeding t stocks from other breeders. Some of these were grown at Alliance on ( dry land and also were tested under hot-weather conditions at North Platte and Lincoln. Exceptional opportunity for determining heat-resistance qualifies, was'available'in western Nebraska where highest temperatures ' on record occurred in early July. Some very heat-resistant lines and fami - lies have been found. As there was less than a half-inch of effective rain - fall all season at Alliance after potatoes were planted, it was possible to / determine the ability of varieties and selections to produce tubers on mois - f cure stored, in fallowed land.

In the spring of 1939, 100 lines were tested in the heat machine and great) differences in endurance were found. Observations in western Ne - braska during the heat wave in early July warrant the conclusion that there! is, a close correlation between the performance of a line in the heat macljine and under severe conditions in the field. Cooking tests indicate that good general cooking quality is rather closely correlated with high specific gravity. \ Extensive tests during the year indicate that of the new introductions the Mesaba is a very desirable early white variety with good cooking quality. The Red Warba is the best red variety for our hotter regions but the Earlaine is generally a low yielder and the Pontiac is not recommended because of its tendency to produce tubers of poor type and poor cooking quality.

Vegetable Experiments Carrots.—The first generations from roots of high and low specific gravity were grown in 1939. A high percentage of plants of these inbred lines were discarded because of being annual bloomers. Data do not permit conclusions concerning the inheritance of roots with regard to specific gravity. • Sweetcorn.—Replicated tests of 25 white sweetcorn hybrids were grown at Scottsbluff and Lincoln and an additional 50 hybrids of yellow sweet - corn were grown for observation. Most hybrids tested yielded more than the open-pollinated varieties. Heat-endurance tests made in the heat-testing machine revealed great differences in various hybrids. Tomatoes.—Comprehensive replicated tests of 10 distinct types of tomatoes were grown with and without irrigation and straw mulching at Lincoln, with and without irrigation at North Platte, and on a flat sandy and a sloping gravel soil in Scottsbluff county, for the purpose of determin - ing the most suitable type of tomato plant for the various conditions en - countered. The compilation of data has not yet been completed but partial calculations indicate that variety recommendations must be made on the basis of the adaptation of vine type to the physiological environment.

Scab resistance tests were conducted on a severely infested soil at Mitchell and resistance to spindle tuber has been tested in the field at Lincoln. Tests of domestic and foreign commercial varieties have revealed one or two varieties that have promise as breeding parents for resistance to wilt. A number of them were resistant to scab. Inbred and hybrid seedlings selected for desirable horticultural characters have been tested and a few exhibit more resistance to wilt than the commonly grown commercial varieties. A large number of first-year hybrid seedlings of parents showing some resist - ance to wilt are being tested in the greenhouse.

New Disease Problems A bacterial disease of potatoes known as ring rot was found for the first time this year. This disease has been reported as causing serious losses in states previously reporting it. A careful survey of the seed stocks in Nebraska showed it to be present in a iew lots of seed in western Nebraska and jit was also found in out-of-state seed on the market in eastern and central Nebraska. The results of this survey have been published as follows: "A Survey of Bacterial Wilt and Ring Rot of Potatoes in Nebraska in the Spring of 1939," Plant Disease Reporter, 23:288-90, by R. W.

A study has been made of the symptoms , and of microscopic methods for quick identification, so that a more accurate y diagnosis can be made in the field. &#132; A disease of potatoes appearing as a dry rot of the underground stem ;i of the plant resulting in a wilt has been found to be due to a strain of .' Fusarium solani which has not previously been known to affect growing ¦ plants. The results of this investigation are being published as follows: R. W. Goss, "A Dry Rot of Potato Stems Caused by Fusarium solani" Phytopathology 30:160-65. An investigation oi the cause and control of a disease of potatoes known I as "hay wire" has been started during the past summer and is being con - tinued in cooperation with the Nebraska Certified Potato Growers. A disease of pines, caused by Sphaeropsis cllisii, has been discovered for the first time in Nebraska and was reported by F. R. Lancaster in the Plant Disease Reporter, 23:126, with the title, "Pine Tip Die-Back in Nebraska." Chemical Studies With Plant Materials Studies of Flour and Baking Quality Factors A method has been developed whereby the gluten and starch which have been washed from flour may be recombined to form doughs with baking characteristics similar to those of the original flour doughs. This affords a basis for the study of differences in the individual constituents of flour and for a study of the effect of these differences on baking be - havior. It has been shown that variations in the properties of the starches have considerable influence on baking properties. Publication: "Starch in Relation to Some Baking Properties of Flour" by R. M. Sandstedt, C. E. Jolitz, and M. J. Blish, Cereal Chem. 16:780-92. In testing the baking properties of wheat varieties, it is highly desirable to be able to test all varieties on an equal protein basis since protein content is largely determined by climatic factors. Accordingly work is now in progress on the development of methods for making baking tests and "recording dough mixer" curves on flours diluted with starch to a definite protein basis. A modified Wohlgemuth method for estimating alpha-amylase activity in malted grains was developed and a report has been published: "A Standardized Wohlgemuth Procedure for Alpha-Amylase Activity," by R. M. Sandstedt, Eric Kneen, and M. ]. Blish, Cereal Chem. 16:712-23. A paper is now in preparation in which a method for the determination of beta-amylase will be given. The above-mentioned alpha-amylase method is not applicable to the estimation of the exceedingly small quantities of alpha-amylase which occur in some ungerminated cereals; accordingly another method has been developed for this purpose and a description of it will soon be prepared for publication. </seg>
         <seg id="p033">Fifty-third Annual Report A study was made of the effect of varying sugar levels on loaf character - istics in laboratory baking. It was found that a positive volume response was effected in the high sugar levels when doughs were proofed to stan - dard time; but this effect was minimized when the proofing was to constant height. This led to the recommendation that in laboratory baking doughs be proofed to a standard height and that relatively high sugar levels be used.

Physico-Chemical Studies on the Nature of Cold Resistance in Crop Plants ,'•'¦'"¦'".' The influence of nutrients on hardening and cold resistance is one phase of the project. In sand-culture experiments die addition of manga - nese sulphate (within certain limits) to an adequate nutrient solution increased the ability of winter wheat seedlings to; develop cold resistance when hardened. Likewise with winter wheat seedlings calcium nitrate as the sole source of nitrogen proved greatly superior to ammonium sul - phate in producing plants with enhanced ability to develop cold resistance. Experiments with young tomato plants under controlled nutrition demon - strated the extreme variability in cold resistance of this type of material andj as yet have given rather indefinite results. • Another phase is the influence of carbohydrate storage and reserves on hardening and cold resistance. Using the methods of analysis previ - ously established 30 varieties of winter wheat have been studied. Dry matter and sugar analyses have been made after various periods of low- : temperature hardening and high-temperature dehardening. Compilation and| analysis of data are as yet incomplete but it may be 1 stated that this method of treatment seems to provide a means for differentiation of wheat varieties as regards winterhardiness. '•'.' . : :-, Studies have been conducted on methods of propagation and testing for cold resistance of several South American Solanaceae introductions. It was found that controlled freezing technique, provides a means for differ - entiation on the basis of cold resistance. Attempts to apply controlled freezing technique to the selection of cold-resistant lines of tomato plants so j far have not proved successful. Preliminary experiments indicate that stqrage conditions and stage of maturity markedly influence the cold resistance of potato tubers. Further investigations dealing with this subject are jin progress. ' &gt;¦" ; Preliminary, investigations with year-old transplant stock of Honey Locust and Black Locust indicated wide differences in cold resistance and in resistance to breaking dormancy. Root analyses were carried out for dry matter, crude fat, protein, sugars, starch, and hemicellulose. Cold resistance was' found to be correlated with dry matter and sugar content. The investigation has been expanded to include sixspecies, three of these being from two locations. Tlje work is progressing favorably and so far is con - firmatory of the preliminary data.

         <seg id="p034">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station The study of defoliation was continued for the third year, and again ¦ there was a direct relation between the amount of defoliation and killing, j The practical application of this problem has to do with pasturing of i winter wheat. '\ In general, plants from bunted seed were less winterhardy than plants ¦' of the same variety grown from clean seed. In order to vary bunt infec- ¦ tion the wheat seed was germinated at s°, 10°, 15°, and 20° C. The ¦ heaviest bunt infections were obtained al 10°, and 15° C. Of wheats seeded September 15, October 1 and 15, and November 1, the earliest and the latest dates killed the worst when exposed to low I temperatures. This suggests that wheat seeded about October 1 at Lin - coln is best able to withstand winter temperatures. Five varieties of wheat were seeded at seven stations (Lincoln, Nebr.; Hays. Kansas; Akron, Colorado; Alliance, Nebr.; Moccasin, Mont.; Ed - monton, Alberta, and Lethbridge, Alberta) from seed grown at a single station the previous year. The crop harvested in 1938, after growing one year at each station, was used for this study. The object was to determine whether seed from these different stations would produce plants differing in cold resistance. The study has been under way only one year and no definite statements can be made as yet. The varieties of winter barley grown in a uniform hardiness nursery throughout the United States were subjected to low temperatures. It was found that those varieties known to be hardy in the field also proved to be hardy under controlled freezing. Again a number of hybrid lines were frozen to eliminate tender plants. The surviving plants were saved and grown to maturity. In this way it should be possible to hasten the selection of material carrying more hardi - ness. The method is being used especially for winter x spring hybrids, where the spring types are not wanted. The studies of true stocks and the controlled freezing studies are cooperative with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Insects, Rodents, and Birds Control of Major Field Crop and Other Injurious Insect Pests The Nebraska winter wheat crops of the five seasons from 1933-34 to 1937-38 had practically no important commercial damage by the Hessian fly. During the drouthy summer of 1934 this insect reached the lowest population level on record in this state. Surveys made in June of 1935 to 1938 showed an average of only 0.2, 0.3, 1.0 and 0.3 per cent, respec - tively, of the wheat stems to be infested with the fly over eastern and southern Nebraska. In the fall of 1938, however, the Hessian fly showed a marked increase, due to not only a normal increase through the main fall brood but also through an extra, or supplementary, fall brood in October. This increase continued moderately in the spring of 1939, so that at places in southeastern Nebraska, especially in the lowlands along the </seg>
         <seg id="p035">I Fimr-THiRD Annual Report .!•'•¦ ¦'¦.' ' ¦' .'¦¦'¦ ¦..-'.. ¦'' ' - !i Missouri River, the Hessian fly population level appeared to be approach - ing the danger point. But the recurrence of the drouth in the fall of 1939 had a very unfavorable effect on this pest, and a survey made in Septem - ¦J ber showed that many of the fly puparia had been killed outright through i desiccation, while in several localities natural control by parasites had '. been extensive and important. Under these conditions, no additional studies on the biology and control of the Hessian fly were made in 1939. Chinch bugs survived the winter of 1938-39 well, and, owing to the 1 ideal weather early in 1939 for prolonging the egg-laying and extending the hatching period, there was a tremendous increase in the chinch bug population in the summer of 1939, especially in the southeastern counties | of the state. At least some commercial damage was reported from Richard - . son[ Nemaha, Pawnee, Johnson, Otoe, Cass, Sarpy, Douglas, Washington I and Lancaster counties, between June 8 and August 17. During Septem - ber! and October of 1939 there were exceedingly heavy fall flights of adult !-. chinch bugs all over southeastern Nebraska. After the bugs had entered their wintering quarters in the bunch-grasses, a survey was made in cooperation with the Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine of the U. |S. Department of Agriculture. This survey revealed severe infestations in Richardson, Nemaha, Pawnee, Johnson, Otoe, Cass, Sarpy, Douglas, Lancaster, Gage, and Jefferson counties, heavy infestations in Washington, Dodge, Saunders, Butler, Polk, and Saline counties, moderate infestations in Seward, Burt, Cuming, and Dakota counties, and light infestations in Thayer, Fillmore, York, arid Thurston counties. In the counties to the west of these mentioned, the average infestation was normal or nearly so. The outlook is for very serious chinch bug damage to susceptible crops -. •in [1940 in the counties mentioned, which will enable.and necessitate a resumption of the studies of chinch bug barriers that had to be suspended in 1935 because of a reduced chinch bug population in the state. • ¦ Grasshopper Control ; . ; NN . The experiments on grasshopper control carried on during the summer of 1939 were, unlike in previous seasons, primarily directed toward the tesing out of a number of materials that it was expected might add to poisoned baits an odor attractive to the grasshoppers, thus inducing them to jeat more readily and more heavily of the bait, to improve its killing ability. Forty-five different materials thought to have some possible value as such attractive materials, or attrahents, or some combination value as attrahents and wetting agents, were tested, as compared with both poisoned and unpoisoned bran baits without any-attrahent. In the poisoned, baits, arsenic trioxide and calcium fluosilicate compound were the poisons used. Of! the 45 attrahent materials, 29 were volatile organic compounds, mostly '::.- essential oils, 8 were fruit and vegetable parts and 8 were heavy oils ami sweets. A total of 644 pans of bait were placed and observed in the field, and hourly field records of light, temperature and humidity were maintained. h . </seg>
         <seg id="p036">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Certain conclusions may be at least tentatively presented as the results ¦ ot these experiments. Amyl acetate, long used as an attrahent in grass - hopper baits, showed an average efficiency of only 78 per cent in the 6 \ tests conducted, when rather maximum dosages were used, and in only ,' one ot these 6 tests was its efficiency greater than that of the untreated | check. Attrahcm materials making a definite and consistent improvement m baits treated with them, using untreated bran as a check with the value of 100, included oil of French pennyroyal (235), oil of citronella (193), lemon rind (187), linalool (152), oil of bay leaf (149), garlic juice (141), oil of catnip (131), oil of American pennyroyal and oil of pineapple (both 126). and onion juice (123). Materials that did not consistently average better than the plain bran mash, or that showed one or more very low ratings, included acetophonc, beta ionone, butyric acid, eucalyptus oil, eugenol. geraniol. lactic acid, lemon oil, linaloe, methyl benzoate, oil of mustard, para cresol phenol acetate, oil of peppermint, phenol ethyl alcohol and oil ot sweet orange. Amon;; citrus fruits, lemon juice did not seem to be as attractive as the grated rind. Lemon rind had the highest rating (187), while the lemon juice rating was only 105. Lemon oil, in the series of volatile oils, rated 127, hut the last two tests with lemon oil were low, and may have unduly affected the results. Orange juice was second only to lemon rind, but the oil of sweet orange showed a rating of only 112. It is interesting to observe the high attrahent ratings when used in grasshopper baits of pennyroyal oils and oil of citronella, both of which arc strongly repellent to mosquitoes and other small flies. The results from the use of garlic and onion juices were likewise importantly suggestive. Tests were made of these juices because grasshoppers were noted readily to feed upon and destroy onions in the field. Of the two, garlic juice was more consistently attractive than onion juice. Adult grasshoppers, particularly, were attracted by alliaceous odors. It may be that it would be practical for fanners to raise small patches of garlic for use as attra - hents in grasshopper baits. None of the baits treated with heavier oils (corn oil, linseed oil, lubricating oil, etc.) or with sweet materials (honey, corn syrup, cane molasses, etc.) showed a consistently high rating. All but the corn syrup had average ratings less than for plain bran. Studies on the biology of the more injurious species of grasshoppers were also carried on in 1939. The species chiefly studied were Melanoplus difterentialis and M. bivittatus, the two dominant species in the locality of the studies. Out of a large number of species of grasshoppers found feeding in alfalfa fields in late June near Lincoln, M. ditferentialis con - stituted 88.51 and M. bivittatus 10.7 per cent. At that time the first genera - tion of M. mexicanus was about over, and that species constituted only 0.1 per cent of the population. The first adults of M. bivittatus were found in Lincoln on fune 21, and of M. differentialis on July 10. In a number of individuals of M. differentialis, reared from eggs, maturity was reached in from 78 to 99 days, with an average of 83.2 days. </seg>

Studies of Insects Attracted to light Traps I.i 1939 the light trap at Lincoln was operated for a short time only, it hiving been found necessary to curtail this project somewhat because of concentration on the grasshopper project. During the period of opera - tion] however, which extended from June 13 to 29, 41 species of cutworm and 'other moths were collected and identified, most of which were species of decided economic importance. The data obtained formed useful addi - tions to our knowledge of the seasonal activity of the principal economic species of moths and beetles. The work on preparing for publication a summary of the cutworm and related moths caught at the Nebraska and Kansas light traps was continued during 1939. A report on one phase of this project, entitled "Blister Beetles and Ladybird Beetles Taken at a Nebraska Light Trap," by Don B. Whelan, was published in the October, 1935, number of The Journal of the Kansas Entomological Society. "¦-'¦¦:]' [¦ j V : ; ¦'.'¦'': ¦ : ¦'¦¦;. ;' :.

Sorghum Grains for Pig Rations in Dry Lot \ Ten head of 100-pound pigs per lot were fed for 80 days in dry lot. ()ne lot received Sooner milo grain, another Early Kalo, and a third Chey- ' enne kafir. These various rations were compared with an average of five lots which received shelled corn as their grain ration. All lots in the test received the same protein and mineral supplements. The detailed results are av ai lable in Hog Progress Report 2718 by addressing the Department of Animal Husbandry. All grains were self-fed, unground. The gains secured with the grain sorghums were slightly larger than those with corn. More grain sorghum was consumed daily in the sorghum lots and slightly more feed was required for 100 pounds of gain. Sooner milo and Cheyenne kahr proved 91 per cent as valuable as corn while the Early Kalo proved to be 8/ per cent as valuable. Sorghum Grains for Pigs on Sudan Grass Pasture Lots of ten head of 98-pound pigs were self-fed on one-half acre Sudan-grass lots. Yellow shelled corn, tankage, and a simple mineral mix - ture comprised the basal ration. Compared with this was whole sorghum grain, tankage, and mineral, self-fed, free choice. A third lot received whole sorghum grain, plus a mineral. The sorghum grain used was a mixture of Early Kalo and Atlas sorgo gram. Here, as in the preceding dry-lot test, the sorghum-fed pigs con - sumed more grain and gained more rapidly than the corn-fed lot but required more feed to produce 100 pounds gain. The sorghum grain in this case proved 94 per cent as valuable as corn. The importance of feeding a protein supplement with sorghum grain was strikingly brought out in comparing the two sorghum-fed lots. The addition of tankage to the ration doubled the daily gain. Each pound of tankage fed saved more than eight pounds of sorghum grain. At the end of 100 days' feeding the sorghum-grain-and-tankage pigs averaged 230 pounds. At the end of 114 days the corn-fed pigs averaged 222 pounds and the pigs fed only sorghum grain only 173 pounds.

One of the striking demonstrations in this'test was the need for feeding a mineral supplement where soybean oil meal is used as the source of protein. Four pounds of mineral as fed ¦ to one lot saved 93 pounds of corn and 95 pounds of soybean meal. Ex - ! peller-type soybean oil meal was used in this test. The feeding of a mineral j supplement stimulated the appetites and doubled the rate of gain. Soybean oil meal plus a mineral mixture proved a more efficient supple - ment to corn than a mixture of tankage and soybean meal, equal parts.

'¦";¦¦ [Early Kalo grain, Sooner milo grain, the heads from both of these sorghum crops, and Atlas grain sorgo were compared with corn as feeds forl heifer calves. The feeding period extended over 166 days. Definite conclusions should not be made from a single trial, but the following sum - mary seems justifiable: : (The sorghums tested were just as, easy to feed and appeared just as palatable to the cattle as corn. No digestive disturbances occurred. The gains made by all lots of sorghum-fed cattle were equal to or superior to those made by the corn-fed cattle. The catde fed the grain sorghums gained as much but ate more and so made a pound of gain at a little higher expenditure in pounds of feed. jGround Sooner milo as fed in this test proved to be worth 96 per cent as much as ground corn (replacement value).

Another test was conducted to determine the value of adding a small amount of alfalfa hay to rations that used either silage or fodder as the only roughage in the fattening ration. All the rations were checked against the standard ration of shelled corn and alfalfa hay. The lambs fed Early Kalo and Sooner milo made practically the same gain on the same amount of feed with a slight advantage in this test in favor ot the Kalo. There seemed to be no difference in the palatability. The Jail}' gain was 0.28 and 0.27 respectively, and average grain con - sumption was 1.39 lbs. daily per lamb. The silage and fodder were fed in amounts that would be cleaned up by the next feeding period. The average daily consumption of Atlas silage was 1.97 lbs. per lamb compared to 1.39 lbs. of Atlas fodder. Fields from which the Atlas fodder and silage were taken have been yielding 10 to 12 tons of silage per acre and 5 to 6 tons of fodder. Assuming an Atlas fodder yield per acre of one-half as many tons as Atlas silage from the same acre, the results of this test show an acre of Atlas made into silajje would produce about 43 per cent more gain than the same acre turned into Atlas fodder. The alfalfa hay added to one lot was limited to one-half pound per lamb each day. The lambs receiving no alfalfa hay gained 0.27 lb. per day compared to 0.34 lb. for the lambs receiving a limited amount of alfalfa. In this test 123 pounds of alfalfa hay saved or equaled 100 pounds of Sooner milo plus 365 pounds of corn silage, plus 20 pounds of cotton - seed meal, plus 3 pounds of bone meal in producing 100 pounds of gain. This test in which alfalfa was added to a fodder ration is not com - parable to the test in which alfalfa was added to a silage ration since the lambs in this test were much lighter in weight. In this test 108 pounds of alfalfa saved 24 pounds of shelled corn, plus 4 pounds of cottonseed meal, plus 75 pounds of Atlas fodder, plus 1 pound of bone meal in producing 11)0 pounds of gain. The lambs receiving alfalfa gained 0.39 pound per day compared to a 0.36 pound for the lambs receiving no alfalfa. The shelled corn required to produce 100 pounds of gain in the corn and alfalfa ration was the same amount as the Early Kalo or Sooner milo required to produce the same amount of gain in the silage rations. The 371 pounds of alfalfa consumed to produce 100 pounds of gain in the corn-alfalfa lot was equal to approximately 1,075 pounds corn silage, plus </seg>

Firmness grades determined by manual examination and also by refractive index determinations of the back fat showed no essential differences between lots, all of the lots grading hard. From the standpoint of finish, color, quality, and firmness the sorghum-fed pigsi were indistinguishable from the corn-fed lot. Loin roasts from these pigs were used in cooking and palatability tests and here again little if any difference was noted. Curing tests conducted by a commercial packing plant showed that all of the carcasses produced acceptable cured cuts.

Little difference was noted between lot averages so far as dressing yields were concerned. No appreciable differences in color of fat or lean, firmness, marbling, or texture were apparent. Rib cuts from representative cattle were used for cooking and palatability tests. A conservative appraisal of the cooking and palatability data indicates that sorghum-fed beef is not inferior to that produced with corn.

         <seg id="p042">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Dairy Production and Manufacture Characteristics of Ice Cream and Ice Cream Mix \ One of the problems of the ice cream manufacturer is to obtain an a economical source of milk solids-not-fat. Any means by which skimmilk J can be stored helps to solve the problem, and for this reason studies have been made of the possibilities of freezing and storing condensed skimmilk. Plain skimmilk was condensed in a stainless steel vacuum pan to 30 per cent solids, and part of this was superheated until a desired viscosity was obtained. Both products were standardized to 30 per cent solids with ' distilled water. Another type of condensed skimmilk was prepared by adding one pound of sugar for each pound of milk solids and then condensing the product until it contained 60 per cent solids. The various condensed milks were placed in new, clean, bright lard cans with covers and stored at O°F. Cans of each type of milk were removed after one, two, and three months' storage, and after thawing for 24 hours were made up into ice cream mixes and compared with ice cream made irom freshly-condensed skimmilk. The results showed that plain and sweetened condensed skimmilk can be frozen and stored at O°F. for periods up to three months without any detrimental effects. Plain condensed skimmilk decreased very slowly in solubility during storage, indicating that precipitation was occurring progressively. Sweetened con - densed skimmilk did not exhibit this characteristic during the three months' storage period. Superheated condensed skimmilk showed protein precipitation at the end of one month in storage and the precipitation increased rapidly as storage continued. Although any of the three types of condensed milk could have been used in an ice cream mix, the sweetened appeared the most desirable. There was no significant effect, during the freezing and storage period, upon the titratable acidity or pH. The type of condensed milk used had little effect upon the viscosity of the ice cream mix. Superheating and the addition of sugar had no beneficial effect upon the whipping ability of the ice cream mix during freezing. The source of the serum solids, the methods of handling, and die process - ing had no effect upon the flavor of the ice cream. Body and texture scores were slightly lowered by all types of frozen condensed skimmilk. Ice cream made with fresh or stored frozen super-heated condensed skimmilk melted more slowly and showed less foam upon melting than ice creams made from plain or sweetened condensed skimmilk. Observations have indicated that there are variations in the character - istics of a milk supply that may affect materially the suitability of the skimmilk for storage when condensed, frozen, and stored tor ice cream making. Consequently, a study was made of those characteristics of a milk supply that it seemed likely might have a material effect.

A study of families is also , being undertaken as to these same characteristics. The records of produc - tion 1 for) the cows in the herd have now been calculated to a uniform basis and these are now available for study as to relationships between growth and production.

Commercial Manufacture of Cream Cheese ¦/. ¦ The possibilities of heating curd after pressing and the use of various emulsifying agents have been tested to determine their effect upon the quality and keeping ability of the cheese. Efforts have also been' directed toward the elimination of some of the moisture from the original milk and! cream by evaporation, coagulation, and mixing with more concentrated products'. Water-absorbing stabilizers have also been tried. Milk Quality as Affected by the Individual Cow Various tests of detection of mastitis have been compared with the plate method to determine their reliability, and every milking cow in the Statjion herd has had monthly tests made on each quarter of the udder. Results (obtained so far seem to indicate that quarantining cows with mastitis infections, sterilizing the milk utensils including the milking machine, having the milker wash his hands after each cow, and dipping thejteatjeups of the milking machine in clear dean water, then in chlori - nated water, and finally in clear water after each cow is milked will keep down the infection and that only a few new cases will develop when such methods are used. A study of the leucocyte count of milk has been continued and also studies of various "off" flavors. </seg>

I Since that time methods and practices that would cure or eliminate this .' disease have been studied. Cows believed to be infected have been treated | in two ways. The cow was allowed to pass over three normal-length heat (estrum) periods (not less than 60 days) and then inseminated artificially with semen from an uninfected bull. A few cows were treated with five irrigations of the genital organs at weekly intervals, with a warm water solution of 500 parts to one part oxyquinoline sulphate, and 1 others were treated in the same manner with one part Lugol's solution to 300 parts of warm water. Each group appeared to get rid of the disease as well as the other. Five bulls have been demonstrated as having the infection. Three were disposed of without treatment, one was kept from service for six months and this rest did not cure him, and two were treated. One was treated with sulfanilamide without success. Later he was given three douchings weekly in the sheath with a five per cent solution of lactic acid in warm water. After being slaughtered a study of his genital tracts indicated no evidence of infection. Previous to treatment, this bull infected every cow he served. The second bull was treated with the lactic acid douche and showed a reduced infection but the infection was not cured as evidenced by inseminated cows and later by a post mortem. Nutritional Values of. Grain and Forage Sorghums To determine how well sorghum grain (Sooner milo) could replace corn, feeding trials have been conducted to compare a grain mixture of 52 per cent yellow cornmeal, 25 per cent wheat bran, 20 per cent cotton - seed meal (43 per cent protein), two per cent steamed bone meal, and one per cent iodized salt with another similar mixture except that the Sooner milo replaced the corn. This grain mixture was fed in the proportion of one pound of grain to three pounds of milk produced, to groups of cows on the double reversal plan with 30-day periods. Corn silage was fed at the rate of 25 pounds per cow daily and alfalfa hay at the rate of two pounds per 100 pounds of live weight in the cow. This experiment has been repeated with minor variations in the procedure. Both trials indicated that under the conditions of a balanced ration, Sooner milo was equal to yellow corn pound for pound when such a feed was not over 52 per cent of the grain mixture.

" " ¦ ".'.:' In studying the factors influencing milk production, experimentation wi :h cows is both costly and time consuming. As a result, experiments arc conducted with rats. The pituitary gland secretes hormones that affect milk secretion; consequently it is desirable to study the relationship of that gland to milk secretion. While the effects of some of these hormones . secreted by the pituitary are known, others are either imperfectly under - stood or unknown. The anterior pituitary-like sex hormone (Antuitrin "S") was shown to be ineffective in inhibiting lactation in the rat as a result of a series of eight experiments. Further experiments showed that while the estrogenicsubstance (Progynon-B) had only a slight inhibitory action upon milk secretion, a combination of Antuitrin "SC" and Progy - no'n had a marked inhibitory action. ; Publications during the year include: "Effect of Pregnancy Urine Ex - trs ct on Lactation in the Rat," I.

White Leghorn pullets each were used for an experiment, in which a sunlight lamp that transmits ultra-violet energy was tested as a source of antirachitic factor. Rations and environmental factors were similar except for the one variable. The basal ration for both lots was sufficient for all factors except the antirachitic factor, which in the case of the one lot was provided with two per cent of U. S. P. quality cod-liver oil fed in the mash to make a total of one per cent of the whole ration. The other lot was provided with S-l lamp irradiation from 5 to 7 a. m. each morning from October 15th to March 15th. The lamp was placed 60 inches above the floor with feed and water containers beneath. Management practices were similar to those generally followed by good poultrymen with respect to removal of birds which go out of condition. This year's experiment again indicates that Leghorn hens can be main - tained in good condition, and that good egg production is possible when the antirachitic factor is provided during the winter and early spring months with sunlight lamp radiation for two hours daily. When sunlight lamp radiation is depended upon for the antirachitic factor, however, the ration must be high in vitamin A values. Twenty per cent of yellow corn and 10 per cent of good quality alfalfa meal in the mash will provide a liberal supply of this essential. Protein Utilization by Growing Poults The most practical sources of supplemental protein at present are meat scraps, fish meal, dried milk products, soybean oil meal, and corn gluten meal. In a series of experiments these were combined for addition to a standard basal ration to determine the relative growth-promoting value of the various combinations. The experiment was duplicated, and then modified in the third series to provide the same protein level for all lots. The results of these experiments involving 765 poults justify the follow - ing conclusions: All five combinations of proteins gave excellent results when used to supplement the basal ration used in these experiments. Certain concen - trate combinations were more economical than others. The results with a concentrate composed of equal parts of five ingredients indicate no special advantage in using a great variety of sources of supplemental protein. </seg>
         <seg id="p047">• Fifty-third Annual Report j Protein Utilization by Laying Hens | Two combinations of proteins were compared in experiments with t laying hens covering 240 days. Hatchability, mortality, and culling data j were also obtained. No significant difference in production, hatchability I and mortality was observed in the two groups. Formula No. 8-S, in which ! soybean oil meal replaced dried milk, as called for in formula No. 8, was lower in cost than the original No. 8 formula. The modified formula apparently provides all essentials for good production and high hatch - ability when good quality ingredients are used. 1 Field-Feeding Grain Sorghums to Turkeys A preliminary experiment to determine the practicability of having turkeys harvest grain sorghums in the field during the last month of the feeding period indicates that this practice is feasible. Two lots of 79 torn 1 turkeys each were used for this experiment. The birds were 135 days old at the beginning of the experiment. Both lots received a complete mash mixture (No. 16) containing 10 per cent of alfalfa meal to insure a sufficiency of vitamin A. Both lots also received oats soaked in milk once daily, and a supplemental grain mixture. The variation in manage - ment was in the grain part of the ration. Utilization of Ctet Products by Chicks It has been observed that germinated oats are a very palatable feedstuff forjgrowing chicks. In an experiment for which four lots of 62 chicks each were used, the growth-promoting values of four oat products, pul - verized bats, oats germinated 4 days, oats germinated 8 days, and feeding oatmeal, were compared when: used in parallel amounts with a basal ration which has been extensively used in other experiments. Results show that the growth-promoting value of oats for chicks can be enhanced slightly by germination. The necessity for an increased level of the growth-promoting factors present in germinated oats is not so evi - dent when a good basal ration, such as was used in our experiments, is provided. The use of feeding-grade oatmeal to replace an equal amount of pulverized oats in the specific ration used, increased the growth rate slightly, but at a greater cost per unit of gain. | Concentrtte-Grain System of Feeding Turkeys I I the Last Six Weeks |The!primary problem ¦¦was .'that of the use of concentrate mixtures with whole grain. The concentrate used was Nebraska Formula 4-CX, which is as follows: .

         <seg id="p048">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station The use of pellets is being advocated as a way of increasing feed con- ' sumption and increasing efficiency. One lot was then given free access to formula 4-CX in the form of pellets, the other two lots receiving the ) same mixture as a mash. One of the latter two lots also received a flesh- •! ing mash moistened with milk. Green Sudan grass was available part } ot the period. Results show that the grain-plus-concentrate system of feeding turkeys from the 20th to the 26th week is feasible. There is no apparent advantage in convening the concentrate into pellets. Ad libitum feeding of both concentrate and grain results in a gradual reduction of the protein level | as the birds approach the end of the feeding period. The practice of feeding a milk-moistened fleshing mash once daily is very desirable. The significance of obtaining a high feed intake is demonstrated by this experiment. The Utilization of Food Elements by Growing Chicks Continuing a series of studies with growing chicks, a comparison was made of alfalfa meal and Sudan-grass meal. It was found that the the substitution of Sudan-grass meal for the 10 per cent of alfalfa meal in a ration had no effect on the growth rate of White Leghorn chicks up to six weeks of age. It was concluded that Sudan-grass meal can replace alfalfa meal in a ration for growing chicks. Experience with day-old chicks has shown that variations in growth within lots can be reduced to a low level by feeding controlled amounts of a pelleted ration to all experimental chicks. The possibility of further reducing variability by eliminating genetic variation was studied by hatch - ing chicks from eggs produced by five hens so that about ten pedigreed chicks were available from each of five different matings. All these chicks were fed individually 836 g. of dry matter over a period of six weeks. The ration used was Nebraska No. 8-S with Sudan-grass meal substituted for the alfalfa meal. Data available as a result of the feeding trial and subsequent analytical work include final net weight, rate of gain, gain per gram of nitrogen fed, and the nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus content of each chick. Since the composition of the feed had been do - rermined it was possible to calculate the percentages of nitrogen, calcium," and phosphorus retained. A preliminary survey of the data shows very low variability within groups of like sex from identical matings. With respect to final weights the males showed deviations between the low and high values of 2, 2, 3, 4, and 7 per cent of the average weight respec - tively, in the groups of five matings, while the females had deviations of 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 per cent in like groups. The males had an average net weight of about 425 g. and the females 408 g. after six weeks of feeding. The range of variation between extremes was decreased in the case of the retention of nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus. In another feeding trial the effect of substituting urea for one-third of the concentrate portion of a complete ration was studied with two lots </seg>
         <seg id="p049">I ¦ Fifty-third Annual Report f' of day-old chicks. At the end of the six weeks' feeding period, wherein all chicks of both lots were individually fed equal amounts of the pelleted . rations, the lots fed the normal ration had made better growth than tfiose 1 with|urea included in the ration. Outside of differences in the growth rate there was a marked contrast in the feathering of the two lots. Those with urea in the ration were not as far advanced in feather growth and show ;d large areas devoid of feathers. The analytical work in connection with this trial has not been completed. Work elsewhere has indicated that ruminants can utilize the nitrogen of urea but the impression is prevalent that animals with a single stomach are unable to make use of it.

Performance Characteristics of Rubber Tires on Tractors Additional work was done with pneumatic tractor tires in 1939. Attention was focused on the use of duals, which were compared with singles on lister ridges, on a wet stubble field, and on plowed ground, and a report has been accepted for publication in the Journal of the American Society of Agricultural Engineers. Steel wheels were included on the plowed ground. The following are some conclusions from this work: 1. It is difficult to make single pneumatic tires ride lister ridges. It can be done by throttling the tractor and pulling little or nothing. 2. Dual tires of any size spaced 3/2 to 4/2 inches apart on the rim ride lister ridges satisfactorily. 3. Dual tires gave better traction on a wet stubble field than single tires. 4. Dual tires had less travel reduction on plowed ground than single tires, la other words, they slipped less and gave better traction. 5. Dual tires showed a higher fuel consumption in pounds per draw-bar horsepower hour than did the single tires. The difference was small and tends to discourage the idea of lessening fuel consumption and thereby tractor operating costs by the use of dual tires.

Vjater meters and watt-hour meters have been installed on a number of automatic water systems on farms in eastern Nebraska for the purpose of obtaining data on cost of operation and quantities of water used. Both deep and shallow well systems are being metered. Most of the installations are too new to furnish data of much value. A number of automatic water heaters in, farm homes are also being metered. Here again the installations are.too new to furnish information of value on cost of operation and quantities used. . ¦i: . i ¦ • * ¦ - ¦ ¦ " ; :-.'¦'- Electrical Water Heating for Livestock The heating of drinking water for.hogs was continued during the winter of 1938-39. Water temperatures were maintained at approximately 4()°, 55°, and.7s°F., the same as for the two previous, years. Results obtained. were similar to those of the two preceding years and indicated that there is little value in warming drinking water for hogs except to prevent freezing. . Several tests have been made in an effort to learn if there is danger of lead poisoning in the use of lead-covered soil-heating cable in heating drinking water for livestock. Chemical analysis showed definite indica - tions of lead in distilled (or soft) water in which soil-heating cable had been; operated. Hard water, however, showed no trace of lead under similar operating conditions. Tentative plans are to continue the tests with . water of different degrees of hardness in an attempt to find a danger point below which it would be unsafe to use soil-heating cable. Four experimental stock-tank-heaters have, been installed on farms in Lancaster and Gage counties. These heaters have soil-heating cable heating elements arid are designed merely to keep a drinking opening free of ice in a covered tank. The question of lead poisoning has been discussed with the cooperators and tests for lead in the water will be* made : from time to time. ¦ ¦.'¦¦ . Methods of Cooling Milk on the Farm and Their j Effect on Quality A progress report was issued in January, 1939, on a small dry-type portable milk-cooling cabinet which can be built on the farm. 2 The cabinet has ixen found satisfactory for use on a small dairy farm where bottled milk! is cooled and stored.

Future plans include the testing of a small washing-machine pump to determine its possibilities for use in a constant-level milk cooling tank. Other types of ' small inexpensive pumps may also be tested. i The Adaptability of Electric Hotbeds to Farm Use Hotbeds heated by means of electric soil-heating cable and by means of thermostatically controlled blue-flame kerosene burners were again operated during the winter of 1938-39. Results during the past five sea - sons indicate that electricity at 2 to 3 cents per kilowatt-hour compares ' favorably with kerosene at 13 cents per gallon for hotbed heating. The average consumption of electricity for the five seasons was 2.17 kilowatt - hours per 3'x6' sash per day and kerosene consumption averaged 0.49 gallon per sash per day during the same period. Thermostatic control of the kerosene burners was more difficult than for the electric units and some trouble was experienced with soot. Two serious fires occurred in the kerosene-heated beds during the five seasons. Adaptation of Insulated Electric Brooders in Uninsulated Poultry Houses A special-type rectangular 200-chick insulated electric brooder, designed' to be built on the farm, has given excellent results and is being used on an increasing number of farms. It is heated with soil-heating cable and temperature control is by means of a wafer and snap switch thermostat. A progress report summarizes the brooder studies of 1937 and 1938 and includes a sketch of the special type brooder together with a bill of materials. 3 Studies during the 1939 season indicated that an 8-inch vestibule with a double curtain covering the full front of the brooder tends to relieve the crowded condition within the brooder as the chicks grow larger and also offers the chicks a choice of temperature zones for comfort. Chicks in this brooder weighed more at the end of eight weeks than those in brooders having no vestibule. A combination brooder and incubator, using the brooder as a source of heat for the specially built incubator, is being constructed. Tests will continue during the 1940 season. Mechanical Equipment for the Eradication of Bindweed •* By way of summary, it will be recalled that a 32-acre field was com - pletely freed of bindweed (except seedlings) by the summer-fallow method, which was started in 1934. Work on this field served as a means of trying out numerous home-made as well as commercial implements. It deserves to be called the fore-runner of the application of power and machinery on a large scale to the eradication of bindweed. 8 For a copy address Department of Agricultural Engineering.

         <seg id="p053">!' Fifty-third Annual Report .i-. Work was continued to see if the regular equipment of a farm could | not be utilized in a bindweed eradication project and the need for purchas - f ing a new machine eliminated. It was hoped to crop the land at the t same time and thus avoid other objectionable features of the summer- I fallo ( w method. To this end a field of 17.44 acres was secured. It was planned to check-plant corn on it, to cultivate the field in both directions as long as possible with a two-row cultivator, and then to continue through the large corn with one-horse cultivators. All remaining bind - -1 weeds were to be taken out by a hoe. The third season's work has now been concluded on this field and where a few bindweeds survived they were chlorated and the field turned back to the farmer as clean. A second field of 15.78 acres was added to the program in 1938 and two seasons' work has been completed on it. Several new cultivator sweeps are being tested.: "-.¦'¦ :- \'. - ..':'-/ ¦.. .:¦ ':; : Rural Economics Cost of Producing Farm Crops THe Experiment Station has obtained the cooperation of farmers living in selected areas of the state in keeping cost records. The records for crops show the number of hours of work performed by men, horses, and machines for each operation from seedbed preparation to harvest. During the past year 157 wheat records, 178 corn records, and 84 tractor records were obtained. The information upon the cost of operating tractors has been published as Experiment Station Bulletin 324, Cost of Tractor Power onNebrps\a Farms, by Frank Miller, W. L. Ruden, and C. W. Smith, 20 pages, November, 1939. ..'; ' . Xs a rule tractors used in the western part of Nebraska are between 21 and 30 drawbar horsepower. In the central and eastern parts of the state the most common size is between 11 and 20 drawbar horsepower. There is no significant difference in cost per rated drawbar horsepower hour for items except fuel in tractors between 11 and 30 horsepower. Tractors smaller than 10 drawbar horsepower show a higher total cost per unit of power than those over 10 drawbar horsepower. Overhead costs per rated drawbar horsepower hour vary inversely with the | number of hours the tractor is used annually. ; ¦''¦¦. "¦'.'¦ Total costs per used drawbar horsepower hour increase as the tractor load decreases from its rated capacity. [f low cost per unit of useful power is desired the tractor should be kept busy at work that uses a high percentage of its rated power. Pne.lor more of several methods may be used for adjusting the load to the power of the tractor: (1) The size of equipment may be increased. (2)j More than one piece of equipment may be pulled. (3) A higher gear may be used and the job completed at a greater speed. (4) A higher gear may be used and the tractor throttled to the speed required for the work.

These were summarized and analyzed according to financial organization, loss and gain, bushel analysis, and analysis of surplus. It is planned to carry on ihis project for a series of years. The major problem confronting farmers' elevators is that of increas- \ ing their volume of grain handled. The elevator capacity in Nebraska is at least double that required to handle the grain marketed if all elevators were operated at optimum capacity. Farm Organization and Farm Costs This is one of the oldest and most important Rural Economics projects. Information is taken from record books kept by farmers. A total of 795 farm account books for the year 1938 were received and summarized. In addition, the Soil Conservation Service turned over for summarizing 15 books kept by cooperators in Gage county and 4 from Otoe county. Measurement of Farmers' Response to Price in Hog Production and Marketing Data have been assembled on the marketing of hogs from all counties in Nebraska and the price received for these marketings on the Omaha market for the six-year period 1930-35. All items of expense from the time the hogs left the local shipping point until they were sold to the packer were obtained. This expense varied from 38 cents per 100 pounds in 1933 to 48 cents in 1930. The number of hogs shipped by rail decreased each year and by 1935 railway shipments accounted for a relatively small part of the hogs received at the market. Farm Real Estate Tax Delinquencies and Public Expenditures Research Bulletin 105, The Tax System o/ Nebraska with Special Reference to Its Relation to Agriculture, 84 pages, by L. B. Snyder, was published in October, 1938. A series of maps is now being prepared show - ing the location of tax delinquent real estate. The object of the maps is to present graphically the relationship between tax delinquency and the different soil grades. Tax-delinquency maps for 48 townships in five counties have been completed. In order to be of the greatest value, the data on which the maps are based should be brought up to date. Only the years 1928-32 are now included. </seg>

A part of these records have been from farmers who are following a definitely designed program of soil conservation and the other records are upon similar farms where soil conservation is now practiced.

One reason for this is that because of the drouth all yields have been very low. .... .; I'¦ : . ... ; i.V: V Land Tenure . ./¦''"¦'¦¦-¦ ¦¦ This is a new project. A field study was made during the summer in Clay and Hall counties in which about 200 records in each county were obtained from tenants and about 60 records from landlords. Some of the important items on which it is desired to gain information are as follows: (1) why tenants move so frequently; (2) what adjustments in rent are advisable,! particularly pasture and hay land, with changing economic conditions; (3) the extent o£ understanding between tenants and land - lords of each other's problems. The data obtained in the survey are now being tabulated. . . '-';.' y Land Use Planning in Areas Data have been obtained on the cultivated land and non-cultivated land in several counties and maps are being drawn showing the location of such land.| Data pertaining to crops and livestock have been obtained for all counties in the state over a period of years, as well as climatic data. These are basic for adjustments in the use of land. Maps are being made for several counties that will show in addition to cultivated and non-cultivated : land the assessed valuation, tax delinquency, ownership, and use-suitability areas all in place. Economic classification of land has been made in several counties in the state and similar classification will be made in more counties during the year. ' ¦-".-: "¦/ There is some evidence from the studies that there is some misuse of v land under present conditions. The evidence collected so far points toward a preponderance of farms too small in size to return an adequate income. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics, U. S.

From these data maps are being constructed showing the geography of the price of each commodity. ' Seasonal prices arc also being tabulated. Home Economics Kitchen Stoves Apparatus has been designed to weigh small quantities of gasoline to one gram so that the heat transfer efficiency of the surface burners may be determined to within approximately one per cent. The heat-transfer efficiency of burners on two gasoline stoves has been measured and tests indicate that the efficiency varies from 15 to 45 per cent, depending upon the size of pan used. The effect of different gas rates and draft on the pan are also being studied. Tests for carbon monoxide have not been completed. Ovens have been only partially studied. Heat-loss tests show that the ovens have characteristics similar to gas ovens. The investigation is being continued. Publication: Nebr. Agr. Sta. Res.

Small Food Mixers .Nfcchanical work on this project has been completed to the point where a mixer controlled by a centrifugal switch has been adapted to different types of beaters. This test mixer is to be used in a series of food tests to determine the relation of beaters, bowl, bowl motion, and speed to satisfactory mixing and beating. Tests have shown that the motor of the present size used equipped with a centrifugal speed control is satisfactory Irom the standpoint of heavy load requirements. After study of the mixer with egg whites, angel food cake, butter cake, cookie dough, biscuit dough, candy, and potatoes as loads, further mechanical changes will be made as needed. The Mineral and Nitrogen Metabolism of College Women Eighty college girls, of the 100 in the original plan, have been studied.

Results indicate that I' girls from 18 to 22 years are storing minerals and nitrogen when they are supplied in amounts above the requirement for maintenance. X-rays of the wrists have been taken of many of the girls in order to study the stage of maturation of the bones. These were accompanied by calcium and phosphorus determinations of the blood.

In this study the factors of intelligence and socio-economic status of family were controlled. An analysis of the data concerning the home environment and family i life of the subjects was also made. This study was reported in, "Some i Family Life Patterns and Their Relation to Personality Development in Children," by Leland H. Stott, J. Exper. Educ, Vol. VII, December, 1939. A few general patterns of family behavior were found to be common to farm, town, and city settings while others apparently were peculiar to certain general home settings. Some of the more important common patterns were: (1) a pattern of family relationships characterized by con- ' fidence, affection, and companionability, (2) a pattern involving family discord and perhaps parental misconduct and a critical attitude on the ' part of the child, and (3) "nervous tension." These were found to be particularly important in relation to the personality development of the children. A study of the family life of rural couples in relation to their similari - ties and differences in personality and temperament is under way. Some preliminary studies only have been completed. ' Comparative Costs of Home Produced and Commercially Produced Bread and Rolls Records were kept by Nebraska women including kinds, amounts and costs of ingredients with time of production used in white and whole wheat bread and rolls. Records were also kept of the kinds and amounts of bread purchased.

North Platte Substation Work at the North Platte Substation followed the general plan. Projects cooperative with the U. S. Department of Agriculture are dry land crops and tillage and swine breeding. A major improvement was the installation of 6,000 feet of new water main under a WPA project. This will greatly increase the fire protection. A machine shed and general utility building was erected on Station land by the SCS service. Rainfall was about 30 per cent below normal, and less favorably dis - tributed tor late-season than for early-season crops. The rainfall for the five months July to November was among the lowest of record. </seg>

Fifty-third Annual Report f] Dry Land Crops and Tillage Average crop yields were winter wheat 22.7 bushels; spring wheat, !; 9.0; okts, 30.7; barley, 18.0; Early Kalo, 22.4; corn, 4.2; and potatoes, 78.6 | bushels. The effects of different tillage practices and crop sequences were I greater than for several years. Yield increases after fallow over the average of all lannual cropping methods were 60 per cent for winter wheat, 89 per cent tor spring grains, and 137 per cent for Early Kalo. Crops following corn made good yields as a result of moisture storage from late rains after the crop of the previous year had been killed by drouth. The outstanding effect of previous cropping and tillage was in rotations of winter wheat and Early Kalo. The yield of winter wheat directly after Early Kalo in I two-year rotations was 2.5 bushels per acre.The yield of Early Kalo after , winter wheat was 12.2 bushels per acre. Where the crop rotation was ; four years with fallow preceding each crop, the yields were 27.0 bushels [per afcre for winter wheat and 35.8 bushels for Early Kalo.

The season was favorable for good yields of the later-maturing varieties. Yields of spring wheat were low and the quality poor. Geres, the leading spring wheat variety in Nebraska for the past 13 years, yielded 7.8 bushels per acre. Four new rust-resistant varieties, Premier, Merit, Rival, and Pilot, have been grown for the past two years and look promising. A selection of Atlas x Vaughn gave the highest yield among the barley varieties of 26.1 bushels; Selections from this cross have given good yields in nurseries and field plats at several western great plains experiment stations. Spartan ranked second with a yield of 25.5 bushels. Since 1924, Brunker has been a high-yielding early oat variety. This variety yielded 26.0 bushels this year being slightly exceeded by two, Fulghum selection and a new smut-resistant variety, Fulton. The sorghum varieties seeded on land previously cropped to oats failed to head while the yields of the grain varieties on fallowed land ranged from 31.7 :o 57.2 bushels. Club Kafir produced the highest yield while Early Kalo yielded 42.4. The early corn hybrids and open-pollinated varieties grow i oh table land were complete failures because of drouth. Twenty - nine hybrids grown under irrigation averaged 56.7 bushels or 143 per cent of the open-pollinated checks. Seven soybean varieties were grown unde-irrigated conditions and yields were approximately 20 bushels per acre. Most of the varieties were matured by the first of October. </seg>

Between May 15 and October 6, the pump was operated on 90 days for a total of 900 hours. A high water table contributed to a higher than usual output. \ The average flow was 1160 gallons per minute. A total ot 2,305 acre inches was used on 140 acres of land, of which 83 acres were in crop and 57 acres under preparation for later seeding. Operating costs of $379.52 lor 17,020 kilowatt-hours of electricity and $270.08 for labor amounted to 28.1 cents per acre inch of water applied. Adding $300 for fixed costs raises the total cost to 41.2 cents per acre inch. Irrigated potatoes produced 400 bushels per acre in comparison with 78 bushels on dry land. The irrigation cost of the increased production was 2.81 cents per bushel. Irrigated corn produced 47.5 bushels in com - parison with 4.2 bushels on dry land. The per-bushel cost of irrigation of the increased production was 14.94 cents. Atlas .;orgo with a yield of 20 tons of ensilage per acre under irrigation and 5 tons on dry land cost 88.67 cents per ton of increased production. A rise in ground-water level, apparently the result of seepage from the Sutherland canals and reservoirs, made changes necessary in order to keep the motor above water. In May, 1939, the water level was 18 inches higher than at any previous time and on December 15, 30 inches above the usun) level at that season. Horticulture New windbreak plantings of Chinese elm, Western Yellow pine. Lin - den, Russian Olive and Tamarack were made on the table land, to afford protection to an area that will be used later for orchard plantings. Tomato varietal trials were continued under irrigation and extended to dry land for the first time. Some of the dry-land plantings made satis - factory yields under very adverse conditions. \cw lawn and parking areas were set with buffalo grass, which has continued to give good results.

The wild hay and silage were supplemented with 1.0 pound per head daily of either cottonseed meal or soybean oil meal. Fed at this level the rye proved fully'equal to corn in producing gains. The cottonseed meal and soybean oil meal were of equal value in this trial. The calves fed silage made larger gains than the calves fed either prairie or alfalfa hay and in turn the calves fed alfalfa hay made somewhat more rapid gains than the calves fed prairie hay. After the wintering period, these calves were fed for 182 days. The two hay lots and one of the silage lots were fed on native grass for 84 days and iji dry lot for 98 days. The other two lots were fed in dry lot for the 182 days.. Ground corn was fed.to all lots except one of the groups in dry lot, which was fed equal parts of ground corn and ground rye. In dry lot, alfalfa hay was fed as a roughage and a source of protein. At the close of the period there was little difference in the weight of the different lots. All of them sold at the same price and all produced acceptable carcasses.

S. Department of Agriculture. The main work is the irrigated rotation experiments, and results show influence on the crop yields oi farm manure, alfalfa, and pastured sweet clover. The hybrid , corn test represents a study of a number of experimental hybrids, with a view to finding a satisfactory hybrid for irrigated farms in the North Plane valley. The sorghum variety test includes a number of forage and grain sorghums, also the place and importance of sorghums in this region. In addition, other work has been carried on. Precipitation in 1939 amounted to 7.81 inches, as compared with a 30-year mean of 13.65 inches. During the growing season of 1939, pre - cipitation amounted to 5.86 inches, as compared with a 30-year mean of 11.15 inches. Precipitation in the watershed of the Pathfinder dam was also below normal. Consequently, irrigation water delivered to farmers under the Government ditch amounted to only 1.36 acre feet. Tempera - tures were above the 29-year mean for 1911-39, and were particularly higher during the summer months. Evaporation during the growing season amounted to 45.87 inches, as compared with the 29-year mean of 36.39 inches. The frost-free period was 145 days, as compared with a 29-year mean of 135 days. Moderate to severe hailstorms occurred through - out the valley, and caused severe damage to the small-grain crops and canning crops, and moderate damage to sugar-beet crops. Crop Rotations At present 52 crop rotations are in operation. Of these, 31 were inaugurated in 1912; 3 in 1920; 10 in 1926; 3 in 1931; 1 in 1932; and 4 in 1937. The crop rotations vary in length from continuous cropping to 7-year rotations. The rotation experiments have been planned to determine the influence of farm manure, alfalfa, pastured sweet clover, and applica - tions of phosphate on the yields of irrigated crops. In the :otations where farm manure has been applied, or where alfalfa lias been grown, or where sweet clover has been pastured, the yields of crops have been significantly higher than in rotations where these prac - tices have not been followed both during 1939 and for the 22-year period. The pasl year's records continue to substantiate records of previous years. Hybrid Corn The hybrid corn test during 1939 included three open-pollinated local varieties, four commercial hybrids, and twenty experimental hybrids. Yields ranged from J22.7 for one hybrid to 76.7 bushels per acre for a local open-pollinated variety. Generally speaking, the yields from all the hybrids </seg>
         <seg id="p063">l' Fifty-third Annual Report ¦i . ¦. * ¦¦ ¦¦- .'¦'.'¦• ¦ -¦ . ' !in this test were unusually, good. Certain of the experimental hybrids, however, appear to have outstanding possibilities for this area. It appears that the commercial hybrids lowa 939 and Funk G-8 and the open-polli - -1 nated variety Minnesota 13 are worthy of consideration for planting. Sorghum Varieties The sorghum variety test included four forage sorghum varieties and fourteen grain sorghum varieties. The yield of oven-dried stover from forage varieties ranged from 3.7 tons per acre for Black Amber to 5.4 tons for Leoti Red. The grain produced by these two varieties was prac - tically the same, or approximately 55 bushels per acre. Although Leoti Red was somewhat later in maturing than Black Amber, it appears more satisfactory for silage purposes, because of its greater yield of forage. At present Adas appears to be inferior to Leoti Red as a forage sorghum for i the North Platte valley, owing to its later maturity and the fact that it ;" has not produced as much forage. The yield from grain sorghum varieties ranged from 96.1 bushels per acre for Kalo t0.24.4 bushels for Club. Colby and Day Milo combine types produced, satisfactory yields and were not damaged by birds. These varieties are also sufficiently early in maturity. Colby appears superior to Day Milp. Birds jentirely destroyed the yields of Cheyenne, Western Blackhuli, and Pink Kafir. Satisfactory grain sorghums may be listed as follows: Kalo, Early Kalo, Sooner Milo, and Colby. Hegari may also be worthy of. consic eration. ¦ ¦• V. Valentine Substation Tie main part of the work at the Valentine Substation is concerned with the wintering of range cattle. The work of the substation,also . includes tests'with crops, including corn, barley, oats, grain „ sorghums, forage sorghums, spring wheat and winter wheat. ¦ • ¦,¦: Range Calves -: -&gt; : -" In the following tabulation the lots represent ten heifer calves each, averaging 441 pounds. The mineral fed in Lot 3 consisted of 20 parts salt, 40 parts ground limestone, and 40 parts steamed bone meal, and was fed at the rate of. 0.1 pound daily. They were kept on trial during the wintering period of 168 days and a period on summer range of 180 days. 7" -':'-« ,' '-¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ Prairie hay _ Lot. • Supplement pctday j gain ga - n (;; ; . Lit. Us.

         <seg id="p064">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Dual-Purpose Cattle The U. S. Department of Agriculture transferred the herd of Red \ Polled cattle to Indiana and sent to Valentine 16 head of Milking Short- ' horn cattle from their herd at Beltsville, Maryland. This shipment brought j the number of females to 35 head. The average of 12 Milking Shorthorn lactations was 6,6223 lbs. of milk and 271.1 lbs. of butterfat. Fifteen Red Polled lactations averaged 5,939.6 lbs. of milk and 255.2 lbs. of butterfat. Poultry \ In a flock-testing project poults from four turkey breeders were brooded together and dressed out at 26 weeks. The death loss for the first eight ' weeks varied from 2 to 25 per cent. The lot with the largest percentage of prime birds had the heaviest toms and hens. The average difference in weight between the heaviest and lightest lots was 2.64 lbs. for the toms and 1.9 lbs. for the hens. Fifty-three per cent of the birds in the heavy lot were graded as having extra full breasts and only four per cent in the lightest lot. Subirrigated Meadow Investigation Seasonal fluctuations ot the depth to the water level in a number of meadows has been recorded since 1925. The largest yields of hay were obtained in seasons of the greatest rise in the water level from March to June. The annual rainfall at Valentine for each year from 1931 to 1938 has been below normal. The accumulated deficiency was 28 inches for the period. The lowest water level was reached in the fall of 1937 when seven wells averaged approximately 20 inches lower than for the six years prior to 1931. Box Butte Experiment Farm The area surrounding the Box Butte Farm experienced another severe drouth during the season of 1939, comparable in intensity and duration to the crop seasons ol 1934 and 1936. Consequently yields were low. Work at this farm is largely under the direction of the technical staff members at Lincoln. The crop that receives most emphasis is potatoes. This was the eighth year of varietal testing of cereal crops. A spring and winter wheat nursery and field plats for winter wheat and spring grains are included in these tests. Winter wheat variety tests included 14 varieties planted on stubble land in field plat trials. Yields in general were low. The spring-grain variety tests included field-plat plantings of 14 spring wheats, 10 of oats, and 13 of barley varieties, on stubble land. Corn, sorghum, soybean and artichoke variety tests were planted but because of severe grasshopper infestation and drouth were abandoned. The potato program was in most respects a continuance of the work carried for the past several seasons. The breeding project was enlarged </seg>
         <seg id="p065">¦; •'¦;.•¦ Fifty-third Annum. Report . j! in 1939. Insect control presented a major problem. Potato yields on fallow f were satisfactory. . i) New work included a dry-land tomato variety test, in which 75 !&gt;. varieties were tested. The Soil Conservation Service established a new j research project on water penetration and cover. . STATE SERUM PLANT On July 11, 1939, the State Serum Plant was closed by order of the Board of Regents and serum stock was disposed of to the highest bidder, the Nebraska Farm Bureau Federation, for 38J4. cents per hundred cubic centimeters. The equipment was also sold. During the time covered by this rpport there was little hog cholera in Nebraska and demand for serum was light.
