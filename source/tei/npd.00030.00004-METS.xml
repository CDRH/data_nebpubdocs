The of the application of manure upon land under rotations is mag studied. kSoint- of the investigations carried on at the central Experi - ■iir Station relative to the effect of rotation upon the crop pro - cm-: paver of soils are as follows: According to information procured from thirty-one pro - - ve farmers, the yields of corn are practically doubled when alfalfa and clover are introduced into a systematic rotation of i ii»|is The average vields of corn produced by the thirty-one hiwn iM-fore the ground was seeded to alfalfa or clover was :u.."i bushels per acre, while the yield of corn from these same tields \\;is •&gt;&gt;•_&gt; bushels per acre after the legume crops were liroken up. This shows the very great effect of leguminous crops upon the yields of succeeding crops of corn. These fields were m alfalfa or clover for ;i varying length of time. The longest lime any one of these farmers allowed the land to remain in a leguminous crop i MM. Most of them, however, allowed the leguminous crop*! to remain for one- or two-year periods. There are several reasons advanced for the wonderful effects upon the crop yields of corn grown upon alfalfa or clover land, among which is the increase of nitrogen content of soil, as shown l»y the dark green color of the succeeding corn crop when grow - ing. This increase in nitrogen content has been noted by several i:\|&gt;eriiiicnt Stations after careful chemical analyses of the soils before and after the {-row th of leguminous crops. </seg>

Pane should be cut when the first leads begin to ripen. Tf the cane is sown late it will probably ot be necessary to cut it nntil time for frost. This gives *he dvantajre of curing the cane nt a time when there is seldom nch rnin. The feeding value is superior to Platte Valley rairie hay. At.fai.fa.- — Alfalfa is the most valuable forage crop that we fan prow. On the bench land where the subsurface water is 20 feet below the surface, it produces 4 to S tons of hay per acre vearly. The annual precipitation on this bench land does not have a very marked influence on the growth of the alfalfa. The nlfalfa on the Substation bench land in 1010 made fair crops when the first 13 feet of the soil did not contain any available moisture. On the table land the "Towth depends entirelv on the precipi ition. During years of from 1S to 20 inches of precipitation it rodiieed two crons of ? to one ton each. Tt did not produce crop worth mowing in 1010 tho there m sufficient growth to rovide considerable pasture for hops. The alfalfa on the table ses all the available water to a depth of more than 15 feet. amples of soil to that depth have shown practically no available oisture. yet the alfalfa remained green, hut made little growth.

For the present we can to our species as the Rul' Pine Sawflv. Tloth sexes of the Hull Pine Sawflv are handsomely colored, the female being black willi the thorax, head, and legs rufous and the body variously striped with bright yellow, while the male is black relieved by ■ How marks on the head, abdomen, and legs. APPEARANCE AND HABITS OF THE LARVAE The larvae of the Hull Pine Sawflv are n&gt;ns»&gt;icuonsly - various and recur in bmx-hes nt twenty-five up to fifty or seventv - imong the needles at the tips of the branches. Here they ding closely with their abdominal legs, the caudal curl also tightly wrapping the needles, and in feedins begin at the tips of the needles anil devour them toward their bases. There is an evident sexual disparity in size, the females being distinctly the larger. From the known larvae of related species of Diprion — M, nhhnti. fnhricii. ahirth and protti- our larvae are at distinguishable by their dark green, unspotted but longitn - dinallv lined body and bright red head. In the spring the larvae are almost continually engaged in a </seg>
            <seg id="p051">12 </seg>
            <seg id="p052">13 jM-ruliar motion, that of throwing back the fore end of the body to the middle or a little beyond until it is almost at right angles to the needle upon which the larva is attached and then qnite suddenly snapping back to the horizontal position. On May 29 ■ clump of larvae was observed for four hours during the mid - dle of the day and not for a moment did they cease this motion. Obviously this characteristic proves a valuable protection to the larvae from the parasites, numbers of which were flitting about ninong the trees, as these insects seemed exceedingly averse to at - tacking a moving larva. In the fall, when the larvae are con - ably smaller, this throwing back of the body is exaggerated until the head and tail almost touch, but there is little or no snapping return to the normal position at this time and fhe posture is generally assumed only when the larvae are disturbed in some way, being leisurely abandoned soon after the disturb ■an ceases. The larvae at this time also have the habit of exud lag from their mouths drops of a white viscous fluid, especially when disturbed in some way. THE LARVAE IN SPRING When the weather becomes warm enough in the spring the M which have hibernated on the trees begin feeding vigor ■ nislv jiikI soon reach full growth. At the same time the defolia - • lue to this feeding soon becomes evident, and, by tht first ' iy when the larvae are nearly full sized and become lew ravenous, the tops of the trees have become conspicuously denuded. Alxuit this time they stop feeding to any great extent in the daytime and soon thereafter begin dropping to the ground to spin up. At the time of my first visit to the region, on May lie larvae were still very abundant on the tree* but much leas so than they had been a week or ten days previously, accord - ing to the reports of the settlers. By June 10 they had almost disappeared from the trees and only here and there could be found in anv abundance, trees that were covered with them </seg>

In presenting the conceptions of gametic coupling and of spurious ullelomorphisni, Bateson has warned us against confusing the two ideas. 1 " To me, however, they seem funda- Rilly the same phenomenon. Hateson (toe. tit.) pointed out if a case of perfect coupling were known it might be re - ■d as the converse of spurious allelomorphism; that is, the former might be represented as the result of attraction and the latter us the result of repulsion between dominant factors. For me, however, it is difficult to conceive of two genes always at - tracting each other under certain circumstances and just as per - sistent I \ repelling each other under other circumstances, partic - ularly when the only discernible difference in the circumstances is that in one case both characters happened to be present in ; a rent and in the other case the two were in separate par - liametic coupling and spurious allelomorphism seem to • bear the same relation to each other as do positive and ive correlation in fluctuations. The latter seem directly *ite; but nevertheless to say, for instance, that earliness in some plant is negatively correlated with tallness is merely another way of saying that it is positively correlated with short - ness. Similarly, to say that red pericarp in maize is allelo - morphic to red cob is to say also that it is genetically correlated with white cob. Spurious allelomorphism, in this case at least, is to be regarded as negative genetic correlation. In one case two dominant characters are associated; in the other case one dominant character is associated with the absence of the other one. These relationships may be represented graphically some - what as I represented the possible relationships of the two fac - tors assumed to be necessary for the production of mottling in beans. 1 * An individual that is heterozygous in the characters A and B might have any of the formulas below: ■ Bateson, W.

That winr lenerth and eve color are Inherited independently of each other In certain cases, tho both are se*- llmlted.

Apparently the case under consideration is one of per correlation of distinct characters. &gt;t the least interesting feature of the maize families dis - cuaaed above is the fact that in two of them the two height classes were so sharply segregated.

VARIATIONS FOIND IN MAIZE PLANTS Variability with Zea mays is so great that 6 groups and some 500 varieties are recognised. 1 The greatest variation is found in the size, shape, and character of kernel, and it is prin - cipally upon these modifications that the classification of va - ■h is baaed. The next greatest variation is in size of plant. In other characters, however, the genus is remarkably uniform, specially in tyjx&gt; of leaf, type of stem, and the infloresence. All ■peek* and varieties intercross freely. E:hin a group, such as dent corn or Hint corn, usually the range of variation may be found in size of plant, color n. and shape of grain, tho there is a recognized limit in !er of the grain, such as starchy endosperm, flinty endo - floury endosperm, or saccharous endosperm. Within a recognized variety the variation in color of kernel nited to one recognized color, or even shade of color, ex - • »|.t where the grain is variegated, as in calico corn. There is always some recoguized type, of kernel for each variety, but a high degree of fluctuation in average weigh* and average length of kernel. This variation is in some measure inheritable, due partly to the mixed parentage of varieties and the lack of rigid lion to type, and partly to the influence on growth of local environment, which must, of course, vary in some degree with each individual. i Sturdevant, Bui. 57, Office of Experiment Stations. </seg>

It seems probable that stalk and leaf would show a closer relationship in jjrowth than leaf and ear, as the latter is in a sense a product of these parts. B sight of Plant. — Table 8 shows the total weight of the to varv from about .'?7"i grams to 9C3 grams, while Table 7 able 9 show the frequency distribution of the plants ac - g to total weight. The highest degree of correlation is between total weight and leaf area, 0.584. but this is not close, as is shown in column 6.

It would ■■■•■t here that the small plants have a gr relative leaf area. I.vKiiK ami Small I'i.an :ts Have About the Same Proportion II ami Stai.k. In Table S. column 7. with the exception of r 1 1 • - first case (which contains plants almost barren), there is no marked difference in proportion of ear to stalk, the stalk on \ era ire having ;il&gt;ont two-thirds the weight of the ear. This niicht not Ik- true if large and small varieties were compared small varieties usually having a higher proportion of ear. Wkiciit m Ear. Table 10 is a summary of plants arranged according to weight of ear and Table 11 shows the various cor r.-l:ition coefficients. Weight of ear is the most interesting char acter from a practical standpoint, since it is an indication of productiveness. It will be seen from Table 11 that there are no high correlations, indicating that variation in size of ear is met with only small corres]&gt;onding changes in other parts of the Relative vehsus Actual Productiveness. — If the relative &gt;f ear produced, rather than the actual size, be used as a measure of productivity then Table 2 offers an opportunity to study the characters of some productive and nonproductive plants. In the fir^t three cases the ear is about twice the weight of the stalk but in +he last three the stalk is heaviest, yet the total weight of plant remains about constant. A study of the data does not show a marked change in other characters of the plant to correspond. Tn Table 10, where the same plants are arranged according to actual yieH per jdnnt, the increased size of ear is accompanied by some increase in all parts of the plant. There is no closo relationship between any character of the plant and productiveness as judged either by the actual or by the relative size of car. Tf characters were closely correlated. </seg>

There is considerable irregularity in tin- distribution of the anaerobes (onlv facultative anaerobes wmm found) if the number foot by foot is taken, but a mean would show a slight increase to the tenth foot, which is the maximum in both fields. </seg>
