LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT. 

PHYSICIAN'S REPORT 

To the Honorable Board of Trustees of the Nebraska lnstitut 

for the Blind. Nebraska City, Neb 

Gentlemen: I herewith submit my biennial rep. 
term ending November 30, 1900. 

During this period there has been very little severe sickness. 
In the winter of 1899-1900 there was an unusual amount of catarrhal 
fever and throat affections; one case of typhoid fever. 
which recovered; and one of emphysema, which terminated 
fatally. 

The hygienic condition of the school is excellent, and during 
the present season the health of pupils and teachers has been 
exceptionally good. 

Unremitting care is exercised in perfecting healthful measures. 
Cleanliness, pure air, industry and conformity to school 
regulations and duties are the watchwords of superiors and 
students. 

Pasteur filters have been secured since our last report: hem 
the drinking water is pure and healthful. 

Expert examination determined that there were seven pup

ications in a teacher. Unconsciously they mold the character 

urnish the model to be copied, and largely furnish the ideals 

or attainment. 

I herewith submit the reports of teachers for the bienninm. 

In the discipline of the school we have treated each student as 

we would have a Superintendent rreat our child 

Economy, integrity, and promptness have guided us in the 

jusiness affairs of the institution 

There were a score or more of seeing pupils admitted by 
loctor's certificates in previous years. Many of these were 
apable of securing an education in the common schools of the 
tate. The Superintendent and Board of Trustees secured the 

ervices of an oculist of reputation, who upon examination re- 

ected seven pupils, and a number of seeing pupils left the institution 
before tlie examination was held. 

I herein transcribe the closing words of Dr. Dayton's report 

o me. bearing date April 30, 1900: 

In rendering this report I have acted with the greatest care 

and discretion, not wishing to injure the future of those ex- 

amined nor do an injustice to a worthy child of the state. I am

1899 I have been its Teacher ol Mathematics from September 
1S94. to the present time: my opinion and methods, therefor* 
are not the fruit of a priori speculation but the tried results o 
years of thoughtful experience. Some of these results are en 
bodied in this report, which aims to set forth briefly what is ac 
ually accomplished in my classes. 

My pupils come to me from the Primary Department with a 
very rudimentary knowledge of notation and numeration, addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, and division, and a slight acquaintance 
with fractions. In the next four years they complete 
what is popularly known as •practical arithmetic." We use to 
some extent Robinson's Arithmetic reprinted in a system of embossed 
points, but our main reliance is on oral instruction.. Each 
problem is studied without reference to set rules, various solutions 
are discussed, and the pupils then decide which is best, 
giving definite reasons for their choice. Clear apprehension of 
principles, lucid explanations, and logical solutions are insisted 
upon, and mere facility in obtaining answers is not tolerated. 
We depend solely upon mental computation. Tangible apparatus 
has been devised as substitutes for blackboard and tablet, 
but it is useful only in teaching beginners the forms of written 

arithmetic. My pupils ¦•tind the interest of f97:?.6S for i in 

9 days, at 4i&gt;." "extract the cube root of 270, 671, 777, 032, 18

aids of any kind. In a well graded class every pup 

ollows a recitation as if the work was visible before liii 

is eager with corrections and criticisms, and ready at an; 
moment to continue the recitation, if called upon to do so. I 
is obvious that under such conditions the study of arithmetic ha 
a high culture value for the blind. 

For the satisfactory completion of elementary algebra. tw&lt; 
years are required. Peck's Algebra in point is used as a textbook 
Our methods here are substantially the same as those in arithme 

tic. and the results are equally satisfactory. At first the pupil; 
find literal quantities more difficult to remember than numerica 
ones, but later they are able to cope successfully with long anc

ture value of this course is even greater tbau that iu arith

and a general review of mathematics, completes the course. 

st year the class finished solid geometry in less than four 

nths. Well's Elementary Geometry, reprinted iu point, is 
-d as a text-book and is thoroughly mastered. This work is 

ry well adapted to the needs of the blind. This is especially 
ne in plane geometry, where every diagram is perfectly reproit-ed 
in tangible form. In solid geometry this is impossible, 
id the difficulty is, therefore, much greater. My pupils are 

tight to discover these diagrams from the description given in 
t- demonstrations, and generally succeed in doing so. When 

fail, a little oral description, supplemented — if necessary 

by blocks and improvised figures, usually suffices. They carry 
»¦ most intricate diagrams in memory while reciting, and 

wer (|iiestions as readily and intelligently as if the figure 
% visible before them. In original exercises they invent appro- 

ate mental diagrams, describing them clearly and accurately, 

il produce demonstrations that compare favorably with the 

&gt;dels given in their text-books. My pupils take pardonable 
ide in exhibiting their attainments before intelligent visitors, 

d justly claim a greater meed of praise than would be accorded 
r the same work done under more favorable conditions.

and may be accounted for psychologically. But experience 
shows that thorough daily drill, "out of a spelling-book."' will 
develop in the blind, as well as in seeing pupils, some degree 
of that sixth sense— the sense orthographical— acquired by 
our fathers and mothers in the same way. 

Regular class work in language and literature should be made 
a means of developing a sense of order, exactness, and correctness 
of speech and writing. I have combined with such drill, 
studies and readings of good literature, which not only increase 
the knowledge and widen the mental horizon of those too much 
shut in, but also give them the highest ideals of life, and inspire 
them with courage and determination. The blind have great 
neeil of "sweetness and light" in their lives.

HISTORY 

To J. E. Harris, Superintendent: 

Long exi&gt;erience in the work familiarizes the teacher with the 
indisputable fact that the blind are. as a rule, more introspective 
and of keener intuitive perceptions than are seeing pupils of a 
like age, possessing similar social environments. Their sensibil 
ity is quick to note what is worthy of emulation, and to denounce 

in equally forcible Term's a type of character that

INSTITrTIOX FOR THE BLIND 

and fairly accurate, yet are they necessarily limited; owing in 
part to the circumscribed bounds of social life which too often 
close round a blind child, and prove a hindrance to the development 
of an all-rounded character. In these limitations the blind 
youth is ill fitted for the conditions of life as they are; is unable 
to seize the underlying principle of society — that action is quite 
as necessary as thought; and more often fails to comprehend 
that an event is not always as worthy of investigation as is its 

cause 

It is the purpose of a carefully selected course of study to en- 

courage a stronger mentality and to develop character. We 
have aimed to introduce a line of work that shall meet the 

requirements of our pupils. 

History, more than any other study, portrays life as it actually 

is: and over against base desires and ignoble purposes it sets 
forth the grandest achievements but always at the expense of 
undaunted and unremitting labor. Hence, history is made an 
important sociological study in our curriculum of daily work.

PRIMARY DEPARTMENT. 

To J. E. Harris. Superintendent: 

Iu order to present clearly the purpose of the work whicb 
is now being done iu the Primary Department, it is important 
that the real nature of the work shall first be rightly understood. 
The Primary Department of our institution, although frequently 
referred to as "the Kindergarten." is such mei-ely in name. It 
is true that at one time considerable attention was given tokindergarten 
work. More advanced work has since been introduced, 
and .there are at present four primary grades. This partial 
chauge i8 simply the result of an attempt to make the 
primary work of such a character that it shall meet the need* 
of all pupils entering this department. 

As a rule, the blind girl or boy is not sent to school until 
i j_r lit or nine ream of age. Having reached such an age. the 
hild should begin at once the process of laying the foundatiou 
n which rests the broader education of later years. Frequently 

pupils of more mature years are obliged to begin in the primary 
grades. In order, therefore, to meet the needs of all. it is deemed* 

liiii tin- subject taught in the lower grades shall lie those 

vhich will establish, and fix in the minds of the pupils, a few 
uut)ameutal principles. The course of study now pursued in- 

lutles Arithmetic. Language. Spelling, and the reading and

ments of this branch of study. Frequent calls for the writing of 
letters, stories, etc., demand an application of the principles 
learned. Such exercises as the above reveal to the teacher the 
ability and inclinations of the pupils, and in this way enable her 
so to plan and present the work that it shall be helpful to each 
member of the class. In connection with the regular Language 
work, occasional lessons are given which treat of articles that 
are in daily use, such as glass, paper, brick, the various grains, 
spices, beverages, etc. Lessons of this kind arouse the interest 
of even the youngest pupils, and are at the same time of an instructive 
character. 

Too much importance cannot be attached to the necessity of 
pupils early learning to spell correctly. It is only too true that 
in the matter of spelling blind persons are found to be very 
deficient. There are, however, reasons why spelling is so difficult 
for one who- cannot see. There is formed no mental picture of 
a word, for he who reads by touch cannot see the entire word 
.at a glance, as does he who reads by sight. As no great amount 
of reading is required in the preparation of lessons, pupils read 
but little for themselves, but depend almost entirely upon those 
who can see. Consequently there is lost the opportunity of becoming 
familiar with and learning to spell words. In order to 
overcome, so far as is possible, the difficulties mentioned. Spelling 
has been made a part of the Primary work, and is receiving 
special attention. 

As the reading must be done through the sense of touch, it 
should be learned at as early an age as possible. The boy or 
girl of more mature years .finds it very difficult to master the 
Point, and rarely succeeds in becoming a rapid reader. 

Great as may be the interest with which the teacher watches 
the mental development of her pupils, never ought she to forget 
the importance of heart culture. To train each little girl to be 
ladylike, each little boy to be gentlemanly, to inspire in the 
heart of each an earnest desire to do right, are duties which are 
as much a part of the Primary work as is any one of the studies 
included in the course. 

Respectfully.

INSTITUTION FOE THE BLIND. 

MISIC KKADKK. LIBRARIAN. TYPEWRITING. 

Io J. E. Harris, Su]&gt;eriutendent. 

Sih: I have the honor to submit my report as Music Reader, 
Librarian, and Teacher of Tyj&gt;ewriting. 

October 1. 1899. I was employed as Music Reader for this 
institution. Previous to that time the music had been read to 
the pupil by the teacher during. lesson hours. This made it very 
hard for both teacher and pupil, as the lesson period was limited 
to only thirty minutes. Under the present system the pupil 
copies his music into New York Point from dictation by the 
reader. It is then memorized and practiced, and, when he 
appears before the teacher, he is practically on the same footing 
as the seeing child. Moreover he has an exact reproduction of 
the priuted music for future reference. About 2,500 pages of 
such music have been produced. To facilitate the work I have 
copied into "point" all band, orchestra and chorus music and 
almost all music for the voice and primary piano pupils. About 
tive hours daily of dose application on &gt;my part are required to 
accomplish these results. 

In September. 1900, I became Librarian of this institution. 
Besides many pamphlets, we have about 1,200 bound volumes, 
half of which are ink print and the remainder point. I have 
the sole care and custody of these books and am preparing to 
rearrange and recatalogue them — a much needed improvement. 
The library is open at stated hours for the use of the pupils 
and teachers and a careful record is kept of all books loaned. 
Many new books have been added during the present biennium, 
but many more are sadly needed. 

In September, I'.IOO. it was also found necessary for me to 
teach the typewriting. The pupils are taught letter writing and 
business correspondence and are required to prepare much of 

i heir class work on the typewriter. They readily learn to adjust 
their paper for themselves and to move back the carriage to 
make a correction. They also learn the mechanism and care 
of the machine. The progress is necessarily slow, but, under 
the guidance of a skillful and enthusiastic teacher, the final </seg>

results are highly satisfactory. Daring 1 lie eight years that 1 
have beeu connected with this school I hate seen much excellent 
typewriting done by the blind and I have pupils who began the

value of this work can hardly be overestimated.

November 30, 1900. 

Our Music Department is divided into four branches: Piano 
forte. Violin, Voice and the Theoretical studies. Harmony 
Theory and History of Music, which are requirements for gradu 
ation. 

The number of pupils receiving instruction in the various 
brandies of the department, during the biennium. is as follows: 

The Pianoforte Course is divided into six grades, the Violin 
and Voice each into four, all of which courses must be completed, 
according to the ability of the pupil, in from four lo 
&lt;^igl)t years. The post-graduate work done is not excelled by any 
of the regular conservatories making a specialty of music; high 
standards are attained, not only for the student as an artist, but 
as teacher. 

The system of tutoring is continued whereby the advanced 
pupils are teaching beginners under the immediate supervision 
of the Director. Our Normal Department has proven to be one 
of the greatest aids to the pupils, in giving them practical ex 
perience.

IXSTITl'TIOX FOR THE BLIND. 

In connection with, ami under the same direction as the 
Violin Department, we have an orchestra and band. Besides 
being a recreation our orchestra and hand rehearsals are very 
instructive. 

In connection with the Voice Department are two senior 
choruses and one junior chorus. 

The printed music is changed into point music. For this work 
we employ a reader, whose duty it is to read the music by position 
from the staff. After the music is thus written in point, 
it is memorized and executed. 

We have added to the department during the bieiininm the 
following number of instruments: Two new pianofortes, which 
provides us with a fair supply of good instruments; one reed 
organ, three violins, one violoncello, one piccolo, one viola, one 
B-fiai cornet, one double-bell euphonium, one tambourine, and 
one pair of castanets. With constant use these instruments 
soon wear out and have to be replaced by new ones. A fund 
will be needed for this purpose. 

The necessity of having a bandstand to meet the requirements 
of the work in that department seems a growing need, 
ami an appropriation for the same is respectfully solicited. 

It gives me great pleasure to nnd a growing interest, and a 
desire to do better work. Musicales are given frequently by the 
pupils, and very gratifying have been the results, proving that 
the Musical Department is one of the most important factors 
in our school, titting them for a position in life where they will 
be and have l&gt;een of value to themselves and to the world. 

To -I. E. Hants. Superintendent 

In response to your request. I hereby submit thft following

carpet weaving and net and hammock making. The number of 
students in each department, during the last bienninm. is as 
follows: Piano tuning, 34; broom making. 34; weaving. 34; and 
hammock and net making, 41. 

TUNING HEPARTMEXT 

This department at present is well supplied with pianos for 
practice. We have two old square pianos for beginners and one 
upright for the use of the more advanced pupils. Piano tuning 
is considered to be one of the most profitable employments for 
a blind person to follow, and it is the aim of this Department to 
lit each and every one who completes the course, so that he may 
be a competent and thorough tuner. In order more successfully 
to accomplish these results, we need more tools, a supply of 
material to be used in repairing the practice pianos, which are 
constantly wearing out. We also need a number of models of the 
standard piano actions, so that the pupil may become thoroughly 
familiar with their mechanical construction. This familiarity 
is now obtained by the pupil examining the different pianos which 
are now in the building. But as the pianos are so constantly 
in use, the opportunity for examining them is limited. These 
tools, material and models can be purchased at a moderate cost 
of seventy-five or a hundred dollars. We think that this money 
would be well spent, and the pupils in this department would 
be greatly benefited thereby. 

BROOM MAKIN"&lt; 

In this department the pupils are taught to make all kinds of 
brooms and brushes. During the last two years, thirty-four have 
received instruction in this work. We need more room for 
storing our brooms and material, also a new press should be 
bought to replace the old one, which is nearly worn out. We 
need a new bleach box and a drying room. 

WEAVING DEPARTMENT. 

Within the last three years, two fly shuttle rag carpet looms 
have been placed in our workshop, and after a fair test, we </seg>

believe that this occupation will afford a means of gaining a 
livelihood for many of our boys and girls. In this work our 
pupils become as proficient as the average seeing weaver, and 
are able to do all kinds of plain and fancy rag carpet weaving. 

NET AND HAMMOCK MAKING. 

Nearly every pupil who enters the institution is taught to 
make hammocks, fly nets and fish nets. Although this is not a 
very remunerative trade, it is a means by which a number of 
our pupils earn enough money during the summer to pay their 
expenses through the following term of school. 

It is the aim of the Industrial Department to make each of its 
graduates self-supporting. In order that this may be more successfully 
accomplished and to meet the demands made upon 
this department by the increasing number of students from year 
to year, some new trades should be added, and a building should 
be erected for the use of the Industrial Department. This 
would economize the teacher's time and energy, more pupils 
could be taught and better results would be obtained. 

Respectfully, Clark Baucb. 
Director of Industrial Department. 

JIRLS INDUSTRIAL DEPARTMENT. 

To J. E. Harris. Superintendent. 

Dear Sir: The number of pupils enrolled in this department 
for the past bieunium was 51. 

They are taught sewing, knitting, crocheting, and beadwork. 

They do hemming and seaming very well; crocheting and in 
knitting they can do as good work as one who can see. 

The majority of them do beadwork and some of the work cannot 
be excelled. 

Respectfully submitted, 

Mrs. F. H. Marnell. </seg>
