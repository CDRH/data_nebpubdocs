            <seg id="p002">THE MARKETING OF MIXED GRAINS. H. C. FILLEY AND P. L. GADDIS. Wheat which contains any appreciable amount of rye is less valuable for making flour than is pure wheat. Because of this the buyers in every terminal market pay less for wheat containing rye, than for unmixed wheat. The manager of a country elevator buying wheat direct from the producer, must either discriminate against mixed grain or his elevator company must accept a loss. The difference in price is always greater in a milling market than in a storage market. The miller buys wheat on the basis of its immediate value for making flour; the storage merchant buys upon the basis of future value. The miller cannot use a car of wheat containing 2 per cent of rye; the storage merchant can purchase it, mix it with perhaps 10 cars containing no rye, and the percentage of the rye becomes negligible. It may then be delivered to the miller upon contract. The Minneapolis market is primarily a milling market, 95 per cent of the Nebraska wheat shipped there going direct to the mills. The market will absorb but little rye-mixed wheat, and that only at a sharp discount, since the miller says he does not want it at any price. In order to determine just how much the Minneapolis millers discount wheat containing rye, four mixtures were offered for sale to various milling companies. The first con - tained Nebraska wheat, 1914 crop, and per cent of rye by weight; the second, 1 per cent rye; the third, 2 per cent rye; and the fourth, 3 per cent rye. They made little objection to the \ per cent rye, but on the 1 per cent mixture the discount ran all the way from 1 to 5 cents. On the 2 per cent and 3 per cent mixtures no opinion was forthcoming. They simply stated that they would not buy wheat of that character. The Chicago market usually discriminates in price against wheat containing \ per cent up to 2 per cent of rye to the extent of 1 cent a bushel. The discrimination depends upon the quality of the wheat as well as upon the quantity of rye. About the same discrimination is found in other terminal markets where con - siderable wheat is stored. In general, millers refuse to buy wheat containing more than 1 per cent of rye. It must be mixed in the storage elevator with wheat free from rye. The miller bases his refusal to buy wheat containing rye upon the demands of the American housewife for flour that will </seg>
            <seg id="p003">make white bread. A very small per cent of rye mixed with wheat gives the flour a grayish tint. This cannot be remedied by bleaching, nor the rye and wheat be separated by screening. Rye flour does not make quite as light bread as does wheat flour, nor is the flavor the same. These differences, however, are of minor importance, since a change in color is noticeable when the mixture contains too little rye to affect either texture or flavor. The threshing machine which threshes wheat immediately after rye, is the most common cause of mixing the two cereals, altho tlr sowing of wheat following rye is in some measure responsible. When the seed is once mixed, if conditions are unfavorable, the proportion of rye seems to increase from year to year. Farmers may prevent further mixing by avoiding the sowing of wheat following rye, and by sowing clean seed. The first load of wheat threshed after threshing rye should never be used for seed. ATS CONTAINING A HIGH PERCENTAGE OF BARLEY MUST BE SOLD BY AMPLE" INSTEAD OF BY "GRADE." Probably the easiest method of procuring clean seed is to purchase it. Usually some farms in every neighborhood have clean wheat. When a farmer desires to keep his own seed, especially where it is not badly mixed, he may go into the grain after it has headed out and pull out the rye from a patch suf - ficiently large to furnish seed for the following year. It must be cut and threshed separately. The first essential step in procuring a good price for any product, is to have something to sell for which there is a demand. The market demands wheat free from rye. The grower must meet the demands of the market or accept a lower price. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">In some sections of the State where early oats are grown, barley has become a serious pest. It ripens with the oats and gains on it during the seasons which are less favorable to the oats. Little attention has been given it where the oats are fed on the farm, since the total yield per acre (in pounds) is increased and the barley is a good feed. Where oats are raised for market the barley-oats mixture is resulting in a noticeable loss to the farmers. Mixed grain is sold at a terminal market, not by grade but by sample. Because of this, an elevator manager can never sell such grain "to arrive," and can form only a very rough estimate as to the price which he will receive. When the percentage of oats containing barley was small the elevator and terminal market would absorb it by mixing with clean oats. Under such conditions the discount was often not large enough to counteract the increase in weight due to the barley. At the present time the grower of oats mixed with barley must expect a cut in price which will more than over - come the advantage of the added weight. The very obvious remedy for the present condition is to sow clean seed. Usually good seed oats may be obtained from a neighbor, but if that is not possible, the oats and barley may be separated fairly closely by the use of water. If the mixture is thrown into a pail or small tank of water, and stirred up well, most of the barley will sink to the bottom, leaving the oats on the surface. They may be skimmed off and dried for seeding. It is possible to remove any barley which remains, by pulling it up after heading. This method is not practicable for a large field, but only for a seed patch. This patch should be harvested and threshed separately. The loss occasioned by mixed grain of any kind is an easily preventable loss. It may be stopped by the sowing of pure seed, and using reasonable care to prevent future mixing. The market demands a dzfinite, standard product, and the only known way by which the grower can avoid a discount is to standardize his product to meet the market demands. 10 M </seg>
