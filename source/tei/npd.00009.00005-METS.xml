on the work uf a food ooaMMMOM witlioiit the services of a 
vhemist at all times at the command of the Commission, and aw it 
wm apparent at the time your deputy took charge of the office. 
¦Ml has since proven true, that I lie amount of fees which coulil 
l&gt;e collected under the law would not be sufficient to pav for the 
services separately of both a clerk anil a rhtmist, it was deeme&lt;l 
lic-t to employ as a clerk one also oonipetent to do the work of a 
chemist: wilh this object in view Mr. J. M. Nelson, ;i graduate 
of the state univert-ity, waa employed an&lt;l liegan work July 1. 
P.tol. No provision had l&gt;een made for a laboratory or for fund* 
!•¦ MtaMiall and maintain one, but through the kindness of the 
reirents, the chancellor and I'rof. II. II. Nicholson uf the state 
university the commission has been freely granted the use of both 
laboratory and supplies for making analyses, at the experiment 
station: for this kindness mi the part of the university authorities 
I hr officers of the commission are very grateful as it enabled them 
to have made analyses and pursue investigations which otherwise 
it would have been impossible to have done. 

I To successfully carry on the work of a food commission it is 
only neeessary but imperative that provision be made for a 
equipped laboratory but for the services of a competent 

hcinist ax well 

In order to make the present law self supporting, provision 
was made for the issuing of permits to certain manufacturers ami 
dealers who came under its provisions upon the payment, 
annually, to the state of s|&gt;ecitied. fees. 

I The section of the act (see. 8) relating to the payment of 
is as follows; 

K'-Sk&lt; . H. For said permits and the services performed in 
nection therewith, including the inspection :in provided by

Em, Ten Dollars ($10.00), payable in each and every case into

While the collection of fees from certain dealers who come 
under its provisions make the law self supporting, experience 
proves that such plan is not for t'le best interests of all parties 
concerned. 

If a food commission law in of l&lt;enetit to the people of the 
itata then it should be supported by the public and not by a few 
dealers who come under its provisions, but who are not personally 
b— eittsd to any greater extent than are the great mass of the 
people who an not dealers but consumers. Not only is much 
time, effort and expense required to collect these fees but the 
amount which can be collected in any one year is uncertain and 
wholly inadequate for the proper and efficient support of the

T1IK DAIKY INDISTUV. 

Tfce year I'.w-j has been a prosperous one for the dairy industry 
in Nebraska. The increase in butter production for the 
war is estimated at -V-i^ percent as compared with 1001. This 
increase is practically all of creamery make, as the production &lt;&gt;l 
dain butter is about the same as for the previous year. This 
increase is due largely to two causes: less wasteful methods in 
the handling of milk and the separation of the cream, and better 
prices for dairy products. 

There is&gt; no provision made in the statutes of Nebraska for 

gathering accurate and detailed st

&gt;A1UY STATISTICS OF NEBRASKA 

Proa the 17th Annual Keportof the Nebraska Dairymen's Association 

L "Through the kindness of Mr. L &lt;!. PowcfS, chief statist;-for 
agriculture. I ;nn enabled to give, in advaawa of the 

liar |iiil&gt;li&lt;-:ili&lt;&gt;ii. mm st atisiics in regard to the dairy industry in 

Nebraska as abowa by the I*. S. oeaoaja returns for ItN. In the 
comparison* made at between the census retama for I9M m.l 

1900, attention is invited t&lt;&lt; a few items of motc than ordinary 

treat. Tin* increase in the iiiiiiiIkt of milch eowa was oa)ly 
I'.t. or L.I |&gt;er cent, while the increase in butler product ion for 

the same period was 12,349,978 |&gt;ounils. or M par cent. At tirM 

thought tliis marked increase might be accounted for in the larger 

use by dairymen of improved breeds of dairy cows, Imt 1 am 

more inclined to credit the increase largely to the improved met'h 

tof separating the butter-fat from the whole milk: the use of 
MMora for the separation of cream instead of the deep can of 
How pan system, which often left from 1 "i to ."&gt;() per cent of 

the batter-fat in the skimmed milk. It is true that there has been 
a marked improvement in the use of better brad dairy cow 

has Keen in the methods id' separating the cream from the milk.

lie made in the state, but rather

Quite a contrast is shown in the increase in value of dairy

that oleomargarine colored yellow should lie taxed ten (in) 
cents per )K&gt;und while the uncolored article should pay a tax of 

le-fourth (^) of one (1) cent per pound. The original n&lt;-t 

placed a tax of two (•_') cents per pound on all 

'I in 

oleomargarine. Probably no bill introduced in eomgimm, ew-r 
received more careful and patient hearing and investigation than 
the so called --(irout Hill." First the House &lt; 'ommiUee on

packing house interests: all manufacturers and dealers in oleomar 
gerine: live stock commission exchanges together with the cott«,n 
•eed oil interests of the southern stales, a considerable per cent of 
cotton seed oil lieing used in the manufacture of oleomargerine. 
It goes without saying that the interests here mentioned, as 
opposed to the passage of this bill, had a commanding influence 
in both state and national affairs both from a political as well M I 
commercial stand point. 

Most actively interested in the passage of the measure wen 
the organized dairy interests id' the entire country: almost without 
exception the entire agricultural press of the country: national 
and slate organizations interested in the development of our 
agricultural resources: state dairy and food commissioners; produce 
exchanges; dairymen and farmers gi nnnlljj ami a large per 
cent of the consumers of dairy products. These facts are here 
|&gt;re»ented to show that the enactment of this law m not hastily 
done or ill advised: that it was not, as claimed, enacted a; the 
lichest of a so called -'creamery trust:" that it is the result of a 
twenty years struggle in halls of legislation and courts of justice
