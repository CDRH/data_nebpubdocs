            <seg id="p004">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 313 HOSPITAL FOR TUBERCULOUS Kearney, Nebraska To His Excellency, Honorable John H. Morehead, Governor, and to the Honorable members of the Board of Commis - sioners of State Institutions, Howard Kennedy, Henry Gerdes and Silas A. Holcomb: Gentlemen: I present herewith the third biennial report for this institution covering the period from December 1, 1914, to November 30, 1916. The Hospital for Tuberculous was provided for by an Act of the Legislature of 1911, and in January, 1912, was opened to patients. The hospital is situated on the "Lincoln Highway" which leads from coast to coast, exactly midway between Boston and San Francisco at an altitude of 2100 feet above sea level. The grounds are beautified by many elm trees which are of large size for this part of the State. The broad silver ribbon of the Platte River is visible a couple of miles to the south. The property when acquired by the State included a large and impressive residence built of Colorado sandstone in the early nineties of the last century. This is now used as living quarters for the superintendent and his family, the nurses and other employees. It is referred to as the "Nurses' Home." A frame pavilion for patients was built in the year 1912, consisting of a two-story central structure facing south, with a living room, nurses' office, toilet, dining room and kitchen on the first floor, and a large assembly room on the second floor. On each side is a wing consisting of a row of rooms </seg>
            <seg id="p005">SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF 314 th about eleven by fourteen feet, opening by double doors a long broad porch which faces south. Each room has a north window, and two large transoms on the opposite side, which admits south light and winter sun above the porch roof. The west wing has ten rooms, the east wing six. This provides for thirty-two patients. I The new hospital building with a capacity of fifty-three, designed to accommodate the very sick, or those who are nporarily needing confinement to bed. This is a hand - ne structure of brick and concrete ; the exterior is finished a rough red brick with white stone trimmings. The wards i smaller rooms are provided with large French windows ming out, giving a maximum of light and air. The two rigs are square, and placed at an angle to the central por - n for the purpose of receiving sun on every side at some le in the day. This is an admirable idea, and may work 11 in some situations, but it is not suitable here. In this nate the patients should receive sunshine all day in winter. The purpose of this institution is two-fold: First, to save the life and restore to health and usefulness the patient ho is not already too far gone and, second, to prevent the urther and needless spread of the disease, pulmonary tuber - ulosis or consumption, by removing the patient from others nd by teaching him how to care for himself so that he will become harmless instead of a menace to the household in •hich he lives. This education of the patient is difficult and requires constant and close personal attention. Occasional alks on tuberculosis have been given and the use of a "Ques - on Box" has been encouraged, in order that the things the atients wish to know about themselves and their disease may be explained to them. A small number of excellent &gt;ooks on tuberculosis for the patient and layman is in the patients' library and these are much read. It is hoped that the oming biennium will afford more time and larger opportunity or this very valuable educational work. kThe method of treatment used has been the accepted natorium treatment," absolute rest where required, mild rcise where needed, medicine as little as might be and only </seg>
            <seg id="p006">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 315 as specially indicated for special symptoms, since there has been discovered no medicine which has any effect on the tuberculosis itself except as an aid. Tuberculin has not been used because its use requires such close and careful atten - tion that it has not been deemed advisable while so many other duties crowded the superintendent. It is hoped that in the coming biennium he may have time to seek the benefit from this measure which past experience has shown him may be expected in selected cases. The graded exercise and work referred to as "Autoin - oculation" has been used with great satisfaction. This method, made famous by Paterson of England, provided for the application of graded exercise increased as rapidly as the condition of the patient will permit in order to build up strength and resistance to the disease. This is applied only to patients without fever, and the exercise is controlled by the temperature and pulse of the patient taken after the exercise and again after a half hour's rest in recumbency, by the feeling of fatigue or its absence, by the progress of the patient with reference to gain or loss in weight and the physical signs of disease in the chest. This is regarded as a very important factor in returning a patient to his or her pursuit of a livelihood and in the hardening of the pa - tient so that a return to work will not cause another break - down. This requires close supervision and takes much time. It is hoped that more time may be devoted to it in the future in proportion to its value in treatment. The work of all departments has in the past been hamp - ered by lack of sufficient funds and of assistants and em - ployees. During the past biennium land has been acquired both on the east and west of the original grounds, straightening up the boundary lines and giving a present total of approxi - mately thirty acres. The funds provided by the Legislature of 1913 for a new building have been utilized for a hand - some structure referred to as the "New Hospital Building." Many unfavorable conditions combined to prevent the con - struction of this in the preceding biennium and to delay </seg>
            <seg id="p007">316 its completion until the year just past. During this year there has also been completed a new building containing a central heating plant in the basement with a modern laundry above. A hospital for tuberculosis is essentially a place for the treatment of the sick, and the nature of the disease treated is such that no consideration can be given to productivity, except that it may furnish means for benefit in the treatment of the patient. Other state institutions, such as hospitals for the insane, industrial schools and prisons are caring for in - mates usually physically sound and able to do a full day's work. A full day's work cannot be expected of a patient with tuberculosis, and, even where one may be able to do a few hours' work, this cannot be relied upon as regular and steady productive employment. In spite of this fact Table 18 shows a very gratifying result from the garden which has contributed very materially to the table. Without opening a discussion whether hogs can acquire tuberculosis from human beings as well as from cattle, means have been provided for steam cooking and sterilizing the garbage from the institution so that it may be fed with per - fect safety to the hogs. As the garbage from the patients' tables was formerly destroyed, this constitutes a great sav - ing and renders our herd of hogs a source of income that is practically all profit. A recent change to the cafeteria plan in the serving of meals for such patients as are able to go to the table has also constituted a further noteworthy saving in the elimination of waste. Sanatorium care and treatment in private institutions requires an expenditure ranging from $14 to $60 a week. Persons unable to afford such terms for an indefinite period are indigent so far as obtaining this treatment is concerned, and are regarded as eligible for admittance to this hospital under the legislative act which authorized this institution. If, however, they are not actually destitute, it has been re - garded desirable and just that they should pay to the insti - tution a portion of the cost of their maintenance in propor - tion to their means, and a number have so paid gladly in </seg>

            <seg id="p009">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 317 sums ranging from $5 to $30 a month. This has constituted a small but appreciable source of income. . Reference to Table 1 shows a very gratifying growth in population. At the beginning of this biennium there were present in the institution, eighteen men and seven women, a total of twenty-five patients. The end of the biennium, with the recently opened new hospital building, leaves us with twenty-seven men and twenty-five women, a total of fifty-two patients, and others being received from the waiting list as rapidly as they can be cared for, with the prospect that the present entire capacity of eighty-five will soon be reached. The plans and hopes for the future usefulness of this institution are great. One out of every seven or eight deaths throughout the country is caused by tuberculosis, and it is authoritatively stated that it causes one out of three of the deaths occurring during the working period of life. This means that Nebraska loses probably at least 1500 lives each year from this preventable disease. Expert statisticians have made careful and conservative estimates that each death from tuberculosis causes an average financial loss of $3700 as a minimum estimate. This means an actual money loss of more than five and a half millions of dollars to the State of Nebraska each year. It is the aim and hope that the work of this institution, the results of treatment, the knowledge and the inspiration for the fight against the "Great White Plague," which pa - tients leaving here are expected to take with them, will so aid in the campaign of prevention, that in time this terrible loss of life and money may be eliminated. To accomplish this, much is needed for the equipping and upbuilding of the institution. RECOMMENDATIONS The cost of maintenance of this hospital cannot be com - pared with that of institutions whose inmates are able-bodied and can do a full day's work. Comparison with other in - stitutions for tuberculosis similarly situated, shows that our ODeratinfir exDenses for the Dast vear are even lower than </seg>
            <seg id="p010">318 or.i(_.\J.\ l) Bl K&lt;^ .\ 1AL Ktii UK 1 Ur those reported by many others before the recent marked in - crease in the cost of living. Owing to lack of funds, how - ever, our equipment has been wholly insufficient and the work much cramped. [The biennium began with twenty-five patients ; the ca - city now is eighty-five. The cost of maintenance during ; past year has been about $665 per capita. At the same te without predicting further increase in the cost of living, jre will be need for the coming biennium, the sum of 12,200 for maintenance. I recommend the appropriation this amount for this purpose. EQUIPMENT i There is urgent need for an automobile truck of suf - ent size and capacity to do the hauling of supplies for the titution. This will permit great saving of time and the omplishment of much more work. There is immediate sd for steam tables, steam cookers, refrigerator and refrig - ting machine for the culinary department, and equipment complete the laundry. At least $6,500 should be appro - ated for these purposes. An X-Ray apparatus is urgently sded for the institution, for which I recommend an appro - afion of $2,500. IMPROVEMENTS I There is much need for permanent improvements to ildings and grounds. Great difficulty has been ex - rienced because of inadequate housing of employees. The Curses' Home" is a beautiful building, but very old, and much need of repair. Though large it was designed for comparatively small family. To complete it, extend and re - lir plumbing, heating, electric wiring, etc., will require an ipropriation of $5,000. The old pavilion, the original build - g for patients, is in bad need of extensive repairs. Owing the narrow single flight of stairs to the second floor, and e lack of fire protection, this fine upstairs room is not used, mong other improvements to this building, I recommend -e escapes, the conversion of this second floor assembly room </seg>
            <seg id="p011">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 319 into an open air school for tuberculous children, of whom we are beginning to have a number. I recommend an appropri - ation of $5,000 to repair and improve this building as indi - cated. For sewage disposal, extension of water system, fire pro - tection and genera] improvements on the ground, I recom - mend an appropriation of $5,000. NEW BUILDINGS A residence for the superintendent and his family is urgently needed. The cramped quarters at present occupied at the "Nurses' Home" are unsuitable and otherwise needed. I request an appropriation of $5,500 for this purpose. The very valuable results from our garden and from a small hot bed last winter point to the necessity of a green house, for which I recommend an appropriation of $2,500. A garage will be needed for the auto truck, for which I would recommend the appropriation of $500 and $1,250 for a new horse barn. The old horse barn should be removed. It is a den of rats and because of its proximity to the pa - vilion and the Nurses' Home, it causes a serious menace to health on account of flies. We are much in need of a suitable hog house and hen - nery, I would recommend the appropriation of $550 for the construction of these. We shall undoubtedly soon be in need of provisions for a larger number of patients. In order that our hands may not be tied, as they have been in the past, forcing us to turn a deaf ear to the heartrending appeals that are made in be - half of patients for whom there is no room, I recommend an appropriation of $30,000 for new buildings, to be com - pleted during the coming biennium in order that we may save the lives of a larger number and restore to health and usefulness more of Nebraska's citizens who have become vic - tims of the Great White Plague. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">320 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF LAND More land should be provided to allow for future growth of the institution. Land values in the neighborhood appear to be rising rapidly ; for this reason as well as to permit a unified plan for symmetrical development I recommend the early acquisition of further property. I The writer has met much criticism because of the name ospital for Tuberculous." The name is somewhat awk - rd, is seldom written in this form and is ungrammatical that an adjective is made the object of a preposition. The ommendation is therefore hereby offered that the coming arislature be requested to change the name. State Hospital ■ Tuberculosis would be more suitable; State Sanatorium State Sanatorium for Tuberculosis would harmonize mire ly with the custom of other states. Any one of these three uld avoid the objections made to the present name.

I wish to express thanks on behalf of the patients as well as for myself to all who have contributed to the entertainment and happiness of our people; to the State Industrial School for the concerts which its band has given here, to the Young Women's Christian Association of the State Normal School for the entertainments it has given the patients and the Vic - trola and records which have been its Christmas gifts, to the Kearney Ministerial Association for the Sunday services held for the patients, and to Father Muensterman for the services he has so kindly rendered, and to all the many kind friends who have sent flowers, delicacies and clothing to the patients.
