Morchead, Governor, and to the Honorable members of the Board of Commis - sioners of State Institutions, Howard Kennedy, Henry Gerdes and Silas A. Holcomb: Gentlemen: I hereby submit to you the fourteenth biennial report of the Ingleside Hospital for the Insane, covering the period from December 1, 1914, to November 30, 1916. With this report I beg to offer some suggestions per - taining to the needs of the hospital for the next two years. ACKNOWLEDGEMENT If success has been attained by the present administra - tion in the management of the Ingleside Hospital for the In - sane, much of the success is due to the wholesome advice and friendly support so kindly given by the Governor of the State and by the several members of the Board of Commis - sioners of State Institutions. Our work has been made agreeable by the hearty co-operation and confidence so gen - erously expressed by the people of the State of Nebraska. We have been, indeed, fortunate in being surrounded by loyal assistants, all of whom have endeavored to do their part and have ever been ready to advise with the superin - tendent in solving the many institution problems. The patients generally have been quite contented and without exception, when mentally able, have appreciated the E;s made for their care and comfort. We have been for - « in the selection of employees. Our employee popula - consists of ladies and gentlemen, all of whom, we be - are interested in their work and are trying to give faith- </seg>

The department heads have been conscientious in their work and without an exception every department of this institution at the present time is working in harmony During the past ten years all classes of the insane have been admitted to Ingleside. Prior to ten years ago this insti - tution was used primarily for the care of the incurable insane. Therefore many of the older patients of other institutions were transferred to Ingleside. The above facts make our population still appear to be composed principally of aged people. As will be shown by tables appended to this report we have several hundred very aged patients who still remain residents of this hospital. MORTALITY The death rate has been high, due to the fact that the majority of the people were aged and due to the further fact that many senile dementia cases are constantly being admit - ted. The oldest patient committed to the hospital in the past year was 94 years of age. A very great number of patients between 70 and 80 years of age are now being cared for at the hospital. nth other departments.

            <seg id="p006">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 211 CASES IMPROVED AND CASES RESTORED TO NORMAL MENTALITY Many most gratifying results have been obtained in the treatment of cases of acute mania. Hardly a week passes but that patients are sent home to their family with their men - tality restored. Hydrotherapy, in the treatment of certain forms of mental trouble, is an important factor and has aided in the cure of many cases. The medical staff of Ingleside has, in the past year, been doing much research work and is ever alert in giving atten - tion to the newer methods in treating and caring for the in - sane. At present our staff is giving much attention to the treatment of certain forms of epilepsy. While we are not yet ready to state the results, we hope within the next year to be able to announce some definite conclusions. It is most distressing to the friends and relatives of patients to observe the progressive trend of certain forms of incurable mental troubles, as many cases of insanity are in - curable, but it is gratifying, indeed, to the friends of patients, who are curable, to observe from month to month a gradual improvement until the mind is wholly restored" and patient again able to return to family and friends and again assume his place in society. Hospital authorities, if possible, are as much elated over the recovery of persons mentally ill as the friends and relatives can possibly be. INSTITUTION OVER-CROWDED By over-crowding we are able to care for, fairly com - fortably, a population of eleven hundred and fifty patients. The capacity at this time is filled. We have had to discourage the commitment of many persons who should be receiving hospital care. There should be more room supplied for pa - tients who are demanding admission and others who are un - doubtedly needing the care of the hospital and those who will need apply to the hospital for care and treatment. NEW BUILDING NEEDED Considering the gradual increase in population of the State and consequent increase of the number of insane it </seg>
            <seg id="p007">212 bt.L'ONU r&gt;IJi.rsirslAlj Kfcr^OKT Of is highly important that this institution be supplied with more room. The plan in detail, under heading "Appropriation for New Building", we believe, is a feasible one. When such a building is erected and in use, I feel that the building plan of this institution will have been completed. It will give a capacity of twelve hundred and fifty patients. Personally, I believe that a hospital for the insane with a capacity as above stated is large enough for one set of officers to manage. With that number the superintendent and other officers may person - ally know every patient in the institution and become fa - miliar with the mental and physical traits of all the patients. Where the number is greater than above stated, it appears to me that the work cannot be so well done. HEALTH OF PATIENTS The general health of the population during the biennium has been quite satisfactory. No epidemcis of magnitude have appeared. Among the infirm and helpless patients, due to the fact that they are infirm and unable to take exercise, there has been quite a number of cases of tuberculosis. During the past year all actively tubercular cases have been segregated. The sanitary conditions of the institution generally have been improved. More attention has been paid to prevention, con - sequently we expect in the future to have less, rather than more, tuberculosis. A large number of those who had active tuberculosis have become better and are now in a stationary non-active condition. Very few, if any, of the physically strong men and women patients have become tuberculous. This institution houses approximately ninety epileptic patients. The mental and physical condition of epileptic pa - tients varies greatly. A large number of those suffering with epilepsy are wholly demented. A considerable number are quite bright mentally excepting during and near the time of their seizures. Unfortunately one of our patients, a boy twenty years old, committed suicide by hanging. We have a number of pa - tients at the hospital who are suicidically inclined and it re- </seg>

            <seg id="p009">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 213 quires the utmost vigilance on the part of our nurses to pre - vent self-destruction. If the prevention of suicide were to be taken into consideration in the planning and construction of hospital buildings, such accidents could, in a great measure, be prevented. Exposed steam and water pipes abundant and everywhere in a large institution, help to suggest to a suicidal patient a means of self-destruction. . Our patients have been singularly free from injury and accidents. Minor injuries have occasionally occurred by in - firm patients falling and occasionally by one patient striking another. No injuries or accidents of a serious nature have occurred. FARM LAND The State owns, in the vicinity of this hospital, six hun- dred and forty acres of land. Alfalfa and corn are the prin- cipal field crops raised. Nearly eighty acres of land are used for garden purposes. The farms and gardens, during the past biennium, have yielded abundantly, the value of farm products raised and later consumed, sold or still on hand is approximately $65,378.89. Tables appended hereto will show in detail, kind, quantity and value of all farm and garden products raised. APPROPRIATIONS NEEDED FOR THE COMING BIENNIUM Appropriation for General Maintenance and Salaries $448,224.00 Appropriation for Sanitary Sewer and Sewer Work 10,000.00 Appropriation for Addition to Boiler House, One New Boiler, New Brick Smokestack, Electric Motors, Pumps and En - gine Repairs _ 15,000.00 Appropriation for New Building (capacity one hundred patients) - _..- 100.000.00 The method of arriving at the estimated needs for the coming biennium is as follows: Capacity of hospital 1160 patients ; cost of maintenance per annum is $193.20 ; two years $386.40 for each patient; cost of 1160 patients at $386.40 each is $448,224. Included in the above maintenance is the pay - roll and salaries, estimated at $6,000 per month. Salaries and wages will continue practically the same as during the past biennium. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">214 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF The maintenance appropriation consists of board and clothing, repairs and improvements, fuel and light, furniture, hardware, kitchen and dining room supplies, drugs, books and instruments, telephone, telegraph, vehicles, harness, farm ma - chinery, blacksmithing, chapel and amusements, burial, laun - dry, engine room and plumbing supplies, return of patients and traveling expenses, building material, paints, oils, glass, decorators' supplies, brick and cement, trees, walks, curbing, greenhouse and seed supplies, and all other necessary expenses not specifically provided for. The past two summers having been favorable, the farm and garden have produced a great quantity of food stuff. Therefore, the cost of maintenance, even at the high price of supplies, has been somewhat reduced during the biennial per - iod. An appropriation for a less amount than that figured, or $386.40 per patient for the biennium might be insufficient if the high price of supplies continues. In my opinion the maintenance asked for is probably too small. There is a con - stant expense for general repairs and improvements. The work to be done and its cost cannot be accurately estimated. The Ingleside Hospital for the Insane plant is a large one. 1 o keep the buildings in a proper state of repair, painters, carpenters and other mechanics are kept busy every working day in the year. SANITARY SEWER The appropriation suggested for sanitary sewer and sewer work is explained as follows: $4,000 was appropri - ated two years ago and is still available for a "Sanitary Sewer". The amount is wholly inadequate for the needs of this institution in solving the sewer problem. Not one, but a system of septic tanks is needed. At present the sewage from the whole institution, with a patient and employee popu - lation of over 1300, empties into a dry ditch, conducted through sewage pipes to a point about one-half mile south of the main building. The ditch for a mile below the sewer opening is very offensive. Farmers through whose land this sewage flows have made strong protest against the continu - ation of the present plan. We believe that the appropriation </seg>
            <seg id="p011">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 215 asked for will be sufficient to separate the storm and house sewage, the storm sewage to continue in an open ditch and the house sewage to be conducted as a closed sewer to a point about three-fourths mile south of the institution proper, the same being on the State's land, and emptying into a system of septic tanks with a capacity sufficient for the disposal of all of the house sewage of the institution. This appropria - tion of $10,000, with the appropriation of $4,000 two years ago, will solve, we think, for all time the problem of sewage disposal as it pertains to the Ingleside hospital. The appropriation asked for, for a new boiler and an ad - dition to the boiler house is to be explained as follows : Dur - ing the winter time the boiler capacity of this institution is too small. There are three boilers with a total capacity of seven hundred fifty horse power. All of the boilers, of ne - cessity, must be used almost continuously during the winter. Even at full capacity during zero weather the buildings can - not be kept wholly comfortable. The horsepower of the boil - ers of an institution of this size should be at least one thou - sand horse power capacity. Combined with the recommen - dation for an addition to the boiler house, new boiler, etc., a new brick smoke-stack is needed and two large electric motors to take the place of an expensive obsolete system of compressed air pumping. The total cost of boiler house, new boiler, pumps, engine repairs, smoke-stack and motors is estimated at 15,000. APPROPRIATION FOR NEW BUILDING The new building appropriation asked for is explained as follows: A modern hospital building is needed. A build - ing to accommodate at least one hundred patients should be built during the coming biennium. At present our patients who are physically ill, of necessity, are compelled to be kept on infirmary wards, which wards were not originally ar - ranged for sick persons and are not suitable for such purpose. My idea is that a building should be erected so arranged as to give comfortable quarters for sick patients. One wing for the male patients and one for the female patients. There should be in this building isolation wards for contagious </seg>
            <seg id="p012">216 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF diseases. There should be on the upper floor of this build - ing a ward for male tubercular patients and a ward for female tubercular patients, built with the idea of getting a maximum amount of sunlight and fresh air for the unfor - tunate insane who become afflicted with tuberculosis. In the new building there should be a male ward and a female ward to receive presumably curable new patients, where they can be housed, cared for and treated separately and apart from the chronic insane and incurable cases. An estimate of the cost of the building I have in mind would be approximately $100,000. The capacity of the hospital has been reached. The in - stitution is crowded. A continued demand is being made and will continue to be made for the admission of more patients. The new building referred to above will meet the needs of the present population of the institution and will also furnish room for one hundred patients who will, without a doubt, demand admission during the next biennium. FINANCES The financial affairs of the Ingleside Hospital for the Insane are in good condition. The appropriations available have been sufficient for the needs. Detailed reports of all financial transactions have been regularly sent to the Board each month. RELIGIOUS SERVICES, AMUSEMENTS AND ENTERTAINMENTS Much attention is given to musical entertainments and other forms of amusement. "Ingleside" maintains a brass band and an orchestra. A number of the employees are good musicians and also sev - eral of the patients are musicians of ability. During the sum - mer months, band concerts, are given on the campus two even - ings each week. Moving pictures are shown at the Audi - torium every Friday evening. An average audience of 1000 people attends the amusements. Every Tuesday evening an institution party is given in the Auditorium. Regularly on Sunday afternoons, chapel services are held by pastors alter - nately from one of the several churches of the city of Has- </seg>
            <seg id="p013">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 217 CONCLUSION In closing this report, it is my desire to sincerely thank the members of our medical staff and all of the local officers for their loyal support and hearty co-operation. To the employees, I wish to express my appreciation for the worthy service they have rendered the State, in helping to care for those who are unable to care for themselves. We believe that all have kept in mind the fact that the Ingleside Hospital for the Insane is being maintained solely for the purpose of providing care, comfort and treatment for those who are mentally ill. To His Excellency, Governor John H. Morehead, and the Honorable members of the Board of Commissioners of State Institutions, I owe a debt of gratitude, for their wise counsel and advice, for their personal friendship and for their kindly indulgence in overlooking our many short-comings. Respectfully submitted, W. S. Fast, Superintendent. Ingleside, Nebraska, November SO, 1916. </seg>
