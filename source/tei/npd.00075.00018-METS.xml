            <seg id="p003">SUMMARY 1. In studying, the effect of prolonging the feeding period two trials were conducted in which the following conditions were imposed upon western lambs: (1) a maintenance period of 56 days followed by 84 days of full feeding, (2) 84 days of full feeding followed by 56 days of maintenance, and (3) continuous full feeding for 140 days. 2. Feeder lambs fed alfalfa hay and no grain for 66 days remained thrifty but gained only 1.51 pounds per head. They gained 7 pounds per head more during the 84-day period of full feeding than similar lambs that had not been held on a maintenance ration. This increased efficiency following maintenance was not observed when severe weather occurred during the latter part of the feeding period. 3. These lambs consumed the same amount of corn and twice as much hay as the check lot, which was full-fed shelled corn and alfalfa 84 days. • . ■ 4. Imposing maintenance before instead of after full feeding re - sulted in the consumption of less grain but more alfalfa per lamb Lambs handled in this manner were also more attractive and more uni - form at the conclusion of the experiment. 5. Sixty-five-pound feeder lambs reached an average weight of 90 pounds at the end of 84 days of full feeding. They averaged 113 pounds at the end of 140 days. 6. From the standpoint of weight, finish, and attractiveness as gauged by market standards for live lambs", maintenance followed bv full feeding was the most efficient method of prolonging the feeding 7. Following a period of live-weight maintenance, there is a definite lowering of live and carcass grade: u«=«iiims 8. Eighty-four days of full feeding on corn and alfalfa produced carcasses whicK reached the peak so far as grade was concerned. Con - tinued full feeding brought about a lowering of grade due to increas - ing wastmess. Full feeding for periods longer than 84 days produced carcasses weighing in excess of 45 pounds, the upper weight limit of popular lamb carcasses. 6 "■ OI 9. Holding full-fed lambs to constant weight kept the carcai^ within the desired weight limits, although a deterioration of grade was nototl. ■ - - 10. Lambs which had been held to maintenance for "?« **&#132;„ j then full-fed for 84 days produced very desirable carcasses foliar as weight and quality were concerned. 11.

The flesh from the racks of choice carcasses contained 44 per cent of fat; from good carcasses, 35.5; medium, 30.5 per cent: and common, 28 per cent. 14. The chemical composition of the kidney fat showed the same general trends as noted for the rack flesh. Based on one year's study only, there was no apparent softening of the kidney fat following maintenance, as indicated by refractive ' indices. ' 15. The average cooking loss through evaporation remained prac - tically constant at 8 per cent. Dripping losses appeared to be directlv correlated with fatness, ranging from 3.03 .to 7.83 per cent The leg roasts required approximately 30 minutes of roasting time to the pound. This did not appear to vary with weight or fatness. 16. Considerably less difference in palatability was noted between the various roasts than might have been expected in view of the differ - ences in grade and quality of the various carcasses. The fatter roasts appeared to have a more desirable flavor of both fat and lean. The flavor of the lean particularly seemed to become less pronounced as the roasts became fatter. The amount and richness of juice showed some correlation with fatness. Members of the cooked-meat grading committee were quite outspoken in commenting upon the improvement in palatability in the roasts from the animals which had been liberally fed. It is quite possible that the cooking method used failed to bring out to the maximum extent the differences in the meat. At any rate it can safely be said that none of the roasts produced in this experiment were unpalatable, however unattractive some of them may have been before cooking. . </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Length of Feeding Period and Plane of Nutrition as Factors in Lamb Feeding 'A. D, WEBER and WM. J. LOEFFEL. Department of Animal Husbandry AND MATILDA PETERS, Department of Home Economics The primary object in fattening western lambs in Ne - braska is to provide a market for home-grown feeds, espe - cially roughages. Many difficulties are encountered in at - taining this objective. For example, profits are uncertain because of fluctuations in the prices of fat lambs. It is obvious that the feeder can neither control prices nor main - tain them at an even level, except possibly by doing his part to insure an orderly distribution of market receipts. Because of the management practices that must be fol - lowed on the range and also because of consumer demand for lamb instead of mutton, the bulk of each year's crop of fed western lambs is marketed between December 1 and April 15. There are two principal reasons for the more or less orderly distribution of market receipts during this period. In the first place, a large number of the west - ern lambs brought into the corn belt are used in lambing down corn, which results in their being finished for the most part prior to January 15. Secondly, in order to utilize large amounts of alfalfa hay and sugar-beet by-pro - ducts, Colorado and western Nebraska farmers feed over a relatively long period, marketing most of their lambs after January 15. With a normal distribution of feeder lambs in the prin - cipal lamb-feeding areas, a reasonably uniform level of fat lamb receipts during the winter months might be expected. But frequently such an equalization of feeder shipments does not occur. Thus when an exceptionally large number of lambs are on feed in the corn belt, Colorado and Ne - braska feed lots may contain less than the usual number. As a result, fat lambs may become a drug on the market early in the season because of excessive receipts, and occupy an exceedingly favorable position during the late winter months because of unusually light ' receipts. Obviously, the situation is reversed whenever the opposite condition prevails with reference to the location of lambs on feed. Figure 1 shows the relation of the average number of sheep and lambs slaughtered monthly under federal in - spection to the average monthly price of good to choice lambs at Omaha for the years 1920 to 1929 inclusive. Price bears an inverse relationship to the number of sheep </seg>
            <seg id="p006">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 262 and lambs slaughtered. The highest prices, on the aver- Xw ?CUr * du " n^ . FeI ?ruary, March, and April. The ex - planation for this lies m the fact that the number of native SSr. ' rn "f n Jambs and fat range lambs slaughtered Sip £,*Tnf e }**?$ e ? rIy winter months greatly exceeds the number of fat lambs available from Colorado and Ne - br?_ska feed lots during the late winter months While fed lambs from Colorado and Nebraska feed lots K 1^ dominate the market in February, March, and April not all of the lambs fattened in these two states are marketed during the late winter. Factors which make it more difficult to realize a profit on lambs fed from 125 to 175 days are heavy feeder lambs, a sharp discrimination against heavy fat lambs, and, in some years, high-priced hay. Even though the late winter market is their objective Colorado and Nebraska feeders follow the practice of sort - ing out and marketing fat lambs at regular intervals This procedure enables at least the larger operators to distrib - ute their marketing throughout the season, thus minimiz - ing the possibility of unusual losses due to extreme fluctua - tions in prices. The system as a whole has the advantage of providing an excellent market for large amounts of cheap roughages, especially in those years when an in - crease in fat lamb prices occurs after February 1 From a study of Figure 1 it would seem that 'whenever practical, Nebraska farmers should attempt to take advan - tage of the relatively high prices that ordinarily prevail dur - ing the late winter months. isl : '■ ; . ■ I* ; '■ ' ■ ' H DOLLAC5 PES CWT.-GOOO To CHOICE LAMBS [23 HUNDRED THOUSANDS OF SHEEP AND 13 — — IAMBS M AUCHTFPEf) _____ 12 _ ___| B — i _ — ~ *r f i-l— - 10 " fh - f - ir r f- f i- f w w '- i~ Vr 1- I- I- I- I- I- - I- I- I - 6 - - - - - - - t - It ?- ?- ?- i- JAH.

            <seg id="p007">Feeding Period and Plane op Nutrition A few investigators have seen the possibility of protit - ably feeding lambs over a relatively long period. Dean and Potter (4) 1 observed that the price of fat lambs on the Portland market from 1910 to 1924 advanced 52 cents per month from October until April. They concluded that lambs to be marketed in March and April should be fed alfalfa alone until 60 to 90 days before the time they are to be marketed, and then given grain at the rate of one pound per head daily. Peters (9) reported that at the Minnesota Station dur - ing the winter of 1926-27 and again in 1927-28, carloads of feeder lambs were purchased and placed on fattening rations during October and marketed early in January. Other loads were, purchased early in January and fed for the late market. In these two years, feeder lambs cost about the same in January as they did in October, although the lambs bought in October were of somewhat better quality. But the fall-fattened lambs were sold at prac - tically no margin per hundredweight over the cost price as feeders, while the winter-fattened lambs were sold at a margin of $3.28 per hundredweight over cost price. In commenting on the Minnesota experiments, Peters said, "Lamb fattening throughout the corn belt is concen - trated in a shorter season than is the fattening of any other type of animal and with great detriment financially to the feeder. The season can be extended by encourag - ing those farmers in the corn belt who are raising lambs for market to get them on the market early, ahead of the western lambs, and it can be extended some to very great advantage by encouraging the fattening of thin lambs late in the winter even though they may not be of very high quality." In this connection, it should be kept in mind that most of the feeder lambs come off the ranges in September and October. As a consequence, the supply of feeder lambs in January is very limited. " This means that while the pur - chasing of feeder lambs in January may often be profitable it cannot become an important factor in increasing the supply of fat lambs during the late winter months. The upshot of the whole thing is that in the majority of cases lambs are started on feed in October regardless of whether it is hoped to market them in January or April. It is obvious, therefore, that different methods of feeding and management must be employed when 65-pound feeder 'Numbers in parentheses are references to publications listed in the back of this bulletin. ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p008">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 262 lambs are to be marketed fat averaging 90 pounds follow - ing a six-months feeding period instead of a period of three months. The results of numerous experiments conducted at vari - ous agricultural experiment stations show conclusively that 65-pound feeder lambs can be marketed averaging about 90 pounds after having been full-fed shelled corn and alfalfa hay from 70 to 90 days. This method is com - monly followed in many of the principal lamb-feeding areas. Tests at the Nebraska (11) and Illinois (5) experiment stations illustrate the possibility of shortening the feeding period. It is done by self-feeding a mixture of ground roughage and ground grain. This method of feeding is widely used by feeders located near the central markets and is becoming increasingly popular in certain sections of the corn belt where alfalfa hay is not so abundant nor open yard feeding so practical as in Nebraska. : The tendency to shorten the feeding period possibly means that a less orderly movement of fat lambs to market is likely in the future. It also suggests that the price trends depicted in Figure 1 are fairly certain to continue. At least the situation is one that will bear close study on the part of Nebraska feeders who have plenty of alfalfa and can feed lambs during the entire winter with no shelter except a windbreak. The experiments reported in this bulletin were planned to obtain information on some problems in - volved in fattening lambs for the late winter market under Nebraska conditions. The discussion of monthly variations in market receipts and prices is presented to furnish a suitable background for the study under consideration. It should be distinctly understood that the material covered in this bulletin deals with the effect of the plane of nutrition and length of feed - ing period on the gains and feed requirements of western lambs and on the quality and palatability of lamb carcasses. Under no consideration should the foregoing discussion or the analysis of the results which follows be construed to mean that the authors unqualifiedly recommend feeding lambs for the late winter market. This admonition is probably unnecessary so far as many Nebraska farmers are concerned, since they are using either the method forming the basis of this study or else a modifi - cation of it. It is unquestionably a practice that deserves consideration on the part of many Nebraska farmers who are now fattening lambs for the December and January </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Feeding Period and Plane of Nutrition markets But before changing methods the individual farmer should carefully study the reports of agricultural marketing specialists and statisticians. Only when this is done will the results reported herein assume their greatest practical significance. OBJECTS OF THE EXPERIMENT loT The primary object of this experiment was to study the S w* ? f Reding period and the plane of nutrition as related to the problem of fattening western lambs for the February March, and April markets. It was realized at the outset that m making a study of this kind, only a few worthwhile means of prolonging the feeding period could be used. An effort was made to select rations and manage - ment methods of sufficient contrast to insure results that would be applicable to a variety of rations and conditions. I he object of the experiment, therefore, was not to use certain rations or methods with the idea of possibly later recommending one or more of them, but rather to study the effects of the following conditions when imposed upon lambs in an attempt to lengthen the feeding period: 1. A maintenance period followed by a period of full feeding, 2. A period of full feeding followed by a maintenance period, 3. Continuous full feeding for a period equal to the total time covered by the same maintenance and full feeding periods. The term maintenance as here used signifies live-weight maintenance and not absolute maintenance in a technical sense. The influence of each of the conditions was measured first by its effect upon carcasses resulting from slaughtering average lambs at 28-day intervals, second by the total gain produced during the entire feeding period or periods, and third by the total feed consumed per lamb and the feed required for 100 pounds of gain. The following allotment served as the basis for the studies : Lot 1— Check lot — full-fed shelled corn and alfalfa hay for 84 days, Lot 2— Fed approximately a maintenance ration of alfalfa, hay for 56 days and then full-fed shelled corn and alfalfa hay 84 days, Lot 1A — Full-fed shelled corn and alfalfa hay for 140 days, </seg>
            <seg id="p010">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 262 if Lot IB — Full-fed shelled corn and alfalfa hay 84 days and then fed approximately a maintenance ration consisting of alfalfa hay and a light feed of corn for 56 days. Lots 1A and IB, each consisting of only 10 lambs, were carefully selected as average lambs from Lot 1 at the con - clusion of 84 days of full feeding. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE DATES OF THE EXPERIMENTS The two trials were identical so far as length of feeding period, methods of management, and rations were con - cerned. Trial I started October 28, 1928. All but 20 of Lot 1 were marketed at the end of 84 days, or January 19 1929, while the end of the 140-day period for Lots 2 1A and IB was reached March 17, 1929. Trial II commenced October 7, 1929, and closed February 24, 1930, at the end of 140 days. The 84th day was December 30, 1929. LAMBS USED White-faced Wyoming lambs, mostly wethers, grading good to choice as feeders, were used in both trials. The average initial weight was 65 pounds in Trial I and 64 pounds in Trial II. The lambs used in both trials were quite similar in type, conformation, quality, and finish when started on feed. FEEDS An attempt was made to use the same quality of feeds in both trials. No.. 2 yellow shelled corn was fed. ' The alfalfa fed in both trials was good, leafy, third-cutting hay. SHELTER • In both trials, Lots 1 and 2 were fed in lots 30 by 100 feet with access to an open shed facing south, Avith shed space 22 by 30 feet. METHOD OF FEEDING The lambs were fed grain in bunks in the open and hay in racks under the shed. All rations were hand-fed regularly at 7:30 A. M. and 4:30 P. M. MARKETING' In each experiment, the lambs were shipped on the even - ing of the day the final experimental weight was taken. Shrinkage in shipment was calculated from the average of the final experimental weights. All shipments were by rail except in the case of Lot 1 in Trial II, which was by truck. It should be. noted that market weights and shrinkage data </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Feeding Period and Plane of Nutrition for Lot 1 in both trials are based upon 20 lambs less than actually finished, since that number were selected at the conclusion of the 84-day period and designated as Lots 1A and IB. No marketing or packing-house data were obtained on these two lots because only four lambs were left in each lot at the conclusion of the experiment. Lots 1A and IB, therefore, are primarily of interest in connec - tion with the carcass studies made at Lincoln. EXPERIMENTAL FEEDING DATA The lambs slaughtered at Lincoln were selected from the same lots of lambs for which feed data are presented. As a result, the number of lambs on feed decreased as the feeding period progressed. Since these lambs were the average of their respective lots at the time they were re - moved, feed requirements and gains were calculated from total feed consumed, total weights, and total number of lamb days. Furthermore, in order to minimize the effect of the removal of lambs at 28-day intervals on the data obtained, more than the usual number of lambs were fed in each lot. The standard deviations of gains are of neces - sity based on varying numbers of lambs, depending upon the number remaining at the close of each period. The data presented in Tables 1, 2, and 6 represent weighted avei-ages of the results obtained in the two trials.

            <seg id="p012">Nebraska Experiment Station 'Bulletin. 262 pounds of alfalfa hay per 100 pounds of live weight has been reported by some workers to be sufficient for main - tenance over an extended period (8), these lambs lost 2.8 pounds per head in live weight during the first 28 days even though fed 2.7 pounds of alfalfa hay per hundred pounds of live weight. This was doubtless due to the fact that they had just been weaned and were not accustomed to dry feed. During the second 28-day period, more alfalfa was consumed and the lambs were apparently able to use it more efficiently, for they gained 4.3 pounds per head. Subtracting the amount. lost during the first 28 days from the amount gained during the second 28 days, we find that the net gain was 1.5 pounds per head for the 56 days. While the lambs showed a small average gain during this preliminary period, the variation between individual lambs was quite large, ranging from a loss of 7 pounds to a gain of 10 pounds.. As a result, the lambs did not appear as uniform nor as fleshy as they did .at the begin - ning of the experiment. They were rather gaunt and unattractive at the time they were started on corn, although all of them were thrifty.

Even more satisfactory gains were made during the next two 28-day periods. In fact Table 2 shows an average gain of 34.1 pounds for Lot 2 for the 140 days, as contrasted with an average gain of 25.9 pounds for Lot 1 as given in Table i. This increased gain is of especial interest since 82 per cent of it was made during the 84 days in which grain was fed. The amount of grain fed per lamb was practically the same, 102.5 pounds in Lot 1 and 100.8 pounds in Lot 2. </seg>

Lot 1 was full-fed shelled corn and alfalfa hay 84 days. Lot 2 was fed approximately a maintenance ration 6f alfalfa hay for 5G days and. then full-fed shelled corn and alfalfa hay 84 days. Lot 2, however, consumed 138 pounds more hay than Lot 1, o T P° un P s of thls amount being accounted for during the 84 days in which grain was fed. This is nevertheless an in - sufficient amount to explain an increased gain of 6.7 pounds made during the period in which grain was fed. Waters is quoted by Armsby (2) as follows: "Appar - ently the animal organism when kept for a long period of time on a low nutritive plane, as in the case of mainten - ance animals, gets on a more economical basis than when more liberally fed . . ." Thus the fact that Lot 2 made larger gains than Lot 1 even though practically the same amount of corn was fed may possibly be attributed to more efficient use of feed resulting from maintenance conditions imposed during the 56 days prior to the time grain was fed. However, the lambs in Lots 1 and 2 were not fed grain concurrently. Differences in weather conditions may have been responsible for the differences in gains </seg>
            <seg id="p014">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 262 DATA FOR EACH TRIAL Table 3 is included in order that the results in Lots 1 and 2 may be analyzed separately. In studying Table 3, it can be seen that in Trial I the average corn consumption was 103.3 pounds for Lot 1 and 100.8 pounds for Lot 2, while in Trial II it was 102.4 pounds for Lot 1 and 102.2 for Lot 2 rne relation of the amount of alfalfa hay fed in Lot 1 to the amount fed in Lot 2 was about the same in both trials although each lot consumed more hay in Trial I than in Trial II. Yet in spite of the similarity in feed consump - tion, Lot 2 gained 11.6 pounds more than Lot 1 in Trial I but only 2.9 pounds more in Trial II. The explanation for this disparity in results probably lies in either the inherent differences m the lambs or in the differences in weather conditions.

During the next 28-day period, how - ever, Lot -2 again gained significantly more than Lot 1 but not enough to make the difference between the two lots for the 84-day period as great as in Trial I. It appears, then, that severe weather during a part of Trial II was responsible for Lot 2 making a smaller total gain than was made in Trial I. A careful analysis of Table 4 and Figure 3, however, seems to justify the conclusion that lambs sub - jected to . maintenance for 56 days and then full-fed 84 days will gain more under normal weather conditions than lambs full-fed 84 days without having been on a low plane of nutrition. Dean and Potter (4) also found this to be true in three trials in which no grain was fed for the first 50 to 100 days. SHRINKAGE IN SHIPMENT " . Data relative to shrinkage in shipment and dressing per - centage are given in Table &amp;. Due to the heavy shrink in transit of Lot 2 in Trial I and the relatively low shrink for the same lot in Trial II, the difference in gains between Lots 1 and 2 in Trial II more nearly equals the difference noted in Trial I when gains are calculated from Omaha weights instead of from final experimental weights at.Lin - coln. MAINTENANCE FOLLOWING FULL FEEDING The lambs in Lot 1A were full-fed shelled corn and alfalfa hay for 84 days as a part of Lot 1. They were then fed alfalfa hay and a light feed of corn for 56 days. The results are given in Table 6. Comparing Lot. IB with Lot 1A, which was full-fed shelled corn and alfalfa hay 140 </seg>

The Lot 1A lambs continued to make rapid and economical gains. But they were classed as heavy lambs at the conclusion of the experiment, which meant that they would ordinarily sell at less per pound than lambs averaging 90 pounds. Attempting to hold 90-pound fat lambs with little gain, as was done with Lot IB, resulted in the lambs losing their "bloom." They were rather unattractive and also less uni - form than they were when removed from Lot 1. Theoretically, Lot IB and Lot 2 received the same treat - ment except that the maintenance period followed full feeding in the case of Lot IB, while it preceded full feed - ing in Lot 2. Nevertheless, the Lot 2 lambs made an aver - age gain of 3.6 pounds more than the Lot IB lambs and consumed an average of 29.4 pounds less corn and 42 pounds more alfalfa hay. They were also more attractive and more uniform at the conclusion of the experiment. Table 6. — Average of two trials — Lots 1A and IB LotlA Lot IB . -^ 28 days 56 days 28 days 56 days . *.,-..

FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS Experimental results are of value to the feeder only when interpreted in the light of conditions existing at the time the data are to be used.

            <seg id="p019">Feeding Period and Plane of Nutrition But the data given herein will be useful to the feeder who is trying to decide whether or not to feed for the late winter market, providing he makes a few calculations. In order to make such calculations as easy as possible Mitchell (7) proposed a graphical method of presenting the financial phases of feeding experiments. This method has been applied to the average results obtained in Lots 1 and 2, and is shown in Figures 4 and 5. TOTAL FEED BILL PER LAMB By making use of Figure 4, the calculation of total feed bill per lamb is a relatively easy matter. The left scale represents the cost of corn per bushel, the right scale the cost of alfalfa hay per ton, and the intermediate scales the total feed bill per lamb. When a ruler or straight edge is placed at the price of corn per bushel and at the price of alfalfa hay per ton, the point of intersection on the inter - mediate scale shows the total feed bill per lamb for that lot. For example, by placing the edge of a ruler at$0.70 on the corn-price scale and $15 on the alfalfa-price scale, we find that the points of intersection on the intermediate scales indicate a total feed bill per lamb of $2.30 for Lot 1 and $3.35 for Lot 2. Similarily, the total feed bill per lamb can be determined for a wide range of prices by con - necting any two points on the right and left scales and read - ing the amounts indicated where the line defined intersects the intermediate scales. Thus, to consider an extreme case, with corn at $1.70 per bushel and alfalfa hay at $5 per ton, the total feed bill per lamb would be $3.45 for Lot 1 and $3.70 for Lot 2. MARGIN NECESSARY TO BREAK EVEN Expenses incurred for items other than feed vary a great deal, depending upon the amount spent for labor, interest, marketing, and incidental charges. Death losses also must be charged against the lambs marketed. It is obvious, therefore, that while feed cost is the principal item of expense, it is not the only one to be considered when calculating the necessary margin of selling price per hun - dred-weight over cost. A rapid calculation of necessary margin is possible by making use of the alignment chart presented as Figure 5. All other expenses should be added to the total feed cost per lamb. If we assume these additional costs to be $0.70 and $0.75 per lamb for Lots 1 and 2 respectively, then the total costs per lamb would be $3.00 and $4.10 with corn at $0.70 per bushel and alfalfa hay at $15.00 per ton. </seg>

For method of using see the discussion under "Margin Necessary to Break Even." The total expense per lamb includes feed, labor, interest, risk, marketing, and incidental charges. In order to determine the necessary margin with feeder lambs costing $7.00 per hundredweight, the procedure is as follows. Place the straight edge at $7.00 on the left scale and at $3.00 on the intermediate scale for Lot 1. A continuation of the line connecting these points intersects the right scale at $1.65, which is the necessary margin for Lot 1. Similarly, the necessary margin for Lot 2 is found by keeping the straight edge at $7.00 on the left scale and moving it to $4.10 on the intermediate scale for Lot 2. When this is done the right scale is intersected at $2.10. Thus, under these conditions the necessary margin per </seg>
            <seg id="p021">. Feeding Period and Plane op Nutrition hundredweight for Lot 2 would have to be $0.45 more than for Lot 1. If the actual margin of selling price per hundredweight over cost is $3.00 for each lot, then the profit per lamb can be calculated as follows. Placing the ruler at $7.00 on the left scale and $3.00 on the right scale, we find that the intermediate scales for Lots 1 and 2 are intersected at $4.20 and $5.05. In other words, each amount represents the maximum total expense per lamb that the difference between selling price and cost price per lamb would have equaled. But the total expense per lamb was less than these amounts in each case, or $3.00 and $4.10 for Lots 1 and 2 respectively. Therefore, by subtraction we deter - mine that the profit per lamb would have been $1.20 in Lot 1 and $0.95 in Lot 2. By studying Figure 5, it can be seen that the necessary margin to cover feed costs only, or feed costs plus one or more of the additional items of expense, can be determined. The legend "Total expense per lamb" is used merely to emphasize the fact that in figuring profits and necessary margin per hundredweight- to break even, all items of ex - pense should be considered. CARCASS STUDIES Regardless of how economical or efficient a given method of production may be, if that method exerts a deleterious effect upon meat quality, the industry as a whole will suffer. To determine the effect of the treatment set forth upon carcass quality and meat palatability, these studies were undertaken in the Experiment Station abattoir. . LIVE GRADING' In the second trial all lambs fed were graded on foot both at the beginning and at the close of the trial. The grading was done by a committee of three, each work - ing independently. 2 The method used was suggested by Spencer (10). By this method numerical grades from one to five are used : one representing choice ; two, good ; three, medium; four, common; and five, cull. Each lamb was graded from three standpoints, conformation, finish, and quality, equal weight being attached to all three points in arriving at the grade for each lamb. The average in - itial grade in Lot 1 was 2.64, while for Lot 2 it was 2.66 in each case, or high medium. It should be stated that this grading system was intended primarily for fat lambs and * Ray It. Thalman assisted the authors in grading both lambs and carcasses. </seg>
            <seg id="p022">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 262 some question might justly be raised as to the fairness of applying this grading system to feeder lambs. The average final grade in Lot 1 was 1.55 and in Lot 2, 1.65, indicating a slight superiority of the lambs in Lot 1. Since the two years' work were identical, only the aver - aged results are presented in the following discussion. Three average lambs were selected for slaughter from each lot at 28-day intervals, making. the averages based upon six individuals at each period with two exceptions. For the control or initial killing, a total of seven lambs were slaugh - tered and in the first period in Lot 1 only five lambs were used. Thus the entire project is based upon detailed slaughter records of 66 lambs. Prior to slaughter, every lamb was graded according to the numerical system described. In selecting lambs for slaughter, great care was exercised to secure representa - tive specimens. Lambs were used which were average at the beginning of the trial in weight and grade, and had made average gains for the period. They gave outward indications of being average individuals at the time of slaughter. Considering the comparatively large number of lambs comprising the lots and the care used in selecting those for slaughter, the latter may be regarded as fair and accurate samples. Figure 6 shows the relation of. live grade to the length of feeding period and plane of nutrition. Considering the combined curve for Lots 1 and 1A, an improvement in live grade is noted as the feeding period progressed from high medium in the control lambs slaughtered at the beginning to good in the lambs fed 140 days.- A full grade marks the improvement for the first 84 days of feeding. Two incon - sistencies occur, the recession of grades in the second and fifth periods. It is difficult to explain these irregularities. Either the lambs slaughtered at the end of those periods were not representative, or idiosyncrasies of the graders were responsible. As might be expected, the most marked improvement was noted in finish. More than a full grade of advance was noted in this detail. It is difficult to separate finish from conformation entirely. As a lamb fattens, it becomes wider, deeper, and closer to the ground and therefore ap - pears to improve in conformation. Perhaps this accounts for the half grade of improvement in conformation between the initial and final slaughter period. The improvement in quality or general refinement was small. </seg>

Considering Lots 1 and IB as one, a very definite regres - sion of grade occurred during the last two periods when live weight maintenance conditions were imposed upon full-fed lambs. The reduction in grade from the peak at the 84th day until the 140th day was more than a half grade. The deterioration. was more noticeable in the first maintenance period, which coincides with the feed data, which showed that after a period of adjustment the lambs began to gain in weight on a ration which had previously barely maintained live weight. In Lots 1 and IB the greatest improvement was in finish, the net advance in this detail being a half grade during the 140 days. The net improvement during the entire trial in con - formation was a third of a grade, and in quality only one-fifth of a grade. Under maintenance conditions theoretically there should have been no loss of finish. In the judgment of the grading committee, however, a definite loss of fat occurred during the maintenance period. The loss of finish during the 56-day maintenance period was judged to have been almost a full grade, and the loss in conformation a half grade. In fact, the detailed live grades arrived at by the committee showed that the lambs during the 56-day maintenance period had lost as much in finish and conformation as they had improved in the previous 28-day period of full feeding. Lot 2, which received maintenance rations for the first 56 days of the test and was then full-fed, reached approximately the same final grade as Lot 1A. The average final live grade of Lot 2 was a third of a grade higher than of Lot IB, which </seg>
            <seg id="p024">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 262 received the maintenance allowance at the end of the trial rather than at the beginning. During the first two periods, when an attempt was made to maintain live weight, a decline in live grade was noted. This appeared to affect the finish or fatness primarily, although it also depressed the confor - mation grade. It is possible that the lambs in Lot 2 actually grew m spite of losing in bod y fat during the maintenance period. Armsby (1) suggests that growth may be masked by the loss of body fat instead of being made at the expense of body fat. Too much significance should not be attached to such an intangible thing as a grade, which is based largely on personal opinion rather than on measurable items. Inasmuch as the live grades do show consistent trends, except in two instances they probably have value. Since the appraisal of lambs at the market is largely based upon personal opinion, these estimates are submitted. In fairness" to the graders, it should be said that they worked "blind" ; that is, they did not know from which lot the lambs were selected. CARCASS GRADES A descriptive grading chart was prepared for the use of the committee of three who graded the Iamb carcasses. The sum - marized carcass grades are presented in Figure 7.

            <seg id="p025">Feeding Period and Plane op Nutrition are more tangible than the grades on live lambs and there - fore are a more reliable index of what actually occurred as a result of the experimental conditions imposed. The improvement in grade of Lots 1 and 1A was quite consistent from medium to choice. The improvement was slow during the first 28-day period because the lambs were going on feed. Likewise, during the latter stages improve - ment in grade was retarded because the lambs were becoming finished. As the full-feeding period progressed, the lambs seemed to become more compact, plumper in the legs, wider and thicker - fleshed in the loin and rack,, smoother and more compact in the shoulders, and shorter and thicker in the neck. Many of these apparent changes were merely matters of proportions. The most outstanding change was in finish. According to the committee, the covering of the carcasses became thicker, more even, whiter, and firmer as the period progressed. The kid - ney and pelvic fat became excessive after 112 days of full feeding, and extremely excessive at 140 days. Imposing maintenance on full-fed lambs, as was done in Lot IB, caused a deterioration of carcass quality of three - fourths of a grade. Fifty-six days of maintenance returned the lambs in grade to approximately the point where they were 28 clays prior to the let-down. The lambs lost the "bloom," the covering, the kidney fat, and the compactness they had attained. Twenty-eight days of live-weight maintenance depressed the carcass grades a full grade, from medium to common in Lot 2. A further decline was noted the second 28-day period, although it was less noticeable, probably because the period of adjustment had passed. The third period, when grain feed - ing was started in Lot 2, marked a beginning of rapid im - provement in carcass grade. The total improvement from the low point to the high point was more than two full grades. It is interesting to note that Lot 2 during the 84 days when grain was fed reached practically the same grade attained by Lot 1 after the same period of full feeding. While there were many points in which carcass grades actually were lowered during the maintenance period, a rapid recovery occurred after the grain feeding commenced. The same general im - provements in compactness, thickness of fleshing, and finish noted in Lot 1 were observed, although they never developed to so marked a degree. The carcasses never reached the point where they showed the excessive kidney and pelvic fat seen in Lot 1. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 262 In the foregoing discussion of grades, it should be borne in mind that this applies to quality only. By quality is meant conformation and finish. From a commercial standpoint, weight is closely linked with quality. For example, whenever a carcass exceeds 45 pounds in weight its- market value is definitely lowered, regardless of the conformation, finish, and quality. Carcass weight was not taken into consideration in arriving at the grades reported. SLAUGHTER DtATA All lambs were held off feed for 24 hours prior to slaughter. Immediately prior to slaughter each lamb was shorn. Dressing yields are reported pn the basis of shorn weight as well as weight in fleece. Because of fluctuations in humidity, it was thought more accurate to use the hot carcass weight less 2*/&gt; per cent for chilling shrink throughout this study. This shrinkage in chill - ing is slightly greater than generally was experienced on a 48-hour chill. The official method of slaughtering as sug - gested by cooperators in the Quality in Meats project was used. A common round dress was made 1 . The "Internal fat" includes all killing fats, the caul, pluck; and ruffle. It will be noted that the live and carckss weights of Lots 1 and 1A increased quite regularly. After 84 days of full feed - ing, the lambs reached the point where) price discrimination on account of weight usually begins.

            <seg id="p027">Feeding Period and Plane of Nutrition fleece at this time weighed 91 pounds and produced a 45-pound carcass. Where the full feeding was continued 140 days, the average live weight increased to 111 pounds and the car - cass weight to 57. It should be pointed out that carcasses weighing in excess of 50 pounds are classed as "heavy" and are subject to further price discrimination. The dressing yield of the control lambs appears abnormally high. This was probably due to the fact that they were shrunk out. Aside from the initial slaughtering, the dress - ing yields increased fairly consistently with increasing fat - ness from 45.7 per cent. at 28 days to 51.2 per cent at 140 days. The dressing yields based on the shorn weight averaged 3i/&gt; per cent higher. The amount of internal fat increased from 2 pounds in the controls to almost 6 pounds per head in the lambs full fed for 140 days. Based on percentage of live weight, this amounted to 3 per cent in the controls and 5.33 per cent of the lambs at the close. "In the. combined Lots 1 and IB it will be noted that the live weight was practically maintained during the last 56 days, while the carcass weight slightly declined. This accounts for the decline in dressing yield during the maintenance period. Maintenance caused a slight decline in the amount of internal fat, although some recovery was noted by the end of the test. It is interesting to point out in this lot that both the live and carcass weights were kept within the limits most desired at the markets. A steady decline in dressing yield occurred during the first 56 days in Lot 2. With the introduction of corn into the ration, the live weights, the dressed weights, and the dressing yields increased. The live weight maintenance period in Lot 2 caused a re - duction in the amount and percentage of internal fat, which did not appear to make any substantial recovery until after corn had been fed for some time. The live weight of the lambs in Lot 2 reached 95.5 pounds, which is heavier than the market generally prefers. The . carcasses, however, weighed 46 pounds, only a pound heavier than is most accep - table. The dressing yields in Lot 2 were considerably lower than the yields obtained in Lots 1 and 1A. CUTTING DATA The cutting method followed was a modification of com - mercial practice. Five ribs were left on the shoulder, seven on the short rack, and one on the loin. In commercial prac - tice, nine ribs are usually left on the rack. Thus, the per- </seg>

The method followed prod aped a cut comparable to the beef rib. The rough loins included the flanks, the kidneys, and the kidney fat. Later the kidney fat was ntirely removed. The weight of the kidney fat given represents the fat minus the kidneys. It is a common practice among retailers and whole - salers to gauge the fatness of a lamb carcass by the "kidney," that is, the kidney knob. For that eason, a quantitative study of the amount of kidney fat was thought to be desirable. It is almost impossible to trim out the kidney fat uniformly, another reason for removing the kidney fat completely. The lamb legs were removed at the "pin bone" or hip bone. They carried a small tip of the flank. The weights of the cuts as well as their percentage relation to the entire carcass are presented in Table 8. Throughout all these studies, the weight of rack differed with the length of the feeding period. However, the relation of the rack weight to carcass weight wis rather definite, be - ing a little less than 9.5 per cent, which is approximately the percentage relation of the rib cut to the beef carcass. In Lots 1 and 1A, the weight of r&lt;bugh loin more than doubled during the period of the experiment. This was due to </seg>
            <seg id="p029">Feeding Period and Plane of Nutrition the great increase in kidney fat. The kidney fat increased from 0.68 pound in the controls to 2.68 pounds in the lambs fed 140 days. In point of actual weight, the kidney fat quad - rupled. On the basis of percentage of the carcass weight, it more than doubled. While the weight of the legs increased with the lengh of the feeding period, their advancing weight did not keep pace with the increasing carcass weight. The legs comprised 35 per cent of the control carcasses and only 31 per cent of the carcasses of lambs full-fed for 140 days.

The effect of maintenance was largely that of counteracting the trends just noted. After maintenance con - ditions, were imposed, the percentage of legs increased slightly, while the percentage of loin registered a slight decrease. The weight and percentage of kidney fat actually increased dur - ing the first 28-day, maintenance period, although this appears inconsistent in view of the subsequent drop during the fol - lowing period. In Lot 2 the same general trends noted in Lots 1 and 1A are observed,- particularly after the 56-day period when grain was introduced into the ration. After feeding for live weight maintenance was begun the percentage of kidney fat actually declined. BONING YIELDS The producer and feeder recognize bones as the essential framework upon which to build muscle and fat. The con - sumer, on the other hand, looks upon bone as a waste since it cannot be consumed. Consequently, the percentage of bone present is important in determining the economy of meat cuts. To throw some light upon effect of fatness upon the percent - age of bone, the short racks were boned out. The data are presented in Table 9 on a percentage basis. With the bone </seg>
            <seg id="p030">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 262 was included such inedible material as cartilage as well as the neck tendon. The actual weight of bone was comparatively uniform throughout the experiment. The bon^ varied from 12 to 21 per cent. Increasing fatness tended to reduce the percent - age. While the fatter racks containejl less bone, many con - sumers would have classed the excessive fat equally as objec - tionable as bone from the standpoint of waste. PLUMPNESS OF LEG Spencer (10) suggests a correlation 1 between carcass grade and the plumpness of leg. He found that in the better-qual - ity carcasses the circumference of the leg measured at a point one-third of the distance from the aitchbone to the hock ex - ceeded the length of the leg as measured between the same points. The relation of the. leg circumjf erence to leg length is presented in Table 10. There appears to be some correlation between leg plumpness and the fatness of the carcasses. Several inconsistencies occur in these 1 data, which probably are due to the individuality of the lamb's. The increase in plumpness of leg was greater than could be accounted for by the thicker external covering. It prob - ably can be explained by the infiltration of fat in and between the muscles.

After the rack was boned out, the flesh, that is, the fat and lean, was twice ground, mixed, and quartered dowii until a suitable sample was secured. All analyses were made under the supervision of the station chemist. In Lots 1 and 1A the percentage of water declined from 55 in the controls to 40 in the lambs full-fed. During this same period the fat increased from 28 to 47 per cent. The protein declined from 16 to 12 per cent as the lambs increased in fat - ness. Less than one per cent of ash was contained in the rack flesh. This tended to decline as the feeding period progressed. Fattening should not be construed as a replacement of the water in the tissues by fat, but rather as an additive process. With the increase in fat, the proportion of the other consti - tuents declines. Figure 8 shows that 56 days of maintenance after 84 days of • full feeding tended to flatten out all curves, that is, to prevent any radical change in composition from that at the time maintenance was imposed. During the preliminary maintenance period in Lot 2, the reverse of fattening took place. The percentage of water and protein increased at tha expense of body fat. After corn was introduced in the ration of Lot 2, the same general trends were noted as took place in Lots 1 and 1A, except that the speed of fattening was probably more pronounced. Figure 9 shows an interesting correlation between carcass grade and the percentage of fat in the rack flesh. The fat in individual specimens varied from 16 to 56 per cent. </seg>

One who has handled lamb carcasses is impressed with the importance of fatness in determining carcass grade. Fat does "cover a multitude of sins." Some individual cases appear to deviate widely from the average. These may have been due to faulty judgment Of the grading committee or to the overshadowing importance of conformation or quality in these cases. Finish is not the only factor affecting grade, but it is one of the most important. Excessive finish or wastiness, of course, will depress the grade so that there is a point in fatness beyond which the trend suggested will no longer be evident. The average percentage of fat found in the common car - casses was 28.0 per cent; in the medium carcasses, 30.5 per cent; in the good, 35.5 per cent; and in the choice, 44.0 per cent. Miss Chatfield (3) found the percentage of fat in beef ribs to run from 14 to 44 per cent. Many are inclined to look upon adipose tissue as fat, not recognizing that it may vary in fatness with the condition of the animal. To determine whether any changes occur in the fat, the kidney fat from all lambs was finely- chopped by hand, sampled, and analyzed. The results are summarized in Table 11. </seg>

A retardation of the fat deposition is indicated by the analyses from Lot 2, where 56 days of maintenance preceded full feeding. There is a common belief among sheep men that the fat of sheep that are "let down" becomes soft. The refractive in - dex is commonly accepted a3 the simplest accurate method to determine the softness of fat. To ascertain particularly whether maintenance produced soft fat, refractive indices were determined on kidney fat samples the first year. Ex - ternal body fat would have been preferable for this purpose, but the limited amount of external fat, particularly from the lambs in the early periods, necessitated the use of kidney fat. The refractive indices ran from 1.4542 to 1.4553. Since they did not appear to be significant, these determinations were discontinued the second year. They are presented be - cause of the limited information available on lamb fat. To determine the refractive index, the sample of chopped tallow was placed in a constant temperature oven at 130° C. for 3*4 hours, after which it was filtered through a hot-water funnel. One or two drops of the liquid fat were placed on the stationary prism of an Abbe refractometer. The refrac - tive index was recorded after the fat had been given an opportunity to reach the temperature of the instrument. As the temperature could not be held constant, a correction fac- </seg>
            <seg id="p034">Nebraska Experiment Station Bulletin 262 tor of .000365 was used for each degree of variation in tem - perature, and all results calculated to 40° C. COOKING TESTS The left leg of each carcass was used for a cooking test and palatability studies. The official method of roasting rec - ommended by the cooperators in the Quality in Meats investi - gations was followed. A meat thermometer was inserted in the leg so that the bulb was approximately in the center of the fleshy portion. Uncovered sheet-iron pans were used for roasting. Each pan was provided with a rack a half inch high made of % inch mesh galvanized hardware cloth to keep the roast out of the drippings. The roasts were seared for 20 minutes in an oven at 527° F., after which they were transferred to an oven at 257° F. where they remained until the meat thermometer registered 75° C. (167° F.). Table 12 summarizes the cooking data. The percentage of loss by evaporation appeared to be quite uniform, with only one exception deviating very materially from 8 per cent. The percentage of loss by evaporation appeared to bear no definite relation to fatness. One might; expect that a proportion - ately greater surface of the lighter legs, together with the lack of a protective covering of fat, would greatly increase the loss by evaporation from these cuts. This, however, did not prove to be the case.

            <seg id="p035">Feeding Period and Plane of Nutrition contrary, appeared to be directly correlated with fatness, the fatter roasts shrinking most. As the roasts increased in weight, more time was required to cook them. As they became heavier and fatter, however, little, if any diffex-ence was .noted in the time required per unit of weight. A slight tendency for the time per pound to decrease was noted as the fatness of the legs increased. The time here given i-epresents the entire roasting process, in - cluding searing. The time required to roast a leg of lamb averaged 30 minutes per pound and ranged from 27 to 33 minutes. The roasts were medium so far as being "done" was concerned. PALATABILTTY STUDIES Comparable samples of the roasted legs were submitted to the grading committee,, who recorded their impressions on the official cooked-meat grading chart. According to this chart, all factors, such as aroma, texture, flavor of fat and lean, tenderness and juiciness are given numerical values ranging from one to seven. Descriptive terms are assigned to each figure. Aroma, flavor of fat, and flavor of lean are sub - divided into intensity phases which tell how much, and desir - ability phases, which tell how desirable. In other words, the flavor of a roast may be very pronounced yet quite undesir - able. The palatability committee was composed of members of the teaching and experimental staff, all of whom had had some experience in grading cooked meat. The size of the com - mittee varied from a minimum of 3 in one instance to a maxi - mum of 15. The average for all tests was 10. The figures given in Table 13 are weighted averages of the opinions of all judges. By this method comparatively little significance is attached to the test in which only a limited number of judges served and more weight to those tests where many opinions were available. In judging, the meat was not salted or seasoned in any way. So far as possible the personnel of the committee was main - tained as uniformly as possible. Approximately the same number of men as of women comprised the committee. The members knew nothing of the origin or treatment of any par - ticular roast. Continued full feeding appeared to increase the desirability of the meat aroma. There is a slight indication that the in - tensity of the aroma increased with liberal feeding and de - creased with maintenance. Differences here were so slight that it is questionable whether they were significant. There </seg>

Many ot the samples contained no internal fat; hence the fat flavor as given is based on fewer opinions than any other fac - tor considered. In the later stages of the fattening process, the flavor of the fat became more desirable. As fattening progressed, the flavor of the lean became noticeably less pronounced. There was a fairly consistent trend of improvement in lean flavor with full feeding. It is interesting to note that in the last period of Lots 1 and IB there was some recession so far as the desirability of the flavor of lean was concerned. Comparatively little difference was noted in the tenderness of the samples for the various lots. In all lots there was a fairly consistent increase in qual - ity and quantity of juice as the feeding period progressed. LITERATURE CITED 1. Armsby, H. P. 1917. The Nutrition of Farm Animals.
