PETERS The Nebraska Experiment Station has for a number of yean collected reports of cases of loss of animals from ing green sorghum. Special experiments to determine the cause of death from cattle running in sorghum fields were undertaken by the Department of Animal Pathology during the summer of 1901, as the result of numerous inquiries which came to the Station asking for remedies and reporting deaths of anii that had been pastured on sorghum or had broken into hum fields. In m- iese animals did not regu larly pasture upon sorghum, but broke into the fields from adjacent pastures or as they were being driven past li of sorghum. Investigation proved that the animals did not die from bloat as has been reported by many agricultural papers. Many cases were reported where death occui without bloat and in so short a time that no other th&gt; l»t that of poison seemed tenable. In most it where losses of this kind were reported, the sorghum hail been stunted in its growth and was not entirely healthy and i its appearance. \\ d many fields where animals had died, but gen - erally found these animals in so advanced a stage of decom- Kirt of the material here presented is from tbe 15th Annual Report is Station.

Often the animals had bet'ii buried, and when other animals were turned into these fields they refused to eat the sorghum and no information could be secured. 1[n the spring of 1901, special effort was made to further ; investigation of sorghum poisoning. A notice was pL the leading State papers to the effect that the Experiment ition would send a veterinarian to investigate all cases so-called sorghum poisoning, if notified in time to be of istance or to secure any information. We responded to merous calls of this kind, but in most instances where mals were turned upon the sorghum for the express pur - le of poisoning them they refused to eat, and no data could secured. I In response to one of these calls, I reached the farm of Mr. ?rt Foss, near Aurora, at 7 :30 a.m., on August 3, 1901. vo days previous, fifteen head of his cattle had broken to a sorghum field, where they had remained twenty min - es. They were then driven into another field and were t seen again for several hours. When seen, three •k, all of which died within a few hours. The symptoms ■re drowsiness, running at the eyes, twitching of the mus !$, numbness of the limbs, staggering gait, inability to md, involuntary passing of urine. On August 2, two more ws broke through the fence and were on the sorghum field e minutes. One hour later, one of these animals, a four - ar-old cow, was very sick, but finally recovered. t\'e turned a small yearling steer on the sorghum at 8 :30 ., August 3, but he refused to eat any sorghum, and after ■ty-five minutes two more were turned into the sorghum, ?re they remained until 10:00 a.m., when only one, a ill, red steer, had taken any sorghum, and he had eaten y a few leaves. They were then turned back with the i. At 10 55 a.m. the small, red steer acted somewhat but soon recovered. At 11 :00 a.m. we turned one red heifer and one yearling steer on the sorghum. The heifer was the only animal that ate any quantity, and, as subsequent examination showed, she ate only one and one-half pounds of green sorghum 11:10 a.m. this animal dropped to the ground. Upon ex </seg>
            <seg id="p005">5 animation it was found that she had stopped chewing her cud and there was a peculiar twitching of the muscles of the nose and head and also of the body. The animal was very dull. At 11 :15 a.m. she was taken out of the sorghum field and allowed to lie in a stubble field. When lying down her head was turned toward the abdomen, presenting the symptoms shown liy a horse having the colic. The eyes seemed dull and gave off a watery discharge. There was u partial paralysis of the tongue and great quantities of safiva ran from the mouth. The limbs and ears were cold. The pupils of the eyes dilated, pulse not perceptible, mucous membrane of the rectum protruding, involuntary discharge of urine and faeces. Upon pricking the animal with a knife on the lower limbs it showed no feeling. This animal was closely watched in the field by Mr. Foss and myself and we observed that she did not take any weeds, but simply a small amount of sorghum, eating only the tops of the leaves. At 1:30 p.m. the animal was still lying on its right side; all the muscles of the head were contracted and showed involun - tary twitching. The limbs were paralyzed and the animal was unconscious; the mucous membrane of the mouth was of a salmon color. At 2 :35 p.m. the animal was in great pain, and it was apparent that she would not recover. At the suggestion of Mr. Foss the animal was killed in order to hold a post-mortem examinati I'ost-Moutem Examination. — Animal still warm.

One case of sorghum poisoning is reported from sorghum that had been cut several hours before feeding. Mr. E. F. Stoner, of Chester, cut sorghum at 8:00 o'clock p.m., August 2, which was fed to three niilch cows at 8:00 a.m., August 3. About 9 :00 o'clock a.m. these animals were first noticed to be sick. One died within an hour and fifteen minutes. The other two recovered within twelve hours. On August 6 I visited this sorghum field and made an examination of the Jiuni, which was not fully matured. It was compara - tively free from w At 5:45 p.m. we placed a cow in this sorghum field and allowed her to eat as much cut Jiuin as she would, up to 8:00 p.m., when she had con - sumed about twenty pounds. At 7 :00 a.m., on August 7, the animal showed no effects of sorghum poisoning, and no bad ■ 1 lowed. Tin * mm of 1902 was unusually wet in most sections of the Stai ■ result of the vigorous growth of sorghum, few poisoning have been reported. On July 24, Mr. William J. Smith, of Cambridge, lost two cows as the result of feeding green sorghum. On the 30th of July, Mr. H. B. Slade and I visited the farm of Mr. Smith and made a ph&gt; of the effect upon a cow of the sorghum growing in the field. A full-sized Jersey cow was turned into the sorghum patch shortly after 9 KM) o'clock. At 9 :10 the ani - mal began to eat the sorghum and kept quite steadily at it for the next few minutes. She soon ceased, became uneasy, and in ten minutes after she had taken the first mouthful of \ hum she was seen to lurch suddenly as if she had lost her balance. From that time on the symptoms of poisoning rapidly developed, and the cow passed into a semi-comatose condition. After five hours the effect of the poison appeared lessened and the cow recovered. The fresh air acted to some extent as an antidote, and by 2 KK) o'clock the animal was able to rejoin the herd. Samples of sorghum taken from the locality where the cow had eaten were examined in the laboratory and found to produce prus - sic acid.

The action upon the heart, respiration, and nerv iters as well as the incipient diarrhoea are all characteristic symptoms of prussic acid poisoning, and the smell of the acid about the mouth was sufficient by itself to identify the poison.

I gave it several doses of aconite, thinking possibly one poison would counteract the other, but it died in great agony. The cattle seemed to all go crazy at once, then stag - ger like a person intoxicated, fall in all directions, and die where they fell. I stuck all of them with a knife, the same as in alfalfa bloat, but there wasn't any gas in them. The Kafir corn was planted on sod ground above irrigation. It was from 6 to 15 inches high and was burnt brown from the drouth." Shortly after the poisoning, Dr. Glover visited the field and collected samples, which he generously placed at our disposal. These samples yielded prussic acid in greater amounts than any yet examined in Nebraska. More definite information in regard to the conclusions drawn from the chemical investigations, as well as obser - vations in regard to the conditions under which sorghum becomes dangerous, will be given in Part II of this bulletin. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">9 Part II. CHEMICAL INVESTIGATIONS. 1 BY S. AVEBY. The investigations of the Department of Animal Pathol - ogy have been given in Part I of this bulletin. That work furnished the basis of chemical investigation. Some three years ago Dr. A. T. Peters arrived at the fol - lowing conclusions regarding the loss of cattle from eating green sorghum : 1. Animals do not die from bloat or indigestion. 2. They do not choke to death. 3. The deaths result from a violent poison in sorghum of stunted growth. 4. The symptoms are those of prussic acid poisoning. The chemical investigations on the subject here recorded explain and confirm the conclusions drawn by the veteri - narian from his field work. Definite knowledge of the poisonous principle in these plants was wanting till very recently. As late a publication as the Yearbook of the Department of Agriculture for 1900 contains the suggestion that in many cases death may result from choking. In 1886 Berthelot and Andre* ascribed the cause to excessive amounts of potassium nitrate (saltpeter). Williams 4 of the U. S. Department of Agriculture also gests saltpeter as a cause of the trouble. Hiltner* has shown 'The chemical work on prussic acid in Sorghum vulgare (common sorghum and Kafir corn) was begun by Mr. Henry B. Slade and has been continued by the writer. Mr. Slade, who is no longer connected with this Station, has fully authorized the writer to present his part of the work. In view of the pioneer work of Mr. Slade his name is published on the title page as one of the joint authors. The writer is, however, responsible for the form of presentation of all of Part II. It should be added, also, that part of the work here given Is due to the labor of Dr. Peters and is presented in the chemical part for the sake of convenience.

            <seg id="p010">I it the amount of nitrate in Nebraska fields was too small produce fatal results. This writer suggests that the plant der certain conditions develops a highly poisonous chenii - compound. Slade 6 in the Annual Report of the Station ■ the present year put forward the theory that such a coui - und might be produced by the action of an enzym upon a icoside found in the plant through a process of abnormal J&gt;wth. On June 27 of the present year the Vhvmical \ London contained an article on Cyanogenesis in Plants Dunstan and Henry. This article, which fully confirms ide's prediction, was not known to Mr. Slade or to the iter till October 10. In brief, the England Chemists iso - ed from Egyptian Sorghum vulgare a glucoside capable liberating prussic acid. In the meantime Mr. Slade had detected prussic acid in fatal sorghum grown in western t Alaska, determined the per cent, and secured strong evi - nce in favor of the glucoside theory. IOn July 20, Mr. William J. Smith, of Cambridge, Nebr., 1 sorghum to a herd of cattle with the result that two' died. ie sample, received by Mr. Slade on the fourth day after tting, was weighed, ground up in a vegetable cutter, mixed th water, and distilled as long as prussic acid was evolved. ie pnissic acid found in the distillate amounted to .014 r cent of the weight of the sorghum taken. As later re- Its show that most of the acid is in the leaves, it is prob - able that the entire stalk here submitted to analysis con - tained a lower per cent of prussic acid than the part which animal actually consumed. At this per cent, seven or eight pounds of sorghum might cause death. During the first two weeks in September, the writer dis - covered that prussic acid could be obtained from leaves of healthy sorghum in the fields about the Station. As the past season was abnormally wet, nearly all of the fields had made a vigorous growth. By distilling water from a suffi - cient quantity of leaves, determinable amounts of prussic acid were evolved in all cases, though the amount was well below the danger line. Of the common Nebraska fo plants, sorghum and Kafir corn alone yield prussic acid. *A Study of thn Knzvms of Green Sorghum, 15th Annual Report, ' </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Poisoning of Cattle by Sorghum and Kafir Corn. 1 1 |)n the 7th of October the writer visited Colorado to in - tigate the outbreak of poisoning from Kafir corn described page 7 of this bulletin. By the courtesy of Dr. Head l, Chemist of the Colorado Station, leaves from the fatal d were tested for prussic acid. The large amount ob - aed was in keeping with the deadly character of the plant the field. Parts of the dried sample were found, on dis - ing, to yield as much as .1 per cent of prussic acid. At s rate, one pound might contain the fatal amount As both sorghum and Kafir corn are important forage plants, and as the investigations of the writer show that they contain as normal constituents compounds yielding prussic acid, the important question naturally arises, In what i ditions of growth are these plants dangerous? The follow - ing have been suggested: 1. Young plants. 2. Second growth. 3. Frosted plants. 4. Stunted plants. Unfortunately sufficient data have not been secured t&lt;&gt; enable the writer to give a final opinion on all of these points. They will, however, be discussed in the light of the facts at hand. tSToung plants of vigorous growth contain a higher per it of prussic acid than the bright, green leaves of plants ching maturity. As the stalks and seeds contain no prus - acid, the young plants contain a much greater per cent acid than the mature plants considered as a whole. Second growth is not more deadly than first growth, al though, as falls in the West are often bright and dry, condi - tions may be favorable for the elaboration of ♦• amounts of poison during the second growth. Frost is without influence except as the forerunner &lt; period of bright, dry weather. Eirowth arrested by dry weather before the plant begins mature presents a condition very favorable for the elab - .tion of the poison. Growth stunted by too much water, rile soil, shade of trees, or hardness of ground does not ult in the formation of dangerous quantities of j A study of the data at hand, field observations, and chem- </seg>

The danger in - creases in Nebraska as one proceeds from the Missouri river westward. This cannot be attributed entirely to a dryer soil, as some irrigated fields have proven fatal. In general, how - ever, we can say that the analyses of numerous samples show that dry, clear weather, by arresting the normal develop - ment of the plant, is the chief cause of the formation of ab - normal quantities of poison. »The following table gives some of the analytical data on lich the conclusions above given are based. The figures given represent the amount of prussic acid obtained by dis - tilling with water 100 grams of the sample. The dates rep - resent the time of cutting the plant. </seg>

            <seg id="p014">14 Poisoning of Cattle by Sorghum and Kafir Corn. The investigations made at this Station show that the prussic acid is not present as such, but that it is liber from a glucoside, (1) by an enzym in the plant as in tIn - case of sorghum poisoning, and (2) by the action of boiling water on the plant. Glucosides of this sort are in them selves harmless and are dangerous only when they libei prussic acid. Now the above table shows that even dried plants may contain a very large amount of combined pr\; acid. We should expect that such a fodder would be as faia! to stock after curing as when standing in the field. Experi - ence, however, seems to prove the contrary. Enzyms rapidly become inactive when dried in the presence of proteid sub - stances, as Mr. A. F. Woods, Chief of Division of Plant Pathology, informs the writer. In other words, the sub - stance capable of breaking up the glucoside into prussic acid and other compounds is no longer active. This, now, is con - firmed by the following experiment. 100 grains of Kafir corn were ground in the vegetable cutter; of this, one half was mixed with 200 cc of water and allowed to dry. The other half was mixed with 200 cc of water extract of gi sorghum leaves. After drying, this sample yielded on analy - sis only one-half as much prussic acid as the sample that had been treated with water only. This signifies that the enzym from the fresh leaves had liberated a considerable amount of acid. In this case the acid had escaped in the atmosphere; in cases of poisoning the enzym allows the poi - son to enter the system of the animal. Well-cured Kafir corn containing a large amount of prus sic acid was fed to several animals. In no case could any symptoms of prussic acid poisoning be observed, although one animal consumed material representing 1.2 grains of combined prussic acid. One-third of this amount of free acid is highly dangerous. In concluding this phase of the subject we do not wish to put ourselves on record as stating that plants become harmless on drying. We can, how state that there is at hand strong evidence pointing to such a conclusion. There is a general opinion among stockmen that cattle fattening on corn may be allowed the range of fields of stunted sorghum without danger of loss. During the sum- </seg>
            <seg id="p015">mer of 1901 when instances of poisoning were very numer - ous, the writer watched for a number of days forty head of steers, on full feed of corn, that were allowed the range of a sorghum field that to all appearances was highly danger - ous. No loss or symptoms of poisonin rred. I doubtful if in the presence of more palatable food sorghum is consumed iu any great quantity. At t! time there is no doubt that partially digested grail acts certain extent as an antidote for prnssie acid. The following &lt;&gt;f experiments were carried out on a bjirren heifer in order to determine the effect of carbohy - drates in lessening the poisonous action of prussic acid. Sufficient time was allowed between the experiments for the animal to reach a normal condition. Prussic acid administered. Result. sions, but recovered. ANTIDOTES. Prussic acid has a tendency to unite with certain carbo drates, forming additional products. Tli (pounds are much less poisonous than the free acid. Hoth glucose and milk sugar unite with prussic acid to some extent even in di - lute solutions. Aside from this action these carbohydrates retard the action of the enzyui in liberatio lie acid. These facts snggesi that, in case the animal is not in such a condition as to render medical treatment out of the question, the following may be effective A strong solution of glucose, which nearly every fanner has at hand in the form of 'coin syrup" or molasses, ma administered.
