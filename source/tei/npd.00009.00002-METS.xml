Er. E. S. Snively, President, called the meeting to order,

PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS 

Ladii.s ami Gentleman, Membmrt of tin 1 State Dairy 
Association: 

Eis with much pleasure that I welcome you to this the 
Annual Convention of the Nebraska Dairymen's 
ciation 

I he past year has been one of unusual note in the 
ory of the Dairy interests of the State; it probably 
¦ks the era of a rapid and phenominal development, 
year prior to 1902 produced as much as it did, nor was 
re, prior to 1902, so many of our people interested in 
•ying. It is certainly gratifying to note that whilst so 
ly of our farmers and ranchmen have recently become 
srested in dairying in a comparatively short time, yet, 
» not the slightest indication, in my judgment as to the 
nber who will eventually become interested in this 
nch of agricultural life. 

I'olitical economists have at all times asserted that the 
ilth and advancement of any State or community is 
ermined largely by the wealth and advancement of its 
icultural population. So, also, has the statement fretfitly 
been made and by the best of authorities - that 
country ever reaches its highest development until its 
mers engage extensively in dairying. A cursory 
imination of our oldest and most wealthy agricultural 
tions will confirm this statement. Even in our day and 

MORNING JANUARY 22ND, 1903 </seg>


            <seg id="p019">
19 

time we see the truthfulness of the statement and by oar 
own observation know as a positive fact that no agricultural 
community in which dairying is not extensively con 
ducted can compare or compete with that in which the 
dairy interests are highly developed. 

We as a state, are purely agricultural, and if our agricultural 
possibilities are to be measured by our adaptability 
to dairy farming, in that as a State we are particularly 
favored, because dairying can be conducted profitably 
in every portion, because of our climatic conditions, 
which are of the very test; the water as pure and wholesome 
as can be found; our natural grasses as sweet, nutritious 
and abundant as nature can provide; our grain known 
of and sought for by the dairymen of the East, yes, 
Nebraska corn is not unknown among the dairymen of 
Europe; because of our alfalfa, which grows so luxuriantly 
even to the extent as to make one think it was indigenous; 
because of these, which are some of the important natural 
factors and which will help the development of the dairy 
industry and when developed, Nebraska will come up to 
the full standard measure as one of the great agricultural 

I) far, what have we done and to what extent have we 
n advantage of these natural facilities so that we may 
h a high plane of development? We have been prong 
more or less butter for the past twenty years, but 
quite recent that wo have taken a place of note 
ng the dairy sections of the country. Probably five 
•s will mark the beginning of the rapid growth of the 
istry, and though still in its infancy, not in point of 
•s, but in point of development, it is destined to become 
most lusty, the most strong, the most remunerative of 
agricultural industries. 

&gt;Lmong a few of the reasons which I believe are respon:e, 
in addition to our natural facilities, for this growth 
the dairy interests in the State and which I believe to </seg>


            <seg id="p020">
20 

If im]x&gt;rtant factors in reaching a high plane of development, 
is first, probably, tho change in conducting the 
business or commercial end of the industry. Until, probably, 
five or six years ago, the product of the Nebraska 
dairy had an indeterminate value today it is determinate. 
The dairy interests of the Stato owe this largely to a few 
men. It was because of the business aggressiveness and 
ability and integrity of men like G. E. Haskell, J. H. 
Rushton and their contemporaries that this wonderful 
change was brought about, placing the business on a plane 
equal to, if not excelling, that upon which any product of 
the farm is commercially handled or marketed. They 
struck the rock of the dairy resources of the State and 
from it has flowed a continuously increasing stream of 
pure, golden yellow nuggets. 

I^gain, we were at a time wholly, and are yet to a great 
ent, a class of calf raisers. We had an idea that the 
y profit to be obtained from the cow was in raising the 
f. It is not strange that we were slow to accept the 
tements of men in authority, we looked upon their 
fuments as being wholly false, yet, they have been able 
i short time to demonstrate that the Nebraska cow has a 
ue outside of her calf value. The more we investied 
the statements and prophesies, the more physical 
dences which were brought to our notice by actual 
ults. the less sceptical we become and so determined 
it we will not only continue to produce the beef for the 
isumer of the East, but also produce his butter. 

i^gain, the recent developments called into existence 
idea of centralization. One main place to handle the 
duct of a large section of country. This was accomihed 
through the skim station. This plan was a great 
icator and helped establish the fact that the dairy 
srests of the State had a future. Following closely 
&gt;n the skim station, so close, in fact, that the dividing 
nt can scarcely be marked, was the introduction and </seg>


            <seg id="p021">
use of the hand separator. The peculiar conditions which 
exist in the State, the fact that its population is scattered 
over a wide area and dense in no locality aeemed to 
demand the use of the hand separator. No State has, I 
believe, used as many hand separators in the past year as 
has Nebraska Their u?e has wonderfully stimulated the 
production and has been a most important factor in developing 
the industry. 

Again, the almost universally successful attempt in the 
State to grow alfalfa has solved the problem of Winter 
feed. We will have, during the different sessions of this 
Convention, papers upon this most excellent plant, and its 
bearing upon the dairy industry. I merely desire to say 
that so far as my own limited knowledge is concerned 
there is nothing along the line of dairy feeds to equal it. 
Sections of the State that produce a phenominal amount 
of butterfat during some periods of the year utterly fail 
in production when the Winter months come on. For 
example, during the last week of December and fir 
•January we had severe weather. The ground in some 
sections of the State being covered with snow, necessitating 
the feeding of the herds better than is ordinarily 
done. During that time there was an increase of S 
cent in the production from the alfalfa localities and a 
decrease of a like amount in the sections wherein we have 
us yet not taken up the alfalfa proposition. 

Another instance, last Spring while in a certain town in 
the Platte Valley and in conversation with the president 
of one of the local banks, he made the assertion that the 
cow and the alfalfa were the savors of their section, and 
that since the advent of the dairy proposition and the 
alfalfa, their land had increased 100 per cent in value and 
that now it was hard to find sufficient land to meet the 
wants of would be purchasers. 

KLgain, along with these has come a desire on the part 
our dairvmen for a better knowledge of the business. </seg>

            <seg id="p022">

I hat they may be able to handle it more intelligently 
profitably; making it a business to thoroughly underid 
the conditions under which they are individually 
collectively working. Learning to know the good 
s from the poor ones, anxious to know how to make 
good ones produce the maximum amount, doing this 
h the knowledge that they have at home all the neces/ 
adjuncts in less costly form than the dairymen of 
sibly any other section. 

Andrew Carnegie, after traversing the State in 187 
reported as having said, "We travel all day a vast prairie 
watered by the Platte. nothing could be finer. Such fields 
of corn, tuch herds of cattle grazing at will, no wonder 
we export beef for it is fed here for nothing. The cattle 
thrive on the rich grasses as if fed on oats; no flies, no 
mosquitoes, nothing to disturb or annoy; the pellucid 
streams that run through the ranches furnish the best 
water. Large profits have been made in the trade; the 
best assurance that it will grow." Should he take a trip 
in 1903, not only up the Platte Valley, but the Republican, 
the Elkhorn, the Loup. the Blue, the Frenchman, and 
Beaver valleys as well as over the table lands of the State 
and see, in addition to what he then saw, the immense 
fields of alfalfa, the land dotted with skimming stations, 
cream receiving points, creameries, and individual dairies, 
which are being used by the decendants of the people 
whom he then saw as calf raisers, hog raisers and corn 
growers, and note the evidences of increased wealth and 
prosperity, he could not help but say, in addition, no wonder 
we export butter, could not help but mark the additional 
profit and emphasize "the best assurance that it 
will grow."

Mr Bassett: I move you that a committee consisting 

of three be appointed to whom this report and accompany- 

ing vouchers shall be referred, and their report made later 

at this meeting. Adopted. 

President: 1 will appoint as such committee, Messrs. 

L. D. Stillson, J. N. Ashburn and J. S. Clark. 

On Friday, at the morning session, this committee sub- 

mitted their report as follows: 

"Nebraska State Dairymen's Association, 

Gentlemen: We, your Committee appointed to audit 

the report of the treasurer have examined the same, and 

find it to be correct 

L. D. (Stillson. 
J. N. Ashburn, 

Signed, 

Auditing Committee." 

Report of Committee adopted. 

Secretary Bassett: I desire to offer the following: 

that all students in attendance at the dairy school be made 
honorary members of this Association for the year, providing 
they attend the meeting and register. Motion 

adopted. 

At this point in the proceedings the hall was occupied 

for the regular daily chapel exercises of the University, 
during which brief addresses were made by Hon. J. B. 
Dinsmore and Hon. R. W. Furnas life members of this 
association also an address by Governor John H. Mickey. 
Their addresses, as reported by the stenographer, were as 

follows: </seg>


            <seg id="p026">
26 

Hon. J. B. Dinsmore: Ladies and Gentlemen, Students 
t&gt;f the University: This is the first time I have ever been 
before you to speak to you with regard to the privileges, 
opportunities and advantages that you enjoy, that many 
men of riper years have not had the privilege of enjoying. 
You are now fitting yourselves for life's work. The work 
that you are now accomplishing is one that shall go with 
you throughout life, to be used by you to the advancement 
of your own interests and that of your fellow-beings 
around and about you. I think that I am safe in saying 
that no business man can overlook, in entering upon a 
business career, the securing of ample capital as a means 
to carry on his business? It is for you to do here, or to 
leave undone, that which shall mark you as having 
acquired certain desirable capital,or lacking in such capital. 
Capital is not alone what you may know, but it is the 
means of using it advantageously, so that you can communicate 
of your knowledge to your fellowmen round about 
you. No matter how much you know, no matter how 
thoroughly your education may have been so far as book 
knowledge is concerned, unless you can communicate it to 
those around you, it is of but little use. It is the man 
and woman of practical knowledge, that which is gained 
in every day life, as well as in the Universities and schools, 
that is the force in the nation, that is the up-lifting hand, 
that is always stretched out to help others to a higher and 
better life. Make the best use of your opportunities! You 
cannot know too much, you cannot know too thoroughly 
what you are doing. The young man or woman who is entering 
upon life's duties and simply does that which he or she 
has to do in order to pass, is doing little. They are not 
making the use that they might make, of their opportunities; 
they are not securing the capital that they need. Do 
well what you have to do, and then be looking for something 
else to do. Don't watch the clock, don't look for the 
time when the bell shall ring when you can leave your </seg>


            <seg id="p027">
27 

Ei rooms, or your rooms, to get entertainment and enjoy - 
t outside, but seek for that knowledge that you can 
to others, that can bs a means in your hands in 
uraging and lifting up others. 

It will be but a very few years yet when the older men 
of this state, those who have devoted years to the upbuilding 
of its material interests, those who have worked and 
fought for this institution, as those who are interested in 
it and tried to put it upon a broader foundation, must surrender 
their guidance and influence upon public affairs 
into your hands. It is for you and others so fortunate to 
come to the University, to say what the future of this 
institution shall be. It is but a few years since it had a 
few scholars; its influence hardly went beyond this county. 
Today it has a standing recognized throughout the United 
States. It has been the influence coming up from the 
common people of the state that has helped it, demanding 
something better than they had, insisting that the leg' 
islature, through their representatives, should do for you 
and help you to get the education that you are seeking. 
Use it, use it well, be men and women, make better the 
state, and the educational facilities of the state, and you 
will do well your part in life. (Applause.) 

Ihancellor Andrews: We are very much obliged to 
for these admirable words, and I hope we will take 
n to heart and obey them. They are in line with the 
igs we try to teach in the University. The first docuit 
relating to the earliest times of the history of the 
versity that I happened to read, is signed by a gentle-1 
that is on the platform, a gentleman known up and 
n the Commonwealth, and way beyond, for his great 
icities and magnificent public services. I refer to Exernor 
Furnas, of course (Applause). I am going to 
oduce him as the grand old man of Nebraska, by which </seg>


            <seg id="p028">
28 

I don't mean to emphasize his age, for he is not any older 
than the youngest man among us, but I mean in other 
words, to introduce him as the "Gladstone of Nebraska." 

Governor Furnas will say a few words to us. 

I Governor R. W. Furnas: Mr. President, Mr. Chanaland 
Students of the University: When I use the 
•d "students" I do not mean to select from this audie 
those who are in attendance from this University, 
everybody present, because education commences at 
cradle and ends at the grave, and you older persons 
3 are here engaged in these meetings during this week, 
e as much to learn hereafter as you have learned 
ore. Mr. Chancellor, you have chosen to speak of me 
iplimentary in reference to the early efforts in intro:ing 
education into this state. Pardon me if I say a 
t words on that point that might be considered as per- 

In my boyhood days there were scarcely any educational 
antages, and since then I have felt that I have been 
idicapped almost in all my life's work for the want of 
education that I ought to have had. Hence, when I 
le to this territory, forty-seven years ago, I thought I 
r an opportunity to do something in the line of educal. 
There was at that time no educational school law in 
territory of Nebraska. I was honored by a seat in 
Territorial Legislature, and I made it one of the first 
ies of my work to introduce a bill, establishing a sys-1 
of education in the Territory of Nebraska. I was 
cessful in obtaining its passage, and it did a great 
•k, but since that date we have grown so that other 
nges have been necessary. 

I had the honor of being appointed by the Governor as 
one of the members of the first Board of Regents of this 
Iniversity, and was partly instrumental in erecting the 
main building on this campus, when it was thought we 
were way in advance of the times; that we did not need a </seg>


            <seg id="p029">
29 

University, and there was a disposition on the part of the 
people to advance in that as well as all things else that 
has made this a great State The University was put in 
motion, it didn't require much urging, not much of it. 

I had the honor of presiding over the first Territorial 
educational convention in Nebraska. I mention these 
facts to show that I have taken an interest and felt an 
interest by reason of having been deprived of an education 
that I should have had in an earlier day. It has 
always afforded me great pleasure to stand before the 
young men and men of this state, who are engaged in 
qualifying themselves for after life and usefulness, and 
let me say right here in regard to this after usefulness: 
You may pass through this University and obtain your 
diploma. Your effort for an education is not finished; you 
simply have your credentials to go out into this world and 
fight its battles. And remember, life is what you make 
it. I have in my mind an instance now of a man I knew 
in Ohio before I came here, who was said to be the best 
educated man in that country, who was sawing wood for a 
living. He did not know how to utilize his education. I 
want to emphasize these words, "Life in irhat you inilh 
it." Your diploma, when you obtain it from this University, 
is simply a credential to go out into the world and 
make a living for yourself. 

I don't know what else I can say other than to mak 
some comparisons in educational matters, as well as in all 
else, in a new country like this that tends to make a happy 
and prosperous people. This State is an exceptional 
instance in making one feel youthful; at any rate I was 
fan old man when I came here and I don't propose to be 
old man as long as I live. One of the most abhorent 
ideas of life is to grow out of usefulness and have it said 
after awhile, there is Furnas, he has been but can't do 
anything more, he has served his day and is laid 
away on the shelf. When that time comes I don't want to </seg>

            <seg id="p030">
30 


Iy here any longer, I want to quit when I cannot do anyng 
for the fellowfnen of my race. I have followed alf 
! instrumentalities of advancement in this Territory and 
ite from its foundation until the present date, and let 
say that it is a matter of great pride to the men whore 
here when the foundation was laid to witness the 
rancement that has been made. A stranger comes into 
s State and looks over it and says, you have got a nice 
intry, and he does not see much difference from where 
came from and what he finds here. But he don't stop 
think there are those living here who witnessed the 
indation laid. 

Ii educational matters we have been an exceptional 
e. I used to think that perhaps we were a little 
avagant in preparing for educating the youth of thise. 
I remember instances when school houses were 
t out on these open prairies with no children to send 
:hool. We were certainly entitled to great credit for 
ing these great advanced preparations. The advancet 
here has been, without exception, the development 
growth of our State in educational matters. When I 
e here, and others at the same date, we felt if there 
anything to be developed in Nebraska, it was its agriure, 
and those developments have been made beyond 
expectations of anybody. 

|[n the work of the State Board of Agriculture we have, 
some extent, endeavored to secure active Co-operation 
tween the scientists of the University and those inter;ed 
directly in agricultural pursuits. 

When we first undertook to organize these matters we 
found that in the University among the faculty there was 
just that disposition that I like to see in those engaged in 
scientific work, and my idea was if we could connect the 
practical with the scientific we could obtain the highest 
result. We have an experimental farm where all the factors 
connected with agriculture are in full operation, and </seg>


            <seg id="p031">
31 

I ere young men and women can obtain all the education 
t is to make them of future worth to you. And it is 
m this scientific standpoint, and agriculture, there is 
t as much science in agriculture as anything else, and 
re should be as much time and money devoted to 
king scientific agriculturists as any of the professions, 
1 we are learning that more and more every day we 
! from the sharp competition in everything and especif 
in the products of the soil. I think I have occupied 
time as much as I can advantageously. When I start 
these agricultural matters I know hardly where to stop. 

Chancellor Andrews: We are going to heed Governor 
Furnas, and we are not going to wait for the bell. We 
are very much obliged to you Governor Furnas for the 
words you have expressed in our hearing this morning. 
When I think of the early history of the University I am 
always impressed with the wisdom of the men who had it 
in charge at an early day. I don't know exactly how but 
some how or other, the foundations of this University were 
well laid. The earliest methods and ideas of the promotors 
were substantially right, and I think it true almost 
beyond that of any other University of any place in this 
country or elsewhere. The progress has been uniformly 
on the good side. I don't refer to the profit which the 
state has made, but I refer to the results accomplished 
by the University and of the men who, whether in science, 
literature, art in every department, I know I speak of all 
those who labor in the University today, that it would be 
the richest reward that would possibly come to us if we 
could feel that we were in some sort, living up to the 
expectations of the men who laid the foundation of the 
University, a few of whom are still with us, thank God. 

His excellency, Governor Mickey is with us and will 
now speak. </seg>

GOVERNOR IflCKEY: If I have the right impression I 
was asked to be here a little while this morning, and to 
speak on the subject of "Giving." i hardly know what t&lt;&gt; 
say to you. I have not had time for preparation that I 
should have had to speak to this intelligent audience, but 
what I have to say will b? along the line I believe in. First, 
I think we ought to be willing to give ourselves in this 
life a fair chance in relation to life. I remember reading 
an incident of a boy years ago who, among other laborers, 
was helping to build the state house in the State of Indiana, 
and some of the fellow laborers with him made fun of 
him because he had a book in his pocket, and he would 
read it occasionally. And one day he turned and said to 
them, "never you mind, I will be Governor of this great 
State some day," and sure enough he was. He was giving 
to himself thoughts when he had spare moments. 

I remember another incident where a boy, in the city &lt;&gt;f 
:*acuse, New York, a bootblack, stood on the step of a 
;at building, eating his lunch. Presently some one from 
&gt;ve threw out a bucket of water and it fell down on 
n. He jumped up, turned around, looked quite indigit 
and shouted back, "some day I will own this block 
i I will discharge you." Sure enough, Jie is the pom 
fee simple of the title of that block. Of course, the sernt 
that throwed that water out died, and he didn't have 
• privilege of discharging him. I speak of this to show 
it we want to give ourselves a fair chance. That boy, a 
)t-black, saved his money and gave himself a chance to 
! it, and made himself marked in the world. 

I remember reading of an incident that occurred in the 
state of Kansas many years ago, in the early settlement 
of that state, where there lived a man who moved from 
the east, with two small children, his wife, and I think a 
large New Foundland dog. That man had occasion one 
day to leave his home, and after he had been gone a while 
his wife discovered that the youngest of the familv was </seg>

            <seg id="p033">
33 


not in sight, and she hunted for the little tot but failed to 
find it After searching in vain for the little one, she 
became discouraged and then went to the nearest neigh 
bor, some few miles away, and informed the friends that 
the child had wandered away, and they hunted and hunted 
until the father returned. After diligent search they 
found the little one, and the large New Foundland dog 
was with it, and there he was when they found them, 
.standing over her with his front foot on one side and hind 
foot on the other, a path worn around the little one who 
was lying under the dog unharmed. But tiie dog was torn 
and bleeding from the wolves who tried to get the child,and 
though torn from one side to the other, he had defended 
and preserved the life of that little one.so that the man had 
compassion on the dog and took him in his conveyance, 
but the faithful animal died before reaching home. The 
man was so overcome when the dog died that he buried 
him nicely and built a monument for him. He had given 
his life for that little girl. It is not what we get that 
makes us, but it is what we give out. The life that feeds 
on self will decay, but a life that gives something is a life 
that expands and grows, and that is what we are in this 
world for, and when we live any other life, we fail to 
accomplish the purpose that we are in this world for. It 
could not be otherwise. I sometimes think of men who 
like to live and accumulate and pile up. I have notictr' 
in my life where some men want more land and more cattle, 
and more hogs and more buildings, and more this and 
more that, and then they are wanting more land so they 
can feed more cattle, more hogs, etc. They live for that 
material gain, but they have to part with it some day. If 
the material things we gain are used intelligently they 
are a blessing, but to be absorbed in them and let them 1 e 
the burden of our lives and to rob ourselves of the higher 
and nobler impulses of this life, is a wrong thing to do. 

There was a man who lived in the state of New York, </seg>

            <seg id="p034">
34 


who had a small family, many years ago, and one of then? 
was a boy and his name was William. This man was a poor 
man, and his father was a candle and soap maker in the 
early days, and his boy, William, was living with him and 
helping him some, learning to make soap and candles. 
One day he said to his boy, I am not able to support you. 
The boy was just entering his teerts. He said "you will 
have to go out in the world and make your way alone. 
Sorry I cannot help you." So his mother gathered his^ 
things together for him, and he kissed her good bye and 
started for New York City. As he got a little ways from 
home he met an old friend, a Captain on the canal, and 
they knew each other. This captain was a good religious 
man, good at heart, and when he learned where William 
was going, the condition of things, he said to him, "let us 
get down and pray" and so they got down and prayed, 
the Captain praying for him. They got up. After he had 
prayed that Cod would bless him, he said to him: "Now, 
William, the first thing you do is to give your heart to 
God, be a good man, and after you do that, when you 
earn money remember this, you give one-tenth of all that 
you get to God, and you will be prosperous and happy, a 
rich man, and do a great deal of good in the world." So 
they parted and William went on to New York City. Of 
course William was lonesome. He was walking the street 
and he heard the music in the church, and the door was 
open and walked in. They were holding services. The 
opportunity was given to confess Christ. William was, 
of course, away from home and he remembered what the 
Captain said to him, and when the invitation was given he 
signified his desire to join the church. It was but a day 
or two until a soap firm in the city wanted help, he went 
into their employ and worked a few days, and when they 
came to pay him they handed him a small amount, and 
this thought came to him when he got his first money, 
that ten cents of each dollar belonged to God. True to </seg>


            <seg id="p035">
35 

the right impulses of the mind, after he had read the 
bible and learned how the Jews used to go and take ten 
cents out of the first dollar to give to God, that boy had 
something in the Lords" treasury and he prospered and 
became a valuable employe to this firm, and finally became 
a partner and when he became a partner in the business 
of course he had something to say as to its conduct. He 
remembered then what his Captain had said to him, that 
when he made soap to "make an honest pound of good 
soap and you will always have a sale for it," and^stire 
enough when he became a partner he followed that principle. 
Everybody bought soap of this man. He prospered 
and married and gave one tenth to the Lord. 
Finally the other member of the firm died and he became 
the sole owner of this soap manufactory. He said to his 
book keeper one day, one tenth of all you earn put into a 
certain fund, which he did. And he kept on until he got 
an abundance and he finally said to his book keeper, I will 
give all my profits, and he gave millions to the building of 
hospitals and other things to help the world. 

I speak of this to show this thought, that if we can put 
trust in God and do what He wants us to do in this 
Id, that He will give us opportunities, and if we 
rove our opportunities along these lines, it is hard to 
mate what great good men and women can accomplish, 
ape that these thoughts this morning will help you. 
jcially the younger people, to see that in your life 
ad of you there are great opportunities to make youres 
helpful and useful. (Applause.) 

REPORT OF SECRETARY

36 

with 1901, no detailed or definite statistics are available to 

show, but conservative estimates of persons well informed 

in regard to the matter [dace the increased butter produc- 

tion in the State for the year 1902 a^ 33-1-3 per cent as 

compared with 1901. If I should be asked which were 

two most important factors in causing the great 

ase, I should unhesitatingly reply: First The Hand 

In this connection we should not lose dght of the fact 

that there has also been a marked improvement in tht 

price of dairy product , especially the price received by 

dairymen for cream; and another factor equally important 

in any business or industry, and that is greater confidence 

in the future success of the dairy industry, occasioned b\ 

the passage of. the so-called "Grout Bill" by congn 

which, in a large measure, does away with the unfair an 

unjust competition which the legitimate dairy industry 

htt had to contend with for many years in the sale of 

imitation and fraudulent dairy product 

The U. S. Census returns for the year 1900 show that as 

compared with returns for 1890 there had been in thi 

State an increase of 36 per cent in butter production per 

cow per year. This does not mean that our dairy cows 

actually produce that much more of butter, but rather 

that we save 36 per cent more of what they do product 

than we did ten years ago. 

This increase, this saving, is due to better methods in 

the handling of the milk and the separation therefrom of 

the cream or butterfat. 

Under the deep can or shallow pan system formerly 

. a large per cent of the cream, or butterfat in milk. 

was left in the skimmed milk, and was thus practically 

lost or wasted. By means of the separator not only is all 

the cream or butterfat separated from the milk, but the 

cream thus obtained as a whole is more valuable f&lt; r

butter making than the cream obtained by previous 
methods. 

The scattered condition of our dairies makes it expensive 
and impractical to haul the milk from the farm to a 
separator, even when centrally located, in order to have 
the cream separated from the milk, and then to haul the 
skimmed milk back to the farm, it being much less expensive 
and more practical for each dairyman to own a hand 
separator of his own. This latter plan has been and is 
being largely adopted by the dairymen in all parts of the 
state, with results so satisfactory both to the dairymen 
and the purchasers of cream and the manufacturers of 
butter, and there has been a marked increase in cream and 
butter production as before indicated. It is certainly a 
conservative estimate to say that in Nebraska, a dairyman 
who has a hand separator, or who can conveniently deliver 
his milk at a skimming station, has for sale an average of 
50 per cent more cream or butterfat from the same number 
of cows, than when he used the deep can system of 
separating the cream from the milk, and a considerable 
per cent of such dairymen have an increase of 100 per

ALFALFA 

{lotwithstanding that the great value of alfalfa to the 
ry and livestock interests of the state will be ably preted 
at this meeting of our Association, its importance 
mt slightly realized or appreciated by the great mass 
the people of our state. 

Our soil and climate seem to be particularly adapted to 
the successful growing of this plant, and especially is this 
the case when the plant has become acclimated. The 
alfalfa plant seems to adapt itself readily to surrounding 
conditions and the best results in securing a stand in seed-

E1902 report of the Wisconsin Dairymens' Association, 
discussing this question, the following is reported as 
&gt;f. Henry's statement in regard to the feeding value of 
5 plant: 

"I am going to show you some alfalfa hay cuttings, the 
second or third cutting from the University farm. We 
all know it was an excessively dry season. Now I wish 
you farmers would realize that alfalfa has got as much 
nitrogen in it as wheat bran, and if you should put that 
into a mill and grind it up and feed it to your cows, you 
could feed it pound for pound instead of wheat bran." 

In the same report, ex-governor Hoard quoted authority 
show "that eleven pounds of alfalfa hay, cut at the 
ht period and rightly cured, are the equal of eight 
inds of oats and corn and bran as a milk-producing 
d." Prof. Emery: "In what proportion?" Ex-Govlor 
Hoard: "One quarter oats, one quarter corn and one 
f bran." "Now, when a farmer can grow a plant like 
ilfa, as Prof. Henry says, pound for pound, worth a? 
ch to produce milk as bran, or that eleven pounds of it 
the equivalent of eight pounds of mixed grain, it is a 
position that ought to appeal to the brains of every 
mer in the United States." 

In conversation recently with one of the managers of a 
ge creamery in this state, a creamery which by the way 
nufactured 4,000,000 pounds of creamery butter in the 
ir 1902, he stated that those sections of their territory 
ere alfalfa was raised could be readily shown by the 
variations in the quality of cream received by them 
m such locality as compared with the wide variations in 
intity received from localities where the plant is not 
•wn. Also, that in December last, because of cold and 
rmy weather, in localities where alfalfa is not grown 
« cream business" as he expressed it "went all to

(jived, while at the same time, from localities where 
ilfa is grown there was not only no decrease but a 
•ked increase in the amount of cream received, which 
accounted for by saying that when the weather was 
isant, farmers were accustomed to let their cows range 
fields and rustle for a living, but when the weather 
unfavorable they fed alfalfa hay, which resulted in a 
ked increase in the milk and cream product. 

I am aware that exagerated statements as to yields of 
alfalfa and the feeding value of the hay have some times 
been made, yet to the mass of our people, and especially 
those engaged in dairying, the great value of this plant is 
not appreciated or even realized.

THE PHYSIOLOGY OF MILK-SECRETION.

STATION, AMES, IOWA. 

tlilk is the normal secretion of the mammary gland of 
lales of the order mammalia. In this paper, however. 
f cow's milk will be consierded. It is white, opaque, 
htly sweet in taste, alkaline or amphoteric in reaction 
I has a characteristic odor. The specific gravity is 1029 
1033. It is composed approximately of water 
ar 5'/&lt; , fat 4'/&lt; , casein and albumen 34' ( and salts i' &lt; . 
•h of these constituents is in itself highly complex in 
composition. The component parts are disposed as foil* &gt;ws : 
casein, albumen, sugar and salts are in solution in the 
water making a solution called whey. The fat is in suspension 
in the whey. The fat is divided into very minute 
globules or particles 1-2500C to 1-5000 of an inch in diameter 
each of which is surrounded by a thin sheet of casein 
which prevents a coalescence of the srlobules. In the pro- </seg>

            <seg id="p040">
40 


uf churning the casein envelopes are broken and the 
globules of fat collect in masses which we call butter. 
Milk is ordinarily considered a solution but it is, strictly 
speaking, an emulsion, as the oil globules are only in suspension 
and not in solution. Under the high power of the 
microscope the oil droplets appear as highly refractive 
bodies floating in a clear fluid. 

As stated at the outset, milk is a secretion of the mammary 
gland. This gland is a dependency of the skin and 
is a member of the group of glandular structures known 
as compound saccular, or racemose glands. A cow has 
four such glands which combined form what is popularly 
known as the bag or udder. Each gland is composed of 
15 or 20 distinct lobes which are held together by connective 
tissue so as to form a single conical mass. Each lobe 
is subdivided by penetrating septa of fibrous and fatty 
tissue into numerous lobules which are again subdivided 
into the individual sacs called acini. The acini are very 
small barely visible to the naked eye, and each one is 
lined by numerous columnar epithelial cells. These cells 
are microscopic in size, varying from 1 1000 to 1 200 of 
an inch in diameter. Each acinus has a minute tubular 
duct leading from it. These small ducts unite to form 
larger ones which constitute the ducts of the lobules. 
These larger ducts still further unite to form the common 
lactiferous, or milk-bearing, canals which in turn empty 
into the large cavities at the lower part of the gland, 
called milk sinuses. The ducts and milk sinuses are lined 
with epithelium. 

By way of illustration, in order to make the description 
which I have given more clear, I will ask you to imagine 
a very prolific grape vine with fifteen or twenty bunches 
of grapes hanging close together. This would represent 
in a rough way a mammary gland. Each one of the 
bunches would figure as a lobule and each grape on a </seg>


            <seg id="p041">
41 

Ich an acinus. Now conceive each grape hollowed out 
ost to the hull and then lined with small column-like 
ies. These bodies would represent the cells. The 
n of each individual grape will represent the small 
srlobular duct which conveys the secretion out from 
little sac in which it is formed. The main stem of the 
chand the principal branch upon which the various 
ches hang typify the interlobular and the common 
retory .canals. The fibrous and fatty tissue between 
acini and lobules of the gland may be likened to the 
which everywhere fills the interstices of the various 
ts of the vineful of grapes. 

The milk sinus of which I spoke above has in each gland 
a capacity of about one pint, making two quarts for the 
entire udder. In these sinuses together with the ducts 
and acini the milk which is secreted during the intervals 
of milking or suckling is stored up. The milk finds its 
way to the exterior during the milking process through an 
extension of the milk-forming apparatus called the 
mamilla, nipple, or teat which is pierced by a canal to 
admit of the passage of the fluid. 

The condition of the mammary gland varies with the 
different periods of life as well as under different conditions. 
In early life and up to to the time when the first 
period of pregnancy is progressing the gland is usually in 
a rudimentary state, consisting then chiefly of fibrous and 
fatty tissue. The functional elements, namely the cells, 
acini and ducts are a solid, unexpanded, inactive mass. 
Near the termination of the period of gestation these 
essential parts of these organs undergo a rapid development 
so as to be in a condition for active work at the 
proper time. During this preparatory stage the connective 
tissue septa become reduced to quite thin partitions and 
the secreting tissues greatly predominate. After a considerable, 
but varviner. period of lactation the functional </seg>

            <seg id="p042">
42 


l 

parts of the organ become less and less conspicuous until, at 
their action ceases altogether. This we call "going 
dry." Then unless another period of gestation intervenes 
this state of atrophy becomes permanent. Thus there is 
seen to be a close sympathy between the organs of generation 
and those of lactation. 

The mammary glands are supplied with blood ve.-nerves 
and lymphatics. The blood supply finds its way to 
the glands through the external pudic artery. It is carried 
along the ducts in the connective tissues by small vessels 
and finally right up to the epithelial cells by the capillary 
•is. The blood is conveyed from the udder by the 
subcutaneous abdominal, or milk-veins, which pass forward 
along the abdomen just under the skin to the region of the 
sternum where they penetrate the abdominal wall and 
enter the thorax by numerous perforations several of 
which are so large that they may readily be felt with the 
end of the finger. These openings are popularly called 
"milk-pores" or "milk-fountains," names which are, however, 
not very appropriate. The size of these openings 
and of the milk-vein are by some considered an evidence 
of capacity for milk-production, but such an inference is 
of doubtful propriety and often misleading. The lymphatics 
follow pretty closely the course of the blood 
els. 

The nerves come from the first pair of the lumbar plexus 
and ramify to the walls of the acini. 

Allow me now to consider briefly the exact mechanism 
of milk secretion. The epithelial cells to which I have 
already directed your attention with their blood and nerve 
supply are the important factors in milk secretion. All 
other things are subordinate. Upon the development of 
the cells depend the quality and quantity of the secretion.

the center of the cell is a small particle of more con- 

densed protoplasm called the nucleus. As the time of 

calving approaches these cells multiply rapidly and are 

cast off into the acinus. In addition large white blood 

El, called leukocytes, find their way into the acini and 
tubules. These leukocytes take up fat droplets which 
secreted by the epithelial cells. When calving occurs

            <seg id="p044">

milk secretion the whole cell does not degenerate, only the 
outer part of it. The fat, casein, albumen and milk sugar 
are formed by this process of partial degeneration of the 
cell. The water and salts, on the other hand, are the 
result of simple transudation, or filtration, from the blood 
and lymph capillaries which surround the cells. As evidence 
that the casein and sugar are not a mere filtrate 
we have the fact that they do not exist preformed in the 
blood or lymph even up to the point at which these fluids 
come into contact with the cell. Fat exists in the blood 
but only in very small quantities. The total amount of 
fat in the blood of a cow would not equal the amount of 
fat removed from the udder at one milking. It is evident, 
therefore, that the fat, sugar and casein, the greater part 
of the bulk of solids in milk, are the product of special 

It is essential also to note that the greater part of the 
milk is secreted during the act of suckling or milking. It 
has been shown that the milk sinuses will hold about two 
quarts of milk. Allowing a like amount for the capacity 
of the acini and ducts and it is seen that the total capacity 
of the udder is about one gallon. This is not more than a 
third or a fourth of what a good cow will produce at a 
milking or a suckling. In the intervals of withdrawal of 
milk from the udder the gland cells are in a state of partial 
rest but as soon as withdrawal is begun the cells, 
which are under direct control of the nerves and blood 
supply, are excited to great activity with the result that 
milk is produced in large quantities. An additional evidence 
that in the intervals of milking the cells are only 
slightly active is found in the fact that the milk which is 
stored up during these intervals is very watery and poor 
in fat. During these rest periods the transudation of 
water is out of proportion to the production of solids, 
especially fat which is the direct result of cell activity. 

Knowing, then, that the principal constituents of milk </seg>

EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 

I the direct outcome of the cellular activity of the mamry 
gland we are prepared to appreciate the great 
wrtance of proper development of this gland. As a 
i a good udder is one of generous size, but this is n&lt; t 
ays the case. The fibrous and fatty tissue which make 
the supporting framework of the udder may be of such 
essive development as to contribute a large part of the 
k. Such an udder, though large, is apt to be rigid and 
,-ielding and to be reduced only slightly in size by milk. 
I would consider that pliability of the udder after 
milk has been withdrawn is a characteristic of great 
x&gt;rtance in deterimining the value of an udder as a 
k producer. 

More valuable, however, than any external appearance 
is the application to each individual cow in a herd of some 
test of total solids or of fat alone. Owing to the fact that, 
as a general rule, the other solids of milk maintain a tolerably 
constant ratio to the fat, it is a common practice to 
judge of the value of a dairy cow by the per centage of 
fat which her milk contains. For the determination of 
fat the Babcock test is used almost exclusively for commercial 
testing. There are other methods which are more 
accurate but on account of the difficulty which attends 
their use they are employed only in the laboratory. Before 
a dairyman can lay claim to an accurate knowledge of 
the producing powers of the individuals of his herd he 
must have applied a fat test to each of them a sufficient 
number of times to detect the fluctuations which ordinarily 
occur in every cow. 

In breeding or purchasing dairy cows choice may be 
made from one or more of the well known dairy breeds or 
from a good milking strain of the beef type. Many grade 
cows of unknown breeding are excellent dairy animals, and 
it is profitable to search for and find them. The day is 
coming when dairy cows will be bought and sold upon the 
basis of response to the Babcock test. This is an ideal </seg>

which may soon be reached if it is striven for 

The manner of feeding also has an important bearint 

upon milksecretion. Of eoorse, it is true that if a cow- 

has a poorly developed milk secreting apparatus no method 

of feeding will make a good cow of her. Recent tests at 
experiment stations have shown that the fat content of 
milk can not be much increased by feeding methods. 
There is a maximum limit of production, dependent upon 
the gland development, peculiar to each individual cow 
beyond which she can not be forced by any kind of feeding. 
However, any cow whether good or bad, that has 

been poorly fed can be much improved by proper fot 
given in sufficient quantity 

Water, of all foods, has the greatest influence upon the 
composition of milk. Cows should have as much water as 
Ivill drink not less frequently than twice a day. In 
tor it should be heated so as to remove the chill. The 
er should always be pure. The drinking of impure 
er not only has a deletarious effect upon the milk, but 
ads to parasitic infestation which lowers the vitality 
ns the milk flow. Of the inorganic foods, per-3 
the only one that needs to be supplied is common 
The other inorganic constituents are present in sufnt 
quantities in the food and water. 

P connection with organic foodstuffs attention is called 
e fact that the various food elements, viz: proteids, 
shydrates and hydrocarbons, are not transferred 
tly from the food to the milk. These food princifirst 
undergo chemical change in the process of digestion 
and later on, as has already been pointed out, they 
undergo chemical change in the epithelial cells of the 
mammary gland. It is well known that starches, sugars 
and proteids are converted into fats. Also that one kind 
of fat is changed into another kind. The casein of the 
milk is supposed to be produced from the albumen of the </seg>

I^hile it is doubtless true that a cow kept at perfect 
; will, other things equal, give the greatest quantity of 
k, yet considerations of health forbid such forcing and 
uire that the cow be given moderate exercise in the 
n air. Undue exertion should be avoided. 

As the milk glands are under direct control of the nervous 
system any conditions which affect the nervous sys 
tern will react upon the milk-producing glands. Any 
undue disturbance of the normal distribution of the 
nervous force will divert some of the blood-supply from 
the milk glands to some other part of the body and thus 
diminish the milk flow. The well known phenomenon &lt;&gt;f 
"not giving down" the milk is the result of lack of nervous 
tone in the gland brought about by some sort of excitement. 
The udder is not a container in which the milk is 
ready stored up at milking time but an organ in which, as 
has already been pointed out, the greater part of the milk 
is elaborated while milking or suckling is in progress by 
viitue of the agitation produced. Unless the cow is in 
perfect repose, this secretion will not take place normally. 
The lesson to be derived from this is that the cow should 
be treated with the greatest gentleness and be otherwise 
kept free from excitement, especially during the time of 
milking or suckling.

Our first acquaintance with it was made in the spring of 

. when we saw a soft velvety plant growing on the 

dirt that was thrown out of our cellar. We did not then 

think that this tender and innocent looking plant would 

soon be the subject of legislation, nor was there a suspi- 

cion of its ever being cultivated and becoming one of the 

most helpful plants in the transforming of our section of 

the country. We being at that time a farming community. 

our hatred of it, as we soon saw it spreading on all the 

Kivated fields, was intense. But it has proven itself to 
uch a friend in our time of need, that a fire has

keep the crazy cows away from the cultivated lands, and 
much that had been cultivated was left idle, and our cows 
fed almost exclusively on these idle lands where only the 
ian Thistle grew, and while we were not scientific 
dairy people, we were dependent on butter and eggs 
largely for our living, and our wives were living Babcock 
Testers of cream. And I want to say right here that the 
Ru.-sian Thistle has been accused of making unpalatable 
and stinking butter when, if the smeller had only been a 
little longer, or the nose not turned up at the Russian 
Thistle, the proper origin of the bad taste and smell 
would have been found, and his lovely name is Star cf 
Bethlehem; we call him the nasty wild onion. Some of 
the masters of the herds about this time discovered that 
there was more grazing on a small patch of Russian Thistles 
than there was on a much larger area of our short 
nutritious grass. One acre of thistles is probably equal to 
five for this purpose. 

Towards the spring of 1897 I was a little short of feed 
and a neighbor having both corn fodder with a few nubbins 
on it and thistles, told me I could have my choice of 
either corn fodder $3.00 per load or thistles for $1.00. I 
hauled a few loads of the fodder when the supply gave 
out and I was forced to take thistles or nothing. I had 
but little faith in them but thought I would try a load and 
I soon discovered that I had missed it by not taking the 
thistle feed all the time. This was my first experience 
with the Russian Thistle as a cured feed. I had not been 
among the first to try it, but being raised in Missouri I 
had gotten my lesson well, and I put up perhaps a hundred 
or more tons of it that year and have never been 
without it since. It has solved the question of wintering 
stock in our section of the country, and when winter 
dairying is taken up in earnest, the Russian Thistle will be 
an important factor in the sections of country where a 
lack of moisture makes farming doubtful. </seg>

L EXPERIENCE IN THE MANAGEMENT AND 
OPERATION OF SKIMMING AND CREAM 
RECEIVING STATIONS 

J. N. ASHBURN. GIBBON 

Irhe work of a station-operator is of more importance 
the development of dairying in Nebraska than you 
ght suppose; and the success of his employer's business 
each station is, in a large degree made or marred by 
• station man's ability, character and methods. 

Eot only must his every day work in the station be ably 
conscientiously performed, but he should take an 
rest in the whole subject of dairying, read current 
y literature and be able to talk it intelligently to his </seg>

patrons whose methods might be improved, and interestingly 
and convincingly to persons who could and should be 
dairying but are not. 

Eany of us are young men and hardly realize the possiies 
of our position and the extent of our opportunity 
ush the good cause along. 

In the nature of the business, it is impossible for the 
station-operator's labors for increase of business or to 
improve conditions to bear material fruit at once. This is 
perhaps especially true with us out in the western portion 
of the state where, three and a half years ago, dairying 
for a profit was practiced scarcely at all; where our work 
was in a sense pioneer work, and where the business was 
largely built up by convincing men who did not milk that 
milking will pay and inducing them to begin, after which 
the man had to secure his dairy cows or select them from 
his range stock. And the results, or the satisfactory ones, 
did not appear the first season in most cases. The stationman 
then was inclined to become discouraged, and sometimes 
no doubt a conscientious, energetic fellow has done 
gook work and accomplished much -more than even he 
knew -and then left the field to another who stepped into 
an immediately increasing business and received, from 
many unobserving people,the credit for the results accomplished 
by his predecessor's efforts. 

So we have learned not to be too impatient for results. 

The station which I operate was opened in August, 1899, 
the first of a line of them extending along the railroad a 
couple of hundred miles. Between that time and the following 
spring ten more new skimming stations were 
erected, and eight old creamery plants were leased to 
be used as skimming stations. (Only two of these creameries 
were in operation, and they in a small way.) The 
business from the whole nineteen plants was not very imposing 
the first season, but at most of the new points be- </seg>


            <seg id="p055">
55 

Iie quite well established and confidence in the industry 
; being resurrected at the defunct creamery points. 1 
lk the new stations in territory where dairying was p racily 
unknown made a better showing at first than the old 
imeries and I'm sure the wcrk was pleasanter there, 
as the season advanced and the farmers became c-on;ed 
that the skimming station was operated on business 
iciples, was pitying and had come to stay, they went 
k to milking cows and the pioneer work of those early 
imeries began to show. 

I At a few of the points the business dragged, decidedly 
some of the stations were so situated, geographically 
nean in relation to roads and distances) that I think 
y could never have been successful as milk-receiving 
nts; but generally the outlook was very encouraging 
second spring, when the Hand-separator made its 
iearance and began to make the change which it ! 
roughly accomplished now. 

On this territory today, thirty-one or two cream receiving 
stations are flourishing and at only two, or possibly 
there is any whole milk being handled and, in each of these 
cases, a very small run. Probably a thousand, or more, 
hand-separators have been sold during the last eighteen or 
twenty months and the prospects are good, I am told, that 
nearly as many more will be placed the coming season. 

I The most troublesome detail of the skimming station 
;m was the matter of transporting the milk to and 
i the station. We found the only practical way to 
mplish this was by means of regular haulers who 
e over certain regular routes every day and were paid 
ted price per hundred pounds of milk. A few handrators 
scattered along any route would cut down the 
of milk enough to make the trip unprofitable for the 
er and he would quit business, in a way, forcing the 
nee of his patrons to get a separator or cease to be

l 

patrons. And that is one of the reasons the change waa 
wrought bo quickly. In June, 1901, my station handled in 
the neighborhood of ten thousand pounds of milk daily. 
Last June one year later we received only about thirteen 
thousand pounds of whole milk in the entire month 
but had made a substantial increase over the June previous 
in the total butterfat received. 

I 'he belief is universal, out our way that the hand-sector 
system ha.: ,¦ me to stay and that it is a great 
Movement over the skimming station plan, as no 
ibt it L-. from the standpoint of the western farmer at 
Jt, and quite frequently we find a man who feels 
re" about the skimming plants, says their being di&gt;tinued 
so soon proved them a failure and the money 
ested in them wasted. (They were all built by 
ipanies of farmers and local business men.) This feelis 
not general but nearly every thinking dairyman, 
n those who are now the most enthusiastic hand septor 
advocates, will tell you that the skimming station 
i a necessary step in this wonderful growth in dairy, 
and one well worth the expense. 

However that may be, we as station operators are not 
re. ixmsible for the change in system, but now that the 
hand-seperator has come to be the "whole thing" in western 
dairying, we find our work, both inside and outside 
the station materially changed and we have had to learn 
several new things. 

The handling of the product after it is received inside 
the station is now, of course, simplified so far as the work 
is concerned, but the operator is naturally as fully responsible 
for the quality and condition of the cream which he 
«ends to the factory, now, as he was before, and, getting 

Eito his own hands at a later stage, he finds more diffiy 
in controlling these things. Uniformity or a very 
• approach to it is impossible It can he approximated </seg>


            <seg id="p057">
57 

twhen the patrons can and will deliver their cream 
[uently (and all equally so,) and skim a cream of about 
same density, holding it at a proper temperature, stir- 

It is perhaps more difficult to secure this proper handling 
in a community where more than half the patrons are 
grain-farmers first and dairying receives only secondary 
consideration, the farmers being busiest at the time of 
year when the cream requires most attention. 

Station operators, with us are not required to "grade" 
cream except into two classes, viz: that which is right 
which we accept and that which we reject on account of 
taint, thin consistency, sourness or any other defect which 
renders it unfit to make the journey to the churning plant 
and arrive in fit condition to be made into good butter. 
Here, I believe is the most difficult part of a station man's 
duties. If this part is done perfectly, the buttermaker is 
relieved of most of his much talked of trouble with quality 
of butter made from hand-separator cream. In the 
first place most of us are probably incompetent to draw 
this line to a fine point, never having had experience in 
buttermaking — Secondly, - competition is sharp and 
strong: (Undoubtedly a good thing for the industry generally), 
and in almost every village where any cream is 
handled, two or more creamery companies are doing business 
or trying to. In my town three companies are represented 
by local agents. If a reliable and valued patron 
brings one of us a batch of cream that is a little old or 
otherwise "off" and we know it but it isn't very bad and it is 
a first, or infrequent occurrence, we are quite averse to 
taking the chance of losing the patron (to the other fellow) 
by rejecting this cream and we are very likely to take it 
in, with a word of caution for the future, which I don't 
suppose does the buttermaker a bit of good when he makes 
butter of that cream. 

If our duties were confined to our regular work in the </seg>

            <seg id="p058">

station, of receiving' weighing, testing, cooling, preparing; 
for shipment the cream and keeping our records and 
accounts, we would still, no doubt, make mistakes and 
have troubles enough, but when they are complicated by 
including getting and keeping business and the good wilt 
and confidence of the patrons, I am afraid it adds, in some 
cases, to the difficulty of making the distinctions in quality. 
This does not excuse us if we send in bad cream and 
and it should not be so, but perhaps it is quite in keeping 
with human nature that it is so,- sometimes. I will 
say that there has, in my experience, been very much less 
questionable cream offered than we were led to expect 
and when any comes in, it in almost every case, is the 
result of being held too long at a time when the farmer 
and his household are so busy as to make it practically 
impossible to deliver the cream with proper frequency. 
The patrons of my station have at all times taken a great 
deal of pains in handling their product and with almost no 
exceptions have made my work easier by bringing first 
quality cream, always. 

I Tie Babcock test is always a cause of some suspicion in 
ilities where it is new, simply because it is not under&gt;d, 
and an operator has to exercise some patience in 
ilaining it and inducing the doubters to come and see 
perated. The difference between butter-fat and butter 
uite a stumbling block for some people and the natural 
iation in test of a cow or herd is looked upon with 
»elief. This trouble, of course, is not continual but is 
ctically over when the test system becomes familiar 
, understood by the patrons. 

I believe that now, excepting by those patrons just beginning, 
the test at a station is as seldom questioned as 
the weights. Still I believe it to be all too easy to make 
errors in testing cream, —rather in sampling it as I think 
there is where most of the errors are made. We test </seg>


            <seg id="p059">
59 

every delivery of cream on the day it is received if possible 
and the process of mixing and sampling is not 
allowed to be hurried or slighted under any circumstances. 
I take a sample large enough in each case for two or three 
tests, and whenever the result is not clear and distinct for 
reading, or in any way makes me suspicious of its correct 
ness I repeat the test from that sample. 

I believe that more skill or experience is required to 
get perfect results in testing cream samples such as we 
have in a station than in testing milk, because of the 
greater range in consistency, the acidity etc. But after 
an operator has had enough experience to make him competent 
to handle a station, his errors and troubles with the 
test are almost invariably caused by his neglect or inaccuracy. 
We may occasionally hear an operator say that 
he is not getting very clear separations or satisfactory 
tests because the last batch of acid the company sent him 
was bad. This fellow's trouble can probably be traced to 
some other cause than poor acid, unless he has left it 
uncorked and exposed to the air for a long time. If he 
has reasonably pure water and clean glassware he can look 
for his trouble either in the proportion of acid used, the 
speed of his centrifuge or his temperature somewhere 
along the line. It gets to be a wonderfully old story this 
testing and we have to watch ourselves to see that we do 
not begin to take things for granted and neglect some of 
the scrupulous exactness necessary at every point. 

I We are in a position to do a good^work for the dairymen 
our district by inducing and assisting them to test their 
lividual cows, giving them an opportunity, with the 
owledge obtained of each cow's product, to cull out the 
profitable ones and so to build up a better dairy stock, 
may be that we are much more in need of this work in 
i west than in the eastern portions, I presume we are; 
t I will venture to say that a good many unprofitable </seg>

I's are being milked in every dairy community in the 
;e. The best thing is certainly for the dairymen to get 
nail tester and learn to operate it for himself, but not 
ly of our farmers have taken that much interest in the 
:ter yet, so to those parties who have an interest in 
ing a test made I offer to make the tests if they will 
lg me the samples taken in a way that will correctly 
resent what each cow produces and also keep the 
ghts of milk from each cow. I loan the patron a jar 
each cow to be tested and furnish preservative to keep 
samples when necessary; I ask him to bring a comite 
sample of four or six consecutive milkings. 

Ehis work can be done without interfering with our reg¦ 
station duties and is of great value if done acculy 
all along the line. 

t^ station-operator must be something of an authority 
separators. He is probably selling agent for one make 
machine and should be qualified not only to properly 
iresent that one but also be able to look after small 
ubles with any kind, and know whether it is doing good 
rk and if not, why not, and to apply such simple remes 
as adjustment, etc. 

So we may say that a station-operator's is not a monotonous, 
work, running always in one narrow groove, but is 
full of change and interest. It is a healthful work, both 
indoors and out, and with plenty of physical exercise. It 
is a stimulating work, with new lessons always to be 
learned, definite points to be attained and with competition 
always present. It is a good work; and if we will 
give it our whole attention and best efforts, we can have 
the satisfying knowledge that we are not only earning 
our salary by conducting an honest and remunerative 
business for our employer, but are helping to benefit our 
patrons, the dairymen even more, proportionately; and 
though working in a humble position, we are expending </seg>

Ktime and strength helping to push along that grand 
istry which is revolutionizing farming in Nebraska. 

Eiairman: I now have the pleasure of introducing to 
Dr. S. Stewart, of Kansas City, Mo., who will address 

TUBERCULOSIS OF THE DAIRY COW. 

A few years ago Dr. Edward Rush of New York became 
interested in the study of tuberculosis and after patient 
investigation as to the extent and prevalence of this disease 
he found that in every country where tuberculosis 
prevailed among the people it was also prevalent among 
the cattle used for dairy purposes. He found also that 
where milk and butter were not used as a food, the people 
were not afflicted with tuberculosis. Of the cattle slaughtered 
in Prussia a recent report shows that 14.6 percent 
were tuberculous: in Saxony the percentage found was 
29.3 in Belgium 20,850 cattle were tested in 1896 and 4&gt;. 
88 per cent were found to be afflicted with this disease 
An eminent authority in England estimates that 30 per 
cent of the cows of that country are tuberculous. In the 
New England states the percentage of tuberculous cows is 
probably not nearly so great, yet the number is relatively 
large. Under the direction of the cattle commi 
of Massachusetts, over 24,000 dairy cows were tested, 50 
percent of which were found to be tuberculous. These 
cattle were in the worst infected counties. The daries 
maintained by several of the states at the agricultural 
college farms, hospitals for the insane and other state in- 

Eutions, have been tested and in almost even- instance 
alarming, percentage of tuberculous cows have been 
ind. 

E&gt;f the cows shipped from the territory west of the Mis 
ri River to Omaha, St Joseph and Kansas City for 
lghter, many are found to be diseased with tubercu- </seg>

. hence it is fair to believe that the dairies of Ne 
ka are not free from this malady. A consideration of this 
subject at the present time may be helpful in drawing 
particular attention to the nature and characteristics of 
this disease and lead to the prevention of its extensive 
development throughout the dairy districts of this state. 

E'uberculosis as a disease is not confined to cattle but 
vails among all animals, domesticated or wild, even 
r ls and fishes contract the disease. 

!n animal body is composed of cells or unit elements 
inged in groups and tissues and these into masses or 
ans, such as mucous membrane, lungs, liver, muscles, 
es and skin. The cells of which flesh and bone are 
le up are cemented together into tissues and organs, 
in channels formed everywhere through these tissues 
organs in which flows streams of fluid that contain 
r ,e numbers of loose cells. These loose cells under ceri 
conditions can wedge their way between the fixed 
ue cells. 

The germ causing tuberculosis is very much smaller 
than either the loose cells floating in the body, or the 
fixed cells constituting the tissues, and when once it has 
found entrance into an animal body it can penetrate between 
the tissue cells. This little germ, the bacillus 
tuberculosis, finds its way into the animal body through 
various channels, and is able to make use of the tissues in 
which it becomes lodged, as food for growth and multiplication 
in numbers. Strange as it may seem, this germ is 
able to grow in any tissue of the animal body, hence it 
sets up diseased processes in the lungs, liver, glands, 
muscles, skin, and even the bones. The development of 
the germs in any tissue produces an irritation at that 
point and the tissue undertakes to protect itself from 
further encroachment by building a wall round about the 
invaders. Loose cells accumulate in an effort to surround </seg>

of the tubercle may be either gray or pink in color 
depending somewhat on the place in which it develops. 
These tubercles vary in size from a pin head to a pea, and 
when growing upon a serous membrane they have a gray 
or pearly color and constitute the old time "pearl disease" 
of cattle. These tubercles may grow close together and 
accumulate in masses as large as a walnut, a man's fist, 
or even larger than this. When the disease process has 
developed slowly the cheesy centers of the tubercles contain 
gritty particles of lime salts. Sometimes they 
coalesce run together and the dead and decomposed cells 
liecome large cheesy masses. 

If you are examing the carcass of a cow and should find 
jrcles such as have been described, and by cutting 
ti open you find the centers are made up of cheesy,

I his disease develops very slowly, it requiring weeks and 
iths for it to reach a stage at which any symptoms are 
duced recognizable by the ordinary observer. When 
disease is contracted by the animal breathing the 
ms into the lungs, the first symptom is a cough which 
dually becomes more and more frequent. Coughing 
lls are brought on by exertion, such as getting up after 
ing lain fora time, running, or by drinking freely of 
1 water. If the infection occurred through swallowing 
virus, often the first symptom is that of indigestion 
h bloating, and diarrhoea alternating with constipation, 
er the disease has progressed farther and interferes

I all the symptoms increase in severity until the animal 
lestroyed or dies of the disease. No matter in what 
an the disease first starts, it will ultimately spread to 
parts of the body. 

i^hen it develops in the udder, it is recognized by the 
nation of rounded masses here and there in one or 
¦e quarters. Sometimes a number of such masses, 
nng in size from a hazel nut to a walnut, are so close 
sther as to appear, when handled, as one nodular painmass. 
The quarters in which large masses develop

en such a one is found he should dispose of it and pr&lt;&gt;his

distant cough or diarrhoea, or continues to become

A. If it does not seem desirable to dispose of that 

animal at once, it should be kept apart from the others 
and watched for further developments. When a herd 
once becomes infected with tuberculosis, it will r.ot Ion*; 
remain a profitable herd. The loss from death and from 
shrinkage in quantity of milk and physicial condition of 
the animals is quite sure to take away the profits. 

There is yet another factor to be considered. The milk 
from a tuberculous cow when fed to pigs will give the disease 
to these animals. It is customary among dairymen 
and feeders of cattle to haul the carcass of a cow or steer 
that dies to a place where the swine may feed upon it, for 
the well established reason that raw flesh serves as change 
of diet. and stimulates to greater thriftiness. If such animal 
has died of tuberculosis, the swine which feed upon it 
are quite likely to contract the disease and prove not only 
a loss of the animals directly involved but also spread 
contagion to others. 

The carcass of a tuberculous animal may l&gt;e remi 
s.'rvicable as food for swine if it is thoroughly cookedand 
the milk from a tuberculous cows may l&gt;e rendered 
harmless by lx&gt;iling. Such cooking and boiling destroys the 
tubercular germs, but does not destroy the food value of 
the milk or flesh. 

In a former statement your attention was called to the 
relative prevalence of tuberculosis in cattle and mankind. 
This close association of the disease is a clinical fact 
which must impress every thinking man regardless of anv </seg>

Iories which may be promulgated. Tuberculosis in man 
poken of as the "the great white plague," and surely 
&gt; for more that 10 per cent of all the deaths in human 
d where statistics are kept is accredited to this disease. 
3 possible that in a large per cent of cases the disease 
ommunicated from one person to another, by cohabital 
and the lack of care in promptly rendering inert the 
tie of the consumptive. That the milk from tubercu; 
cows is another source of infection will not be 
bted by those who have investigated the large number 
instances in which children and adults have died of 
i disease and in which instances tuberculous cows were 
only discoverable source of infection. I feel confit 
that no Nebraska dairyman would for a moment cont 
to permit the milk of a tuberculous cow to be used as 
i in his own family or to be sold for food to other pers 
if he realized the great danger from the use of such 

Many eastern dairymen whose herds were infected, 
have weeded out all the infected animals, have disinfected 
their stables and inclosures, and rejuvenated their herds 
by adding only cows which were free from tuberculosis. 
This weeding out process and procuring animals free from 
this disease, has been accomplished by the use of tuberculin 
as a testing agent. By this agent it is possible to 
detect tuberculosis aniimals which give no outward 
signs of the disease, and makes quite certain the diagnosis 
in cases where the symptoms are not well marked, yet 
the disease be suspected because the animals have been 
exposed to infection. This plan has been thoroughly 
tested and proven effective, and I commend it to you as a 
means of protecting the lives of your families and customers 
and conserving your finances through prevention 
of loss of your animals and their products. </seg>

Q. Is there danger in using the milk 

A. There is a danger, but if the milk is boiled then it ii» 
rendered perfectly safe for food purposes. 

Q. J. K. Honeywell: What is the difference in the temperature 
before and after the tuberculin has been injet- 

I. It is generally agreed by those who are giving this 
ter much attention that a variation of a degree and a 
on the day after the injection higher than it was on 
day preceding will constitute a variation provided that 
elevation does not go quickly down. The elevation 
gradual rise to the highest point and a gradual descent 
i that point. Other fevered states that may come for 
ance like excitement from the presence of a strange 
on, the temperature taken then is not likely to be so 
lual in rise and fall. 

Q. Will it affect any offspring of this animal? 

A. Not at all. Cattle are being used for breeding purposes, 
cows which are tuberculous. If the calf be at once 
removed from the cow it is just as free from tubereult&gt;sis 
as any other calf. 

Q. If the calf lives on the milk will it affect the calf.' 

A. Yes it will, but will not manifest before it is nearly 
a year old. It is this long period which deceives many 
men. The great vitality of the calf to life holds the microbes 
in abeyance, and they don't show themselves until 
the calf is about a year old. 

Q. What is the remedy? 

E.. The only known remedy of today is the destruction 
he least valuable cow; the very valuable cow, the prot 
of which is worth considerable for stock or breeding

purposes, may l&gt;e kept and I believe should be kept and 
bred, but the calf should be immediately taken from the 
cow bo that it will not contract tuberculosis. A cow which 
is not worth keeping from year to year just for the calf 
better be destroyed. The government in its disposition of 
the cases which come to the slaughter houses where 
government inspection is carried on, are Bent to the rendering 
house.- and converted into fertilizers. 

Q. If the swine feed upon these carcases how would 
show itself in them, something like cholera? 

I\. They will become thin, emaciated, but will not have 
v vomiting spells, but nothing will appear on the body 
an eruption. 

Ij. Cattle that die with black leg, would it have any 
ect on hoj 

A. I believe not. Blackleg is not a disease that swine 
ubject to. However. I would advise that all cattle 
that die of blackleg be destroyed, to burn and destroy the 

fl (Mr. Haecker.) How about the practice of storing 
,' in a barn over animals, isn't that a rather dangerous 
ictice? I see there is quite an agitation now whether it 
lot a bad idea to store hay over animals. Can the germ 
carried up by the breath or air into the hay above? 

A. The germs are expectorated usually with the mucous 
out of the animal's mouth, but very little of it would 
go in a spray upward and get upon the hay, but the expectoration 
will fall around the stalls of the manger and 
become a dust, and if there be an upward draft, it will 
carry it into the hay. 

EilR. Stillson: I would like to ask how many, if any,

as any knowledge we have in reference to it. It is in answer 
to a letter that Dr. Thomas, our State Veterniarian 
wrote to the U. S. Department of Agricultural some time 
ago. It is as follows:

Dear Sir: 

Referring to your letter of the 30th Ultimo., 1 can give 
ethe following information: During the fiscal year 
ed June 30th, 1902, there were slaughtered at South 
aha, 528,429 cattle of which 836 were condemned for 
tuberculosis, and 2,364,897 hogs of which 1,846 were condemned 
for tuberculosis, and 2,567 for cholera or swine 
plague. The figures for the calender year, are not yet 
compiled and will not be available in time for your meeting 
January 22nd. 

Very respectfully. 

Acting Chief of Bureau."

of York. He was not to have this paper until tomorrow, 
but owing to the absence of several today, we will 
have it this afternoon: 

t IMPORTANCE OF THE ALFALFA PLANT TO 
THE CATTLE-FEEDING INDUSTRY OF

in view is the net returns that we may obtain from that 
work or business. It is in vain that the farmers organize 
clubs or institutes, it is in vain to expect to receive help 
from any legislature or corporation so long as he does not 
kimw that he must help himself through a sensible and 
practicable management of his own occupation. 
farmer in Nebraska my idea from the first has been to 
depend mainly on stock, and not upon the marketing of 
grain as a source of income, as we have worlds of summer 
feeds, and an abunuance of native as well as cultivated 
Mi for summer pasture of the most nutritious kinds. 
But we always lacked suitable forage during our long and 
cold winters. Our cattle as a whole always do very well 
through the summer season. But, oh, how pitiful do the 
most of our Nebraska cattle look in the spring! Many oi 
them lose about all of their summer gain during the winter 
season. 

In my opinion the general raising of alfalfa, on the 

uitable soils, will satisfactorily settle the question of how 

best to provide an abundance of the very best of nutri- 

tious winter food for our cattle, and keep them growing 

Eugh the winter as well as through the summer. I do 
intend to assert that alfalfa is adapted to. nor that it 
succeed in all sections of Nebraska. But certainly in 

each county there are localities of considerable extent 

where the soil conditions are such that the growth of it 

will be found to be a great success. The alfalfa root has 

been known to penetrate to the depth of more than thirty 

feet in search of moisture and plant food. It, therefore. 

may live and thrive where all other cultivated plants will 

wither and die. 

The yield of alfalfa on suitable soil and under proper 
conditions has been with me more than twice. as much dry 
forage per acre as I have been able to obtain from any 
other plant. On my farm in York county it is from sixt&gt;</seg>

le experiment of my own. on my farm in York County, 
st of ray experiments have been along the line ot 

II the various grasses and forage plants and their adaptlity 
to our locality and their feeding value for our 
ck. And I have found that alfalfa is the king of all 
&gt; forage plants. Last winter I fed a bunch of calves. 
e feeding period was two hundred days from Nov. 2. 
)1, to .May 2(). 1902. I fed them tenpoundsof cornmeal 
* head each day, feeding them twice a day. They had 
&gt;e access to alfalfa hay. I found at the end of the two 
ndred days, that they had consumed thirty-six bushels 
corn, and just about one ton of alfalfa hay per head, 
e average gain for the whole bunch was 450 lbs. per 
id. On May 20 I sold them at home for $5.50 per loo. 
len the-^e calves were nut into the feed lot on Nov. 2

and other grains conta

protein, all I need of it, on my farm, A ton of good alf- 

»i hay contains, according to Hoards Dairyman, 11 per 
t of protein, or about the an.e as a ton of bran, foi 

ivhich I have been paying as much as $20.00 per ton.

Eir average weight was 357 lbs. Figuring these 357 
at 4 cents per Ib., which was a fair price at that time, 
V paid me fifty cents for every bushel of corn they ate 

Ehat it was worth on the market, and $12.10 for every 
of alfalfa hay they ate. I was w well pleased with 
result of the experiment that I want to raise m ire 
lfa and more calves to be fed on my farm. 

Irhe present winter I am feeding my last year's calf 
p again, sixty head, and on account of our soft corn, 
ich could mt ba shelled or ground, I have been feeding 
s far the corn in the ear, cut in about one-inch pieces, 
pounds per head per day. I am feeding them twice a 
r, with free access to alfalfa. On December 11th, 1902, 
! whole bunch weighed 28,810 pounds. On January 
h 1903, the bunch weighed 32,7G0 lbs. There was a 
n in the 37 days of 3,950 lbs. Figuring their gain at 
ents per lb., it makes $197.50. They ate, in these 37 
m, 300 bushels of corn and about eleven tons of alfalfa 
, r . The corn at market price was worth $75.00 This 
ves $122.50 for the eleven tons of hay, or $11.13 per 

The yield of the alfalfa hay crop last year was at least 
six tons per acre, and six times $11.13 makes $66.78 the 
income per acre of alfalfa when fed to calves as I am 
doing it. Surely this ought to be a good enough profit for 
anybody. This income from the hay crop is more than the 
average acre of land sells for. 

{will close by saying again that alfalfa is the king of 
the forage crops' or any other crops. Blessed is he 
o owns land where alfalfa grows, for the homes surinded 
t by fields of alfalfa have transformed the soled 
"Nebraska desert" into a Garden of Eden. 

Ef one-fourth of the cultivated area of Nebraska was

ir lands for greater than that which could possibly be </seg>

Chairman: The hour of 4 o'clock having arrived, at

ADDRESS BY HON. WM. J. BRYAN 

Ladies and Gentlemen: I am not here so much to 
deliver an address as I am to hear what I can, in the short 
time I have to stay, and to introduce myself as it were 
into a new class. I have had plenty of opportunity to 
associate with democrats and populists and silver republicans, 
and I have learned something of republicanism in 
the last few years, (applause) but I thought that this possibly 
would give me a chance to get acquainted in a sort 
of non-partisan way with people who are engaged in 
something besides politics. I am living on a farm now. I 
don't insist that I am a farmer, in fact I cannot help 
believing I belong to a different class, if the distinguished 
utterance by Horace Greeley is correct. He said, that a 
farmer made his money on the farm and spent it in town, 
but that the agriculturist made his money in the town and 
spent it on the farm, and I am proud I am an agriculturist 
(applause.) I sometimes call my farm an experimental 
farm, to see if I can make enough on the outside to keep 
it up. I have been anxious not to arouse the old controversy 
that I have had to do with in politics, and so instead </seg>

            <seg id="p074">
74 


of devoting myself to one line of agriculture I have tried 
to take up several, and instead of taking up one breed of 
cattle I have taken up six different kinds, that I could 
have six different associations I could be with, and I felt I 
was almost at home when I heard them talk about alfalfa, 
for I have some. I remember when I first heard of it 
that I was amazed with the stories about the depth to 
which the roots would go, and when some men told me 
that they knew of some alfalfa that had gone 16 feet to 
water I could hardly believe it, although I saw the ratio 
was the correct one, 16 to 1 (laughter) but I found afterwards 
that it was not a fair sample of what it could do 
under favorable circumstances. I was down in Mexico. 
A man down there said he saw some roots hanging down 
from a tunnel and water dripping off the ends, and he 
investigated and found that 134 feet above was an alfalfa 
field, and they had gone down this distance. I think that 
this is the best story I ever heard of in regard to this 
plant. If you have any better one I would like to hear it 
after I am through. 

I am interested in the different kinds of cattle, because 
lought it was the best means of learning their merits, 
n satisfied from listening to the representatives of all 
eds you cannot learn anything because you have to 
ee with each man. I thought the best plan would be 
t to get one of each and so I have six different kinds, 
I I have tried to cover the field by getting both the 
ry blood and butcher's meat blood, and I have Jersey, 
Istein and Red Polled the latter I don't know whether 
•all a milk or beef cow, because I haven't had a chance 
test her yet, though I have with the others had the 
ince of testing them, and I am most ready to endorse a 
ry I heard in Missouri that came out in a controversy 
ween the representatives of those two breeds. The 
Istein cow was making fun of the small quantity of 
¦sey milk. He said if you will put the milk in a bucket </seg>


            <seg id="p075">
75 

Ii then put a silver dollar in the bottom of the bucket, 
you can see the silver dollar above the milk, it is Jer• 
milk. The Holstein man says if you will put the milk 
the bucket and put the dollar in the bucket, if you can 
1 the dollar through the milk, it is Holstein milk. 

I was down in Mexico the other day and I saw the best 
dairy I had ever seen, and I was a little ashamed when I 
found that the cows that had just been brought from Nebraska 
and Kansas were the poorest looking cows they 
had, not nearly so well fed and kept as the cows that he 
had for a year or so. He had Jersey, Holstein and Brown 
Swiss, and they all looked well and they were the best 
lot of milk cows I ever saw. Finally he says, here is one 
I am proud of. We have been guessing at the quantity 
of milk, so I measured it today, and she has given 30 
quarts and a little over today, and I went around and I 
looked at the cow and I could easily imagine 30 quarts or 
60 if necessary from the appearance of the udder. I was 
admiring it as the largest I had ever seen when a gentleman, 
who had probably never been fined for making a 
pun, said in an off-hand way, he says they are very good 
milk cows but there are udders (others); I don't know 
whether there was any law against it down there, but I 
thought it was a most vicious pun. But among the beef 
cattle I had felt an interest in the three kinds that I have. 
The short horn, the Hereford, and the Polled Angus I 
am not going to attempt to give any comparison of the 
merits between them, but I have felt interested in 
looking at them and watching their growth and 
advancement, because I believe every one of these breeds 
has its advantages, and I have been interested, and the 
interest has been a growing one, as I have come to understand 
how large a subject the subj"ect of cattle raising is, 
and I am interested in it because I believe the cattleman 
is producing something. I divide people into two classes </seg>


            <seg id="p076">
76 

when you measure them by their usefulness. One is a man 
who produces something, adds something to the world, 
and the other is a man who absorbs from the world. And 
I like the cattle raising industry because it is a producing 
industry. He makes it out of old mother earth by learning 
the best uses of the natural resources, by finding out 
what is the best food, by getting the most of food with the 
least of expense; every success he makes not only deserves 
success, and not only every dollar earned a dollar well 
earned, but he cannot do these things without being a 
public benefactor. I like these kind of industries, because 
the men engaged in them add something to the world, and 
are not seeking all the time to get something from the 
world. I believe, my friends, that there is a principle in 
life that we ought to learn and try to follow and teach, 
and that is that life is measured not by what we absorb 
from the world but by what we contribute to the world, 
that people must be measured by the additions they make 
to the sum of human wealth, energy and intelligence, not 
by the abstractions they are able to make, and the men 
engaged in the cattle industry are adding something, and 
when you meet in an association like this, and each man 
tells what he has learned, it is a pleasure to a man to tell 
what he has learned. It is a pleasure to feel that he is 
contributing something that is beneficial to others, and 
every association of this kind is a benefit to the people 
who gather, and through them a benefit to the entire community. 
So I feel an interest in this industry. 

If I could change the subject from that of cattle into 
something which bore on human happiness, I would feel 
really more at home in speaking. If I could just build an 
animal into politics some way I could feel that I had a 
larger fund to draw from when I talked. I am interested 
more in the hornless breed than I am m the breed with 
horns. In fact I feel no compunctions of conscience when 
I take the horns off a cow. I have argued this way: In a </seg>


            <seg id="p077">
77 

natural state a cow needed horns to protect herself, but 
when she came into civilized society and had a protector, 
that she could afford to trade her horns for her protector; 
that we had a right to take the horns off because they are 
a nuisance when you bring cattle together, because they 
will use the horns and interfere with the work and care 
that you are trying to take of them, and if I were going 
to choose of all the breeds, I would try to get the best 
breed with horns and then trade the horns off, for I believe 
the time will come when that breed will be the best which 
has all the qualities that the best breeds have and have no 
horns, and it is because I believe in that that I have 
watched with interest the effort to build up the Polled 
breed, and it is because I felt an interest that I secured a 
representative of the new breed, the Red Polled, because 
I am anxious to see a breed developed both for meat and 
milk, that will have all the qualities that will be found in 
the best breeds and yet have no horns. The animal that 
has all the good qualities and then diminish as fast and 
far as we can any of the characterestics that are hurtful 
at all, and when I see that we are doing this in cattle, I 
say that we are trying to do with cattle and among cattle 
what we are trying' to do among people, because we are 
trying to cultivate among people a civilization composed 
of people who will have all the best qualities of the human 
race and as few of the vices as possible. And I suppose 
we can measure the progress we make as cattle raisers 
just as we measure the progress that we make as human 
beings for the proportion which the fruits bear to the 
things that are hurtful. And I am interested in every 
step that is made in every department of government and 
of industry and of commerce, and therefore, I am not 
going to lose any opportunity to come into contact with 
people who, like you, represent a great branch of industry, 
who come here to get and to give light; who come to 
exchange opinions, who come to exemplify what I believe </seg>

            <seg id="p078">
78 


to be the fundamental rule in commerce, and that is a 
fair exchange of that which you have of value for that 
which other people have of value, and whenever I go 
away from Nebraska 1 am always glad to get back to it, 
because I don't know of any place in this Union where all 
of these great Associations can work to better advantage. 
I don't know of any state in this Union where people have 
more to inspire them than in the natural resources and 
society in which they move; no place where people have 
more to inspire them to great endeavor, and I am glad if 
by my having a very small herd of pure bred animals 
entitles me to come here and join in your deliberations. I 
only had one representative in my Shorthorn herd in June, 
but then my herd increased 100 per cent, and I hope the 
calf will be as good as the cow, and upon these two members 
of my Shorthorn herd I must rely for the pleasure of 
being here this afternoon, for as small as my herd is, they 
have been of sufficient worth to gain me admission into 
this meeting, and I think it is worth a great deal to come 
into contact with a people who know something and are 
willing to give it to the world. 

I am sure the result of your deliberations will be a benefit 
to you and to the industry, and through the benefit to 
the industry to this great country and to the nation, and 
as far as the good will go, a benefit to the entire world. 
(Applause.)

Dairymen's Convention continued.) 

DISCUSSION ON MR. BREEMER'S PAPER 

Q. (Member). You said that last year you fed your 
calves ground corn and alfalfa; and then you fed corn 
whole. Are you as well satisfied with the corn fed whole 
as ground? 

Mr. Breemer: No sir, I am not. I soon found out in 
writing this paper that if I should write all I could write. </seg>


            <seg id="p079">
79 

that I would have to write a bcok biggtr than the bible, 
consequently, I just touched the main points. On this 
point; last year I ground my corn, fed them cornmeal and 
on that feed the cattle gained 2, 3 and 4 pounds. 

Q. Is it not a fact that these were last spring's cah 

A. Yes sir. 

K, Don't calves of that age grind grain fed them much 
er than older cattle? 

A. Yes sir. 

Q. It is generally understood that an animal of that 
age will grind pretty well for himself. Your dairy cows 
eight or nine years old will not do this. Does it pay to 
grind this corn for animals of this age? 

A. Mr. Breemer: After I get through with this 
experiment which I have on hand myself then I can tell. 
I believe ground corn is better for them, and I believe 
ground corn and cobs for a cow is a great deal better than 
the shelled corn. I believe the ground corn is too rich to 
be healthy. 

E. Wasn't you troubled little more last year, when you 
feeding this ground corn, with scours? 

Mr. Breemer: They only got ten pounds a day. 

Q. You know they will eat it much faster if ground? 

Mr. Breemer: Yes, that might be true. 

Q. How do you prepare the ground to sod it for alfalfa 0 

Mr. Breemer: I have experimented a great deal with 
seeding alfalfa. In 1895 I sowed my first field and accidentally 
had a good stand. After a few years I thought I 
knew all about alfalfa. A couple of years afterwards I 
sowed 50 acres and I had to plow it all up again. I found 
I could sow alfalfa in the spring time of the year and 
have success provided we had a dry year, but if we have </seg>


            <seg id="p080">
80 

a wet season the weeds will grow over the alfalfa. 

In 1897 or 1898 I cut my 50 acres three times, and every 
e when I cut it I could plainly see that the weeds were 
reat deal more thicker than the alfalfa. The last time 
¦dly any alfalfa lived. Since that time I have been 
&gt;erimenting with fall sowing. As soon as the oats are 
¦vested I plow the ground up, and in August or Septemsow 
the seed and that fall it will grow to about in 
hes. and the next year the first time I cut it I made 
t as much hay off of that piece as any other I have on 

Q. You sow it in August, and the following summer 
you cut it? 

A. Yes sir. The first fall I don't do anything with it. 
Q. How much seed do you sow per acre? 

Mr.Breemer: I don't hardly like to advise anybody on 


Q. Give your own experience? 

I Mr. Breemer: It depends altogether on the condition 
the soil, etc. If the season is good and the land is in 
d condition, and the weather is favorable, 10 pounds is 
ugh.but by no means do I advise to sow 10 pounds, for I 
e sowed 35 pounds and didn't get much of a stand then. 

Q. Isn't it better to sow more seed rather than less.' 
Mr. Breemer: Yes sir. The thicker it is the better and 

I will produce better hay; if it is thin it grows large but 
a poorer quality. 

Q. Where do you get your seed? 

A. I raise it myself, but I will say for the benefit of all 
that I believe everybody ought to raise his own seed if he 

Q. Did you get any seed last year?

for seed but no seed formed. 

Q. Why couldn't you get seed last year? 

Mr. Bremen I believe because there was too much 
rain. I have been in the habit of using the second crop 
for seed. I suppose any crop would be good enough but 
I prefer the second crop for seed because the second crop 
is perfectly clean and free from weeds. I believe we cattle 
men never ought to undertake to raise any seed for the 
reason by the time the man finds out whether he will get 
theseed.or not, it is too late to make good hay out of it. 
Alfalfa is a new thing. Today I think I know but a very 
little about alfalfa. When I commenced to sow alfalfa 
the people laughed at me, and after I have raised it anybody 
is ready to give me advice and the advice was that 
we should cut it after it was in full bloom; but we found 
out that was too late entirely. Then the next person that 
came around said that we should cut it when it was in 
half bloom. At the present time I commence to cut as 
soon as I see the first bloom in the field, and as a rule 
before I get through cutting, the alfalfa is too ripe. 

Q. (Member) • If a man has only a small piece, say 
10 acres, how much bloom would you want on the plant 
before you commenced cutting, if you can cut it all in a 
day? 

Kir. Bremer: I "believe the best authority says that 
ilfa is at its best when one-tenth of it is in bloom; 
ould say one-twenty-fifth though. 

E. (Member) Do you feed less or more of alfalfa as 
do of corn, when you are feeding cattle; you feed 
r calves you said 10 pounds of corn? 

Mr. Bremer: Yes sir. 

Q. Any more alfalfa? 

I Mr. Bremer: They have free access to the alfalfa, 
t after they have been fed it a little while I find that </seg>

            <seg id="p082">
82 


they eat about 10 pounds of alfalfa hay. 

Q. After being on feed a little while they don't eat as 
much as they do at first? 

Kremer: No, that is natural; for the first two days 
r do eat a considerable more. 

Which cut of the alfalfa do you prefer for dairy 
, is there any difference? 

Mr. Bremer: I don't see any difference in it unless it is 
in the cutting. As a rule there is a great mistake made. 
The first cutting is of ten cut too young, and the first and 
second cutting might be cut too late which often happens, 
and it may be that the first cutting is the best cutting. 
Some claim that the fourth cutting is the best. I fully 
believe that no matter which cutting it is, if it is cut at 
the right time that one cutting is as good as another. 
How about this, Mr. Stillson, am I right? 

IHr. Stillson: No sir, I don't think so. I will say that 
&gt;ur experiments at home, which we have been working 
along this same line, of alfalfa, for a number of years, 
ind that the later in the season alfalfa is cut the better 
s for milk. 

Mr. Bremer: Why is it? 

Ilr. Stillson: In the first place it carries more leaves 
i it to the amount of stalk than later in the season 
if you cut too early it is in an unripe condition, and it 
ries a larger growth of stalk and less growth of leaves. 
it is my experience. Then in the latter part of the 
son it being shorter and still more leaf, there is a 
ater portion of the leaf to the stalk. So far as the 
ting is concerned we endeavor to cut each crop, and 
this year, as near as possible, each in the same conon 
when we commenced to cut, that is, when the bloom 
lmences to start, we begin to cut. 

Mr. Honeywell: Don't you think the first cutting of </seg>


            <seg id="p083">
83 

(alfalfa is going to be the most difficult to save on 
&gt;unt of the more weedy substances in it, and also comat 
the season of the year when we have more rain? 

Mr. Stillson: I don't know how to answer that. I don't 
know it at all yet. But we find this that in feeding we 
consider the first crop of alfalfa better for our horses for 
feed. We have been feeding our horses on alfalfa for five 
years, and we consider the best crop for horses the first 
crop; for milk cows we prefer the second, third and fourth 
crops. 

Er. Honeywell: How do you cure the first crop? 
r. Stillson: We sho^k it up the first clay, 
r. Bremer: Do you mean that you get your first 

Kin without being damaged? 
r. Stillson: Yes, part of it. 

Mr. Honeywell: Do you mean to say you cut it in the 
forenoon and rake it up and shock it that night? 

Mr. Stillson: We cut it after the dew is off 

tlr. Honeywell: Doesn't it bleach out even in that litshock? 


Rr. Stillson: No sir. Sometimes if you put it up wet 
ill then bleach. 

Mr. Bremer: I generally cut according to circumstances. 
Some times I run the mower all day long. I try to 
rake it up when it is fairly wilted, then I try to make one 
shock out of two swathes, which one man can almost 
handle in pitching it on the wagon. If the ground is in 
good condition, that is, the land dry, and I put up my 
shocks any where near noon, the next morning I am ready 
to haul it in after the dew is off. 

Q. (Member) Would not that depend on the weather, 
whether moist, damp, or otherwise? </seg>


            <seg id="p084">
84 

Mr. Bremen Yes, even damp weather will soften the 
dryer alfalfa. After I cut my hay I never spread it out 
again no matter what happens to it; no matter how wet it 
or hew long it stands wet, I never tpread it out again. 
If it only gets a little bit wet on the top I wait until it 
dries off, and if it wets clear through I wait until the top 
is dried off fairly, and then turn the shock over. 

Q. ( Member) That is spread it out? 

Mr. Bremer: No sir, I did it once and will never do it 
again because that loses all our leaves; I never spread it 
nut again. 

Q. (Member) How about alfalfa as feed for horses? 

Er. Bremer: I find that my own alfalfa hay is just as 
[ or better for my horses than anything else that I 
feed them. 

Q. (Member) If you have upland would you plow up 
your grass and sow it to alfalfa? 

I Mr. Bremer: By all means I would. As far as I 
ve experimented I find that, considering everything 
d against alfalfa for horses, I think it is in the man 
10 feeds it. If you first commence to feed alfalfa hay 
ur horses will eat alfalfa, all you give them, and leave 
2 oats and corn in the manger. If you poke the manger 
II it might kill your horses because they will over eat 
emselves, but after they are used to it, say for a day 
two you can feed your driving horses alfalfa just as 
ill as prairie hay.

Secretary Bassett: The following is the report of the 
Tommittee on Resolutions: 

Mr. President: Your Committee on Resolutions beg 
leave to submit the following report: 

That while we do not encourage, but most emphatically 
discourage, the making of undesirable grades of butter, 
either of creamery- or dairy, yet in the process known as 
"Renovated" or "Process" butter we recognize a method 
which adds materially to both the quality and value of 
these undesirable grades of butter and that "Renovated" 
butter, made in compliance with law is a legitimate product, 
clean and wholesome, but not of equal qualit 
value of the better grades of either creamery or dairy 
butter, and we most heartily commend the efforts of Secretary 
of Agriculture, Wilson, to have only desirable 
materials used in the manufacture of "Renovated" butter 
and that in compliance with law, the product be n 
branded that both retail dealers and ultimate consumers 
shall not be deceived as to the identity of the product. 

(hat we favor such amendment to the Food Comm itlaw 
of the state as will include all food products 
1 by man; that when placed upon the market they be 
led that both retail dealers and consumers may not be to 
&gt;ived as to their constituent parts and true value, and 
the provisions of the present law requiring the takout 
of permits and payments of fees be repealed and 
a direct appropriation for the support of the Comsion 
be made. 

IiVe also urge that the legislature pass the bill calling 
¦ funds to enable the state to make a creditable exhibit 
the Louisiana Exposition to be held at St Louis in 1904. 

Resolved, that the thanks of this Association are hereby 
tendered to the University authorities for the use of the </seg>

Hall and other courtesies extended to the State Dairymen's 
Association. 

Ehat we tender our most hearty thanks to our Senators 
Members of Congress for their support and favorable 
! in favor of the measure known as the "Grout Bill." 

that we will ever hold in kindly and grateful rememlce 
the heroic efforts of Ex-Governor W. D. Hoard, 
rles Y. Knight and other officers of the National 
ry Union in securing the passage of that just measure 
"Grout Bill" and especially do we recognize and comid 
the honest, persistent and loyal work of Mr. Knight 
his matter. 

E'hat the thanks of this association be extended to SeciVy 
of Agriculture Hon. James Wilson, for his kindness 
assigning Mr. W. D. Collyer, his Department to 
re the competitive butter exhibits. 

I hat H. R. No. 102, appropriating $100,000 for new 
dings, equipment, live-stock and other purposes for 
agricultural department of the State University, has 
unqualified and enthusiastic support ; in fact 
believe that in view of the rapid growth of 
iraska in wealth and population and considering the 
erative needs of the Agricultural department and the 
it work it is doing under sore difficulties true and 
damental economy would demand the appropriation of 
),000 instead of $100,000 for the purposes named. We 
&gt;t earnestly urge and demand that the Legislature 
ropriate at the very least the sum of $100,000 which 
Regents call for. 

Ejsolved, That we endorse Mr. E. Sudendorf, Secretary

I Kiel's know any thing of, when the milk, cream, or but(as 
the case may be) will not meet the demands and 
must have something else to turn to. We can't afford 
[ill our little calves and feed to the hogs because there 
o sale for them and neither can we afford to kill the 
' and give her a decent burial when she is past her 
fullnass as a dairy coa t (as I heard one say) but we 
st have the dual purpose cow that when she has p 
day as a milker we can either sell her to feeders or 
and sell her ourselves and you are ready to start. 

We find too there is money in the little calves, either as 
veal or as a steer, so let us start with the dairy cow, get 
a good hand separator, build an ice house (they don't cost 
much) and put up your own ice. Have a refrigerator, 
some good salt, and a bottle of butter color. 

I But listen; I think I hear some farmer say, "but I won't 
or my butter; never did, nor never will and we make 
&gt;t as good butter as any one, too." Yes, but right here 
where so many farmers fail in not finding what the 
ide demands and then work for it. Of course, if you 
e met, dean, white butter, why use it, but if you are 
iking butter for the market, color it. You don't need 
tell every one you chance to talk with that you color 
ar butter, for if you do you will surely find some, like 
urself, that would not eat colored butter. "No not I; 
ly I can taste it, and it won't keep," and all such trash; 
t go right on coloring and working for the trade. 

Right here it reminds me of an incident in my own life. 
There came one of those dry years when every thing 
burned up, and we had several notes coming due and no 
way of meeting them. So I told husband I would get 
something the people wanted and play agent awhile. One 
day where 1 stopped for dinner, the conversation turned 
to gardening, and my hostess said, if we could only raise 
</seg>
            <seg id="p090">

{I said why don't you use paris green or london purand 
oh, my! You should have seen them look, (just 
some folks look when you say butter color:) why I 
Id not eat them, it would kill us sure; but I assured 
that we had used it for years and were not dead yet; 
they would not, no never; they always bought of Mr. 
nd-So; he raised thousands of head each year. I 
t know how he does it, but he does and we buy of him. 

Efore I was through canvasing I chanced to run on to 
cabbage man and I asked him how he managed to 
so many cabbage when every one else failed. O f 
he, I just give them a dose or two of paris green and 
ends my trouble. And so if will be with the butter. 

I hose nice folks will find out after a while that yellow 
:er in the winter is all right after all. Then there is 
salt; so many think that any salt will do, just so it is 
n and fine, some will use barrel salt because it is 
dy and the men folks always have lots of it on hand, 
ut to the barn or granary (as the case may be) they go 
ipe the straw and dirt off of it, dig up a nice chunk, 
i it to the house mash it up and it is ready for the butand 
as nice butter as anyone makes too. I tell 
can't do it. You must have good dairy salt. I bee 
the farmers can make as good butter and demand as 
d price for it as the creameries if they work for it. 

I hen there is the strainer; never use the old-fashioned 
i screen, but use a cloth, and then never use it more 
i twice before putting through the wash. I have 
wn some house-wives to use one strainer a whole week, 
ing it out each time of course, but that will not do; 
can't keep it sweet that way. Have a brick print 
not the old style round ones; get parchment paper and 
p your butter nicely by dipping each piece of paper in 
er so as to fold and it will show your butter off better 
n dry paper. If you do this I will assure you you will

Irer see your butter thrown in a heap with other greasi, 
I have heard so many farmers complain of, and neither 
1 you have to take trade for pay very long. 

I But we will suppose right here that you don't want to 
ike butter, you would rather let the creameries do tho 
rd work; all right if you wish to give them the profit: 
t even then you must have a hand separator. Now I am 
: payed for saying this, and neither am I asked to say 
but you can't aford to haul your milk and run the n&gt;k 
its souring on the way, or having it dumped in with 
ir milk, and by the time you get home it will not be fit 
¦ the hogs, much less for little calves and pigs. When, 
having the separator, you will have the milk warm and 
eet, and by using a little oil cake to supply the butter 
, your calves and pigs will thriye just as well as if they 
i the whole milk. 

"THE HAND SEPARATOR FROM A PATRONS 
STANDPOINT" 

By Wm. Ulrich. Princeton. 

Ihe hand separator is a great improvement to the 
ner over the skimming station. Why? Because in 
ling the whole milk to the skimming station, there 
ting to get it separated and then hauling the skim 
k back again, there is a good deal of valuable time 
, when the farmer should be attending to his crops or 
er work. At the skimming station the milk is all run 
) one tank Most patrons take good care of their milk 
deliver it in good, sweet and clean condition; then 
re comes some who are careless and deliver their milk 
i filthy, tainted and sour condition, this milk is run 
ht in with the sweet milk spoiling all of it when the 
k is separated. The patrons who have delivered their 
k in good sweet condition receive skim milk which is 
ited or even a little sour, then by the time they get </seg>

            <seg id="p092">
92 


home, especially in the summer, they have skim milk 
which is sour an 1 which is very poor feed for calves and 
;ind if they are not careful in feeding it they will 
have some dead calves and pigs; another objection is that 
some patrons take more skim milk than belongs to them 
leaving the last customer with very little or no skim milk 
to take back home with him. Then his calves will have 
to drink water or starve till the next day. Now with the 
hand separator the farmer has skim milk to feed to his 
young stock which is warm and sweet and with a little 
ground feed added, making it just about as good as the 
fresh milk from the cow. Some farmer's objections to 
the hand separator are that it is too hard work to turn 
the machine; takes to &gt; long to wash and keep it clean: 
now if those farmers would stop and figure the time it 
takes to deliver the whole milk to the skimming station 
and haul the skim milk back again they would find that 
they save from ten to sixteen hours time every week by 
vising the hand separator. 

It does not take any longer to wash and thoroughly 
in the separator than it does to wash and keep clean 
m four to eight milk cans, and it is not one-fourth the 
rk to take care of the cream that it is to take care of 
whole milk. Another objection some farmers have to 
1 hand separator is that it costs too much; the price 
¦s seem high, but if they will take the difference in 
L»e of hand separated cream and the price paid for butfat 
at the skimming station, they will find that the 
arator will pay for itself in about seven or eight 
nths; also that the farmer has his sweet skim milk from 
hand separator which is worth at least three or four 
much as skim milk from the skimming station, 
experience is that the same number of cows with the 
ie feed and the same care have made a net profit of 
m twenty-five dollars to thirty-seven dollars more per 
nth, or from ninetv cents to one dollar and twenty </seg>


            <seg id="p093">
93 

Eper cow per month, more with the hand separator 
by hauling the whole milk to the skimming: station. 
es the ten to sixteen hours' time saved every week. 

Iie statement is made by creamery men that as good a 
ity of butter cannot be maintained from hand t 
r cream as from skimming station cream; now I d&lt;&gt; 
see why this cannot be done; if the hand separations 
are careful and take good care of their cream and 
/er it in good, sweet condition, the butter maker can 
ly mike a first class article of butter, and if some 
ons are careless and deliver cream of poor quality 
butter maker can surely find out where such cream 
es from; he can either compel those patrons to be 
e careful and deliver a better product or pay them less 

The creamery men can arrange some plan to pay for 
butter fat according to the quality that would either make 
the patron who is careless, deliver a better quality of 
cream or he would get disgusted and quit the business. 
The sooner such patrons stop, the tetter for all concerned. 
Creamery men or butter makers should some 
times take a little of the blame themselves for some of 
the inferior quality of the cream delivered to them, owing 
to the manner in which their cream cans are cared for. I 
have seen cream cans stand on the depot platform for 
about a week, with from one half inch to an inch and a 
half of water in them. Now the odor and rust in these 
cans was not very pleasant, so if a farmer gets one of 
these cans and is not careful in thoroughly cleaning and 
airing it before using, but simply rinses it out with cold 
water and then puts his cream into it and the cover tight 
on the can, it does not take very long till you have cream 
from which first class butter cannot be made, therefore 
the creamery men or butter makers should not preach 
cleanliness unless they practice the same at home. A </seg>

            <seg id="p094">
94 



good many farmers think that if creamery men do not 
keep their cans nice and clean, they are not going to do it 
for them, but will put the cream in the cans as they are. 
therefore if the creamery men would provide a system 
by which they would pay for cream according to quality. 
I think that they would have a better product delivered to 
them from the hand separator patrons.

IhX-RKTAfn BAS8ETT: I am sorry there are not more 
3 to discuss this matter. It is very important for the 
e, when a separator man tells you that his company 
shipped into the state and sold the last year so many 
oads of hand separators I would not begin to say 
¦ many because it seems as though it could hardly be 
? and that thousands more are coming into the state 
year, and the revolution that it is making and the inise 
in the dairy business, and there are so many points 
; the users of hand separat ors should understand in 
BT to get the best result and make it the most profit:. 
His jwint in regard to the care of the cream and 
very of it, and that you should be paid for a better 
lity of cream is very important indeed. Today the

The people of the state do not realize the wonderful 
advancement that has been made in the dairy industry

three years ago there was no dairying other than 
farm dairying. Yet from one town in thai ln.-:ilitv th».r..

was shipp (1, this last season during the summer months, 
from 16, 000 to 26,000 pounds of cream daily, and there 
was paid out $22,000 in 20 days, in that locality, for cream 
being more than a thousand dollars a day. That is only 
one of the many localities in the state where there has 
been such a marked increase and I might add that every 
pound of this cream was from hand separators. 

Prof. Glover: How much doss it cost to transp )rr a 
hundred pounds of cream for say a distance of fifty miles'.' 

(Voice from audience) You can figure on about a cent 
per pound of butter fat. 

Mr. Bassett: The railroads have made a very low rate 
in handling separator cream in order to encourage the 
business. Cream is brought into this city, (Lincoln) a distance 
of 400 miles, from the extreme western portion of 
the state, often from eastern Colorado. Nothing in the 
i'\ has ever helped to develope the dairy industn 
the hand separator and I might include alfalfa. You 
ce that where the largest amount of cream comes 
n, and continuous during the year, that it is in those 
ions where they raise alfalfa. In a good many localities 
lis state the farmers have only a small pasture lot and 
cows are brought into the barn and fed alfalfa, the

The cows get only a small amount of pasture direct 
from the field. Their feed for the year round is largely 
alfalfa hay. 

Knof. Glover: I was told by a man on tbe train, while 
ing from Omaha today, that you could not raise alfalfa 
lebraska. 

Mr. Bassett: I will give you my experience. On my 
farm the first cutting of alfalfa this year there was an 
iual crop - was 36 inches high on the 5th day of June, 
and on the 5th day of July the second cutting wi 
inches high; that was the second cutting. The third cutting 
ranged some where about IS to 20 inches high. We 
did not cut the fourth time because we had all the fodder 
we could take care of. We could not get the help. This 
is the third year since seeding. Alfalfa is not at it:-until 
it has been established 3, 4 or 5 years. Our soil is 
]K»culiarly adapted to the alfalfa. It is of great depth. 
Where I live it is l(i feet to tirst water, and there is fertility 
in this soil to that depth. This is true of the greater 
of this state. The roots of the alfalfa plant will go 

down into the soil to a great depth and you see it has an 
almost inexhaustable source of fertility to draw from. 

There has been a good deal of loss the past season from 
tacks wetting down from heavy rains. Water will run 

through alfalfa when first stacked just like through 

clover. While stacking we use a stack cover, which will 

tor several years get the best 18 or 20 ounce duck- 

ing. In regard to topping out a stack I have a letter in 

which the party says that when he has finished his stack.

putson top of it about 18 inchesof green alfalfa, fresh cut. 

that settles down firmly and moulds somewhat, but the 

wind will not blow it off and it makes a perfect cover. 

This fact is worth knowing. We have not got barn room

Ladies and Gentlemen: I come before you, a com 
tive stranger, from a part of the state that has not been 
well represented at these meetings, it u what we term 
the Alfalfa Region of southwestern Nebraska. We have 
found the valleys of the Republican and the Platte rh 
and their tributaries in western Nebraska and Kansas, to 
lie especially well adapted to the growth of this plant. 
Farmers are just beginning to realize this and the acreage 
into alfalfa is being rapidly increased. In years past, 
the people of this region were very loathe to increase the 
acreage, le«t the amount of hay raised exceed the demand. 
A few dry years and light crops left us with nothing 
but the product of the alfalfa fields for feed and it was 
only then that we began to fully realize the value of the 
hay. The returns of this feeding were first noticed in the 
milk pail. The cow, the old stand-by, had come to the 
rescue of the farmer. In a year of drouth, she gave milk 
on alfalfa hay as she never had before on corn with straw 
and prairie hay for roughness, in times of plenty. 

The skimming stations appeared about t\ 


Ive an out-let for the product. This was better than 
iking the butter and selling to the country store, but 
.s not entirely satisfactory. The calf would not do well 
skimmed milk that was sweet one day and sour the 
xt. The next step was the hand separator and to-day, 
the territory around Oxford, nearly every man with 
If a dozen cows, owns his own separator. I find this 
te of a good many other places in the alfalfa country, 
e farmer has learned that land, once in a good stand of 
alfa, gives a sure return every year and that the great: 
return comes from feeding it on the farm. 

Ei the past, the cattle were raised with the baof idea in 
d and that idea still exists in the selection of the

Report, Vol. XVIII) is authority for the statement, that 
with scrub cows fed alfalfa and Kaffir corn grain, at ordinary 
prices for feed, butter fat was produced at a cost for 
feed of. seven cents a pound. Where can you find a 
stronger testimonial for alfalfa? Ordinary cows with 
alfalfa, returns equal to the best of dairy breeds 
without it. 

Having a glimpse, as it were, at the results of feedir 

this wonderful hay, let us go a little more into detail and 

b-ing out the cause of these wonderful results. Our 

experiment stations have found that three groups of sabstances 
are to be considered in making combinations &lt;&gt;f 

feed. These are protein, carbohydrates and fat. Protein 

includes materials containing nitrogen and enters into 

c mipositi 

milk and animal tissue. Carbohydrates 

includes sugar, starches and vegetable fibre, while the fat 

includes all fatty substance found in the food. These two 

supply heat, energy and go to build up the fatty tissues. 

Protein may be broken down in such a way by digestion 

that it will liberate heat and go to help build up the fat, 

but the carbohydrates and fats cannot build up muscle or 

nerve tissue. From the foregoing facts, it is evident that 

protein is the most important substance in feed stuff. 
To balance a ration for domestic animals is to so adjust 

the quantity of digestible protein, fat and carbohydrates 

therein contained, that the animal economy may use all of 

these substances without anv waste

The weakest point in Nebraska dairying is in the c 
ion of rations given. The average ration is greatly 
•leficient in protein and having too much carbohydrates 
and fat. As no other substance can take the place of 
protein, the insufficient quantity given in feed, limits the 
milk yield and reduces it to that which the protien can 
form. 

Investigation has shown that the average cow weighing 
one thousand jxiunds. needs a ration containing 2.5 pounds 
digestible protein, 12.5 pounds carbohydrates and .4 
l*&gt;unds fats. A ration of 19 pounds of alfalfa and 71 
pounds corn will produce this. Alfalfa is the only sing'e 
feed that will make a balanced ration with corn. The only 
objection to this ration, from a scientific dairyman's standpoint 
is that it lacks variety. 

Variety stimulates a cow to give a larger yield of milk 
than she would with the same amount of feed given alone. 
It is well to give a variety of roughage as well as of grain. 
The change should be very gradual and by a mixture of 
s, not by receiving one kind of feed at one meal and 
another at the next. This would be apt to reduce the 

I*Ve know that June pasture, which forces a cow to her 
;t yield, furnishes a succulent ration and for the best 
ults from the cows through the winter succulent feed 
ist be given. On June pasture alone a cow will give a 
ivy yield of milk. Cut the grass, dry it carefully, so 
it only the water is lost, give this dried grass to the cow 
her only feed and she will soon go dry. The grass has 
t its succulence. Succulent feeds in winter are appetiz; 
and keep the animal's system in a healthy condition 
j the bowels loose. This enables the cow to eat more 
i to digest a greater portion of what she does eat. &lt; H 
hays, alfalfa heads the list for succulence and comes 
irest giving us the desired conditions. </seg>


            <seg id="p101">

The digestibility of alfalfa hay is changed less by process 
of curing than that of any other forage plant. Dry 
alfalfa hay is, in the midst of summer, about as palatable 
to the dairy cow as the finest Kentucky blue grass. Mr 
Coburn of Kansas is authority for this statement. Sorghum 
hay is probably the next best from the stand point 
of succulence. On the other hand, we find timothy hay, 
prairie hay, corn fodder, corn stalks and kaffir corn fodder 
are constipating feeds. 

The dairyman is constantly learning to use more judgment 
in his selection of feeds. He is finding it easier to 
make the butter than it is to feed the cow in a manner to 
give the best results. The feeding governs the quantity 
of the milk and it is the quantity which make the profits. 
It is easier to get educated butter makers than it is to get 
educated feeders. 

I Nebraska had become most too much of a beef-growing 
ite to quickly develop into a dairy state. The stockman 
s been too long accustomed to using cheap roughage for 
s stock cattle. It is hard to make him see that continus 
good feeding of the dairy cow is the most profitable. 

After having the above facts brought out, I think it 
well to turn our attention more directly to the alfalfa, 
which is essential with dairymen in Nebraska to the 
cheapest production of milk and butter fat. We hear of 
its producing qualities as something phenomenal. Many 
prominent dairymen of the east, after traveling all over 
the United States, have made the statement that sooner or 
later, when competition becomes keen and a greater need 
is realized for lowering cost of production, the dairy center 
of the United States is bound to shift to the alfalfa 
fields of the west. This statement is substantiated by the 
experience of the Kansas Agricultural College where 
alfalfa was found to be the cheapest producer of butter 
fat. The more there is learned about alfalfa and the </seg>

            <seg id="p102">

Ire it is used, the stronger is the conviction that how?r 
much has been said, its praises have not been adeitely 
sung. When fed in considerable quantities, it can 
combined with other feeds usually grown on the farm 
Ilions of pounds of butter made on the farm. 

Here now comes the suggestion, if the dairymen of the 
state are doing all of this with what we might call the 
"No Purpose Cow", how much better woiid the results be 
if the "Special Purpose Cow" took their place. 

We have the proof from many sides, where men and 
women too, have brought up the average of their herds 
to 300 350 lbs. of butter fat, per year, and more, and in 
this case a woman made the mark 400 poun Is for the year. 
What som? do others can equal, and I expect to see the 
day when even- dairy cow in Nebraska will average 
pounds of butter fat, even,- twelve months. 

Phis may seem optimistic to you, but remember the world 
ea; only a short while ago the man who milked a cow 
sneered at, by the fellow, that he (the other fellow)

ame individual has traded his broncho for a milk-stool

relccted cow. In an investigation among creamery and 
cheese factory patn ns which Ex. Gov. H(aid ofW)&amp; il 
now and has been carrying on for several years at his own 
expense of thousands of dollars not in the Eastern State.-only 
but in Iowa as well, the invariable conclusions are in 
favor of the selected cow and fairly balanced ration to 
sjch an extent that in the creamery at Montrose, Pa. out 
of fifty patrons, twenty-five read dairy papers and twentyfive 
did not read and get in touch with modern ideas and 
methods, but noi:e the sensitive part. The twenty-five 
who read dairy papers averaged $50.23 per cow, per year: 
the others who knew it all, of course, averaged $32.95. 

Of course, there may be a "penny wise and pound 
foolish" excuse for the eastern dairyman in not feeding a 
balanced ration to his cattle, but here in Nebraska no 
excuse can be given for not attaining highest results, 
where the greatest forage plant in existence can be 
grown so cheaply, and now gentlemen, I want to ask you. 
why shouldn't the dairy business be carried on on the 
same principle as any other business in the land? 

In all business carried on today the specialist is called 
, and why, is very apparent. A person no matter what 
position or occupation may be, can and will be more 
ificient if ono single purpose or one line of thought or 
rk is followed. In other words he becomes an expert 
in his calling. 

Let two men with two ideas, or two different occupations, 
start out with two other men, each one of the latter 
taking one of the ideas or occupations of the former, anil 
the former will ba so far behind that sight will be lost to 
them before sun down, so to speak. 

This holds true in every phase of life. The more we 
specialize and singleize, the more proficient will we 
become. Just so with the dairy cow. When you look for 

cow that will be equally as profitable for beef as a milk </seg>

producer, I can assure you that cow, or breed, docs not 
exist; and as far as I can see it will be a very long time 
before that vacancy is filled. While we all have different 
likes, as well as dislikes, yet the one thing we are all looking 
for without exception, is what can be expressed in dollars 
and cents. So, let us see what advantages are 
afforded in that direction by the Special Dairy Cow. In 
the first place all will admit that the dairy interests are 
increasing in Nebraska more rapidly, perhaps, than any 
other state in the union, and right it should, for there is 
no place on earth where feed and that of the most valuable 
kind for feeding the dairy cow, can be produced as 
cheap as here. Why are the dairy interests increasing in 
Nebraska? Because farmers have learned the certainty 
of its income. In a year of excessive moisture, as the 
past season has been the uncertainty of crops is lost 
sight of for the time being; nevertheless, very many know 
with only two vivid recollections the hardships during 
uncertain seasons. But how was it with the man who 
milked a few cows? He had not much difficulty in meeting 
obligations, and at the same time had plenty for his 
family to eat and wear. 

While in Iowa last summer I became acquainted with a 
gentleman who gave me his history substantially, as follows: 
I was raised in eastern Iowa. Father always milked 
a considerable number of cows. Whenever us boys asked 
for money we always got it. When I became of age I 
married and went west to Cherokee county, la., bought a 
farm there and raised grain. For five years I raised each 
year a big crop of corn. When it was marketed there 
were always notes at the bank to be paid as well as store 
accounts to be settled; and when all was squared up, the 
corn crop was used and winter before me with no money. 
I told my wife that this would never do, and that I 
intended doing as father did, to try dairying. I did bo, 
and now shiD cream to Sioux Citv and receive mv money </seg>

            <seg id="p105">

try month in the year, debts are now unknown, and we 
e a nest egg in the bank. 

It is needless for me to enumerate the advantages 
•ived from dairying. Everybody admits that, but the 
le has come when we should pay more special attention 
the business and derive more profit than heretofore, 
other words, SPECIALIZE. 

1^ good dairy cow will produce each year from the time 
is two years old (it is a good plan to have them become 
ducers at that age, if possible) until the end of her useness, 
as much as she would sell for at any time during 
! year. But here is where the trouble comes in, to get 
i majority of farmers to realize (knowing that a dairy 
v is of not much value for beef), that she has made 
n more profit than any other cattle could have done in 
I same time. I have sometimes said, and am still of 
! opinion, we can afford to give her a decent burial at 
! end of her career. 

Milk and butter values are high and are going to be 

&gt; till higher. I base my opinion on the rapid growth of 
the city or consumer population, and the almost standstill 
(if not retrogression) of the producer in proportion to 
the consumer. 

to make a good dairy ration without any purchased feeds. 
Its large amount of protein makes it possible to make 
a balanced ration with other cheap feeds at hand. We 
know feeds rich in protein are expensive, while the carbohydrate 
and fat are the cheaper part of the ration. 
Good alfalfa hay contains 86 per cent as much protein as 
bran. The per cent protein varies greatly with the manner 
of handling. At the Colorado Experiment Station, 
tests showed the leaves of alfalfa to contain 142 per cent 
digestible protein, making a ton of them worth 2,400 
pounds of bran. 

"Hoard's Dairyman" tells of a Texas dairyman who </seg>

            <seg id="p106">

found that he could U;-c&gt; alfalfa as a substitute for Iran 

with good results in feeding milch cows. As a test, he 

substituted, for three weeks, an equal quantity by weight 

of cut alfalfa hay for the bran he had been feeding. The 

gave an increased yield of both milk and butter as a 

result. Analysis of bran and alfalfa hay show a composi- 

tion almost identical and it is gratifying to know that 

feeding trials show the same results. 

Alfalfa hay is frequently found consisting of stems 

only. If the dairymen knew, in harvesting his crop of 

hay, that in wasting the leaves he was wasting a product 

worth more to them than an equal weight of bran. 

greater care would be taken to avoid the loss. 

According to the Kansas Station, in alfalfa with a good 

stand, the leaves are more than half the weight of the 

cured crop and contain 85 per cent of the total yield of 

the digestible protein. The same authority makes the fol

Silfalfa is our most palatable rough feed and when cut 
ly and well cured is eaten without waste. Under 
orable conditions, three or more crops are harvested in 
ear, and, so far as I have been able to learn, at least one 
d crop in the dryest year in any part of the state. 

Eis hard to get alfalfa started, and with unfavorable 
litions reseeding is often necessary to obtain a good 
d. However the crop is well worth the e 

Pasturing alfalfa by the cows has been accompanied 
by considerable loss from bleat. Various methods have 
l&gt;een tried to avoid this but with varying success. Exjkrience 
seems to vary bo much that it is impossible to give 
any rule universally applicable, except that an occasi 
loss may be expected. The best success seems to be in 
pasturing alfalfa containing other grass, and a stack of 
old prairie hay where the cattle can go to it at will seems 
to be good. It is excellent feed to hold cows to their 
usual flow of milk when pasture becomes short and flies 
had. It is generally cut when used for this purpose. 
There is little danger in pasturing calves on alfalfa while 
they are still receiving milk and even after they are 
weaned if they can find other grass to eat. After once 
being removed from the pasture for -a while and then 
turned on again, there seems to be greater danger of loss. 
Bloating is likely to occur any time until the alfalfa is 
entirely frozen, then it makes fine winter pasture. 

The last cutting in alfalfa often causes bloating in o 
This seems to be mostly when it is wet. Care should l&gt;e 
used in feeding it if loss is to be avoided. This is the 
cutting that is the best for making a big flow of milk. 
The finer the hay and the larger the per cent of the leaves 
present, the more it is relished. Alfalfa unquestionably 
holds first place among the feeds for the dairy cows. Its

iis combined with succulence. It has been preed 
that the cow fed on alfalfa will, in the near future, 
the price of butter for the world. Two strong points 
ts favor are the low cost of production and the superior 
lity of butter produced while feeding it. 

(^ith its use, the problem of the balanced ration, which 
uch a mystery to many dairymen, is solved. Alfalfa 
corn, the two cheapest products on the farm, go 
urally together. Alfalfa will cheapen the cost of 
ter fat from two to five cents a pound. 

THE SPECIAL DAIRY COW IN NEBRASKA 

J. F. SCHLAPPI, LINCOLN. XLBR. 

Mr. President: One would almost feel out of place to 
talk on the Special Dairy Cow here, since that pha 
the cow question has not been agitated to any great 
extent. The idea has always been, and it does yet exist. 
to a large extent, that she must be "beef", or at the very 
outside, "Dual purpose capacity." 

I In my talk before this meeting last year, I touched on 
e Special Dairy Cow. 

Et must have been owing to the "Beef Breeders" meetwhich 
was in session here about the same time thi.t 
re were several "Beef" men present at the Dairymen's 
jting, at least one of whom had considerable to say 
t Nebraska was not adapted to the "Special Dairy 
v", and went on to explain at considerable length. 

Now say, Brother Beef Breeder, we greatly prefer to 
have those fences of the proverbial kind, "Hog tight and 
Bull strong", for we would suffer infinitely more from the 
results, but at the same time you might be convinced that 
a good milker pays best. 

raving now resided in the state over a year and more

iiing in contact with dairymen in nearly every part of 
state I am more than ever convinced that the Special 
ry Cow is as well, if not better, adapted to Nebraska as 
other state, not only am I certain of that but the 
t evidence we have, though the dairy interests are in 
very infancy, are the enormous sums of money paid by 
Creamery Cos. of the state, not to say anything of the 

i anticipate you wish to ask, what breed shall we tie to, 
special dairy purpose? I will answer, any breed. 
?re is no breed but what you will find some first class 
ividuals among them. Of course, you will find a larger 
cent of good ones among the special dairy breeds and. 
refore, I would say, choose the breed that you have a 
ural liking for, but above all you must select the indiual 
to secure the best results. 

In traveling over the state I see in almost every bunch 
of cattle some one cow or maybe more with best of indications 
of a first class dairy cow, and yet, the owner, in 
many cases, does not seem to think very much of her. 
The fact is, the animal has not had an opportunity to 
develop her best qualities. Feed and care are great factors 
in developing the dairy cow. 

In breeding for the special dairy you will always have a 
considerable per cent of them prove unsatisfactory; in 
other words, they have inherited the beefy tendency of 
some ancestor, and no amount of coaxing will convert 
them into anything different. But if you keep right on, 
raising the best from the best, you will be rewarded in a 
comparatively short time, to possess a first class dairy. 

There is just one thing more along this line and that is, 
you may not be very enthusiastic at first, but as you progress 
you will find special dairying very fascinating, as 
well as profitable. Just a word in closing, that will mean 
unquestioned success in the dairy business,— if any question 
or uncertainty arises, ask and follow the advice of </seg>

THE FARMERS DAIRY COW." 

BY PROF. A.. J. GLOVER, AGRICULTURAL COLLEGE, UNI- 

VERSITY OF ILLINOIS. 

The Department of Dairy Husbandry of the University 
of Illinois has for over a year, been conducting field work 
among her dairymen. A number of them were persuaded 
to weigh and sample each mess of milk a sufficient number 
of times during the year so that we could estimate 
the performance of every cow they owned. Some of them 
kept a record of the kinds and amounts of feed that each 
tow consumed. The farmers who took up this work were 
required to weigh and sample the milk from each cow in 
the herd every 7th week for 14 consecutive milkings 
After each cow was milked the milk was poured into a 
weighing pail, weighed and the weight recorded on a 
milk sheet directly under the cow's name. A small 
sample of milk was then taken with a sample dipper or a 
milk theif and put into the same bottles. A corrosive sublimate 
tablet was used to preserve the different samples 
of milk. Instructions were given to each man to shake 
the compositive samples each day so as to mix the fresh 
samples with the rest of the milk and keep the cream 
from becoming hard or drying on the sides of the bottles. 
When the period of weighing and sampling was completed 
I went to the farm to test the samples or had them 
brought to the Creamery and did the testing there. 

APPARATUS 

Ehe things which were necessary for carrying on the 
k were: A pair of spring balance scales for weighing 
milk; a small dipper or milk theif for taking the sam; 
bottles for holding the compositive samples; corn &gt;s- </seg>


            <seg id="p111">
111 

E sublimate for preserving them and milk sheets. 
I were furnished by the experiment station. Each 
was given a name or numbsr which was placed at the 
if the milk sheet so that the weights of the milk 
I be put directly under her name or number. 

ARRANGING APPARATUS 

1^ considerable amount of time can be "saved by arrang; 
scales, sample bottles, and milk sheet in such a way 
it the weighing, recording the weight of the milk, and 
npling of the milk will be done with as few steps and 
tions as possible. After the most desirable place in the 
•n has been chosen for weighing and sampling, the 
les can be suspended from the ceiling so as to hang 
¦y near to the milk sheet which can be tacked to a board 
1 hung on the wall or fixed on an inclined shelf proting 
from the wall. The sample bottles can be arrangon 
either side of the milk sheat, or, if convenient, 
&gt;ve it. If there are two or more milkers, the sample 
ties can be arranged so that each milker will have his 
ties together and arranged in the same order that 
! cows are milked. This method saves time in finding 
&gt; right sample bottle. 

TIME CONSUMED IN WEIGHING AND SAMPLING 

I he length of time required to weigh and sample the 
i depends entirely upon the quickness of the man who 
oing it. Some men will tell you that it takes but little 
e to weigh and sample each cow's milk while others

I ether she has been a profit or a loss to him and, furrmore, 
he will know what cows to select his heifers 
m for his dairy. Considering the time that is coined 
to do this work, it seems strange that more dairy - 
n do not have their herds tested in some way. Many 
them can weigh and sample each cow's milk every 
enth week and then have the butterm.aker test the 
nples for them at the creamery. Together with the 
1 cent fat and the weights of milk, they can estimate 
themselves the performance of every cow in their 
¦ds. The importance of doing this work will be shown 
ttle further on in this paper. 

CALCULATING THE AMOUNT OF MILK AND BUTTER FAT 

The milk was weighed and sampled during the 4th 
week of the 7 week period. With the total amount of 
milk that each cow gave during this time, and the per 
cent of fat, was calculated the amount of butter fat produced 
in the week. From these results were estimated 
the amounts of milk and butter fat each cow produced 
three weeks before and would produce three weeks following 
the test? The cow's yearly record was made up from 
these tests and in this way the total amounts of milk and 
butter that she produced during the entire year were determined. 
In many cases the dairymen kept an approximate 
account of all the grain and roughage that each cow 
consumed during the year. Where this was done, the records 
are of considerably more value for they clearly show 
the profit or loss of every cow kept in the dairy. 

THE DIFFERENT METHODS THAT MAY BE USED IN 
WEIGHING AND SAMPLING 

There are several ways that records from each cow in 
the dairy can be obtained. The method used in obtaining 
the records given in this paper were as follows: The 
farmer, every 7th week, weighed and sampled each cows 
milk for 14 consecutive milkings. The amounts of milk </seg>


            <seg id="p113">
113 

yielded each day were added together, and with the per 
cant of butter fat, which the milk contained, was determined 
the amount of butter fat each cow produced during 
the week. From these results were estimated the amounts 
of milk and butter fat each cow produced three week 
fjre and three weeks following the test. The daily 
department of the Wisconsin experiment station hed 
their patrons weigh and sample one day each week during 
the whole year. From the different weights and tests. 
they estimated the amount of milk and butter fat that 
each cow produced in the year. The testing of the milk 
each week is too much for the average farmer to do but 
taking compositive samples of milk of several milkings 
gives a very good average of the per cent of fat contained 
in milk and can be done by anyone if he chooses. Fairly 
accurate results can be obtained by weighing and sampling 
the milk every 13th week and calculating the results 
the same as when the weighing and sampling were done 
every 7th week. The method of weighing and sampling 
each cow's milk every 7th week for 7 consecutive milkings 
of 3£ days, gives very good results. The results can 
be multiplied by 2 which would equal the amount of milk 
and butter fat produced for one week, then estimated 
the same as if the weighing and sampling were done the 
entire week. The compositive samples that are but 3i 
days old, I usually find in better condition for testing than 
the samples that are a week old. I find also that the 
farmers will take more pains with the work if it does not 
become tedious to them. The accuracy of records obtained 
by weighing and sampling each cow's milk at regular 
times during the year may be doubted. In comparing 
the amounts of milk and butter fat sold from two farms 
to a creamery with the amounts of milk and butter fat 
that I have determined from the weighing and sampling 
of each cow's milk every 7th week for 14 consecutive 
milkings during the year, I found in one case, a difference </seg>

            <seg id="p114">
114 


Jl per cent of butter fat and .0015 per cent in milk 
or making a difference of 4.67 lbs. of butter fat and 8.09' 
lbs. of milk per cow; in the other case a difference .03S 
p3r cent butter fat and 1.98 per cent in milk or .27 of 
butter fat per cow and 120.3 lbs. of milk. In both cases 
the amounts were greater at the creamery. I am fully 
convinced that, by taking pains in weighing and sampling, 
valuable records of the dairy herd can be obtained. 

OBJECT OF THE WORK 

There is no better way of finding out the merits of a 
dairy animal when giving milk, than to use the scales and 
the Babcock Test; with the weights of milk produced, the 
per cent of butter fat in it, and the length of her milking 
Reason, together with the food consumed, the value of a 
row for the dairy can be determined. The object in getting 
the dairymen to weigh and sample each cow's milk in 
their herds is to determine which of the individual cows is 
the most profitable, so that the owner may cull out his 
poor cows and keep only his profitable ones, and to get 
them to see the importance of taking better care of their 
i&lt; iws. A dairy animal should be selected for the amount 
of milk and butter fat which she yields during the year 
rather than on points of fancy or form. It is a pretty 
safe rule in selecting dairy cows to go upon the result* 
obtained from the scales and the Babcock Test. The safe 
way to know the true merits of a dairy cow is to have a 
record of the product she yields in a year. If she is a 
good breeder, that should also be taken into consideration. 
If the performance of each cow in the herd is known, the 
heifers can be selected from the best cows, and when 

§e heifers become fresh the test can be applied to them 
the inferior ones culled out. This can only be done 
n we have an intelligent understanding of each cow 
her capability of producing milk and butter fat. 

ELEMENTS OP DANGER IN THE USE OF THE BABCOCK TEST 

While the scales and the Babcock test can be of great </seg>


            <seg id="p115">
115 

service in the selection of our dairy animals, they must, 
h )wever, be used with judgment. Dairy cows will have 
their off years and this must be considered when the herd 
h l&gt;eing culled. If we do not bear this fact in mind, we 
are apt to sell some of the best cows in our herds. The 
writer has in mind the cow Sweet Briar, of the Minnesota 
Experiment Station, that produced for ten years on an 
average of 358.07 pounds of butter a year, while in 
she produced only 2(Xi.(&gt;2 pounds of butter. If the merits 
of Sweet Briar had been wholly based on the work she did 
in 1898, she would have been classed a very ordinary cow 
and perhaps sold. The great value of the scales and the 
Babcock test lies in their continued use in the dairy herd 
and not in one year's test. It is true that most of the 
good covvs conform very nearly to the accepted dairy form 
but there are enough exceptions to this rule to well repay 
the time needed in testing each cow in the herd. Good 
heifers usually come from the best dairy cows but it happens 
that promising heifers will do very poorly the first 
year. In such cases the heifer's individuality, together 
with her breeding, should be considered before she is sold. 
The testing of cows must continue for a series of years if 
it is to be of any great value in helping the man who does 
it to select better cows. We should always think twice 
before we sell a heifer or a cow unless she has some serious 
defects. 

THK VARIATION IN FLOW AND PKR CENT OF FAT IN MILK 

It has often been asked why it is necessary to weigh 
and sampl© each mess of milk for a week. By weighing 
and testing each milking separately we usually find considerable 
variation in milk yields and fat content. The 
following table shows to what extent a cow will vary in 
milk yield and per cent of fat from one milking to another. 
This table is taken from records of cows that wa^ 
tested for the Holstein Freisan Advanced Registry'- </seg>

TABLE SHOWING THE YIELD OF MILK AND PER

The above table readily shows the importance of weighing 
and sampling the milk for more than one milking, if 
the average test of the cows is to be obtained. Take 
Maid of Cloverdale for an example. She tested on the 
morning of September 25th, 2.00 per cent and at noon 
September 26th. 4.50 per cent. If at either time a test 
had been made for the purpose of obtaining her actual 
it would have been very misleading for her average

REPORT OF HERD "A 

rie herd kept upon this farm was mostly common nastock. 


There were strong evidences of Short Hom Blood, a few 
that showed some Jersey and a few grade Holstein e 
The average weight of each cow was 1,000 pounds. The 
herd, on the whole, was not bred for dairy purposes, moreover 
they neither showed dairy form nor capabilities of 
giving large flows of milk or producing large amounts of 
butter fat. Nearly every cow showed some signs of disorder. 
They were not in a thrifty condition. A number 
of them aborted during the year while others failed to get 
with calf and were sold. Some of them were disposed of 
so early in the test that their records are not calculated 
with the rest of the herd. There were ten other cows 
kept in this herd whose milk was not weighed nor tested. 
It is to be regretted that the owner could not see the importance 
of weighing and sampling the milk from each 
one of these cows. They were so poor he did not wish to 
take the time to do the work. The herd did not yield the 
amount of milk and butter it should for the amount of 
grain it consumed. The owner did not keep an accurate 
enough account of the grain and roughage that each cow 
ate so that I can make a report of them here. He fed a 
ration to his cows that was largely made up of corn and 
other foods highly rich in carbohydrates and containing a 
small per cent of protein. The cows received a small allowance 
of bran with the corn meal from October 1st to 
January 1st. During the months of January and February 
to the cows giving the largest flows of milk was 
given the following ration: </seg>

            <seg id="p119">
118 


I "his ration is altogether too rich in carbohydrates and 
tains a very low per cent of protein. If this farmer 
sold some of his corn and bought some mill feed, he 
Id, with less expense, have improved the ration. For 
mple, a ton of corn meal last year would have paid for 
'e than a ton of grano gluten. If a ration is made 
n 5 pounds of grano gluten ami 3 pounds of corn meal 
h the same amount and kind of roughage as contained 
the above ration, we will have a far better and a 
aper one. This ration would contain the following 
rients: 

1^ number of the cows' udders became feverish and hard 
ring the time that they were being fed so much corn, 
ound four of them that were giving milk from only 
•ee teats. It seems as though that excessive corn feedr, 
, must have had something to do with the general unisfactory 
condition of the herd, especially in the months 
January and February and perhaps the cause of four 
them losing the use of one quarter of their udders, 
e first of March rye was added to the ration. The rye 
i corn meal were mixed equal parts by weight and 
jut 8 lbs. of the mixture, together with timothy hay 
d corn silage was the ration received until May 1st 
»en ground oats was substituted in the place of rye.

The cows were turned out to pasture about the 25th, of 
of May but were given a small allowance of silage to July 
1st. From this time on to the completion of the year's 
work, they received nothing but grass. The ration which 
the cows received from March 1st, to May 1st, was somewhat 
better than the ration fed in January and February 
but it could have been much improved with mill feed. 
The ration for fresh cows was about as follows: 

It will be noticed that this ration which contains but 
4 lbs. of protein costs nearly as much as the above 
ion which contains 2.167 lbs. of protein. It readily 
iws that by exchanging some of the home grown grain 
mill stuff, the ration can be made better and will cost 
more and often less. It can be said that the cows in 
s herd did a very ordinary year's work, but, considering 
individuality of each animal in the herd, the general 
idition of their health, together with unskillful feeding. 
s not at all surprising that the results are as we find 
m. 

The best cow in the herd produced 6145.5 lbs. of milk. 
3.63 per cent fat, 223.65 lbs. of butter fat and 260.92 lbs. 
of butter, while the lowest produced only 1482.6 lbs. of 
milk, 3.97 per cent fat. 58.94 lbs. of butter fat and ¦ 
lbs. of butter. 

The average amount of product yielded by each cow 
tested was 3970.36 lbs. of milk, 3.55 per cent fat, 141.06 
of butter fat, and 164.57 lbs. of butter. 

Ehe average production for each cow in the herd was 
5.9 lbs. of milk, 3.58 per cent fat. 119.36 lbs. of butter

fat and 139.25 lbs. of butter. 

It was found that a cow last year had to produce about 

140 lbs. of butter fat to pay her board, and that the 
average price for butter fat when sold to the creameries 
was 22.0 cents. Calculating the results upon that basis, 
the cows that were tested yielded a profit of 23.3 cents. 
To ascertain the amount of product yielded by each of 
the untested cows in the herd for the year, it was necessary 
to subtract the amount of milk and butter fat yielded 
by the 18 cows that were tested from the total amount of 
milk and butter fat that was sold from this dairy. In this 
calculation a liberal amount of milk was estimated for 

house use and for the feeding of calves. 

Total amount of milk sold from Farm "A". . 97721.0 lbs. 

yielded by tested cows 76060.9 

Calculating the whole herd together, and estimating 

that it takes 140 lbs. of butter fat to pay for a cow's 

board, there is a loss of $4.54 per cow, or each cow should 

have produced 20.64 lbs. more butter fat to have paid for 

her keeping. 

The best cow in this herd gave a profit of $26.60, and 

the poorest one charged $15.67 for her board.

REPORT OP HERD "D' 

The cows in this herd consisted of full blood Jerseys, 
grade Jerseys, full blood Holsteins, grade Holsteins. 
Natives and grade Short Horns. There were 60 cows in 
the herd when the test began and 48 of them remained 
through the year; 12 of the cows were sold during the 
time that the test was being made for they were found 
to be inferior and unprofitable animals. The herd contained 
a great many very fine dairy cows and they made 
some very good records." The cows were in good condition 
during the whole year and were kept in a scrupulously 
clean and well ventilated barn. The barn was scrubbed 
once a day and white washed twice a year. The sanitary 
condition was nearly perfect. They were not only well 
cared for but they received well balanced rations during 
the entire year. The results of this herd readily show the 
importance for every dairyman to take good care of his 
cows and to feed them well. Giving some of the rations 
that the herd received during the year, at different times. 
will show clearly how well these cows were fed. From 
September 1st to the middle of October, to the cows giving 
the largest flows of milk, the ration consisted of 61bs. 
of grano gluten and all the green corn they would eat up 
clean. From October 15th. to December 7th the ration to 
the best milker was about as follows:

grass. It might be said that there were a few cows in 
the herd during this time that were getting more grain 
than there is given in the above ration?. The above 
rations apply more to the general feeding of the best 
milkers in the herd, the strippers and poor milkers getting 
according to the amount of meal that they were producing. 

It should be observed that the rations given to the 
&gt; &lt; \vs during the year did not contain a large amount &lt;f 
grain but each one contained a liberal amount of nutrients 
for cows that were giving large flows of milk. It will also 
be noticed that each ration contained over 2 lbs. of protein. 
When we compare grano gluten with bran or oats, 
we find that it contains twice as much digestible protein. 
Therefore, it is not necessary to feed as many pounds ol 
the grano gluten as we would have to feed of bran or oats 
to get the same amount of digestible protein. The above 
facts are mentioned so that the reader will not be misled 
when he compares the total amount of grain that each 
cow in this herd consumed with the amount of grain consumed 
by each cow in the other herd. When the cows in 
this herd were not receiving grano gluten, they were 
receiving gluten meal which is a bi-product of glucose 
sugar refining companies. This feed is also very rich in 
protein. It contains about 30 per cent of digestible protein. 
These facts demonstrate very clearly that it often 
pays farmers to sell some of their oats or corn and to buy 
some such bi-products as gluten meal, gluten feed, grano 
gluten, oil meal or dried brewer's grains. 

THE BASIS UPON WHICH THE PROFIT OR LOSS 

OF THE COW IS COMPUTED 

Eis very difficult to express the true value of the dairy 
in dollars and cents. But since the profit or loss of 
t of the cows tested has been given, it is perhaps 
to state the basis upon which the profit or loss was </seg>

Eulated. The value of the product that the cow 
ded was based upon the amount of butter fat that she 
le, and the market price of butter fat at the time she 

produced it 

The value of skim milk, the value of the calf, and the 

value of the manure produced by the cow was not credited 
to her, while on the other hand the cow was not 
debited with the amount of labor expended in her care 
nor the amount of feed consumed when dry. The cow 
was simply credited with the amount of butter fat she 
produced and charged for feed consumed when she was 
giving milk. This is perhaps a little unjust to some cows 
for it is possible to have two cows yield the same amount 
of butter fat and one give a profit and the other a loss. 
If, for example, one milks ten months and the other but 
K months in the year to yield equal amounts of butter 
which sometimes happens, one cow is charged with 

ten month's feed and the other for only six month's. 

The average prices of grain and roughage from Sept. 

tl901 to Sept. 1902 was about as follows:

The price of grain is based upon purchase price in 

the city market and the price of roughage is based upon 
the purchase price at the farm. When the cow is charged 
the above prices for farm products the farmer receives a 
profit on his land, and the profit which the cow gives him 
is over and above what he could have received for his products 
if he had sold them upon the market, and moreover 
the cows are often fed foods that are not marketable. </seg>

fhe average production for each cow in the herd was 
1.4 lbs. of milk, 4.45 per cent fat, 26aO8 lbs. of butter 
and 306.92 lbs. of butter. 

Em No. 147 made butter fat the cheapest. She charged 
to produce one pound of butter fat and 35.5c to pro-100 
lbs. of milk. 

I^ow No. 44 charged the most to make butter fat. She 
irged 22.4c to make one pound of butter fat and $1.03 
make 100 lbs. of milk. 

The average cost to produce one pound of butter fat 
was 12.6c, and 54.9c to produce 100 lbs. of milk. 

Cow No. 147 gave a profit of $57.22, and cow No. 44 
charged 18c for her board. 

The average profit of each cow in the herd was $2ti.i&gt;4. 
While the average profit of each cow in this herd is very 
good, it would perhaps have been better if the owner 
could have personally looked after his cows. The cows 
were entirely cared for by hired help.

THE COMMON COW 

PROF. T. L. HAECKER, UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA 

I have on several occasions had the pleasure of presenting 
to this association the merits of the dairy bred cow as 
a money maker in the dairy as compared with the common 
cow having no dairy heredity. The facts presented gave 
such strong evidence in favor of the dairy cow that many 
came to the conclusion that I favored the use of the high 
type dairy cow by the average farmer; but such is really 
not the case, for I also recognize the fact that the special 
dairy cow requires special care and accommodations suited 
to her needs. There is a question if this high type cow 
would do as well if only ordinary care and accommoda- 
Itis were accorded her, or if she would do much better 
n does the common cow. On this point it is not possito 
give any definite information, because we have at 
time restricted the station herd to the conditions that 
inarily obtain on the farms of the west; but we can 
w what the common cow does and will do if proper 
ding and good care is bestowed upon her. 

In view of the fact that the average farmer employs 
the common cow in his farming operations, and has 
demonstrated that he is not only slow to make any change, 
but averse to doing so, it becomes a matter of great 
importance to show what can be done with the cow that 
he seems determined to use. 

The farmer has many difficulties to contend with if 
he undertakes to use the dairy bred cow that should be 
recognized by the man who advocates her employment. 
The chief objection presented by the farmer is the expense 
that is necessary to secure a herd of good dairy 
Es; but to my mind there is a more serious obstacle in 
way, and that is the lack of knowledge of the average 
ner how to handle this cow. If he has the means to </seg>

            <seg id="p135">

EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 

82cure this cow, but has not trained himself to give "her 
proper accommodations and treatment then the chances 
are that he would meet with disappointment if he should 
employ her. I have known so many instances where the 
means were ample, and the disposition to provide all necessary 
accommodations was in evidence, yet because of 
lack of training in how to handle her, disappointment followed 
that I am very slow in recomending her. The fault 
is not with the cow, but with the man. So few men 
know how to care for a good cow that failure is the rule 
and success the exception, and this statement applies to 
all improved stock, but in a more marked degree to the 
use of the high type dairy cow. And since the average 
farmer has not acquired the habit of giving that kindly 
attention to the cow that she must have in order to do her 
best, he had better use the one that is more suited to his 
way of doing things. That is, the common man had 
better be content with the common cow, for she will make 
such return as he deserves. I am quite convinced that 
the common cow is a better dairy cow than is the average 
man a dairyman; that it will be better in the long run to 
devote ourselves to the improvment of the man and his 
methods, than to spend much time in discussing the kind 
of cow that is best adapted for the dairy. 

RESULTS FROM A FAIRLY GOOD HERD. 

It is not the aim to discourage those who are qualified 
to employ good cows from using them, and to show what 
results may be expected where fairly good methods are 
practiced and good cows employed, a record of a couple of 
years will be given. The herd has been composed of all 
kinds of cows, with reference to breed and individuals as 
well. As we have always kept the cows that came to us 
whether good or poor producers. This was done so that 
valuable lessons could be given by making comparisons 
between the good and the poor; and such comparisons </seg>

will be mado in groups and not between individuals. The 

rd for th ' t\v ) years will give a goad idea as to what 

may be expected because there has baen little variations 

in the yearly vield of milk and butter during the ten years 

they have been under experiment.

The c )\vs yielded on an average 7436 pounds of milk 
and 351 pjunds of butter during the calendar year; the 
ost of keep \va; $23.29 per head, and the profit on the 
butter valued at 20 cents per pound, and making no credit 
for skim milk, was $44.90. Since all the feed was purchased, 
the profits would be even greater to the farmer 
who raises the feed. If allowance is made for the skim 
milk at the rate of 15 cents per 100 pounds, and it is 
really worth more for feeding purposes, the annual profit 
per cow would amount to $51.42, or the gross receipts per 
$76.72. If a farmer has a small farm he can take 
care of ten cows without employing any help, and can 
thus provide for an income from his ten cows of $767. 
The difficulty with the average farmer is that he undertakes 
too much. He generally has more land than he can 
manage economically and pays out too much for pom-, 
inefficient, careless labor, which plays havoc with his 

It has been stated that the herd was composed of various 
kinds of cows, good and poor, that is, cows that were 
dairy bred and just common cows. If the cows are 
divided into two groups, one composed of dairy bred cows 
and the other of common or beef bred cows, two things 
are shown. First, what may be expected under proper 
management with the dairy cows, and what may be expected

The common cows during the two years averaged per 
year a yield of 6533 pounds of milk and 287 pounds of 
butter, cost $25.16 for feed and pasture and returned a 
profit of $32.24 per cow, and if they are credited for skim 
milk at the rate of 15 cents per 100 pounds it amounts to 
$42.04. Comparing the average results obtained from the

]&gt;er feed and care of the dairy cow and the common cow. 
That the dairy cow earns each year about $30 more profit 
than can be realized from the common cow. But the most 
valuable lesson that these records teach is that by proper 
care and feed the common cow will return an annual profit 
of $32.24 or a gross return of $42.04. 

Taking the statistic? of the state of Nebraska on the 
yield of butter per cow, it does not exceed 125 pounds, 
which means a gross return for butter of $25, being a loss 
per cow of $17.00, which is wholly chargeable to improper 
care and feeding. Assuming that there are being milked 
in the state, 600,000 cows, the aggregate loss to Nebraska 
farmers is over 10 million dollars per year. It is because 
of this enormous loss that I contend the improvement in 
your dairymen and their methods of caring for the cow 
they have, is a more important matter than the kind of 
O m they are employing. That the fault is not so much 
with the cow as with the man. What the common cow 
does at our experiment stations she will do on every farm 
if similiar opportunities are given. It may be said that 
cows at experiment stations are well fed. That is true, 
but it is also shown that it pays to feed well. But the 
chief cause of failure to make a large yield on the farm 
is not caused by better feeding but the lack of method on 
the part of the farmer. The greatest obstacle in the way 
of securing as large a field as might be secured is irregularity 
and lack of kindly treatment, and by irregularity I 
have reference to quantity of feed given from day to day 
as well as time when it is given and time when the milking 
is done. A cow should have just the same amount of 
feed each day and receive it at stated times. A time 
should be set for feeding and milking and nothing should 
be permitted to interfere with the program. Everything 
should give way to this one chore, and it should be performed 
in such a way that it will be the most enjoyable 
events of the day to the cow. It may be thought that the </seg>

            <seg id="p140">

135 

|:ord of the performance of the common cow at the ex"iment 
stations may not fairly illustrate the possibilities 
the common cow; that the individuals employed may not 
representative. If such is the case then it makes still a 
ier gap between the usefulness in the dairy of the dairy 
vand the common cow. From the statistics published from 
le to time in Hoard's Dairyman of the results secured 
dairy farmers with the common cow it appears quite 
ar that the man who is in charge of the cow has quite 
much to do with results as has the cow, for in tho"ta 
it often is shown that good returns come from herds 
common cows and at times marked failures from those 
nposed of dairy bred cows. 

WHY THE DIFFEKI \( K 

The unsatisfactory returns are chiefly caused by kick &lt;4 
attention to the cows. When a cow comes fresh in milk 
every effort should be made to have her start her lactation 
with a large flow of milk. To this end she should be 
brought to a high physical tone by good and kindly care 
and proper feed. Oats is a good milk stimulent, so she 
should be fed a few days on oats that has been softened 
with hot water an hour before feeding. A mixture of 
bran and oats, equal parts, would also be good. The calf 
should be removed the first day so she will quickly forget 
it "and transfer her affections to her feeder and milker. 
Those things should be done which will make her comfortable 
and contented. All notions that a cow needs exercise 
and a daily exposure to discomfort to make her hardy 
should be abandoned. Keep her quiet and comfortable. 
Feed and milk regularly and in this way the flow can be 
held at the maximum for a few months. If these few 
hints are followed you will be in a fair way to become a 
successful dairyman. Few cows need more than from 7 
to 8 pounds of grain daily, and not more than half of this 
should be corn meal, better make a mixture of 5 parts </seg>

QUALITY AND TYPE OF OUR FARM ANIMALS

farming operations.

pensation for the time and labor expended in conducting 
the work of the farm. 

In the second place it is no less important that the fertility 
of the soil be maintained, and not wastefully dissipated 
as is the case in exclusive grain growing or 
cropping. 

Ehe natural soil fertility should be most jealously 
rded as so much capital stock, that under no circumices 
is it to be impaired. 

It should be looked upon as the very basis and foundation 
of profitable and successful farming, and the plan 
should ever be to so farm that this capital stock— this 
essential condition- be not impaired or wasted. 

Any system of farming that continues to draw upon the 
bountiful stores of nature without any adequate return 
therefor, is not only wrong but wastefully extravagant 
and in the end will lead to impoverishment, unprofitable 
farming, and abandoned farms. 

Phe history of the past, the world over, has demonted 
this fact again and again. The correct theory of 
:essful farming, therefore requires that the fertility of 
soil be maintained and not dissipated. 

Inis can only be accomplished by every farmer 
iming a manufacturer and making his farm a manuuring 
plant or condensing factory, where all of the 
lucts of the farm — the corn, the oats, the grass, the 
ge crops, everything grown— be consumed and coned 
into marketable beef, pork, mutton, wool, butter, 
sse, horses, mules— anything you like in the shape of 
stock or their products, and the resultant wastes, in 
form of fertility, be returned to the land to compenit 
for the fertility given up in growing the crops, 
question then confronting us at this time is, will we

Iough or by means of live stock, and return the greater 
•t of the fertility required in growing the crops to the 
I for the benefit of future crops, and of the future 
lerations that are to follow us, and thus greatly and 
istantly increase the value of our farms, or will we sell 
• crops to the grain dealer and with it an essential part 
our farms, year by year, until little or nothing remains 
1 the farms are greatly depreciated in value? Which 

{we decide in favor of the first proposition then the 
stock becomes the medium or connecting link between 
crude products of the farm, the grain, the grass, etc.. 
the labor in producing the crops and caring for the 
k, and the final result of the undertaking the cash rets, 
the profit or loss. 

i^he result is dependant upon the specific performance 
each individual animal involved in the consumption 
1 conversion of the grain and other food, into the marcommodity. 
Each individual animal becomes a sepae 
machine in this farm factory and if the cost of rung, 
or feeding this machine, for the required period is 
sater than the value of the finished product, then this 
mal machine is not a profitable one and its kind should 
discarded in the future. 

It is said that the average dairy cow in this country 
does not produce more than 130 lbs. of butter fat annually. 
At 20 cents per pound the product of this cow or 
machine would be only $26.00. It is further estimated 
that the cost of keeping the average dairy cow is $35.00 
per year, consequently she does not pay for the keeping, 
her board and is an unprofitable machine. 

Ei the other hand there are numerous cows that will 
ume the same quantity of food and convert it into 
e, four or even five hundred pounds of butter fat anly 
and pay a good round profit for all of the food </seg>

consumed and all of the care and labor required. The one 
is a good machine -the other is a bad one. The one has 
the ability and the capacity to convert the crude farm 
products into a more concentrated form of such a quantity 
and quality as to make it a paying and profitable 
business. The other la~ks the ability to do this and consumes 
more food, or fuel if you please, in the manufacturing 
process than the product is worth on the market. 
One fanner may raise a horse that will readily sell at 5 
years of age for $200 or $3C0, another may raise one 
Kwill sell for one half as much, yet the one has coned 
just as much food and required just as much care 
as the other. The difference is in the machine and may 
be designated as quality. The one has acquired through 
long years of breeding and selection, the habit of converting 
its food into bone and muscle and flesh and so distributing 
it about the body as to make the most perfect and most 
useful animal for the purposes for which the horse is 
wanted. The other lacks this ability— this quality, hence 
is a poor and unprofitable machine. It is true that there 
I much in knowing how to manage a machine, but if it 
lot adapted to the work required of it, has not the incited 
quality it can never do good and profitable work. 

Ehe machine determines what the product shall be. 
feed- cannot change it. The first step in every underng 
should be a definite plan and purpose. Without 
this there is indiscriminate confusion and haphazard 
results. If the farmer decides to market the products of 
his farm through his live stock, he must then determine 
what the finished product or products shall be. Whether 
beef, pork, mutton, wool, butter, cheese, etc., any or all of 
these things, as he may think best. It then becomes a 
question of economical and profitable production. We 
Ew that the different breeds of stock have their specific 
3 and purposes. We know that they have been selected 
bred for generations— even hundred of years- for </seg>

the purpose of doing some particular thing well. Some 
particular thing better and more profitable than other animals 
of their kind. They have been bred for performance 
for quality. 

We know that there are breeds of cattle that have 
acquired the habit of placing the product of the food consumed 
upon their backs where the most valuable and best 
meat is to be found, and they do this naturally and at an 
earlier age and consequently more economically than 
those animals whose breeding has not been specially 
directed. We know that other breeds of cattle have been 
developed possessing the quality of the greatest and richest 
milk production. 

One breed of sheep produces great quantities of the 
best wool and another excels in mutton production. The 
same is true of all the various breeds of domestic or farm 
animals. Each has its particular forte- its points of 
excellence or usefulness. 

It is a necessary condition in the successful production 
of any product that we be familiar with the means of 
machine by which it is produced and that we have the 
test for accomplishing the work designed. It is therefore 
necessary that we know our farm animals and all their 
various characteristics, peculiarities and qualities. It is 
desirable to know their past history, their pedigree the 
record of theii ancestors and the environments with 
which they have been surrounded and what quality or 
qualities have been most developed, so that in a choice of 
breeds for the farm we may select those that have the 
best inherited qualifications for successfully accomplishing 
the object we have in view. 

The value of the animal and its quality depends upon 
the use we make of it. Our variety or breed of cattle 
may be the best for the economical production of milk and 
butter fat, uul fall far short of doing a profitable job in </seg>

B production of beef, for the reason that the beef habit 
never been cultivated or developed. 

In the other hand every effort has been made by careselection 
and breeding -by special feeding — by the 
y and presistent encouragement of the milk flow— to 
blish a breed of cattle whose principal object is the 
/ersion of the food consumed into milk and butter fat. 
; process has developed the udder at the expense of 
;r portions of the body, hence the cat hams the narand 
lean angular body the dairy type. 

I'ther breed of cattle have been evolved for a very dif-3nt 
purpose. The production of milk beyond the rerements 
of its offspring, has not been encouraged, but 
conversion of food into the best quality of muscle and 
has been cultivated, as well as form and temperment, 
il we have the small head, short neck, short legs, set 
ie apart, rounded crops, a good wide back with broad 
p loin, covered with good thick flesh and a bulging 
st. All the fixed characteristics or habits of the unitakable 
beef type. We sell our grain and various farm 
ps to our stock but the price depends upon the quality 
the animal to which it is fed or its ability to convert 
food into the best paying product. 

The better machine the better the work it will perform. 
Always the machine and not the feed determines 
what the product shall be. The better the animal- the 
longer it has been bred for a special purpose, the more 
quality it has -the better price we will receive for the 
feed consumed and the labor expended. 

How shall the desired quality in our farm animals and 
especially for beef purposes be obtained, is the serious 
question confronting most feeders today. The question of 
quality of breeding the best of its kind has not yet sufficiently 
recommended itself to the great mass of our 
fanners and stock growers, and the result is that the </seg>

NEBRASKA DAIRYMEN'S ASSOCIATION 

scrub— a mixture of everything and not much of anything 
to recommend it, abounds every where and many 
are compelled to market their farm products through the 
medium of a very inferior machine, and content themselves 
with low and unprofitable prices. My answer to 
the feeder and corn grower is, grow your own steers of 
the kind and quality you want. I know we have recently 
been told by good authority, that we cannot afford to keep 
a cow, upon the high priced land of Illinois for a year for 
her calf. The statement has been widely circulated and 
so far as I know the correctness of the assertion has not 
been questioned. 1 may be exceedingly rash in attempting 
to controvert the idea, but if it is a correct statement 
of the situation, and there is no help for it, then we are 
indeed in a deplorable condition. 

At the present time, we look to the Western ranges for 
many of our best feeders, where they are grown on 
cheaper land and under cheaper conditions than can be 
found further east, but it is only a question of a short 
time when this source will no longer be able to supply the 
demand. 

The irrigation of much of this region, to be undertaken 
by the government and tf;s adaptation to general farm 
purposes will soon drive out the large breeding herds, 
from which source so large a part of our feeders and 
meat supply is now derived. 

I think there is no question but that this will happen 
in the near future and that the vast territory now devoted 
to breeding herds of cattle and sheep will soon be used for 
other purposes and the herds will be dispersed. 

I [Tie price of land is rapidly advancing in all of the corn 
•wing states in a short time the area where a cow can 
profitably kept for her calf, according to the accepted 
a, will be exceedingly limited. 

Where then shall we obtain our cattle and sheep of the </seg>

            <seg id="p149">
EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 

143 

requisite quality for feeding purposes. We cannot much 
longer look to the western ranges, and the price of our 
corn land, even now, is too high, it is claimed, to admit of 
raising them, except at a loss, and the price of this land, 
high as it now is, will be much higher. The dual purpose 
cow is suggested as a panacea for all our ills -the cow 
that will produce an abundance of the richest milk, and a 
calf that will make a good and profitable feeder for beef. 
The dairy cow and the beef cow have been bred for generations 
for diametrically opposite purposes. The tendencies 
and habits of each have become fixed. What ever increase 
has been made in the milking quality has been at 
the expense of the beef quality and visa versa. 

If the two qualities could be combined in the same animal, 
giving us a first class milk and beef animal in one. 
we would certainly have the ideal animal, but it can never 
be except in a limited degree. Taking the dual purpose 
cow as she is and for what she can do, it is yet an open 
question if a greater profit can be made, taking into 
account the extra labor, care and expense involved, than 
can be derived from the special purpose cow. The idea of 
the-tise of the dual purpose cow does not involve any 
change in our method of farming or feeding or saving of 
the waste products of the farm, but holds out the inducement 
that by combining the dairy and beef cow in one of 
medium quality for milk and beef purposes and the addition 
of extra labor and feed, we may afford to keep her on 
our high priced land. 

Conceeding all that is claimed for the dual purpose cow 
to be true, it cannot possibly relieve the situation to any 
extent or promise to provide the necessary number of 
feeders of the best beef quality. While the dual purpose 
cow may be the cow for the small farmer, who can and 
will be compelled to look to some other source for any 
great benefits or advantages over the present situa- </seg>

lion. The average feeder in the corn growing 
states must breed and raise his own feeders and 
of the type and quality that can be most profitably 
fed for market, and he must do it upon the high 
priced land, if that is the kind he is fortunate enough to 
own. The time has come when the farmer must pursue 
the same business methods, use the same business sense 
and practice the same economy found necessary in other 
vocations. I do mean to say that farmers generally do 
not practice economy, but many of them are short sighted 
and do not practice the right kind. Many industries 
prosper and make vast sums of money from products 
that formerly were allowed to go to waste. Once the 
packing houses only saved the meat, tallow, lard and 
hides the otfal was wasted. Now everything is saved 
and out of the offal formerly lost, immense fortunes are 
made. Their profit is now in this former waste. Manufacturers 
of the present day are making heavy profits out 
of the material that formerly was considered good for 
nothing. One of the most striking examples of this kind 
is now seen all over the South. Where the cotten seed 
\ ;ts formerly thrown away and in most cases not even 
used as a fertilizer, it is now valued at several dollars per 
acre by the grower, which sum represents that much clear 
profit on the cotton crop from what was formerly thrown 
away. The value of the cotton seed crop reaches the millions 
and its utilization not only furnishes an increased 
profit for the planter, but has established a great industry 
for the whole country that furnishes labor for a vast army 
of men. 

Undoubtedly the most stupendous waste of today is 
that of the corn crop on the farm of the corn growing 
states. The animal loss from this source represents millions 
upon millions of dollars to the corn growers of this 
country. The amount is almost beyond our ability to comprehend, 
yet the waste is steadily and constantly going on </seg>

I 1 after year. The great waste is in the corn growing 
cattle feeding regions— the place where we are told 
land is so valuable that we cannot afford to raise our 
feeders and where we cannot afford to keep a cow 
ss we milk her. 

It has been settled over and over again by experimental 
:s and trials that one-third of the feeding value of the 
n plant is in the plant outside of the ear. The loss or 
&gt;te of this part of the plant represents so much money 
own away. There is no other business in the world, so 
as I know, except farming, that is so prosperous and 
iblished upon such a paying basis that it can afford to 
erly disregard and throw away one-third of the value 
one of its greatest products and still prosper. It simshows 
what possibilities there are, when the business 
farming is conducted with the same judgment and unstanding 
and the same business methods and the same 
nomy practiced that we find necessary in other under- 

It is true that our farmers occasionally clamor for a 
change of administration, in order that their distressed 
and unfortunate condition may be improved, but on the 
whole we are doing fairly well and the business of farming 
is reasonably prosperous. Notwithstanding the fact 
that we are not in some respects exercising the same skill 
and intelligence in conducting it, that is used in other 
enterprises. It will avail little to talk to our feeders of 
the value of type and quality, unless we can point them to 
the source from which this kind of stock can be obtained. 
Corn — the great fattening food is grown upon our highest 
priced and most valuable land.and as a rule the farmer who 
raised it, is also the feeder but under existing conditions 
and according to the prevailing idea, he cannot afford to 
raise his own feeders of the type and quality that will 
make him the most money, but he must buy whatever 
kind he can get, good, bad or indifferent, from some other </seg>

            <seg id="p152">
146 


section of the country, where land is cheaper and they can 
afford to raise them. To my mind there is something 
radically wrong about this whole business as it does not 
permit the corn grower and feeder to say to what kind of 
stock he will sell his corn. I believe the farmer should 
run an independent plant, from start to finish, and when 
he has raised the corn or other food and desires to market 
it through his stock, that he will have the stock of the 
type and quality to consume it, that his best judgment 
tells him will net him the most money. The farmer who 
raises the most corn must of course produce the greatest 
amount of fodder, the greatest amount of that food stuff 
now so prodigiously and profligately wasted. 

Why not utilize this valuable food product in growing 
the animals that later are to be fattened upon the corn. 
It is a very simple proposition and I believe a practical 
one. It simply proposes to utilize what is now permitted 
to go to waste. What Prof. Waters estimates in Missouri 
to be worth annually to the feeder of his state over 40,-000,000 
and what I believe has been estimated in Nebraska 
to be worth at least $25,000,000 annually, and for 
the whole country would represent to the farmer a valuation 
of something like three-fourths of a billion dollars. 
If we can grow stock upon what is now wasted, we will 
surely stop the waste and be that ahead. And what is to 
finder? You ask can it be done? Two objections or excuses 
are offered for not making a better use of the corn 
fodder. The first that it has little or no feeding value 
and in the second place if it has a value it is less than the 
of harvesting and saving it. In other words the contention 
is, that it costs more to save the corn fodder, than 
it is worth after it is saved, and therefore it is a saving 
not to save it. 

It is not necessary for me to enter into any discussion 
in regard to its value as a stock food. The actual feeding 
tests that have been made at our experiment stations and </seg>

            <seg id="p153">
EIGHTEENTH ANNUAL CONVENTION 

147 

the comparisons in feeding value with other food products 
of known and standard value have settled this question 
beyond all controversy. The conclusion is this, that corn 
fodder when fed alone has something like one-half the 
feeding value of timothy hay, but when fed in combination 
with clover hay or some food of that nature, is fully 
equal to timothy hay. 

The corn fodder produced on an acre of good corn land 
is equal in quality and value to the timothy hay that could 
be grown on the same land. Shall we save it? 

For fear that some may think that I am talking at random 
or "through my hat", as the saying is, I want to 
explain that I annually raise about 300 acres of corn in 
Illinois. For the past two seasons the yield has been 
between 80 and 90 bushels per acre and the yield of fodder 
over three tons per acre. I have every acre, every 
stalk cut up and run through the shredder. I have kept 
a careful account of the cost of doing this work and I am 
prepared to demonstrate that the fodder does not cost to 
exceed over one dollar per ton, after deducting the cost of 
gathering and cribbing the corn in the ordinary way. 
Now, then, I have a ton of fodder that has cost me $1.00 
and is worth at the least calculation, half as much as timothy 
hay, which in my section of Illinois is $8.00. M\ 
fodder then is worth $4.00 per ton. By the investment of 
$1.00 I have secured a value of $4.00. Ordinarily if a 
man can invest $1.00 in any enterprise and at the end of 
the year have $1.10 to show for it, he looks upon it as a 
good proposition. He has made 10 per cent on his money, 
but in this case, as you will seerl have made 300 per cent. 
Now by a proper combination of this fodder with other 
kinds of food, such as clover, cow peas or alfalfa or grain. 
I can double its value and make it the equal of timothy 
hay, and even better, and more valuable ton for ton. I 
have a first class stock food that will keep in good condi- </seg>

            <seg id="p154">

tion lots of cows and their calves. I can raise all the 
feeders the farm will raise the corn to feed for the market, 
and they will not cost me as much as it would to go 
upon the market and buy them, and besides I am the 
master of the situation, as to the type and quality of the 
stock I feed, and I can make more money from my feeding 
operations than if compelled to feed any kind of stock 
that I might be able to pick up. The price of land is 
largely regulated by what it produces and what can be 
made out of it. I can raise three tons of good fodder per 
acre on some of the high priced lands of Illinois, shred it 
and put it in the barn or rick, at a cost not to exceed 
$3.00 or $1.00 per ton for the fodder. From this one acre 
I have more than enough feed to keep a cow for the 5 or 
6 months, when she is not grazing, and with the proper 
combination of other cheaply grown and soil impn 
r'm, :!k, like clover, alfalfa or cow peas, I have sufficient 
food to keep two or three cows, and at a cost not to exceed 
one-half of the value of a first class, well bred beef calf 
at six months of age. Yet it is contended that we cannot 
afford to keep a cow for her calf. I challenge this assertion 
and say it is the very thing we should do, on the high 
priced lands, and is the only thing we can do to stop the 
great waste that is now going on. 

It is no time to throw up our hands and say we Cannot 
a thing when present methods do not suffice. Rather let 
look for better and more rational methods and for ways 
i means for doing what we know ought to be done and 
ng about a condition that we know ought to exist. 

Another thing, while I am keeping this cow that is to 
raise the calf, the manure that I can make with the 
shredded corn stalks that are not eaten (for they are the 
best absorbent in the world) if properly utilized, is worth 
all it cost me to keep the cow during the winter months 
and she has not cost me a cent, and does not owe me anything. </seg>

Cattle on full feed for fattening purposes can only consume 
a small quantity of fodder. Hogs, to which so much 
of our corn is fed, cannot consume it at all. No animal 
that we are fattening for market can consume any considerable 
quantity of it. How foolish - how unbusiness like 
to so manage farm, factory or manufacturing plant, that 
we have a large quantity of valuable product on hand 
every year that we cannot utilize or get anything for. 
The facts of the case are that we need to balance the products 
of our farm, and raise such crops only, and in such 
quantities, as can be consumed entirely and without waste. 

To do this we must also balance the stock to fit the requirments 
of the farm, and of the kind that will consume 
every part and parcel of the entire products, and when we 
do this and select stock of the best type, and quality, as 
the medium for condensing it, we will be doing business 
in a business way. 

MY EXPERIENCE IN FEEDING LARGE RATIONS 
OF ALFALFA TO HOGS 

Paper read before the State Swine-Breeders' and 1&gt; 
¦ if Breeders' Associations at Lincoln, Nebraska, January 
20th, 1903, by G. H. Payne, of Omaha. 

Mr. Chairman &amp; Gentlemen. 

When our most genial host. Dr. Peters, telephoned me 
he had honored me with a place on your program and assigned 
me the above subject, I was very much surprised 
because I am not a public speaker, in any sense, and my 
experience in the feeding line is somewhat limited. 

Elfalfa is a great subject. The more you see of alfalfa, 
more you hear about alfalfa, the more you want to 
about alfalfa. It is one of the handsomest field 
plants that grows, being the first thing to show green in 
the spring and the last to lose its beautiful color in the </seg>

fall. The sheep love it, the cattle live on it, the chickens 
grow fat on it, the pig will run for it. It is claimed the 
Mormon makes tea of it and the Indian smokes it but 
l&gt;erhaps you can take the last two statements with a few 
grains of salt. 

I told Dr. Peters he would be sorry for assigning thi 
subject to me and you also will be before I am through 
but to the subject. 

My experience in feeding alfalfa to hogs is not extensive, 
although I have studied the subject very carefully 
for the last few years, being interested for some time in a 
small ranch at Sidney, Neb., where we run about 2,000 cattle 
and put up from 1000 to 1200 tons of alfalfa per year; 
and also being interested in several farms at North Platte 
and Lexington, in the heart of the alfalfa belt. 

te have watched with much interest the experiments 
have been carried on at the various State Experit 
Stations, we also having noted the numerous claims 
e by various farmers and others in the alfalfa counof 
the wonderful feeding value of this very producforage 
crop. 

i Wishing to satisfy ourselves more fully on the subject, 
determined, a year ago, on our farms at North Platte 
Lexington, to make a thorough test of the value of 
ilfa for hogs. I can describe our progress no better 
n by quoting from a report we issued on November 
d, 1902, as follows: 

rON ALFALFA EXPERIMENTS CONDUCTED ON THE 
SUMMER RANCH, NORTH PLATTE, NEBRASKA 

Ethe above farm there is a small tract of land, 21 
old alfalfa, and 5 acres new alfalfa sown in 1902: 
26 acres. 

Ee first crop of alfalfa was cut June 1st, and from that 
up to date has been pastured with an average of </seg>


            <seg id="p157">
151 

kbout 160 head of hogs, all ages. The man in charge has 
kept an accurate account of the weights of the hogs and 
food given them, the idea being to satisfy the owners of 
the property of the value of alfalfa as pasturage for hog^ 

in addition to running 160 head of bogs on this 26 acres 
land, the hay was cut three times, making a total of 
I tons of hay. This was sold to a cattle company and 
! out on the property, we doing the feeding at $5.00 per 
i, netting the owners of the property over $13.50 per 
e for the alfalfa, in addition to pasturing, as above 
ted, 160 head of hogs. The hogs were weighed on the 
h day of each month, with this result: 

FIRST EXPERIMENT WITH KIKTY-NINE STOCK HOGS 

June 14 weighed an average of 108 lbs. each. 

August 14 weighed an average of 144 lbs. each. 

This was a gain of 36 lbs. in 60 days, or .6 of a pound 
per day. These hogs were fed, as near as could be measured, 
J lb. of shelled corn per day, the gain in weight per 
day being greater than the grain fed. A very satisfactory 
showing, the gain costing less than one cent per 
pound for grain fed. 

SECOND EXPERIMENT WITH THIRTY SHOATS 

August 14, weighed an average of 131 lbs. each They 
were put in separate pasture and fed about four pound? 
of ground wheat and rye per day, with all the alfalfa they 
wanted to eat. 

i October 14, weighed an average of 190 lbs. each. A 
,in of 59 lbs. in 60 days, or practically 1 lb. each per day. 
lis experiment showed an unsatisfactory gain in common 
with the large increase in grain fed, but the only 
lution we can give is that the ground wheat and rye. fed </seg>

with the alfalfa was not as good a balanced ration as corn 
fed with alfalfa, and that where the grain was increased 
they ate that much less alfalfa. 

THIRD EXPERIMENT 86 MAY AM) JUNE PIGS, AFTER 

WEANING 

§ugust 14, weighed an average of 27.1 lbs. each. Ocr 
14, weighed an average of 45.8 lbs. each. A gain of 
lbs. each in 60 days, or practically h lb. per day. 

I November 14, weighed an average of 61 lbs. each. A 
n of 15.2 lbs. in 30 days. After these pigs were 
ined, from August 14th to September 14th, they pracilly 
made very little gain. They were fed one pound 
ground wheat and rye per pig per day, fed as slop, and 
nty of alfalfa pasture. The gain in this experiment 
reased as the pigs grew, the last 30 days being £ lb. 
n per day against lbs. per day for the first 60 days. 
2se pigs were an ordinary lot and were hardly a satistory 
experiment although the gain was made at a very 

FoIRTH EXPERIMENT -22 THOROUGHBRED DUROC JERSEY 

GILTS 

Ijptember 14, weighed an average of 100.1 lbs. each, 
ember 14, weighed an average of 151.3 lbs. each. A 
i of 51.2 lbs. each in 60 days, or, .8 of a pound per day. 
se hogs were fed one pound of ground wheat and corn 
day each, and alfalfa pasture. This is considered the 
gain of all the experiments, .8 of a pound per day 
g considered a very large gain with such a small grain 
&gt;n, and the grain being wheat and corn. These hogs 
5 in excellent flesh and took very heartily to the 
lfa pasture. The small ration of grain named went 
ct to gain, almost pound for pound. 

THE RESULT 

It has not been the intention to see how rapid a gain </seg>

            <seg id="p159">

fid be made but how much gain for the smallest amount 
grain fed with the alfalfa. 

The first experiment was very satisfactory .6 of a pound 
gain per day on J pound of grain. 

The second experiment was unsatisfactory 1 pound 
gain from 4 pounds of grain, the additional gain not being 
sufficient to warrant the large increase in grain fed. 

The third experiment with the young pigs was not 
satisfactory and we came to the conclusion that a much 
better gain on alfalfa can be made with a pig weighing 75 
pounds, or over, than with a smaller one. 

The fourth experiment with gilts of over 100 lbs. was 
eminently satisfactory — .8 of a pound gain from one 
pound of grain, and the animal in prime breeding condition. 


It is generally conceded that it takes from four and 
one-half to six pounds of grain to make one pound of 
tk. The experiments above prove, beyond all question 
a doubt, that a gain of one pound of pork can be made 
with from one to two pounds of grain and such alfalfa 
pasture as a hog will eat. 

EXPERIMENT ON FATTENING ALFALFA HOGS 

After these experiments were completed we had a few 
head of hogs that we wished to finish for the market. It 
k generally claimed that hogs that have been raised on 
alfa pasture fatten and finish very rapidly when taken 
the alfalfa pasture, much more so than hogs fed in the 
jal way, mostly on corn. To satisfy ourselves on this 
question, an accurate experiment was finished on this 
farm December 4th, the hogs and corn being weighed to a 
pound and an accurate account kept. 

t'he experiment was made with 23 hogs that had run 
alfalfa all summer, with an average of J pound of corn </seg>

l&gt;er head per day until October 1st, then with one pound 
per head per day in addition to the alfalfa pasture, and on 
November 15th were put in separate lots on full feed of 
c &gt;rn and as much alfalfa as they could eat, the idea being 
to see how quickly they could be finished off for the mar- 

ket and at what profit.

EXPERIMENT WITH ALFALFA HAY ALONE 

About November 1st we commenced another experiment. 
It is claimed that hogs will live on alfalfa hay 
alone. To satisfy ourselves on this question we put five 
head in a lot about 100 feet square and fed them nothing 
but alfalfa hay. The experiment was so unsatisfactory 
and our sympathy for the animal was such that we only 
carried on this experiment about 30 days, because the 
shoats showed that they were going down hill very rapidly. 
We then commenced to feed these five shoats about a 
pound of corn a day and all the alfalfa hay they would 
eat, and we found within 10 days a remarkable change for 
the better. 

Wej.vere still not satisfied with this experiment because 
as near as we could tell we could not get the shoats to eat 
more than 2 lbs. to 3 lbs. of hay per day, which, with a 
pound of corn was not sufficient to make a gain of any 
consequence.

EXPERIMENT WITH CHOPPED ALFALFA HAY AND CORN 

5 to 1 

About the same time we commenced another experiment 
with a lot of about (&gt;0 shoats. We took the third 
cutting of alfalfa, which was very green and fine, and 
chopped it up in lengths of about 1 of an inch long, with 
a feed cutter. To 5 or 6 lbs. of this chopped alfalfa we 
put about a pound of corn meal. We mix it up in a box. 
cover with water and stir it thoroughly, and we feed of 
this from 8 to 10 lbs. a day to each hog, or as much as 
they will clean up. We feed it on a feeding floor. 

We have no scales on the farm where we are trying this 
experiment, therefore, are not in position to say now just 
what the gain is, but one thing we do know, that since 
November 1st these hogs are making as satisfactory gains 
a&gt; one could wish in stock hogs, and they will be in splendid 
condition to go on pasture in the spring and make big 
heavy pork for early market next October. 

We have about 100 brood sows that are being fed one 
p &gt;und of ground corn each per day, mixed with all the 
chopped alfalfa they will eat, fed wet, and their condition 
i^ surely as satisfactory as any breeder could wish. 

IN CONCLUSION 

First, we do not believe hogs will thrive on alfalfa hay 
alone, nor do we think it pays to expect young pigs are 
going to do well on alfalfa pasture only. 

Second, we do believe that we can turn shoats on an 
alfalfa pasture in the spring and with one pound of corn 
per head per day make a gain of £ to 3 of a pound per 
day, or from 125 to 150 lbs. during the 6 months grazing 
season, which is making pork at a low cost. 

Third, we also believe from experiments we have made, 
that by chopping alfalfa hay (this must be good hay. </seg>

            <seg id="p162">

) 

where the leaves have been preserved) and mixing this 
with ground corn, at the rate of about one pound of corn 
to five or six pounds of alfalfa, that it will make a ration 
that will carry stock hogs over the winter as satisfactory 
to the owner as the ordinary ration, mostly of corn at k 
the cost, and the animal will be in better condition to </seg>
