ADDRESS OK THE PRESIDENT. Hon. K. M. I'ollni-d. Nehauka. Neb, Ladies and Gentlemen of the Horticultural Society: I am slml U nee so many of yt u here this morning. Our society has been growing for a good many years. One of its chief p-.irposes has been to give out information in a general wa&gt; concerning fruit and its development in the state. During the past year it was thought by the Hoard Directors of the society that perhaps it would be well for the society to take up a little different line of work, and the reason for that &lt;le - cialon wan due to the fact that those of us who had been engaged in this propaganda of education began to realize that here in eastern Ne- braska we have conditions that were especially adapted to the gr of fruit. We discovered that we had a peculiarity of soil her climate, that is in the region along the Missouri river, running fr Sioux City clear down to almost St. Joe. Missouri, on either bank of thf river, a soil that was not surpassed by any soil any for the growing of fruit Perhaps I might say just a word concerning that before I take u a discussion of details. Soil experts tell us that we have in this regior the loess type of soil only found in a few places in the world place is in China, another is in Germany, and there it is along th river Rhine, whii h has the highest type of commercial development any place in the uorld. Another section where this soil is located is ii southern Illinois, in Calhoun county, which is the great apple regioc of Illinois. Another place is in the region I have described. When we came to realize the great possibilities that were in store for the fruit business in this state, this last year the board thought it would be well to direct the attention of the society along the line of development, or the spreading of definite specific information relating to the possibih ties of this particular area. I do not mean by that that apples and other fruits cannot be raised further back from the river, because all of us know that is not the case, but we did realize we had a peculiar condition here along the river that was especially adapted to the grow - ing of fruit, and it seemed to us that perhaps it was within the proper scope of this society to take up this peculiar region and give it a little 22 </seg>
            <seg id="p024">NEBRASKA APPLES CRIMES GOLDEN JOHNATHAN WINESAP OElTcIOVJS BEN DAVIS VARIETIES THAT REACH PERFECTION • IN THE MISSOURI RIVER VALLEY • </seg>
            <seg id="p025">23 special attention. Consequently we took up with the University au - thorities the question of establishing through the University Experi - ment Station what might be termed a model orchard, or I might more properly say a model fruit farm, on which would be grown all the fraits that are especially adapted to this region, and that that orchard should be located in the center, as far as possible, of this peculiar region, with the idea of making out of it a model fruit farm; a farm located in the midst of this region where those who were interested in entering upon the growing of fruit could go and secure definite and reliable data as to the varieties of fruit best adapted there and the proper methods of culture. We did this, and found a very ready re - sponse to our suggestion. Professor Howard, the head of the depart - ment of horticulture, was very anxious that this be done, and assisted very materially. We discovered, however, in order to bring this about, it would necessary to secure an appropriation from the legislature for the [iiirchase of a small tract where this model fruit farm could be created Vs you all are aware, the last legislature was a great legislature for nd they turned a deaf ear to every suggestion that looked the expenditure of the state funds. The result was that we failed re the desired appropriation and the model fruit farm was lost. Then we went further, and took up with the head of the department the question of furnishing an expert orchardist, a man who had been trained in the scientific side of fruit culture, a man who understood the business from the time of the planting of the little tree until it grew o maturity and the fruit was harvested and packed and placed upon he market. Again we met with a willing response, and we have the issurance during the coining year from the department that they will urnish us such a man who will go into the field and go upon the farm nd give the grower the necessary information that will enable him to ike care of his fruit. Now we have a peculiar situation that to my mind demands some such action, as your Board of Directors outlined. We have, without any luestion, as I suggested a moment ago, a peculiar region here that is adapted to the growing of fruit, and we have also found out that those engaged in this business are subject to a great many difficulties. We have a great many pests which are not only attacking the fruit but are attacking the orchards, and this department seems to be in a posi - tion to tell us what to do about this and how to attack them, and under proper treatment these diseases can be suppressed, and then, when it comes to the care of the fruit and the spraying of our orchards, we find that of all the men in this region of the state who are spraying a very, very small per cent of them are able, even where this spray Is given to the trees, to harvest clean fruit. The trouble seems to lie in the fact that there is a general lack of accurate information as to how to care for an orchard in order to produce this clean fruit. Now your Board of Directors thought that the University, through its Experiment </seg>
            <seg id="p026">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 24 Eon, should place a man in the field in this region where he could i in direct contact with the grower and give him the specific in - formation necessary to enable him to grow better fruit. We thought that was a proper work for the society to take up, and for that reason we undertook the two features I have suggested and met with failure in one, but in the other we hare met with the promise of relief. And in the coming season, as I have suggested, we will have an expert fruit man in the field. Now I don't care to take up your time this morning with any fur - ther discussion of any branch of horticulture excepting that I want to say this: This is the last time, or rather this is the last meeting of the society that I will appear as its president, and I do hope that the pro - gram started this year, even in such a small way and accomplishing as little as we have, — I do hope that the new directors and the new board that is selected here tomorrow will carry on this work and co-operate earnestly with the University and insist that the growers of fruit will be given relief, in order that we may get the best out of the wonderful possibilities we have along the river. And I hope also that the new board will take the necessary steps to present this matter to the oomiiu - legislature and that that body can be prevailed upon to purchase a tract of land where this model farm that I have described can be created, in order that it may be an example to all those who care to enter into the fruit business. And now. gentlemen, I thank you Discussion. The next thing on the program is a presentation of the horticultural resources of Nebraska by Dr. George E. Condra of the University of Nebraska. The professor does not seem to be here, and if there is any - one who has any remarks to make along the plan adopted during the past year I am sure the board will be very jtlad to receive these sugges - tions, or criticisms, as they may be. (An observer, not a member: i We have in the state of Nebraska a farmers' organization known as the Nebraska Farmers' Congress, which is working for your interest along legislative lines as well as productive lines. Each fanners' organization is entitled to ten dele - gates, and our associations are held at Omaha annually, or at which - ever city it is desired. At the last session your organization had ten delegates appointed, but, owing to the fact of the busy season, some of them did not come out. These sessions took up and paid particular attention to distribution as well as production. At the last session we had with us the Hon. Charles Brand, the chief of the Bureau of Mar - kets and Marketing at Washington, who gave some very interesting facts about the problems of distribution in the United States, and who also paid particular attention to the fact that Nebraska had one of the most successful co-operative organizations, known as the Central Fruit Growers' Association.

All delegates have voting power in that congress, and all farmers and peo - ple interested in agriculture ape entitled to membership. We are glad to have them there and they can take part in the discussions, and all paid members are voting delegates. The President: I see that Dr. Condra is not here and I do not feel that we can delay our proceedings any longer, so I will announce the next subject on the program. It seems that Mr. Meyer is also tardy this morning. I feel that Dr. Condra won't be here for a few minutes. He told me he had a lecture before a class at the University between ten and eleven and he was very anxious to get his exhibition on either before ten o'clock or after eleven o'clock, and we were so late in coming to order that I imagine he is in the midst of his lecture at the Univer - sity at this time. Mr. Keyser: I hope that those members who are on the program will be in soon, but I would like personally to see some discussion here on the point that you made, and that is in regard to the function of the society. As one interested in the society, and one of the directors. I think here is the place to get some ideas. Now, is it a proper thing for the State Horticultural Society to put forth any special effort and put a little of its state funds into a movement and development in any special section of the state of Nebraska? If not, why not? Have we as a state society, who are supported by an appropriation from the legislature and who are supposed to spread our influence out all over the state, have we such a right? Personally I am interested in the development of eastern Nebraska, in this fruit section. Is it a proper function of a state society to put some special effort into this special territory along the river there? If it is, we want to encourage that, and if it in not, we do not want to be criticised for it. The President: We are deviating slightly from the traditional pur - pose of the society, and that is one of the purposes I have in bringing this up is to bring out a discussion upon this subject. Mr. Titus: Of course, I live in the eastern part of the state and I am interested too. I happen to be put on a committee to help work out this plan by the association that was held at Brownville last weak. This committee was also instructed to interest you in it. Now, I see that you are already interested in it. I do not know as we can spend any of our money to appropriate for a certain specific thing, but the legislature certainly could, and they have other experiment stations in other parts of the state. Why are we not entitled to them? The President: Has anyone else anything to suggest? Mr. Porter: As an onlooker 1 want to say just a word along the lines that has just been brought up, that is in regard to whether or not when an appropriation is made from the state, which necessarily </seg>
            <seg id="p028">26 comes from the general fund of all parties and all sections, it is ad - visable to use that in some specific locality. I have no interest in any particular locality in the state any more than I have in the state as a whole, but I would say, unquestionably, yes. 1 remember very well as a member of the legislature a long, long time ago when we made an appropriation to establish experiment stations at public expense. For what? Why the experiment with dry farming. Why? Because it applied to a part of the state where they needed that. Now it seems to me it would be a mark of idiocy to establish a model fruit farm out in the sand-hills, because that is not the part of the state where they raise fruit. It would be the height of folly to spend the money appro - priated by the legislature to the Horticultural Society in trying to establish experimental stations in parts of the state not adapted to fruit. The President: I would like to make just one further observation unless someone else cares to discuss it; if they do, of course I will yield KMr. von Forell: I don't know who yet is able to determine where can or where we cannot grow fruit in the state of Nebraska, and especially where we cannot grow it. I know in Scotts Bluff county they say it could not be grown. But I don't believe a better quality of apple has been grown any place than in Scotts Bluff county. I don't believe that I have ever seen a better exhibit than I have seen in Morrill and Garden and Scotts Bluff counties. The same is true of cherries and raspberries and blackberries and blueberries and dewberries as of apples. I don't know how expensive the model fruit farm would be, but I do know that several years ago when we asked for an experiment station, and we wanted to memorialize the legislature in asking for it. we asked for an appropriation for growing small fruit, such as appies. and fruit tree growing, etc. We have not gone into that extensively in our experiment station, and it has not been encouraged, and yet w - have orchards in that region that have for ten or fifteen years produced apples and cherries and berries and fruits with the usual pioneer caiv that they have received. It seems to me that inasmuch as a number or years ago it was thought that the northwest part of Nebraska could not grow apples, and that the only place that could grow them was in Richardson county and the southeastern Nebraska counties, and since it has been demonstrated that the northwest part of the state is able to grow them and is a good growing section, then I think the question of where we can't grow fruit in the state of Nebraska and where these stations for experiments should bo. located is one that anyone can answer. I don't believe that the apple growing and fruit growing power is entirely monopolized in the eastern part of the state, and I believe that we have the power to grow fruits out there. Mr. Van Houten: In Iowa we have been through years of expe - rience, even ahead of you, and while I have been interested in the discussion that has been going on, I think that the last speaker, while he is all right as far as experimental work is concerned, yet he should </seg>
            <seg id="p029">27 remember that experimental work is entirely different from the thing proposed by this society. This society has proposed to put out a model orchard, which is not an experiment, but for the purpose of demonstrat - ing the best methods of pruning and caring for fruit, etc. If that is to be a success, it must be where experiments have ceased. That farm should be placed somewhere on the east side. The experimental work should be carried on all over the state, but the model farm should be carried on where it would be a success. We don't know whether it would be a success if located elsewhere than in the eastern part of the state. Speaking of the loess soil along the Missouri river, we have come to the conclusion in Iowa that while we can raise fruit in any and every county in the state, that when a man talks about commercial fruit growing, we say to him, to go along the western part of the state, in that peculiar soil where it has proper drainage and air drainage and • •verything to insure success in commercial fruit growing. We have come to the point in western Iowa where our experiment work has ceased. Our demonstration work has also passed the line of experi - mentation, and it has come down to the line of demonstrating facts that everybody should know, and your model farm, when located, should be located where the best results could be obtained. We have come to the conclusion in our experiment work — our experiment work has been in a large part unprofitable from a commercial side, bat it has been profitable in sifting out the varieties, and where certain fruit should be planted. We have learned that it is a costly work to help these localities that need it, and our demonstration work therefore follows our experiment work. We are demonstrating right along the line suggested by your president, and I think that is the right way. But if you should locate it where the experimental work is going on and where demonstration work is not in any proper state of develop - ment, then it might tend to discourage rather than to encourage and construct. (Gentleman from Scotts Bluff County:) I want to say a word. I am from the western part of the state, that part of the country that Mr. von Forell has spoken of, and I think he missed a little of the idea of the president. We people out in the western part of the state are just as willing as anybody that you ever saw to have that money spent, where it should be spent, down in this part of the country. We don't want any model fruit farm out there, because it is an experiment with us, and if we are to pay part of the taxes, we will say to you that we are mighty glad to have it spent down here. All I want to say is that we are glad to have the money spent where it should be spent and ire would like to have your help sometime when we have something we can do, as we know in this case that you have something that you can do. The President: I want to say, for fear that a misapprehension may go out, the suggestion that I made in regard to establishing a </seg>
            <seg id="p030">28 model fruit farm in the eastern part of the state did not contemplate the dropping of other investigational and experimental work in other parts of the state, not at all. But we have a peculiar condition down there, as I suggested, where we know that certain things can be done. We know that fruit can be grown and grown successfully. Fruit grow - ing has passed beyond the experimental stage; but we have also found out this, that where we know we can grow just as good fruit and a little better, as we think, than anywhere else in the whole world, yet we are met with this condition: We find that hundreds of men who are growing fruit in that region do not know how to take care of it, and the result is when harvest time comes we have nothing but a little wormy, scabby bunch of apples which are almost worthless when they go on the market. I had occasion to go out into the state along about harvest time and people identified me with the horticultural interests of this state, and I had this question put to me: "Why is it, Mr. Pol - lard, with the quality of apples that you grow down in the southeastern part of the state, thousands and thousands of apples rot on the ground and we go hungry?" Now that is the situation, that we do not know how to take care of them. Now my proposition is, the whole state is interested in having this good fruit down here properly taken care of, so that when winter time comes on the people all over the whole state can have the benefit of that, and it was that reason that prompted the Board of Directors to do this so that we could all take advantage of this proposition. The President: Dr. Condra of the State Conservation and Soil Survey has just come in and will address us on the subject "The Horti - cultural Resources of Nebraska." Dr. Condra will illustrate his talk with moving picture films showing the apple industry of the state. This is an important subject and we will all be glad to hear from Dr Condra. THE HOKTICUL.TLKAI- KKSOl RCKS OK M-ltl;\&gt;h\ By Dr. G. E. Condra, Director, State. Conservation ami Soil Snrvej Mr. Chairman, Ladies and Gentlemen: I am a little embarrassed in attempting to speak before this organization. You know so much about technical horticulture and most of my experience is in other lines. We have a few points in common, however, in the field of survey and conservation. In conservation we try to survey a situation with the purpose of determining the factors favoring success or failure, hoping to find wherein things can be improved. For several years past I have beeu wondering and inquiring about our fruits. The county surveys by state and federal departments, with which I am connected, have given some light on the subject. This has become the basis for certain conclusions. Let me point out a few observations made on a rather lengthy pilgrim - age in the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p031">29 We have been impressed with the physical and biological diversity of Nebraska. There are more than sixty soils in the state. The land surface lies between about 820 feet and 5,350 feet in elevation and is expressed in many forms of topography, smooth to rough. The rainfall decreases from 33 inches in the southeast to about 16 inches at the western border. There are notable differences in wind velocity and length of growing seasons. The native wild life expresses the condi - tions of climate, of soil, and of exposure. It was fashioned by such for ages and should afford in the way of suggestion something of value to horticulturists. The broad field of agriculture has gained a great deal from this department of nature and you might profit by their expe - rience. There are valuable lessons and horticultural resources In the wild life. This state grows a profusion of wild flowers. Do you know how they come and go by seasons in the ravines and woodlands of the eastern counties, or in the sand-hills, or on the table lands and in Wild Cat Range and Pine Ridge? Clematis grows wild in several western canyons, as do also blue bells, the asters, monarda and mariposa lily. Do you remember Echinacea of the prairie? It spells "rich man, beg - gar man, thief," etc., for us, but had use for the treatment of snake - bite and for other purposes among the Indians. This plant deserves the attention of horticulturists. One might give a long list of useful prairie land species, which have been nearly destroyed in Nebraska. Our purpose in this is not to argue for the primitive, but to be under - stood as favoring a thoughtful consideration of nature's useful and promising products, and the lessons gained therefrom. Dr. Bessey, whom you all loved, was deeply interested in these things. We have also been impressed with the great variety and wide dis - tribution of wild fruits in Nebraska. There are strawberries, rasp - berries, blackberries, currants, the Juneberry, gooseberries, grapes, sand-cherry, buffalo-berry, choke-cherry, plum and crab-apple. These had considerable importance in pioneer days and are used to some ex - tent at this time. Some member of your society can well afford to work up this chapter in the horticulture of pioneer days. It should be done now while there are with us enough old settlers to recite the story- Formerly the chief source of jams, jellies, preserves and fruit was in these wild fruits. Some fruits were dried for winter use. The remaining wild fruit is most common in the sand-hills and high plains areas. Here one sees mostly the sand-cherry, buffalo-berry, cur - rants, choke-cherry, and plum. The sand-cherry (Prunus besseyi) should be of interest to you at this time. Prof. L. H. Bailey named this species for Dr. Bessey several years ago. The plant is very common in the sand-hills. It is a delicate plant with white flowers and dark colored fruit. A few years ago the University tried to improve the fruit of this plant by hybridization. The result was not very favorable. It would seem, however, that the research should be renewed and ex - tended. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">30 The buffalo-berry is our most plentiful wild fruit. It occurs gen - erally along the Platte and is common in many valleys in the western counties. The plant has olive colored leaves and small red fruits, resembling the currant. This fruit is gathered at about the time of frost and used for jams and jellies. Currants, yellowish and black, occur on the rough land of western Nebraska and at places in the sand - hills. The choke-cherry is mostly in canyons. Plums are widely dis - tributed but have not reached a condition of good fruitage within re - cent years. Grapes, though formerly plentiful along the ravines, canyons and on some trunk valleys, have been largely destroyed by cattle. The crab-apple grew in the southeastern counties and as far northwest as Holt county. It now has practically no importance. These wild fruits have a great deal of value to the state in one way. They show what was done by nature unassisted, and herein we are assured that Nebraska is naturally a fruit state. Horticulture has proved the same thing. You husband plants vastly superior in certain respects to anything in the realm of wild life, yet there may be a deeper geographic relation than we suppose between nature's things and those of a similar kind but cultivated. If this is true, the facts in the dis - tribution and growth of wild fruits should have value in shaping the state's development in this branch of horticulture. Such knowledge, if well determined and organized, would be a resource. Here is a prac - tical subject for further research. Ladies and gentlemen, I do not reel qualified to discuss the whole field of horticultural resources. This is because of a lack of knowl - edge in these departments and time would not permit such if we had the knowledge. I am informed by several persons competent to judge, that floriculture is rapidly advancing in the state. Our flowers are shipped widely over the United States. The vegetable resources are in good hands, partly because they have received more support from the state and federal government than has been the case with most de - velopments in your line. Our state v/ill, without doubt, beceme of higher rank in growing potatoes, beans, watermelons, muskmelons, and the various garden products. The tendency now seems to be toward more extensive gardening near cities and towns. Just what can be done to supplement this production in the way of preserving by - canning and other processes has not been worked out very definitely. The small fruits do well, but ha\p not assumed commercial impor - tance. The grape industry, as we view it, is destined to become a factor in state development. The Concord prevails as the market variety, though there are a number of varieties which are grown, and success - fully so. Some of the steep slope land along the Missouri and devoted to vineyards is giving large returns. We found several such vineyards in the vicinity of Omaha and could give examples at a number of other point*. The peach industry seems to be in a bad way. Splendid successes were obtained a few years ago, then freezing killed most of the trees </seg>
            <seg id="p033">Grape culture in Nebraska is one of the State's leading fruit industries. </seg>
            <seg id="p034">HORTICULTURAL RESOURCES OF NEBRASKA 31 in the larger plantings. This industry may be rejuvenated under com - petent leadership, but I am not in a position to judge positively in this matter. It seems that the apple industry shows greatest promise, mainly id the field of commercial orcharding. Home orcharding is in a bad way. We see everywhere abandoned orchards where trees have become weeds. Everything evidences neglect. These orchards would cause the person not acquainted with the possibilties to conclude that apples are a failure in Nebraska. The fact of the matter is that our people have turned largely to the raising of wheat, corn, alfalfa, hogs and cattle. They have committed a positive sin of omission in their neglect of orchards. This neglect has been principally in a lack of cultivation, pruning and spraying. As a result the fruit, nearly always of poor quality, becomes windfall, rots on the ground or becomes the feed of hogs and cattle. Evidently, positive steps should be taken by the state to eliminate this very undesirable condition, because such infested and infected weed-trees are a menace to the apple Industry. Apples grow in practically all parts of Nebraska. Let me assure you that I have seen good apples grown in nearly every county in the state. There has been too great an effort, however, to carry a few of the leading varieties of the southeast to all parts of the state. It may - be that some nurserymen, principally from other states, have been the cause for this condition. The mistake should not be continued. With - out doubt your society has contributed largely to state development in determining the varieties of apples best suited to the different districts. This good work and service should go on and be extended to all plant- ers. We have seen good apples at mouths of canyons in Pine Ridge, in the North Platte valley, in the South Platte valley, on the loess plains, and in the northeastern part of the state, but most of them were in the eastern and southeastern counties not far from the Missiuri. &lt; 'onuiK-ri ial Orcharding.— -We are convinced and positively so that Nebraska has a promising future in commercial apple orcharding. This conclusion is based on field inquiry and the success of orchardmen. It is a duty of my department to investigate and report upon the sale of foreign lands in Nebraska. Fruit land is included. This calls for much work. We examine the showing of a person or company, or when necessary send someone for a field examination. This has brought us to leading fruit districts of other states, and has given opportunity to determine the factors in orchard development. We found many proj - ects in the northwest promoted without a chance of success. A very prominent orchardist assured me that not one-half of the promoted apple projects in that country could succeed. We learned also that production and marketing are more highly standardized in the apple areas of the northwest than in Nebraska. Their experience in this respect should be studied by Nebraskans for the purpose of making improvement here. Eastern Nebraska, along the Missouri river, has a combination of </seg>
            <seg id="p035">32 conditions which cannot be equalled in any other place in our country. unless it is in the adjacent areas of Iowa, Kansas and Missouri. The climate, soil and market conditions make an admirable combination. Fruit can be grown cheaply without the expense of irrigation. The soil is deep, loose textured and fertile and in this respect better suited for apple growing than that of any other area of our country. Our district is close to good markets, and favored with a short haul and low freight rate as compared with the long haul and high rates of the northwest. As a matter of fact, it seems that we are more favored than is generally supposed. Then, I want to mention another point. It relates to promotion and land values. Our state prevents the unwanton promotion of projects and I assure you that the departments having this in charge will con - demn orchard projects which may be promoted by unscrupulous per - sons to secure money for themselves rather than for the purpose of developing the apple industry and taking a legitimate return. To date our record is clear. Certain competent and well organized companies are organizing, planting and developing orchards. Our land values are low compared with those of the boomed areas. It would be possible to block out an orchard of considerable size at a cost of from $80 to $200 per acre. In doing this certain factors should be observed, namely, the lay of the land, and the distance from railroad and town affecting hauling and labor. As commercial orcharding further de - velops in southeastern Nebraska, and as the success becomes more evi - dent, our people will tend to place their investments here rather than in a far away place. Your success will in this respect assist in conserv - ing another important phase of industry. The success in commercial orcharding attained at places would evidence the possibilities which we would expect to be attained in the future. We have visited most of Nebraska's large orchards and ob - served the processes in apple growing. Among the factors most evi - dent are: (1) selection of soil; (2) selection of varieties; (3) the man - agement; (4) planting, cultivation and fertilization; (5) pruning; (6i spraying; (7) grading; (8) marketing. Most of these factors and processes have been the subjects of study by your society, yet the con - ditions observed in the field would cause one to think that not every commercial orchardist has exerted the necessary thought and care In these matters. Spraying two to four times a year, according to the needs, is positively necessary if good fruit is to result, and I believe that the time will come when a penalty will be placed on wormy and scabby apples in Nebraska. Pruning is likewise necessary, for it has much to do with the size, color and yield of fruit. Cultivation and fertilization are badly neglected, and this should not be, because culti - vation conserves soil moisture which relates to the size and quality of the fruit. Fertilization with barnyard manure and nitrates adds the only deficient ingredient lacking in the fruit land soils. It will pay you to give more thought to this matter. Such fertilization will increase </seg>
            <seg id="p036">33 the size of the apples and you know that one of the great drawbacks is found in this condition. Many of the apples are too small, especially during the dry years. Then the fruit, in case the growth Is prolonged by rains, remains on the trees perhaps until frosted. This does not happen every year, however. I am not sure about the success of smudges and artificial heaters. The Weavers, Pollards and others have within recent years done much to improve the grading and marketing of apples. Your fruit as - sociation is said to exist in part for this purpose. I am convinced that herein is a most important factor in the development of apple orchard - ing at this time. Such grading and marketing could be greatly pro - moted if some one would prepare data on the same for use in the schools Teachers know about the grades of eiiss, potatoes, cattle and many other agricultural products, but not much about apples. I have failed to mention an important factor. It relates to the quality of the Nebraska apple. One of the qualities possessed in com - mon by the leading varieties is that they can be marketed at the time when there is an advantage in the big markets. The second is that apples, under proper management, produce more regularly here than in most places where the water supply is not controlled by irrigation and in fact we do nearly as well in this respect as some of the irrigated districts. Third, we have a definite advantage in the flavor quality, and some advantage in color, size, picking and storage qualities. SurresMful Hurl irult urisls. —The failures in apple growing in Ne - braska have been caused mostly by bad management. This is most noticeable with home orchards. There is practically no cases of per - manent failure under competent management. We see in this one of our principal horticultural resources. The state has at this time the accumulated experience of so many who have succeeded. This expe - rience is of great value. We are thinking just now of such men as the Pollards, Marshall*, Shuberts, Youngers, Barnard, Keyser, Christie and the Weavers. These and others built well in Nebraska, perhaps better than they may think. • Not long since while visiting one of the largest orchards in the state I had the privilege of talking with a man who had been employed there for twenty-five years. This man had given the best of his life to the task of growing good fruit. He had read, thought and worked, all of which was shown in the condition of the orchard and in the quality of the fruit. It would seem that the owners of commercial orchards should endeavor more than in the past to develop competent orchard - ists. by which is meant the men who actually spray, prune and care for the trees and fruit. Much of this labor could be trained in part at the Agricultural College in co-operation with you. Then, too, among the best orehardists of the state are those who have been raised among the trees and whose fathers were orchardists. Nebraska has a one - sided agriculture. It might be called the commercial raw. There is need for specialization, which can be done best by families and over •&gt; </seg>
            <seg id="p037">34 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY long periods. This would give us families of historic prominence in orcharding. It would give to the state the accumulated experience of these families and would also conserve the ability of our soil to feed the people. Let me give you an example of this. A few years ago while visiting with Mr. Isaac Pollard in his vineyards and orchards I learned the spirit of this man. Mr. Pollard loves living things, includ - ing trees. He said, while we were in the orchard, that he has a very close connection with the life of his trees; that some of the trees get sick and that he gives them attention and feels that they are thankful for this service. At a later time I heard Mr. Pollard say before a state meeting of farmers: "I am growing old and nearly blind. I like to sit under my trees and think about their life." This condition of things, my friends, is quite unlike that experienced by many aged persons. It must be comforting to Mr. Pollard and others to have such relations with the work they have done. Should it not be said that he who grows a flower or produces good fruit is a good Nebraskan? But should we not also realize that continued effort along this line makes good families, useful citizens and a better Nebraska? We conclude, therefore, that one of the resources of our state is orchardists who grow good fruit. Summary Conclusion. Reviewing the foregoing discussion I » say that— 1. Nebraska is naturally a fruit-growing state 2. The physical conditions, being varied, promote j;reat tli\ers in fruit development. 3. Native fruits, remaining in some parts of the state, should the objects of technical study in order to gain knowledge for use shaping the distribution of cultivated fruits. 4. Grape growing should assume greater commercial importHn especially on the steep slope lands along the Missouri. 5. Many farm apple orchards have failed because of neglect 6. Commercial apple orcharding in the eastern and southeastern counties is a success and should be greatly extended under competent management. 7. The fraudulent promoter of fruit lands must be kept out Nebraska. 8. The apple industry is best conserved through long periods of years and by generations of successful growers in families devoted to the purpose. Such a line of development, if more generally carried out, would give better citizens and a greater Nebraska. The President: The subject "The Loess Soils of Nebraska and Their Relation to Fruit Raising" was to be discussed by Mr. Meyer, but owing to his being called to a southern state was unable to be with us Dr. Condra has kindly consented to give us a short talk on this subject. </seg>
            <seg id="p038">35 THK LOKSS SOILS OF NEBRASKA AND THEIR RELATION TO FRVIT RAISING. By Dr. G. E. Condra. Director, Nebraska Conservation and Soil Survey. Ladies and Gentlemen: I am glad for the opportunity to discuss this subject with you. Many people engaged in horticulture are talk - ing about the loess soil, meaning perhaps one kind, whereas our survey maps show four leading types of such soil, and others of minor impor - tance. You know what is meant by loess. It is well shown in the bluffs along the Platte and Missouri and in cuts at Nebraska City, Platts - mouth and Omaha. Similar materials occur on the high terraces of the principal valleys and on the well known loess plains and hills where they are called "clay" by farmers and well drillers. Loess is principally silt, which is a little finer grained than clay. It contains some clay, fine sand and sand, and, at places, small concre - tions. It is massive in appearance, as shown on the face of bluffs and excavations. The color, usually buff, varies some, due to the presence of varying amounts of iron oxide and lime. Both these act as a weak inent and stain and form small concretions. The loess deposit serves to mark and name one of the well known soil regions of the state. It occupies much of the southeastern half of Nebraska and extends into Iowa, Kansas and Missouri. The region is divided into the following divisions and types of land: 1. Loess Plains. The largest area of these nearly level plains is south of the Platte, extending from the vicinity of Holdrege to and beyond David City. Smaller plains of this kind occur In various east - ern bounties. 2. Loess and Drift Hills. These were eroded from the original loess plain which extended over the southeastern half of Nebraska and parts of Iowa. Kansas and Missouri. Loess hills are well shown In Wayne. Thurston and other northeastern counties. Drift hills occur in Lancaster, Pawnee. Cass and other southeastern counties where erosion has extended into the drift. I. Loess Bluffs. These are places in the valleys made principally by streams cutting against the hilly upland. Bluff faces are due in part to landslides. The best known bluffs are along the Missouri and Platte. 4. Loess Canyon Areas. These are well shown in Lincoln, Hayes and Frontier counties. 5. Loess Terraces. These are benches or flat areas along the sides of valleys, but higher than the flood plains. Such terraces are well shown in the Platte, Elkhorn, Logan, Salt creek and Republican val - leys. They are capped with loess and underlain by sand and gravel. They are distinct from the flood plain and alluvium proper. There are four kinds of loess in Nebraska. Though resembling each </seg>
            <seg id="p039">36 other in general appearance, they differ in age and origin. We classify them as follows: 1. Plains Loess. This occurs in the loess plains, as a cap tor ihe hills in the Loess Hills Area and as part of the deposit of the bluff land. 2. Terrace Loess. This caps the terraces of the principal valleys. It is much younger than the plains loess. Some would not call this loess. 3. Bluff Land Loess. This is best developed along the Missouri and Platte and extends some distance out on the hills. The material is mixed with uneroded plains loess. Some of the bluff land loess is with - out doubt a dust deposit blown from the valley floors. 4. Drift Loess. By this we mean the loess like soil and subsoil weathered from Kansas Drift in some of the southeastern counties where the loess plains deposit has been eroded away. Some of the original plains loess has been incorporated with this drift loess. The drift loess is found in small patches associated with drift soils proper. The Loess Soils. — The four leading types of loess soil are known as the Grundy silt loam, the Marshall silt loam, the Knox silt loam and the Waukesha silt loam. Another type derived principally from drift material, but containing more or less of loess material, is called the Carrington silt loam. A type developed in the small basins occurring on the loess plains and terraces is called the Scott silt loam. Soil Surveys in the Loess Region- — The soil surveys of counties art made through the co-operation of the State Conservation and Soil Sur - vey and the United States Bureau of Soils They show well the loess types, and I do not hesitate to say that we have endeavored to ronipleu the counties along the Missouri as rapidly as possible because of then importance in fruit growing. Every county from Kansas to Thirrstoii county has been finshed except Burt county. Sarpy county was sur - veyed several years ago when the work was done with little detail Otoe, though better, is not as accurate as we would like. Wa believt that you will be pleased with the reports on Cass, Nemaha, Kirhardson Douglas and Thurston counties. These are all available except th* Richardson county report which will be published soon. Farther west we have mapped Lancaster, Polk, Seward. Saunders, Dawes and Scotts Bluff counties and expect to reach Fillmore. Hall, Dodge, Kimball and Box Butte counties this .ear. You should not place very much confidence in the Lancaster county report because it was made several years ago. The reports enumerated cover a consid - erable part of the loess region of Nebraska. Dawes, Box Butte. Scotts Bluff and Kimball counties are in the High Plains Region. I have given this list for your reference. The reports can be secured from the United States Bureau of Soils free upon request as long as they remain in stock. It has been necessary to change a few of the soil names during the progress of the surveys. Let me point out the changes. The term, </seg>
            <seg id="p040">LOESS SOILS OF NEBRASKA 37 Miami ailt loam, as used in the Sarpy County Report, has been discon - tinued. This soil is now mapped as Marshall silt loam and Knox silt loam. Until this year we have used the name Marshall ailt loam to denote two soils, one on hilly land in which the subsoil is compara - tively mellow, and the other on flat land In which the subsoil is heavy and compact. The flat land soil of this kind will be called Grundy silt loam in the future. The names Shelby silt loam and Carrington silt loam stand for practically the same thing. These corrections are pointed out because some may have reports of adjacent counties in which a given soil is mapped and described under two names, as is the case in Otoe and Cass counties. I will now describe the principal types of loess soils. The descrip - tions here given are in most respects similar to those published in our county reports. They will give additional information on the relations of these soils to fruit growing. Grundy Silt Loam. — This, as has been shown, is the prevailing type on the loess plains where the subsoil is quite heavy. The Grundy silt loam is dark brown to nearly black heavy silt loam 10 to 15 inches deep. The average depth is about 12 inches. The surface soil is high in organic matter content. The upper part of the subsoil is a silty clay or clay and is compact, hard and tough. Frequently it is mottled with light brown. The change from soil to subsoil is abrupt. The upper part of the subsoil is usually called "hard pan" by farmers. At a depth of 20 to 30 inches the subsoil changes into a yellowish gray or pale yellow silty clay lighter in texture than the upper subsoil. The lower subsoil is highly calcareous, the lime existing principally in the form of concretions. It is blotched with iron stains and below the three-foot section the color changes to light gray. This type has great value in the state in the production of wheat, corn, oats, and alfalfa. It Is not so well suited for fruit as other loess soils we will describe later. One of the drawbacks is the hard-pan and Its relation to drouths. The principal problem in the agriculture of this type is to make the soil more drouth resistant. This condition cannot be remedied permanently without deep subsolling. A very good description of this type will be found in the forthcoming report of the soil survey of Gage county. The Scott silt loam and the Scott silty clay loam are two types of limited distribution occurring in small basins on the loess plains and high terraces and modifying the distribution of the Grundy silt loam. They have practically no value in fruit growing. Marshall Silt Loam. This type was developed on the plains loess through the processes of erosion and weathering. It occurs in the moat typical conditions on the loess hills which have their largest distribu - tion in the northeastern counties and on the areas bordering and as - sociated with the drift hills of the southeastern counties. The soil consists of a dark brown to black heavy silt loam 6 to 15 inches. It is high in organic matter and has a smooth, relrety feel. </seg>
            <seg id="p041">38 The subsoil consists of yellowish brown slightly more compact heavy silty loam. Below the three-foot section light gray mottlings and reddish stains are encountered. The change from surface to subsoil is gradual, the intermediate layer, two or three inches thick, being of brownish color. The subsoil is highly calcareous, the lime existing in the form of concretions. Borings and cuts made in this type show that the section below the three-foot level is yellowish gray, more or less blotched with iron stain. The subsoil grades gradually into unmodified loess. In general the subsoil of the Marshall silt loam is loose and open textured. This con - dition changes with distance from the Missouri river. Passing west - ward the compactness of the upper subsoil is gradually increased. The Marshall silt loam, on account of its rolling topography, is subject to considerable erosion. This destructive agency would be much greater in its effect if the soil did not have an open texture, ca - pable of absorbing most of the rainfall. \t times of \ery heavy rainfall the run-off is sufficient to gully the soil, especially where the slopes are steep. This erosion can be prevented by deep plowing and by maintain - ing protective vegetation. There is a limit, however, beyond which deep plowing would be more harmful than helpful. It is where the hill slopes are steep, causing slipping and slumping of the loosened soil. Farmers should make more use of straw brush in preventing erosion. The surface soil of the Marshall silt loam is greatly reduced in thick - ness because of erosion. This condition is most noticeable on steep hill slopes At such places the subsoil becomes of lighter color, rep - resenting a stage in the development of what is known as the Knox silt loam. The surface soil is thickest in the presence of protective vegetation and on the lower slopes. This type was originally covered with a thick growth of prairie grasses and timber. On account of its silty and stone free nature, it is easily handled. Where the slopes are steep the operation of farm implements is difficult. The soil is easy to handle under a variation of moisture conditions, but should not be plowed when too wet. The land responds readily to fertilization with barnyard manure and could be improved for some purposes by the use of nitrates. As a rule no commercial fertilizers are used on this type. The soil ingredients are present in an admirable combination, making this an usually fertile soil. The humus content is reduced by erosion but can be restored by the use of barnyard manure and the growing of leguminous crops. The Marshall silt loam is without doubt our best soil for apple growing. The topography is not too rough for the operation of plant- Ing, cultivation and marketing. There is a high degree of tertility and the open structure permits the development of good root systems. It is an upland soil with good air drainage and comparatively free from frost. The water content is evenly distributed in the soil and subsoil, making a condition much better than occurs in bottom land soils. Much of the type is now under cultivation, growing the crops popular </seg>
            <seg id="p042">View of a cut in Missouri River Bluffs. Shows the great depth of BlulT Loess soil which is especially adapted for fruit growing. </seg>
            <seg id="p043">39 with fanners. This is one reason, as we see it, why more fruit is not grown on this soil. Land values on the Marshall silt loam range from $80 to $200 per acre, depending on topography, location and improvements. The Knox Silt Loam. — This type is developed on the loess hills and bluff lands through the erosion and weathering of loess materials. It is closely related to the Marshall silt loam, but represents more erosion and has less organic matter and a thinner surface soil. The surface soil is light brown to yellowish brown and generally thin. Passing downward there is no abrupt change, the materials grad - ing gradually from the surface soil proper to uneroded loess. The type has a pronounced open and columnar structure. There is much lime, principally in the form of concretions. This type occurs as small areas on the most eroded part of hills and slopes. The best development of the type is near the Missouri where it forms a spotted belt one to seven miles wide. Similar belts occur along the Platte and other valleys in the Loess Region. The type is well drained and is retentive of moisture, even though broken and low in organic matter content. Much of it is covered with native sod and timber. Some of it is under cultivation, growing corn, oats, wheat, alfalfa and fruit. Erosion is a comparatively active factor, but less destructive than one would suppose. This is because of the ability of the subsoil to absorb heavy rainfalls. The Knox silt loam has importance in fruit raising. The value for the production of the ordinary farm crops is not as great as with the Marshall silt loam. This is because of the rougher topography and lower humus content. The Knox silt loam is second in importance as a fruit soil. We should know that, all things considered, it is better suited for fruit than grain production. The type where not too rough is admirably adapted to apple growing. It is well suited for grapes even on the steepest slopes, but should be terraced. Aside from the organic matter content this type has all the leading ingredients of a fertile soil. The humus can be restored by the use of barnyard manure and by growing leguminous crops. Cultivation as it is carried on at places encourages erosion and the depletion of the organic matter. Wiinkoiia Silt Loam. -This is the prevailing type developed on the loess capped terraces. Such terraces are featured in the valley at Omaha, Nemaha City, Ashland, Lincoln and many other places. The height of the benches on which the Waukesha silt loam is developed varies greatly. It ranges between 20 and 90 feet above the valley floor. At Omaha the elevation is about 30 feet. To the north of Fremont the terrace runs as high as 80 feet above the valley floor. The Waukesha silt loam resembles the Marshall silt loam. The surface soil is dark brown to dark grayish brown when dry. The depth averages about 15 inches. The subsoil consists of a light brown heavy silt loam to silty clay loam to a depth of two to three feet. The </seg>
            <seg id="p044">40 color changes to brownish yellow at a depth of 20 inches and becomes yet lighter in the section to a depth of 30 inches, beyond which it is yellowish, resembling loess. The subsoil is quite calcareous. This type of soil is very fertile and is cultivated without the use of artificial fertilizers. It is one of the best soils for alfalfa, corn and grain crops. It is well adapted to fruit growing but has not been given over very extensively to this purpose for the reasons pointed out in the management of the Marshall silt loam. A hindrance in the cultivation of this soil is found in the presence of small, poorly drained basins in which occur the Scott silt loam and the Scott silty clay loam. Other Soils. — We have in association with the Marshall silt loam and the Knox silt loam a few soil typos not derived from the loess. As an example of this is the Carrington silt loam. This is derived from the weathering of the drift or glacial material, but may contain some loess remaining from the loess mantle which formerly covered the area. This type has a wide distribution in Lancaster, Cass, Saunders, Nemaha, Johnson, Otoe, Richardson and Pawnee counties. It is fertile but has a heavy compact subsoil in which occur pebbles and some boulders. At places in the counties just named one may see residual soils formed from shales and limestones and in some cases from sandstones. These soils have a limited area. They vary much in fertility and value. Some are well suited for fruit raising but they are not comparable with the Marshall silt loam and the Knox silt loam. We mention these soils and the Carrington silt loam because persons not technically acquainted with the facts might conclude that the loess soils occupy all of the eastern and southeastern parts of our state. Conclusion. — 1. The loess soils are Nebraska's leading resource 2. The soils of greatest value in fruit production are the Marshall silt loam and the Knox silt loam. 3. The most favorable positions (or horticulture in which these soils occur is on the upland belt bordering the Missouri, where the subsoil is mellow and the rainfall greatest. 4. These fruit soils are fertile, stone free, open textured and easily cultivated. They are upland types affording good air drainage and a comparative freedom from frost. They are well located with respect to railroads and markets. 5. The Marshall silt loam and Knox silt loam have not been over - estimated as fruit soils. It would seem that fruit growers should be more interested in them. 6. If our conclusions based on the surveys are correct, a develop - ment of commercial apple orcharding and commercial grape growing should be extended over the most favorable distribution of these fruit lands.

Mr. Marshall is ready with his paper, and I presume from the nature of that paper that we will get a pretty lively discussion following it, and I presume that we had better start with this on time so that we will have the benefit of the whole thing. I am sure that all of you that know the relationship that existed between Mr. Marshall and myself will know that I take pleasure in introducing an old side partner of mine in the fruit business, and one who helped organize a co-operative association in the fruit business, and who assisted me and helped me to organize it in its infancy, and the success in its begin - ning was very largely due to his unique method of managing it. I know you will all be glad to hear from Mr. Marshall. Mr. C. G. Marshall: The subject that has been assigned to me is Co-operation and its Benefits to the Fruit Grower." This subject is a very deep subject. It is something that the Nebraska growers have Just recently become interested in to any great extent, and it is one that I think the growers of the Missouri valley section — the Missouri river fruit district- —will be studying more closely from now on. Now 1 have Jotted down just a few suggestions and I am going to read them, and then I will be glad to have any one in the audience ask questions re - garding them or make other suggestions. This is a subject that will stand considerable discussion, and I would like to see it discussed thoroughly by all present who are interested. rO-OPEKATIOX AND ITS BENEFITS TO THE FRUIT GROWER. By C. G. Marshall, Arlington. Nebraska. Formerly Manager Central Fruit Growers' Association.) Co-operation in handling and marketing fruit in the United States is more highly developed than in any other agricultural industry. This development came first and has reached its highest stage in the Pacific coast states. The citrus fruit growers of California were forced to organize or quit business as soon as the production exceeded natural moderate demands to any great extent. Demands had to be stimulated and more economical methods of distribution and marketing was neces - sary. As a result of close co-operation and good business methods In distribution, the California citrus growers have long since established their markets in all parts of the world, and the supply and demand are kept so nearly on a par that there is but slight variations in prices throughout the year. The growers of apples and other deciduous fruits in the west and northwest have organized as the orchards have begun to produce. As - sociations have also sprung up in the central west and the east until </seg>
            <seg id="p046">42 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY bow almost every fruit section of importance in the United States is well organized in a co-operative way. Co-operation enables the growers to purchase supplies, such as ma - chinery, spraying materials, barrels, boxes, etc., in quantities, thereby Setting the lowest prices, and gives the advantage of car lot freight rates on same rather than local rates. It provides a way for standardization of the product of each section producing fruit of like quality and appearance. By establishing brands and exercising care to keep the pack up to grade the brand soon be - comes known on the market and is called for, thereby placing a pre - mium on it, as enough fruit is parked under one brand to make an impression on the trade. It enables the small grower having less than minimum cars to load what he has at any time with his neighbor's fruit in car lots and reach the best market at that particular time, which is not possible by local shipments if this market does not happen to be near at hand. It enables the organization to employ expert horticulturists to advise the members individually on problems of orchard management, and to demonstrate the most up-to-date practices. Only extensive grow - ers can afford to employ such help individually, but a comparatively small co-operative organization can well afford to employ such a man and with little cost to the individual member. Fruit growing has be - come a highly specialized industry in many sections of the country, and only by keeping strictly up-to-date and by employing the latest and best methods of pruning, spraying, cultivation, packing and hand - ling of fruit can the grower compete successfully. It places the fruit of every member in the hands of an experienced fruit salesman, whose time is devoted to the study of distribution, markets, advertising of the products, etc. This does away with ruinous local competition by growers of the same community or district in times of depressed market conditions and when several growers are anxious to sell to some jobber or speculator who happens to be in the territory. Co-operative selling organizations lend prestige to the fruit section in which they operate; and a greater confidence is extended to the pack and quality of the fruit put out by such organizations, and their busi - ness-like methods, than to the individual grower. In other words, the average purchaser would rather buy the same fruit from a well organ - ised association than from the individual. The producing and packing of a crop of fruit, if properly done, requires the time and attention of the individual so closely that he cannot inform himself on crop and market conditions of the country and besides he is not provided with facilities for the gathering of this information. This is generally out of his line and he seldom has the right line-up on conditions that affect the marketing of his crops. There are many other advantages of co-operation, among these probably one of the most Important is the resultant better acquaintance </seg>
            <seg id="p047">CO-OPERATION AND ITS BENEFITS 43 of the members, one with another, and the closer relationship, and the comparing of notes. Several successful co-operative fruit growers' associations are now being operated in the Missouri river fruit district between Omaha and St. Joseph, Mo. These have all had their ups and downs and are profiting each year by past experiences. The writer helped to organise the Central Fruit Growers' Association, with headquarters at Nebraska City, and served it two years as sales manager. This organization has had the usual discouraging things to contend with and is gradually solving its problems. While a few of the charter members have with - drawn from the organization, with practically no exceptions the more successful growers are loyal and enthusiastic. After a close study of co-operation of fruit growers and its applica - tion to the industry in the central west the writer makes the following; observations: The first step in perfecting the organization of a co-operative asso - ciation is to incorporate it under the state laws. The co-operative amendment to our Nebraska corporation laws authorize associations to pay dividends prorated on the proportionate amount of the individual's business handled through the association rather than on the stock held. The amount of stock held by one member should be limited to prevent control of the association falling into the hands of an individual or group of individuals. When an individual takes out a share of stock, he is merely paying a membership fee, looking at it from the ideal co - operative standpoint. The association may be financed by notes drawn bj each member in favor of the association to be used merely as collateral on which to borrow money. A certain percentage of the dividends should then be retained and in time the notes can be cancelled and returned to the members. Assuming that the articles of incorporation and by-laws provide for good working board of directors and a manager, the board should secure a man who has business ability, energy, tact and experience, if possible. He should be worthy of the confidence of the members, and then he must have their confidence if he does the best for the individual and for the association. Co-operation among farmers is more difficult to effect than the con - solidation of capital in any other business enterprise. The farmer is the most individualistic of American citizens. It is not easy for him to transact his business with his neighbors. Independence in handling his business affairs is a tradition that has been his for generations. He prefers to conduct his business man to man as his fathers have done before him, unless necessity compels him to do otherwise. So to back up this confidence each member should be required to sign a contract which gives the association the exclusive right to supervise the packing and marking, if it so desire, and to sell all fruit </seg>
            <seg id="p048">44 not excepted by agreement between the members and the directors or manager This contract should be drawn for a term of three to fire years, giving the grower the privilege of withdrawing by notice at the end of any fruit year, thereby making his continued connection with the association voluntary- The privilege of withdrawing should, how - ever, be confined to a short period and to such season of the year as will enable the local directorate to know in advance what they can depend on for the ensuing year. The point is covered by the following clause in the grower's contract used by a successful association: "Pro - vided, that the grower may cancel this contract on March first of any year by giving notice in writing at least twenty days prior to said date." This provision releases the grower from turning in his fruit the next year if he is dissatisfied with results. The management on the other hand knows Just what to depend on and as soon as the crop Is assured can begin to make plans with some definiteness for the pack- Ing and disposal of same. Without these arrangements the manage - ment would not know until harvest time, and in many cases not until after the shipping season has opened, whose fruit they would have to handle. A commission should be charged for selling the fruit. This com - mission should be determined by the board of directors from year to year after the crop is far enough advanced so that its volume can be estimated. It will necessarily be higher when the crop is light and lower when the crop is heavy. Any surplus money in the treasury at the end of the year, except that retained for special purposes, such as building funds, etc., should be prorated back to the growers according to the amount of fruit handled by the association for each member. Associations organized along the lines above suggested are ap - plicable to all sections of the Missouri river fruit district and will do more to place the industry on a permanent and profitable basis than any other agency. In fact, the growers of this, one of the greatest natural fruit districts of the country, will be forced to organize or lose out in competition with other organized sections. Slip-shod, hit and miss methods of growing and packing of fruit are not longer tolerated by the purchasers and consuming public. Neatly packed, standardized goods, with something apparently responsible and sound to stand back of them, are demanded today and business organizations can much bet - ter meet these demands than Individuals. When the whole of this north Missouri river fruit district is organ - ised Into local associations of convenient size for practical and economi - cal handling of their affairs and they federate in establishing a central selling agency. Ideal co-operative conditions will be realized. The local associations will be the foundation of the central agency and must be sound and prosperous to make it possible. The large volume of fruit to handle resulting from federating will cheapen the selling cost and alto place each individual's fruit in reach of more markets. Such is the plan of organisation of the Oxark Fruit Growers' Exchange, which </seg>
            <seg id="p049">DISCUSSION 45 has made southern Missouri and northern Arkansas berries standard in all markets of the country. Before this organization was perfected the berry business of this section was in the "dumps" and the grower* were very much at the mercy of the transient buyers. Quite often the growers were left with no profits and sometimes actually losses oc - ■urrerl on the handling expenses. In recent years, however, the indus - try is prospering. Now. I understand that we have with us a gentleman from Arkansas, who is connected with the Fruit Growers' Association in that part of the section, and during the discussion I would like to hear from this gentleman. Discussion. Mr. Pollard resumes the chair at this point.) The President: We would be glad to have anyone take up this paper of Mr. Marshall's for discussion. I think we would be very glad to hear from this gentleman from Arkansas, and we are very glad indeed that we have such a party with us at this time. Mr. Reeder. from Rogers, Arkansas: I had not anticipated making any talk, but inasmuch as we are all apple or fruit growers, if I can say anything that will be of any benefit I would be glad to do so. I went to Arkansas three years ago last December and bought an or- hard there. At that time there was no local fruit growers' association iear our place. The Ozark Fruit Growers' Association handles berries t has its head otlict- at Springfield, Missouri. They were of no benefit to the growers in our section except in marketing. The first year I was in Rogers there was a fruit growers' association organized that would handle spray material and contract all business pertaining to the care and cultivation and marketing of the apples and peaches. At the present time the berry crop at Rogers is not large and the association has never undertaken to handle it. When we had our organization at first we did not put a contract into effect between the association and the growers. The result was that there were always some that found they could sell outside, and would thereby save the commission that was due to the association. They would do that, and either some members or some growers who did not belong would cut the price. It was hard to keep the price up, but we were in - strumental in keeping up the price on bulk apples. We have never been very successful in regard to handling the cold storage stock be - cause that is where the growers get away from us. After they get their stock in cold storage, they have practically six months to dispose of it, and as we are not in a position to pay a manager and secretary all the year round that phase of it has gotten away. The thing to work for in any organization of this kind is absolute co-operation until you get in a position to control the whole output of the community and work through local organizations and then have a central selling organ - ization. It seems to me that is the only salvation for the fruit grower. As long as we are competing among ourselves on the market, and the </seg>
            <seg id="p050">46 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY local people are competing, there are always speculators in the fruit growing district who will work against an association, because they can get their fruit as cheap where there is an association who can handle it and make proper returns to the grower as they can when there is no association. That was demonstrated there in Rogers the first year. There had always been some fruit produce men there who kept their house open and kept selling tables there. Apples were brought in by the wagon load and these men paid whatever they thought they wanted to pay, and they packed the apples themselves. When the association was organized we changed the price very materially, probably from an average of forty to fifty cents a hundred for orchard run apples up to eighty-five cents or $1.10 during the season. The latter part of the first season I was there we got $1.40 a hundred for orchard run Ben Davis in bulk. Those same men who had been running their houses open there had to quit. They could not pay the price and compete with the association and they took to buying their stuff in car-loads from the surrounding towns, who were too far away from the railroads to haul to Rogers. Those growers were at the mercy of the men who wanted to buy their stuff. I hope that your centra! organization will be successful here, and that you will be successful in establishing jour local organization, and all work to the end of co-operating and sticking together. It is very often that you will have a period of several years when it won't look like an actual business proposition tor the grower to pay his commission to the Fruit Growers' Association and stay in. But if you can look ahead and see the benefits you will derive in tin - future by getting everybody together, I think that the organizations will be successful. Mr. Pollard: I am sure that we are very ulad to hear iroiii Mr Reeder and know something of the operations of the Arkansas Fruit Growers' Association. Is there anyone else who has any questions to ask, or suggestions concerning this subject? I am sure that Mr. Mai shall would be glad to answer any question. Mr. Smith: I was unfortunate to come in just a few moments ago just as Mr. Marshall was closing up his remarks in regard to taking the notes of the members. If the gentlemen present would bear with us a moment I would be very glad to hear that repeated, if Mr. Mar - shall would just repeat that part of the financing of co-operative asso - ciations in regard to the note part. Mr. Marshall: I suggested that when the Central Fruit Growers' Association was organized that that was one problem that we hardly knew how to get around, how to finance an association and put it on a sound basis. We did not take up this proposition, but I have been told and have read that the western associations are using that plan with good success. They simply have each member give his note for a certain amount and they use these notes as collateral in borrowing money to get an association on its feet, or to start with. A certain per cent of the commission that is paid in for the soiling of the fruit is </seg>
            <seg id="p051">47 retained and these notes are gradually absorbed, or paid off and can - celled and returned to the grower. Mr. Pollard: Any other questions? Mr. Williams: I would like to ask Mr. Marshall what the nature of these auxiliary associations in that part of the state — what their relation is to the Central Association? 1 understand there are perhaps some counties or localities organized by themselves that become through their officers a part of the larger association, and I want to know how these are operated? Mr. Marshall: You are referring to the associations there In the eastern part of the state? Mr. Williams: Yes, to your central association. Mr. Marshall: Well, I do not want you to get the term "Central Association" confused with the term "Central Selling Agency." Now, the Central Association, that is simply a name of an association. That Is not named that because there are a number of other associations which are auxiliaries to it. It is because It is the central part of the United States, hence the reason for that name. But there is one or two auxiliaries to the Central Fruit Growers' Association, one at Brown - ville that has been doing considerable business through the central. The local organization has its local officers and its local manager. and it bears the same relation to the Central Fruit Growers' Associa - tion as an individual member who takes out an individual membership. For instance, as Mr. Pollard, who is an apple grower, or Mr. Keyser. Now. this Brownville association is composed of a number of small berry growers principally, men who have a half acre, or some of them even less, and some of them are grape growers, and they felt It wa» a little too expensive for each of those small growers to take out a mem- bership in the Central Fruit Growers' Association as an Individual, and so they organized, and the Central Fruit Growers' Association made another constitution and by-laws to allow them to enter on the same basis as an individual member who had considerable fruit. Their local manager represents them through the local association. All their busi - ness is done through him, so that the Central Association has but the one man really to deal with, their manager. Mr. Williams: In your contract with them, do they contract to furnish everything they raise for that season? Mr. Marshall: We have never had any definite contract with any of our members. There was a form we used when they made an ap - plication for membership. They would agree to sell their stuff through the association, but there is no penalty to anything of that kind, and some of them have not lived up to this agreement in detail; but we find that, while we have not had much trouble along that line, there has been some little trouble, and I recommend that a more binding contract should be entered into between the association and its indi - vidual members, so that the association knows where it is at. An as- sociation cannot do the best by its members or for the association </seg>
            <seg id="p052">48 unless they know what they are going to handle, and they know that the members are behind them and will stay behind them. If the mem - ber has the option of turning his fruit into the association or selling it himself, he will be tempted to sell that part of it that is easy to sell, himself, and turn the poor stuff which is hard to sell over to the asso - ciation. It gets the association in bad and places them in a position that they cannot do any good for the member, and it does not ad - vertise them very favorably, just to be selling that kind of fruit* But I think one of the features that I did not dwell on very long in the paper, that is very important, and one thing that can do the growers of eastern Nebraska probably as much if not more good than the selling, is the employing of a good demonstrator, or a man of experience, an experienced horticulturist, who can work with the growers during the growing season and help those growers to grow the fruit right. I think this last year, if a man of that kind could have been with the growers and traveled among them and prevailed upon them to spray a little better and give a little better care there, that they could have made the product of that association worth two or three times what it was actu - ally worth. We had a very bad season last year, and it was only fruit from the orchard that had the very best care that was barreled, or package stock, — the rest of it was bulk stock. Now, the reason for that was either on account of negligence or because of lack of information in some cases on the part of the grower, and the right kind of suggestions by a good live man and a demonstration during the growing season would have produced a whole lot better crop than was produced in eastern Nebraska last year. Now, not every season is like the season of 1915, and that is possibly one reason why the growers get caught that way once in a while. We have had a few years of comparatively dry seasons, when fungus does not develop so rapidly, and they become a little careless. They know that experiments have shown that at least three or four good sprayings at the proper time are needed, and thorough applications are essential to make fruit if the crop will be clean. If we have a year or two or three when it has been a little dry, and some of them have missed one spray - ing, and they do not notice any difference between the fruit produced, then the man is apt to get a little careless, and in about a year he is up against It, and they have a lot of dirty, scabby, blotched fruit. So that a good horticulturist, one who understands the best methods of orchard management, can, I believe, do as much and even more than a good sales manager towards helping the growers in the association. Mr. Smith: In your investigation along the line of getting up a contract between the grower and the association, don't you think it is necessary to keep out of the way of infringing upon the Interstate Commerce Commission laws in restraint of trade? Mr. Marshall: Yes, sir; I considered that, but I think a contract could be drawn that would do that. There is a number of western associations that hare contracts in force and they do not seem to be </seg>

            <seg id="p054">49 getting in trouble. 1 do not have any of those contracts at the present time, although I did have them. I saw about eight o~&gt; ten associations and got copies of their contracts, and their secretaries and managers commented more or less upon the nature of the contract. The copies are in the office of the Fruit Growers' Association, and also letters from the managers stating that the contracts would stand the test. Mr. Smith: You would suggest caution along that line though? Mr. Marshall: Yes, sir; I would. The President: If there are no further questions we will pass «■ to the next paper. Mr. Duncan: I would like to suggest that while we are on this topic Professor Howard could give us a few pointers on how Mr. Beavers manages his orchard, inasmuch as Mr. Beavers does not seem to be here. Professor Howard: I think that this is asking too much. I think this is assuming quite a good deal to ask a man to tell an audience, without any previous notification at al!, how a man grows his fruit and care for it. I cannot tell you about the way in which he markets his fruit. I think perhaps Professor Cooper could give you some data on how he disposes of his crop. I do know something about the history of Mr. Beavers' success as an orchard man. Perhaps I can say this better when Mr. Beavers is not here than I could if he was here. It was a little over five years ago that Mr. Keyaer and myself and Mr. George Marshall and Mr. Pollard held two or three meetings down the Missouri river in an attempt to awaken more interest in methods of growing clean apples. It was the publicity given to these meetings that attracted Mr. Beavers' attention, and it was due to these meetings that he sent a postal card to the experiment station asking if he could have some information by means of bulletin or otherwise on how to prune an orchard. He apologized a little for even writing that postal card, but he mentioned on his card that he had a young orchard which he had just bought and that he did not know how to prune it, and he wanted some information. Well, instead of sending that man some bulletins, and instead of writing him a long letter, the station sent a man up there at the state's expense to show the man bow to prune his orchard, because any of you men who have grown fruit would realize how hopeless it is to tell a man something about pruning an orchard, even if you have a blackboard to draw pictures on, even if the man has grown fruit for some time alone. The station man, upon his arrival, found that Mr. Beavers had this notion in regard to pruning his trees. He said he had read in a paper somewhere, or he had heard someone say. that an orchard that had not been pruned previously should have a considerable portion of its wood taken out But I believe he said he remembered of reading somewhere that some horticultural man had advised that one-third or one-fourth of the wood should come out. At the time the station man went to his orchard, he had just followed that rule. He had two men in his orchard with axes and car- </seg>
            <seg id="p055">50 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY penter saws removing about one-third of the wood. I am just estimat - ing that. He was an open-minded man, and when the station man suggested that perhaps he was taking off about the proper amount of wood, he questioned as to whether or not he was taking it off at the proper place. Mr. Beavers was open to conviction and suggested that the station man, who was talking with him, should take the saw and show him how he would do it. The station man stayed there two days and pruned fifteen, twenty or thirty trees. When Mr. Beavers found he was not going to have to pay something for that work he fopran to listen, with a little more conviction, and when the station man stayed and helped him through his orchard, he told the hired men that they might stop. He sent the hired man to buy some proper tools for pruning, and he then told those men who were working for him to do nothing but take notice and see to it that they got all the ideas thai the station man was trying to give him. He had those men prune the rest of the orchard in that way. It was a young and very good orchard for a neglected orchard. It was an orchard that had not been pruned for many years, but it was on good soil, and in spite of the fact that it had not had very good attention I doubt if there were over eighteen or twenty trees in the eighteen acres that were no good. The station man said it would probably pay him to get a power sprayer, rather than to prune all the orchard out and then leave it. Mr. Beavers said: "He had never thought of that. Suppose that I were to get one, I do not know how to use it, and I do not know how to put the things in It." He was told that the station maintained a department whose duty it was to show men how to spray and that his was a typical case for a man wanting help, and the station would send a man to help him put it on. When he found that we were not selling sprayers and that the demonstrator was not getting a commission, he thought perhaps that would be a good idea and he bought a power sprayer and then an ex - tension disk. I would like to say that in the past five years Mr. Gus Beavers of South Omaha has made more money off of that eighteen-acre orchard than any similar acreage has made to any man in the state of Nebraska. That man scarcely knew the difference at the time he com - menced between a peach tree and an apple tree, but today he is one of the expert orchardists of this state. He simply lives in his orchard during the growing season. He has a home in South Omaha, but shortly after daylight you will see him in his orchard. Last year he marketed a crop valued at between seven and eight thousand dollars. He keeps his books and can tell you what he gets from each variety of apples each year. I have seen trees that were headed better than Mr. Beavers' trees are headed, but that is because he let his trees go four years before they were pruned. It was almost impossible to get them back and make stocky trees of them afterwards. The point I am trying to make is this, that he has cared for those trees the past five years and sprayed them thoroughly, and last year, despite the fact that it wu about the mort favorable year I hare ever seen in Nebraska for </seg>
            <seg id="p056">51 the development of apple scab and other diseases, Mr. Beavers had a crop that was almost free from Insects and other blemishes. Don't get the idea that scab was not prevalent in that part of the state, because Professor Cooper and Mr. Hoppert took notes on an orchard less than half a mile away that had never been sprayed. Mr. Hoppert tells me that he has the notes from those unsprayed trees and they had from 95 to 100 per cent scabby fruit and were less than one-half a mile away. But Mr. Beavers had controlled the source of infection. And last year, on account of having kept up his orchard, he did not have to fight the battle that we have to fight. The Chairman: I would like to ask whether in the check that was kept on that orchard they made any distinction between the Ben Davis and the Jonathan trees. Professor Howard: Yes, sir; there was a distinction made. Professor Cooper: What was the question? Mr. Pollard: I understood the professor to say that you had several trees and had kept a check on those trees and that there was only about 15 per cent of the fruit that was defective, while the orchards nearby were nearly all scab. I wanted to know if you kept a check on the different trees. Professor Cooper: We kept the varieties separate in all cases, and the 15 per cent refers to the Ben Davis rather than the Jonathans. The per cent of scabby fruit was very slight on the Jonathan. Mr. Pollard : I know we have been spraying down home for a number of years and we have been getting clean fruit nearly all along. But this year we had at times a limb every now and then on a tree which apparently the boys had missed with the spray; they had not been thorough enough, and that particular limb was missed. On the apples that grew upon that limb we would find fungus on them, while the rest of the tree would be entirely free from it. Now, we found that condition down there all around, in isolated cases. Of course, we do not expect much scab on the Jonathan, they not being as susceptible to it. The case of Mr. Beavers seemed to me like a remarkable situa - tion, and that is the reason I asked the question. A Member: What variety did Mr. Beavers raise mostly, that he had a profit of seven or eight thousand dollars a year? Professor Howard: I do not believe I said net. That is what he got for what he sold. But Mr. Beavers has told me that, including (his year's crop, he has netted not less than seven hundred dollars an acre, including this year, for the past five seasons. He has about fifteen to eighteen varieties in the orchard, but he has mostly Ben Davis and Jonathan, and originally had about 250 trees of Grimes' Golden. He has quite a few of Maiden Blush, and then some Winesaps and a few Northwestern Greenings, etc. Q. How did this orchard lay, on high or low ground? A. Well, if you have ever been near South Omaha, it Is fairly high, and it slopes very gently to the south. I should say that it is typical </seg>
            <seg id="p057">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 52 loess soil and rich land, and none of it bo steep bat what we can culti - vate It during the wet season. Mr. Smith: That accounts for the scab? A. Well, this other orchard I mentioned was almost under identical conditions. How would you account for that, it being less than a half mile away, under the same general conditions? Q. I would not attempt to account for that. But it is much earner to keep it down on high land, like this, than on low land. A. Well, I think we will all admit that. Q. What are the distances between the trees? A. His trees are too close. They are 25 by 30 feet, if I am not mistaken. They are too close though. They are about twenty years old. and they are interlocking on one side very badly. Now, if they had been headed properly for the first two years after they had been in the orchard, that condition of affairs would not be so troublesome as it is now. The first three years the scaffold branches grew out so long it was impossible to head them properly, and if he were planting another orchard, he would plant them several feet further apart. I have heard him say that he would not have them nearer than 33 feet A Member: He must have about 55 to 60 trees to the acre A. Yes, sir: I think that is it. I might say these Grimes' Golden trees have been a disappointment to him in one respect. At first he had 250, I think it was, and at present he has less than half of that number. He has lost several each year, in spite of the fact that he has been giving them such good treatment; the loss being due to the col - lar rot. Mr. Beavers is a groceryman by profession, and I might men - tion that is one of the reasons he has made such a success of his orchard. He knows marketing conditions from a groceryman's posi - tion, and now he knows good fruit when he sees it. He has worked up a trade to such an extent that at harvesting time he can get from one - third to twice the price other grocers get on the market. People who know him say: "No, Mr. Beavers is going to have some apples and we will buy them from him. We got them from him last year and we know what they are." He has worked up such a local reputation that he stores very little of his stuff. This year he has some barreled and some boxed, and I rather think those are still in storage, although I haven't seen them. Mr. Smith: Would this not be true, that if all the growers and neighbors of Mr. Beavers and those in that vicinity would adopt like methods the marketing of his crop would be a more difficult proposi - tion, wouldn't it? A. It certainly would. Q. What if everybody would raise the same kind of fruit? tA. It would mean this, if all the orchards in the state had fruit like Beavers' orchard has produced during the past five seasons, and as d and as much as his, a talk like Mr. Marshall's would not be neces- </seg>
            <seg id="p058">53 Mir. They would get together and store it, and would appreciate the motives of co-operation. If all the growers within a radios of ten miles from Omaha would have fruit like Mr. Beavers, something would have to be done, or it would spoil Mr. Beavers' market and the general demand for good apples. I mean by that that five people out of six. who are now buying western grown apples in small packages and by the box, would then buy Nebraska grown apples, and In that way would increase our local market. Mr. Pollard : If there are no further questions we will past to the next number on the program, which is "Pear Growing In Nebraska," by Mr. Elmer Berlin, of BrownvlHe, Nebraska. PEAR GROWING IN NEBRASKA. By Elmer Berlin, BrmvnviUe, Nebraska. In giving this paper on pear growing it only covers my own ex - perience and observation of the following varieties: Kieffer. which is my main crop, Garber, Duchess, and a few Bartlett. In growing pears on a small scale or for commercial purposes there are several points to take into consideration. I will try and cover the main ones in this paper. I have not had experience with very young trees, as my pear orchard was eight years old when I bought it. Now in regard to the soil. My experience has been that they do not want a very rich soil, as the faster the growth the worse the blight affects them. Some of my trees are planted on soil so poor that it will hardly raise a weed, but the blight is not nearly so bad in them as It is in trees planted on richer soil and they bear just as heavily. From what I have observed and from my own experience pear trees generally are planted too closely together. Our trees are planted in rows seventeen feet apart and fifteen feet apart in the row. This is altogether too close as it does not give the trees room to spread. I suppose the idea of setting them so closely was to cut out every other one when they commenced to crowd each other, but as yet I have failed to find a person with nerve enough to cut out a bearing pear tree in good condition. I do not think that pear trees should be planted less than twenty-two feet apart each way and then kept headed back with an open head. Don't let them grow up with a single leader, but keep them headed out as much as possible, because if the blight attacks an open-headed tree only one limb is affected, but if it attacks a tree with only a single leader, the whole tree becomes affected, if you do not watch it very closely. I think this is one of the greatest mistakes that most growers make in setting out pears, they neglect to form the low open head when the trees are young and it is hard to head them out when they are five or six years old. Some of our trees were nearly thirty feet high with only a single leader. We cut them back three to fire feet each year, accord- </seg>
            <seg id="p059">54 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY ing to size, until we got them headed back as low as we wanted them. I do not think it is best to prune any heavier than that in one year, as too heavy pruning will cause quick growth and make the tree more subject to blight. There seems to be a difference in opinion in regard to cultivation, some say cultivate and others say do not cultivate, but from my own experience and what I have observed, I do not think it is best to cul - tivate. I find the blight is worse on trees next to cultivated ground than on those where there is no cultivation. I was through a three-year-old pear orchard last fall that had rasp - berries and strawberries planted between the rows and had clean cul - tivation and three-fourths of the trees were so badly affected with the blight that they will not recover. I think the cultivation caused them to grow too fast, and I find that the faster the pear trees grow, the worse the blight affects them. I think that a blue-grass sod is the best for a pear orchard, as this will keep the soil from washing and also help to keep the weeds down. Never sow alfalfa in a pear orchard if you are bothered with gophers. I have had them kill twelve-year-old trees. Another very important matter that a good many make a mista in is setting out only one variety of pears. Especially is this true the Kieffer, as it will not pollinate its own blossoms properly, but nee another variety to cross-pollinate them. I do not think that more than two or three rows of one variet should be planted together, alternating with some other variety that i considered a good pollenizer. The Garber seems to be the best to plan with the Kieffer, as it blooms at the same time. Our trees are set two rows of Kiefler, then one row of Garber. 1 think that this furnishes plenty of fertilization for the Kieffer, as the Garber is not a very good pear tor commercial purposes; it is best to set only enough to furnish fertilization for the Kieffer. One of my neighbors set out over four hundred Kieffer pears the same time that mine were set out. He has no other variety planted with them and I do not think that he has ever gotten over one hundred bushels of pears at any one time and most of the time it is barren, although his orchard is now fifteen years old. No method has been discovered for the control of the pear blight, and, as before stated, the checking of too rapid growth is one means of prevention, and by proper use of saw and knife its spread can be held in check. Our method of controlling the blight is to keep it trimmed out as fast as we find any. We go over the orchard every two or three weeks during the summer, every week would be better, and cut out all blight that we find, being very careful to cut back several inches from the affected part so that all the diseased part will be re - moved. The blight in an affected limb spreads very rapidly and soon reaches the main body of the tree, especially the single leader type. Disinfect your tools and the wound on tree after cutting each affected limb. I disinfect with corrosive sublimate. </seg>

            <seg id="p061">55 Burn the brush, as if it is left lying on the ground it will spread the blight. In pruning pear trees I find that the safest way is to first go over the orchard and cut out all blight and then go over them again and do what other pruning you want to do. This way there is not much danger of spreading the blight. I do all my pruning, except for blight, in the winter and early spring. I spray pears the same as for apples, except for the summer spray I use only one gallon of commercial lime-sulphur to fifty gallons of water. No precise time can be given for gathering pears. If they are to be shipped to a distant market, they must be picked before they are fully ripe; but care must be taken not to pick them too soon as they will shrivel up. As a general rule, it is safe to gather the fruit whenever the stem will easily part from the limb by twisting or turning the fruit from the natural position with thumb and forefinger. All fruit should be gathered with the stems unbroken, carefully avoiding bruising or breaking the skin. I ship my pears in bushel boxes, as they carry better in boxes than they do in barrels. In raising pears for commercial purposes I consider it a hazardous indertaking until there is a more effectual way of controlling the lisrht l»l-i II— •lull. Mr. Berlin: There is another thing which I think is important in raising pears. They seem to bloom before the apples, and if they are planted on a hillside facing the west or north, to keep the bloom in check, it is better for them. I don't think pears are affected as much with frost as apples. When we had our heaviest pear crop, the limbs of the trees were lower down so that we had to prop them up, and we had the heaviest frost that we have ever had in May. The pears were as large as my little finger, and they were coated with ice and frost also. It might be that it was cloudy that day and that had something to do with it. But I have noticed in my ten years' experience with pears that they are not affected as much with frost as apples are. We have had pear crops when the frost has killed the apples, but it did not kill the pears. If we could- only find some means of overcoming that blight. But after all there is more money in apples than in pears, in my esti- mation Mr. Pollard : I think this question of pear blight is a good question to turn over to Professor Howard. I know he is full of ambition and inasmuch as he has just come into the University as the head of the horticulture department, I think that would be a splendid problem for him and his department to take up. I think that all of us realize the force of Mr. Berlin's remarks about the control of the blight, before pears can be grown very successfully. I think we have all attempted at one time or another to do that, but I think we have all met with the </seg>
            <seg id="p062">56 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY same results. I think Mr. Berlin's location is better than the others in a great many ways, and I think he was wise to choose poor soil to check the growth of the trees. A Member: I would like to ask the gentleman if he had a block of Kieffer fifteen feet high that had never been pruned, how much pruning he would give them the first time? Mr. Berlin: Well, I would not trim over three feet, and then try to spread them out. Another thing I think we make a big mistake in growing pear trees is this: You know the sun scald that conies on the tree, I think a good deal that we think is blight is sun scald. I have had lots of trees die of that trouble and it starts about a foot above the ground. Now I think that is caused from sun scald. But a tree eigh - teen feet high I would not trim it over three feet, and keep the water sprouts cut out. It takes a long time to head out a pear tree. It is not like an apple tree. It will take you three years to do it, that is my experience. A Member: Would you do that every year for three or four years A. Yes, sir; until you get them as low as you want them. Just keep them spread out, the water sprouts are the worst to contend with in trees. But you can tell by cutting your tree back each year how to shape your tree. It is not like an apple tree. We have finally got ours headed out in five years, so that the branches spread out and protect the trunk of the tree. Q. How much lower the second year would you cut it? A. You are a better judge on that when you see how your tret grows. Mr. Christy: in cutting that tree back, there is where your b is liable to spread, isn't it? A. I have never found it so. I have never found blight to sprea&lt; where I trimmed a tree back, except in the water sprouts. You wil find it starts mostly in your water sprouts, and if you don't watch i very carefully you will find it starts in the water sprouts and runs ver&gt; quickly back into the tree. Mr. Christy: Well, the water sprout is where it will start t quickest, because that is the most rapid growth? A. Yes, sir; that is what I say, you have to watch it in the water sprouts. It runs very rapidly on water sprouts, but after you get your tree spread out the little branches will be on the limb, outside of your tree. Q. You are not growing many varieties beside the Kieffer? A. The Kieffer and the Garber and the Duchess and the Bartlett Q. When you say trim them back three feet, do you mean just the main leader? A. Yes, sir. Mr. Smith: Many times the Kieffer pear that has not been pruned properly will grow up a mass of sprouts all about the same height, with no special leader? </seg>
            <seg id="p063">57 A. Well, if you cut like I say, about three to five feet, the limbs will gradually spread out. Q. Well, suppose you have no leader; I happen to have a tree that has no leader. A. Well, I would trim them back to just about the size I want them. Cut all the limbs and water sprouts off to a certain height. It does not make any difference whether or not you cut the main leader, cut them all back the way you want them. But it takes time. Mr. Pollard, Sr. : This discussion has interested me, the question of this blight or canker or whatever you call it. Nobody seems to have told us how to cure that, and I would like to know how to cure it. If we don't stop this blight on the apple tree, or the canker, or whatever you call it, there won't be an orchard in the state in a little while. These farm orchards, and there is no home can exist unless they have plenty of fruit, they want some apples of good quality from trees of good quality, and everybody should have them. If you cannot stop this canker, there won't be an orchard in Nebraska in ten years. How are you going to stop it? Mr. Marshall : Professor Vasey is on this program in the next num - ber on this very subject and perhaps he can answer your question. Mr. Pollard, Sr. : Well, is it a contagious disease or a fungous dis - ease, and will it come a second time if we cure the tree? Will it take it again? We have had men in our orchard just about all summer trimming treeR and prunine them for canker and doctoring them. They were out there two months this spring, and I don't think they have cured the canker. Our doctors scrape off the infected place and scrape off all the old bark and down to the bare clean wood and there you can see the canker at work. They then put on corrosive sublimate on the wound. That is Mr. Vasey's plan. Well, where you scrape off that dead bark and pieces of canker wood, what is going to become of that? Is that going to spread your disease right over? What is the use of doctoring all the time? Won't that have to be destroyed? Shouldn't that diseased wood all be saved and destroyed and carried off, every bit of it? I have been trying to raise pears and I have given it up. We have only a couple of Kieffers, and I would just as soon not have any as those. The old Bartlett pear was affected first by blight. The Duchess is another one that is good. But I would not have the KieSer as a standard pear. Some folks will eat them because they cannot have any others. I got a bushel of sulphur and put about a half a bushel of sulphur under the trees and spaded it into the ground, and those trees have not blighted since. I don't know whether or not that is an experiment, but you don't want to depend upon the University entirely. I wish this society today would urge the state regents to put more money into this Experiment Station out to the Farm. It is the salvation of our industry. I had some cherry trees die with fungus. There is not a tree left out of the ten acres.- This work out to the Farm should </seg>
            <seg id="p064">58 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY be encouraged; they need a lot of money and need to put more men at work. I was doctoring some of these cankers on an apple tree and I wanted to see what it would do, and we had other men doctoring trees, too, and they were doctoring them their way. Some of the best experi - ments and best discoveries we have ever got were made by fools, and I thought I might blunder onto something. I took carbolic acid and scraped off this canker, and then I used that carbolic acid on the place where the canker was. Some ot the boys thought I would kill the tree, but I thought, inasmuch as the canker would kill the tree anyway, I might as well try that. Well, sir, that tree lived and grew and got all over the canker. But the carbolic acid did not kill the tree, although 1 expected it would. I have 165 acres in a bearing orchard now that is full of this canker or blight, or whatever you' call it. It is a disease that is killing our trees and we have been experimenting and trying different cures for it. There is one thing 1 would like to have Mr. Howard's opinion on. Will this scraping that we scrape off affect the trees if it lies on the ground? How is this carried anyway? We don't know any - thing about it. When 1 came to Nebraska we raised apples here just like these wild plum trees, and there wasn't a speck of fungus or worm or canker in them, and when we ate an apple it was always good. When we began to bring in apples we got this fungous disease. They should have this experimental work at the University carried to every farm, and I would like to see this society uree the regents to put more money into the experimental work out to the Farm on this disease of our fruits. Professor Howard: That is just the question that Mr. V«MJ is going to take up in his next paper. So I shall not go into detail in my remarks, because that is his line of work. He is a pathologist and is making laboratory experiments, and he can tell you whether these things that you scrape off will infect your trees or not This discussion started on pear blight. It takes in cankers too, but it is caused en - tirely by a different thing. The pear canker is not a fungous disease, it is a disease that works on the inside of the tree, and insects cause it; it is a bacterial disease. It gets into the pear trees under the bark and through the flowers, and we cannot spray for it. But this Illinois canker is an entirely different thing. Mr. Pollard: Well, in your opinion, will these germs or spores in that scraped wood communicate other diseases? A. Surely, that is where it comes from. It depends upon the time of year, Mr. Pollard, that you scrape it off. Some things are alive one part of the year and they are not alive another part of the year. Mr. Pollard: Well, we will wait and see what Professor Vase}" has to say. The Chairman: Now we will pass on to the next subject, which is "Blister Canker Control, Illustrated," by Prof. H. E.

            <seg id="p065">HI..lsTk.R t ANIvKR ' ONTROL. 59 program, but I am undoubtedly grateful to him for this introduction that he has given me, because he leads me right up to the subject of this Illinois canker. When Mr. Duncan approached me some time ago with the question of whether we could give any optimistic results from our work of three years upon this subject I said I thought we could, and while the control is not something that we could not write out in plain words, because it requires more work than we have been able to give it, yet, nevertheless, we may say, from the means which have been developed by which we can control the Illinois canker, we intend to progress, and we intend to do it easier and more directly and more rapidly. Perhaps, since you have been discussing this pear blight ranker, the Illinois canker and the blister canker, we had better separate the two distinct classes. Pear blight canker is caused by bacteria and transmitted by mMMM of insects, that is one means of infection. The second means is by wounds. If you cut through canker with your saw and pass on to another branch where you are going to remove it, you introduce the bacteria by that process and bring them in contact with that fresh wound and they set up the bacteria. The canker interferes with the circulation of the sap in the tree. The Illinois canker is caused by a different thing and it enters through open wounds almost entirely, and we will take that up almost directly. I have some pictures that 1 want to show you of different situations that you meet with in this canker, regarding the control of the canker, and I want to show you some of pictures of the conditions and the way that we meet them. HI.1STKU CANKKR CONTROL. 1(&gt; H. K. Imp, Itepartiuent of Plant Pathology. I'niverrity of Nebraska, Lincoln. I have been asked on this occasion to throw some light, if possible, on the problem of controlling the apple blister canker, and to attempt to stir up some optimism regarding the future plight of the disease in the state. The extent of the information which I will be able to give at this time will be measured by the results of our researches on the canker during the past three years. I believe we all have a common interest in the disease and feel that it should by all means be made the object of very careful study. Those of you who have visited most of the fruit sections of the state realise that the blister canker is to be found in fully 96 or 97 per cent of the Nebraska orchards. Considering the fact that the first evidence of the canker in Nebraska was found during the season of 1903, we have be - fore us a remarkable record for a fungous disease, inasmuch as a verit - able fungous scourge rarely develops in so short a period. But this is not optimism. I realize of course in presenting what we believe to be the beat method of combating the canker that the range which the discussion </seg>
            <seg id="p066">60 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY should take is determined by the interests of different types of orchard ists. Some of you are operating large orchards and conducting them as a special business; others of you are farmers who regard the home orchard from a slightly different standpoint and not many, perhaps, find time to subject the orchard to the sedulous scrutiny that it de - mands. While I do not consider it good policy to make ironclad rules and fixed limits in orchard pathology, I believe, in the case under con - sideration, that it is the part of wisdom to actually prescribe regarding control measures; yet it should be remembered that a practice adopted today may later be succeeded by a newer and better practice. At the outset, we may conclude that some knowledge of the nature of the canker organism is indispensable to a successful eradication of canker. A Proficient Tree Doctor Most all orchardists are forced to give personal attention to the canker problem, directly or indirectly. The transient laborer is much more unprofitable than the hired steady worker, and except for a pro - ficient foreman, the latter is a failure in cleaning the orchard of canker The question of a proficient foreman or a tree doctor is what I wish to call your attention to first. It is my belief that some sort of a tree doctor should be stationed in the orchard, and in him vested the re - sponsibility of attending all cases of blister canker. Such a servant should be required to qualify his position by a reasonable knowledge ot* not only canker, but other fruit diseases as well, and if he is the right man he will abundantly justify his position. He must realize that the blister canker as well as other fungous pests are caused by tangible agents — miscroscopic plants, or 'Fungi." so-called, and furthermore, he must be able to recognize the symptoms and remedies for each of these troubles. In the case of blister canker he will recognize that the dis - ease is manifested by a destruction of the bark, which results in ill wilting symptoms on the part of the leaves, and (2) in a general un - healthy abnormal appearance due to a failure 01 food to reach certain parts of the tree. This appearance is solely the result of an interfer - ence with sap circulation and is only too frequently confused with "sun scald" or winter injury. But upon close examination the blister canker will be seen to exhibit characters which distinguish it markedly from sun scald or other maladies, the marks of distinction being the spore - producing bodies of the canker. These bodies are round, rather hard and brittle and extend through the bark, where they attach themselves firmly to the wood. Sometimes on old wood the bark sloughs off, leav - ing them exposed and conspicuous. Moreover, when they are removed by scraping or by other means, there remains certain very character - istic, black circles, which, together with those facts just mentioned, constitute unmistakable means of identification. </seg>
            <seg id="p067">BLISTER CANKER CONTROL 61 Kidding the Orchard of Blister Canker. The first problem to be met with in going Into an orchard with the idea of clearing out the canker is the extent to which a tree may be cankered and still admit of successful treatment. Since the treatment consists of pruning and not spraying, we have to consider two Impor - tant points, viz. : ( 1 ) the task of removing all the canker at once, and (2) the vitality of the tree and the effect on the yield of fruit. For example, suppose we have a tree whose symmetry is made up of nine large limbs, six of which bear one-year-old cankers. To sever the six limbs would mean the removal of all the cankers and obviously most all of the tree; but it would also mean an injury to the tree sufficient to render it impractical for further use. We should, therefore, resort to a thorough scraping, and attempt to preserve all the limbs if possible. At any rate, I believe that in all such cases the slogan should be "heraus mit" the canker even at the sacrifice of the tree or some of its parts. Whether pruning or scraping is to be adopted, depends upon the size of the canker and its location relative to the tree. The scraping is made easy by the use of a curved 2-inch gouge and a scraper. The best scraper I have found consists of a curved blade about 4V4 inches long and 1*4 inches wide, with the two handles attached at least 4 inches higher than the sharp edge so as to avoid scraping the fingers against the limb. The scraping should not be less than one-fourth or one-half inch deep, and the adjoining healthy bark should be cut away two and sometimes three inches in order to make sure of getting all the fungous threads. The upper and lower extremities of the canker should also be made to terminate in a pointed manner in order to prevent any dying back of the bark. However, in spite of these precautions some treatments will prove unsuccessful and require, therefore, subsequent attention in order to de - tect them. Examinations should be made the year following your treat - ments of scraping and pruning and all the new growths of canker which appear at the edges of the wounds should again be scraped. This is to be expected because of our inability to see just how far the fungous threads penetrate the bark. I should not regard a treatment successful until it had endured for at least two years in a healthy state. My experience has been that it will show up within two years, if it Is likely to at all. Those cankers which are much too extensive to be scraped practi - cally and successfully must be cut out. Frequently we find it necessary to resort to both pruning and scraping in order to remove the disease. I believe it is impractical to scrape a limb if the canker extends more than half way around it. I am convinced that scraping cankers of this size is much less dependable than cutting out the entire limb. Our ex - periments have shown, and it Is reasonable to suppose, that in cutting out cankered limbs on which the cankers are remote from the cuts </seg>
            <seg id="p068">62 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY fully 95 per cent of the treatments are successful; i. e., there is no further growth of canker even after a period of two years. But we find a considerable less number of successful treatments in cases where the cut is made through the canker rather than remote from it, and logi - cally so, because in such instances the threads of the canker fungus have proceeded below the point at which we severed the limb and con - sequently will continue growth. It often becomes necessary to sacrifice healthy members of the tree in order to cut out those fungous threads, but this sacrifice should be looked upon as distinctly advantageous and advisable. Treatments for Wound*. l*p to this point we have t-onsidered briefly the matter of removing cankers from the tree. We shall now take up the matter of wound treatment which is essentially a precautioning measure. The first step is the disinfection of wound surfaces. It consists in treating wounds with a disinfectant that will destroy all fungous spores that may be on the wound-surface and at the same time effect no injury to the cam - bium or bark. I have found carbolic acid mixture (1 part acid to 100 parts water) to give very promising results, particularly in aiding the wounds to heal. Corrosive sublimate (1 part to 1,000 parts water) is also highly satisfactory. It is convenient to buy this from the druggist in tablet form. It is a violent poison and should be used with reason - able care. Formic aldehyde ( II per cent solution in water) is a very good disinfectant, recommended especially for the sterilization of pruning tools as well as for wound surface. The second step in caring for wounds consists in securing a sub - stantial covering for them. The important role which the dressing performs is that of keeping out disease organisms. It is of course a matter of fact that the blister canker cannot gain a foothold except that a spore of the causal fungus finds a favorable lodging place on a limb. Fresh wounds made in pruning and other orchard practices fur - nish very favorable places through which the disease may take hold It is usually a relatively easy matter to trace a canker to the wound through which the original infection took place. Under Nebraska con - ditions the first production of spores occurs sometimes as early as April and are generally distributed in abundance thereafter, especially during the months of July, August and September. Emphasis must, therefore, be laid upon the matter of covering all open wounds in order to render them impervious to the invading spores of the canker. A considerable number of preparations have been used by orchard - ists as profitable wound covers, yet many of the paint mixtures have been used largely on account of their convenience and availability rather than their merit as permanent dressing. Any wound dressing is satis - factory if it is inexpensive and covers the entire wound, forming thereby a layer impervious to air and water. Preparations of asphaltum yield better results than any with which I have worked. The commercial "By - erlite," sold by Byerley and Sons, Cleveland. Ohio, makes a very good </seg>
            <seg id="p069">DISCUSSION 63 covering if liquefied by Unseed oil. That which we used had a boiling point of about 280° F. The asphaltum was conveniently melted by a plumber's gas torch and the linseed oil then added until a proper con - sistency was obtained. This furnished a dressing quite satisfactory in nine cases out of ten. In addition to linseed oil, such things as gaso - line or naphtha are much in favor as solvents, on account of their low cost and availability. There is also a commercial grade of "liquid asphaltum" on the market which has been reported by some to give very satisfactory results. I have had no experience with it as a dress - ing, however. At any rate the essential features of a proper covering should be remembered in using any preparation, and if you are using something that gives satisfaction, do not give it up in favor of some other preparation until it has been shown to be inferior. As a matter of fact the real merits of any dressing depends greatly on the manner and frequency of the applications. There is no longer any question but that the covering of wounds, both large and small, constitutes a most important phase of the problem of canker control. The keynote to success involves two principal tasks, viz., isolation and prevention. Naturally one of the first steps in isolating the canker is the removal of all sources of fungous spores. These sources as you know consist of diseased parts, varying in size from small twigs to whole tree trunks. They endanger the remainder of healthy trees, whether they are still standing in place or lying in state not far remote from the orchard. Finally, it may be added that the question of controlling the blister anker resolves itself ultimately into a question of ( 1 ) knowing the disease, (2) skillfully scraping and pruning cankered limbs, (3) suc - cessfully disinfecting and covering all wounds, and (4) exercising a systematic and persistent vigilance over such treatments. I am con - vinced that the disease is controllable and believe that through a com - bined co-operative interest we will have the disease in check. I would not hesitate to go into a reasonably infected orchard with the confidence that it could be brought to a healthy state and maintained healthy thereafter. Shows pictures on the screen.) IMscu.ss.ion. Mr. Berlin: I would like to ask if anybody has tried salt around pear trees. I have heard that salt will cut your pear blight. Professor Vasey: I would regard it as unsuccessful, just theoreti - cally, because the salt water will kill out your grass. Q. I was going to mention the commercial asphaltum, and I know it is a treatment which is good because 1 have seen it used. Mr. Williams: When I used the asphaltum it had hardened some by standing, and I just used a little turpentine to soften it up and it was a good treatment. It costs sixty to seventy-five cents a gallon. Professor Vasey: Asphaltum is a good treatment, and it only coats one, two or three cents a pound, but the linseed oil is the expensive </seg>
            <seg id="p070">64 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOC1ETY part of that treatment. We melted the asphaltum first at a tempera - ture of 280 degrees and then we applied one part or asphaltum to two and one-half parts of linseed oil and that held it to a consistency which gave the best results. Q. You did not show any illustration of where you used corrosive sublimate as a treatment. A. We used that as a disinfectant. One part of corrosive sublimate to one thousand parts water. Then another treatment was of carbolic acid, one part to one thousand parts of water, and the third one was formaldehyde. We found in those cases that the healing was stimu - lated, and in every case was much better than where the chloride of mercury or the formaldehyde disinfectants were used. Mr. Pollard: Do you think it is better to do that than to mix the disinfectant in the paint? A. Here is the point in disinfection. You will not treat the wounds shortly after they have been made, especially if there is any exudation from the wounds, and if ) r ou leave the wounds a day or two before you put on your dressing, you must sterilize it, because there may be spores lodged there and if you cover it over they will germinate. Q. Well, couldn't you use a disinfectant dressing:? A. What disinfectant dressing would you use Q. Such as the dressing they told us to use up to the station A. What was that? Q. Corrosive sublimate paint. Our theory has been that the disin - fectant and the paint would destroy any germs that might be in the wound. A. It would do that if it was there in sufficient amount to affect the spores. Mr. Pollard: You think it would be better though to paint the wound with disinfectant immediately before you treat it? A. Yes. sir A Member: You think it is better to disinfect with carbolic acid A. We prefer that, because we got better healing A Member: Well, is there anything in the chemical combination of the oil and acids of the corrosive sublimate that would in any way de - tract from the effect of those for disinfectant purposes? A. Well, if he uses oil residues, which I suppose he did, the mer cury chloride would be effective with those compounds. Mr. Williams: If you dissolve your corrosive sublimate, one to one thousand parts of water, that would not mix well with the paint, and that would be an argument against the mixture. A Member: I would like to ask one or two questions regarding the life history of this spore. Say the spores are given off sometime in April, and in July and August. How long wil) the spores live, if they do not come In contact with a live tree? Professor Vasey: It is hard to say precisely, but these spores may maintain their vitality for six or eight or ten months, depending upon </seg>
            <seg id="p071">DISCUSSION 65 the extent to which they are protected. They may be liberated later on and set up an infection. Q. If they were liberated any time within six or eight months, it would give them a chance to set up an infection? A. You refer to the summer spore, do you? Q. Well, this summer spore, take that. If you scrape them off and let them lie in the orchard for eight months' time, there to be blown around by the wind, to infect the rest of your orchard, I should think that as much attention would have to be paid to getting rid of those spores as to the disinfecting the place where you cut off the limb. Mr. Val. Keyser: I don't think this man's point is well taken at all. He doesn't seem to understand the nature of the disease and the treat - ment we have to get at in order to practically control the disease. We can control the apple scab, and I don't care how bad it is in an orchard, you go in there and spray thoroughly and you can practically control it. tor we have done it time and time again by spraying in one season. It might be impossible and impractical in breaking up all those spores to save them, but if you treat the wound later on you have done all you can practically do to control the canker, and I don't think his point is well taken at all. A Member: Well, wasn't that the question that Mr. Pollard made a moment ago? If this is an answer to his question, then I am answered entirely. I'rofVssor Vasey: It is very hard to state a definite time for the life history or the life activity of th'ese spores. I mentioned eight months. They vary considerably, and should they live these eight months, this summer spore time, it would be under conditions that pro - tect them. But there is another kind of spore that can produce the disease, and we will call it a winter type spore, which lives over winter without any trouble at all and this variety maintained for a consider - able length of time. If you scrape off the bark which contains these spore-producing bodies, then you are laying bare a means or source of infection, because you are simply putting them on the ground and they may spread from there as well as they may from the tree. But if you scrape out the canker tissue which is not producing the fruiting bodies, then you may throw that on the ground as well as anywhere, because nothing can spread from it. Mr. Pollard: I want to ask a question right there. I have always understood that these spores only ripened or fruited along in July or the first of August. My understanding was that if we cut off these spores on the infected part of the tree before they matured, the cutting off killed the spores, and there wasn't any danger of it going onto the ground, and that the source of that in the plant was gone and it died. Professor Vasey: If the part cut off does not contain the fruiting bodies, then you are isolating the spores. Q. Well, the point I am trying to get at is this, when you take out this diseased part from the tree, you take away its food, and when you 3 </seg>
            <seg id="p072">66 separate it from the tree, does it die or does it go ahead and develop? A. The part you would remove from the tree is sufficient to furnish all the nourishment the spore would need for its development. Mr. Smith: Well, in the case of a dead limb, would there be any infection taken from that? A. Yes, sir; there is still a source of infection between those dead limbs that you have removed. Mr. Williams: Would you advise burning then of those limbs you had destroyed? A. Yes, sir; remove them from the vicinity of the orchard and burn them Is the best method to destroy this infection. LMr. Smith: I have made some experiments along that line under direction of the station here some three years ago, and since that I have followed it up upon my own account. The experience that I have gained is that if we can locate those cankers the first year, we can al - most certainly control them, but after those little lumps come on there, it shows they are two years old or older, and they are pretty nearly sure to take the limb if you let them alone on the tree. They are pretty hard to remove, although I have removed some and cured them. I have experimented on one limb about three inches in diameter, that only had two or three inches left of bark on the lower side. The canker had girded it, with the exception of the lower part of the limb. It seems to me that there should be some action taken by the fruit growers of this state along the line of legislation. Now, there is a body of fruit growers here who are interested enough to come to these meetings. I will confine myself to this subject which we are on. I should like a little more Jight along the line of the proper paint to use. Mr. Pollard has given the most practical thing I have heard here this afternoon. The asphaltum is all right in a large orchard, but. gentle - men, give us something that is practical for the small orchard man who has one hundred or two hundred or three hundred trees. He is not in a position to go and buy this stuff and heat it with a certain tempera - ture with a great deal of trouble and expense. What he needs is some - thing that is already prepared on the market for direct remedy or application to be made without much trouble or expense. There are lots of men who have small orchards who will apply a remedy if it is at hand, but they will not take the trouble to go and melt up a lot of tar or asphaltum and the different things that is necessary for that combination, because something that we can apply cold is easy, and something that we can apply as easy as possible is the most effective remedy which we can use, because we will all use it. Professor Vasey: The most practical thing for the small orchard ink is this commercial liquid asphaltum. You can buy it ready to ly and it is inexpensive, and it is efficient, too. I have seen experi - ments and treatments that have been very successful. We have not Kit in our work, but I have seen places where it has been used and were successful. </seg>
            <seg id="p073">Nebraska apple trees produce abundant crops of high quality fruit. </seg>
            <seg id="p074">67 Mr. Smith: Do you mean that is to take the place of the paint'.' A. Yea, sir; that is the treatment. That is sufficient to keep out the fungous spores. Not only this canker fungus, but any fungus. It does not take the place of a disinfectant however. A Member: What is the relative cost of that asphaltum as com - pared to the oil that you speak of? A You mean the linseed oil and asphaltum Q. Yes, sir A. The asphaltum you can secure for two or three cents a pound. It is from a firm in Cleveland, Ohio, I don't know the name now. And the linseed oil will sell from fifty cents to a dollar. Q. I would like to ask a question. Do I understand that when I cut that wound or limb, if I would use carbolic acid and then the next •lay swipe the wound over, that that would be all right? A. I would not disinfect until I applied the treatment, because the pore may come in contact with the wound after you have applied this disinfectant Q. Well, when you are trimming a tree all the wounds that you make, aren't they liable to be infected? A. Yes, sir; they are the most favorable means of infection, and they should all be covered and kept covered. Your first problem is to isolate, and I have given you briefly some of the best methods that we have for isolating. And after you have isolated, you must keep it up. I should do it just as soon as the wound is dry. You won't have any success in treating wounds from which there is exudation of any sort. A Member: Well, as a practical question, could you start out a new orchard and keep out the canker? A. Yes, I would not hesitate at all to start a new orchard around badly infected orchards. I don't think it is discouraging at all. because when you are starting your orchard it is a matter of prevention and care in your pruning and the treating of your trees Mr. Pollard, Sr. : Will the canker attack a tree, a healthy clean tree, without a wound? V It will not, as far as we know. A Member: I would like to make one more remark In regard to that. You may be making a wound and not realize that you have a wound In my own orchard, nearly all the trees in the orchard are infected, and I think this was caused by bruising the bark or wounding the tree by climbing the tree to get off the fruit. That is what I think caused it. The Chairman: Now, I want to say as a horticulturist and one who knows just a smattering about pathology, that I think this society should congratulate Mr. Vasey for the way that he has handled this subject. I think that he is on the right track. The pathological depart - ment is a very important department and he is a practical man in the field, studying this subject in a practical way.

Yet the abundant supply of moisture has produced bountiful crop* of fruit Where the proper </seg>
            <seg id="p081">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 74 care was given fungus and insect pests were kept under control. No care and haphazard methods alike produce an abundant crop of fungous covered fruit which brought the prices to a low level. The outlook for commercial fruit culture when given proper care was never brighter than at this time. The vegetable grower has had large yields and fair prices. The abundant supply of moisture has produced a wonderful growth in trees, shrubs and flowers, so that some magniflcient landscape pictures could be found in riding over Nebraska. From a horticultural standpoint Nebraska has been well blessed and has a very bright future. The work of the office during the past year has been directed toward acquiring and disseminating the information that would help to make Nebraska fruit and vegetable growers produce a better crop which would sell for more money and to help make more people ac - quainted with Nebraska's possibilities as a horticultural state and with products of her fruit, vegetable and flower gardens.

            <seg id="p088">80 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Mr. Keyser: The first subject upon the program for this morning is by Professor R. F. Howard, of the University of Nebraska, upon the ■abject "Clean Fruit." CLEAN FRUIT, By It. F. Howard, Department of Horticulture, University of Nebraska. When the settlers in the New England states planted orchards from grafted trees or seeds brought from Europe they were able to grow fruit from them almost entirely free from insect and fungous blemishes. This condition of affairs existed to a greater or less extent for several generations. During this time apple growing as a iim - mercial enterprise became fairly well established in many of the Atlantic coast states. Nurseries were started, many new American varieties having their origin from desirable seedlings were propagated and disseminated. When civilization gradually began to move westward after the opening of the Erie canal in 1825 orchards were planted in western New York, Pennsylvania and Ohio. The success of these early orchards caused an added stimulus to planting during the decade from 1850 to 1860. It was when these orchards reached bearing age — about 1875 to 1880 — that apple scab and other diseases first began to be a menace to apple growing in America. These pests became so prevalent aboui that time that they not only had the effect of checking the growth of orchard planting but history tells us that many of the discouraged growers actually cut out their fruit trees. It was about this time that a great advance in our knowledge in fungicides was made, which did more to place apple growing on a firm basis than any one discovery has done since. I have reference to the discovery of Bordeaux mixture. When some of our native American grape diseases were introduced into Europe, they threatened to destroy the grape growing industry in France. Our American grape mildew was so destructive on the European species of grapes that the European growers soon saw that it was a matter of finding some method of con - trol or their vineyards would be destroyed. This stimulated research in this field. It was Professor Millardet, of Bordeaux, France, who is given credit for having perfected a fungicide that not only controlled the grape diseases in France but one that has since been the chief weapon against most of the fungous pests of our horticultural irops in America. He had been working for some time in an attempt to dis - cover some means of controlling the grape mildew when his attention was attracted to an unusually vigorous vineyard in the vicinity of Bordeaux, where he was working. Upon inquiring he found that the owner had made a mixture of lime and blue vitriol which he had applied to the leaves. This grape grower's object in doing this was to make the school children believe it was dangerous to take the fruit from his vines. This was in the fall of 1882. The following year </seg>
            <seg id="p089">81 Professor Millardet followed up the suggestion offered by this vineyard and perfected what we now know as Bordeaux mixture. About two or three years later the U. S. Department of Agriculture demonstrated its value as a fungicide and it was then rapidly intro - duced a» an orchard spray. The growers soon saw in it a means of controlling the diseases in their orchards, and the result has been that the planting of apple orchards since that time has not been checked on account of not having a satisfactory fungicide for controlling the diseases that attack our fruit. Owing to differences in season, moisture, etc., we have found that Bordeaux mixture should not be used similarly in all sections of the country. For instance, a spray schedule that is adapted for controlling the diseases in Michigan or south Missouri is not the best schedule for eastern Nebraska. It has been necessary for each fruit growing section to work out a combination of sprays best adapted for its own condi - tions, and for the particular diseases it has to combat. Perhaps it has been due largely to this fact that other fungicides have been worked out and that they have been found to be better adapted to some locali - ties than to others. We have seen lime-sulphur come into prominence as a substitute for Bordeaux within the past six or seven years. The Nebraska Experiment Station was one of the first to compare its efficiency with Bordeaux in controlling apple scab. Many of the grow - ers in the state have used both. I fear some of us have been a little hasty in condemning one and accepting the other. Might it not be that we need them both? Allow me to briefly review what I consider our chief problems in growing clean fruit in Nebraska. The apple scab i Venturia pomi) is probably our most rerious fungous pest. The codling moth worm is our most injurious insect pest. There are other enemies of the orchard that must be taken into account. The curculio will render a considerable portion of our apple crop unfit for a commercial pack unless it is held in check. Sooty blotch ( Leptothyrium pomi) or fly-speck fungus is a minor disease that does considerable damage on a moist season. The apple blotch ( Phyllosticts solitaria) is a disease that has already established itself in many Nebraska orchards. It is perhaps the most serious fruit attacking fungus with which we have yet had to deal. The entomologists and pathologists have worked out the life histories of these insects and diseases. They have pointed out to us how these insects and diseases must pass from one stage to another in order to complete their life cycle. We know, for Instance, that the early infections of apple scab come from the dried leaves under the trees, where the disease has passed the winter; we know that the curculio must go into the soil in midsummer to transform from the worm to the beetle; and we know that the apple blotch, unlike the scab, passes the winter on the young twigs. With all of this informa - tion at hand it is for us as horticulturists to get the proper combina- </seg>
            <seg id="p090">82 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY tions of sprays and to apply them when they will do the maximum amount of good. It has been demonstrated repeatedly that the same conditions that cause the apple tree to make sufficient growth to burst the cluster buds and open its first leaves will also cause the first Infection of apple scab to appear, provided the source of infection is at hand. We know that under normal conditions it is necessary to keep the fruit and foliage covered with fungicides from this time until about the first of July if we are to have a clean crop. We know from experience that on an abnormal year, like 1915, that it is not sufficient to put on these applications from time to time as the fruits increase in size and addi - tional leaves are made, but that it is necessary to spray at least once more late in the summer if the moisture conditions are favorable for the development of late infections. It will be seen then that normally scab may be controlled by thorough sprayinp the forepart of th&lt;- kfow ing season. Three applications are usually sufficient, one just before the flowers open, another immediately after the flowers drop and a third about two weeks later. When cool, damp weather conditions prevail until midsummer a fourth application in July is necessary. Let us look into the habits of apple blotch and see in what way it differs from scab. First, instead of wintering over on the dead leaves, it is carried over from one season to another by means of twip Infec - tions. Second, instead of producing spores to infett the leaves and fruits, before blooming time, it begins about three or four weeks after the flowers are off. Third, instead of stopping growth about midsum - mer on a normal year, that is when it does most of its damage. At least two applications are necessary to control this disease if it is established in the orchard. The first one should be applied about three weeks after the flowers are off, the second about three weeks later. For susceptible varieties like Northwestern Greening, Missouri Pippin and Ben Davis a third application should be applied about three weeks after the second. Winesap, Jonathan and Grimes' Golden are very resistant to blotch and there is some doubt as to the advisability of spraying them for this disease. It is evident from the above statements that normally we must depend upon early applications to control scab and late application? to control blotch. The experience of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, as well as all of the state experiment stations that have worked with this disease, has been to show that Bordeaux mixture is more effective in control - ling It than lime-sulphur. You may Bay that Bordeaux is apt to russet your fruit. Since it has been shown that practically all russetlng due to Bordeaux is caused by the calyx application, and since blotch does not develop until three or four weeks after the flowers are off, it is not necessary to use Bordeaux until the application that follows the calyx spray. The point I wish to make clear is that the fungicides for those orchards now having blotch should consist of lime-sulphur for the </seg>
            <seg id="p091">83 cluster bud and calyx applications to be followed by at least two ap - plications of Bordeaux, the first one two to three weeks after the calyx spray and the second about three weeks later. This gives us a schedule that should not only control scab and blotch, hut assures us of having a crop at picking time practically free from Bordeaux russet. I have assumed in this discussion that an insecticide, preferably lead arsenate, should be included in the spray schedule beginning with the calyx application. My experience has been that 2% pounds of the paste or one-half that amount of the powdered form is sufficient. The above schedule if properly applied should control sooty blotch or ilv-speck fuun Since the adult curculio is a light feeder and since the egg is de - posited within the apple, spraying will at best only partially control this pest. Cultivation is a more effective means of control, because it is necessary for the larva to go into the ground about midsummer to transform to the beetle stage. The average grower is apt to estimate the value of spraying by the amount of clean fruit he has at harvest time. I have talked to men who never think of the effect spraying has upon the tree itself. That the spray materials will keep the foliage green and hold it on the tree, Indirectly making another crop possible, never occurs to them. Furthermore, when an orchard is sprayed well enough to prevent leaf infections of scab and twig infections of blotch on a given year, the battle is half won for the following crop, because there is no source of infection. The past season was an excellent one for demonstrating the cumulative effect of good spraying. This was illustrated in Mr. Gus Beavers' orchard near South Omaha. Despite the fact that last season was unusually favorable for the development of scab the check trees in his orchard left unsprayed had only 12 or 15 per cent of the fruits scabbed. This was due to the excellent treatment these trees had received the past five years, bpr-ai'se an orchard that had I thun a half mile ;r.vay. yielded by actual count over per cent scabbed fruits Let us not forget in our attempts to grow clean fruit that it is not unly necessary tor us to know when and what to use as spray materials but that intelligent pruning and cultural methods are equally im - portant. Discussion. The Chairman: This subject is now open for discussion, and any questions you want to ask Professor Howard, for I know there are a good many of us that do not raise clean fruit, the professor will b - glad to answer them. Professor Howard has accomplished what he recommends in his paper. All you need to do is to go over to the - exhibit and see for yourself. Not only the selected ones like Mr. Marshall brought down here, but take them out of the several barrels and you can get a clean apple from almost any place. He has fifty •fii &gt;praye&lt; </seg>
            <seg id="p092">84 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY boxes of fruit as an illustration of the kind of fruit a man can grow when he tries to grow clean fruit. I hope that you will ask him ques - tions about this subject. Mr. Smith: This year the wasps caused me lots of trouble; they would sting the fruit, and as far as I could see there were no nesU io the trees, but at the same time there seemed to be a lot of them in the air and around the fruit and I would like to know some way to get rid of them. They caused me to lose 100 barrels of Jonathans '.his year. Professor Howard: That is beyond me, I could not tell you about wasps. I really have never accused a wasp of stinging an apple. Now , it may be that a wasp is like some of these other insects; maybe he is parading around under false colors. It took us a long time to get next to the codling moth, and finally an entomologist got next to him and found that he was responsible for all this, but I am of the opinion that apples were punctured by some other insects. Mr. Smith: The reason that I have accused the wasp is that a grower over in the southeastern part of Iowa told me over a year ago that he always made a systematic cleaning of his orchard and burned all the wasp nests, because he said that the wasps did sting his fruit there. A Member: When is the best time for the first spray for apple Professor Howard: I assume that this is what we call a fruit bud scab? i indicating i. When this has made growth enough to burst its cluster and send these shoots out, and it seems to have begun to pul! apart, that is, lust before the individual flowers open and before the calyx opens, that is the time. Perhaps you can see the pink petals in there; then I consider that the proper time to put on the first spray for apple scab. This is much more important in some years than in others, depending upon the moisture conditions during the few days following that stage. I have seen it when that application was most important, and then on the other hand I have seen times that that application was not no im - portant. A Member: I see by the Rural New Yorker that in the east they ■pray sometimes in advance of that, but that is mostly for scale, isn't it? Do you think that any spray ahead of that would do any good, that is, spraying the limbs and all that sort of thing, the bark, etc., and all? Professor Howard: That brings us up to the question of dormant ■pray*. Any application of spray before that spray I would term a dormant spray. And your tree is near enough devoid of foliage at the first application, that you can spray the tree and the limbs for the fungicide, and at that time I think it is a very good time to spray all the branches, because you can do it at that time better than any other time later on. I would not recommend the dormant spray, unless one had San Jose scale or oyster-shell scale in the orchard. A Member: Is the dost spray supposed to be as good as the liquid? </seg>
            <seg id="p093">85 Professor Howard: We thought we had that decided eight or ten years ago, when certain men were discouraging dust sprays. We thought we had decided that wet sprays were the best. Now, it seems to be coming back Into Importance again. I have not tried them out myself to know whether or not they are better than the liquid sprays, so I really would not know the reason that the dust sprays are coming A Member: I suppose it is a matter of mechanical application and chemical combination? Professor Howard: Yes, sir, partially, and then, too, I should say that in all cases of dust sprays, if they are put on as dust, it would depend somewhat on whether or not they adhered to the foliage rapidly. Mr. Westgate: Did you ever find out anything about what caused those heavy creases on the Jonathan apple, the one you remember that I showed you out to the State Farm? A. I don't recall now; where were they? Q. They were creases in the apple that ran up towards the stem. A. I don't just recall your specimen. Q. It was just like a rose. The one I had was like a good many of your Jonathans. There was half a dozen and sometimes more heavy indentures up and down the apple. A. No, I could not tell you what caused that. A Member: I had a tree that had about a dozen limbs with just such wrinkles as that. It wasn't anywhere else In the orchard or any- where else on the same tree. A. I don't know anything about that. A Member: Is the dry lime-sulphur as efficient as the paste? A. I have not tried that out sufficiently to make a definite state - ment. I have talked with some that have used it, but I do not believe I have heard anyone say it is better. Q. They say to use this paste with water, but I was wondering if it was as efficient as they claim. A. I could not tell you about that; I have not tried it out. Mr. Smith: I am interested in the question asked by that young man over there. He speaks about the wasps injuring his apples. For two years at least I was under the same impression that the wasps were stinging my apples, particularly the Jonathan and Northwest Greening, and I made an investigation as closely as I could In regard to it. I was on the lookout all the time, and the only insect I was able to find at the time that was bothering those punctures was the wasp. The puncture was a little round hole that would run from the size of a mustard seed to a pea. And they are larger under the skin of the apple. By being on the outlook for this defect, which is very serious in my orchard, and In fact the most serious thing I have to contend with, I have on three or four occasions found a little insect belonging in the grasshopper or katydid family. 1 have examined all </seg>
            <seg id="p094">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 86 the books and reports I have and I never have seen or found anything in connection with this insect. He is a little fellow about three-eighths of an inch long. A full grown one or adult would be about a half an inch long in the body. The wings are of a greenish hue and trans - parent. He has a long neck, with the eating jaws of a grasshopper, and he sinks his neck down in the puncture and rims out the apple after the puncture has been made. I have found at least three of those, and that was one of the questions I was going to put to Pro fessor Howard for information, to see what we could do about it and to see if he knew any remedy. The regular applications for the other insects do not seem to control this boy. In one instance I found one of these insects in the leaves. By some means in the pruning I put a cluster of leaves on the ground and one of these insects was on the ground. Professor Howard: I must say that Mr. Smith should have been an entomologist. From your description I am unable to tell you what insect you had hold of. Mr. Williams: It is called the snowy tree cricket Professor Howard: Maybe I don't know anything about tha' Mr. Smith: This insect goes back to the same place to feed. The&gt; work particularly on the inside of the tree, and after the puncture is made, they will find a new place. You do not And them in the daytime, and the only time I was able to find these would be along in the even - ing; they commenced about sundown. I would find them when I was working in the orchard late. The wasps gathered around these punc - tures, and very frequently you woul.l find the wasp surkint: ihf juice from the apple at the place where they are punctured. He may puncture them also, but I discovered that the wasps go to these broken places to get their feed. Professor Howard: I am of the opinion that the wasps gather there for the same reason that ants visit places where there is sweet - ness. They are there for the honey or su;&lt;ar that they can pet. I would make this as a general statement. I would suggest that when you catch any insect like that, to be sure that we can identify him correctly, put him in a little box and send it to Professor Bruuer. He will look at the insect and tell you what it is and we will know then all about it. and how it feeds, etc., and its life history, and when we know its life history we can tell where the best point of attack is. We can attack some insects most effectively in the adult stage and some in the larvae stage. I would like to say this in regard to many insects that bother us in the orchard, aside from the codling moth. Any system of orchard management that will tend to keep that orchard clean and to keep the weeds and insects out of the orchard and the trash piles will also tena to control the harm done by these insects. I would also like to make this as a general statement. I have seen up in your section of the country, Mr. Smith, in trees two to three and four years old, those trees almost ruined by the Buffalo tree hopper. Any system that will tend to keep the pests away from that orchard will lessen that damage. </seg>
            <seg id="p095">DISCUSSION 87 KMr. Smith: Well, will the keeping down of the foliage, after they » get Into the orchard, reduce them and keep them down? A Member: This question of the waap. I think that the waap does more good than harm. I think that while they may be around the orchard, nevertheless they live upon other insects that are harmful. I Professor Howard : This is apple blotch that I am speaking of now. sure that you can distinguish it from the scab. Here is a case of It this apple (indicating). It attacks Northwestern Greening and the i Davis and their varieties more than others. It develops later on in the season, and it is not necessary to spray for that early in the season. The first spores for infection are not disseminated early in the season. It very seldom tends to make larger cankers on the old wood, but it attacks the new wood and makes small cankers. It is tut unlike the blister canker in that respect. After it is once established in the orchard, pruning is very necessary in order to get at the source of the infection, and a proper spray, even if you have the proper mix - ture in the orchard, Bordeaux mixture is the proper spray to use. A Member: How late is it necessary to spray in order to get rid of the apple blotch? A. Last year it was necessary to spray in September, but in a normal year, I should say with Bordeaux mixture or lime-sulphur, about the last of July, or near the first of August would control it In a normal year it is controlled along with the applications that we put on for scab. We found that lime-sulphur was sufficient to control this, while it would not control scab. Scab is deeper than this is. But this blotch will cause a cracking of the skin as rapidly as apple scab. A Member: I met a man on a train coming up here the other day. He said that he had an elixir of life for these trees. It is a medicine that comes in a bottle, and some fellow sold it to him for $2.50 and it stops all this trouble of spraying. You make a slit in the bark of the tree at the base and insert this mixture in the base of the tree, and your troubles are all over. There ii no Insect that will attack it It goes all over the tree and into the leaves, and the blossoms and the twigs, etc., and no insect will go near it. He has several horticultural societies who are backing his project. California is one of them. Professor Howard: That is because California is the furthest away. A Member: You succeeded in growing two orchards remarkably clean this year, and I would believe it would be interesting to this audience if you would tell us your story of spraying. Professor Howard: We sprayed some of our orchard tour times aad some of it five times last season. We put lead arsenate (but that was experimental) in the first application. I would not recommend It I would recommend as the fungicide, for the first application, lime - sulphur. A Member: Would it be advisable to commence just after those buds were opening up. Some of us cannot get oyw that. We have </seg>
            <seg id="p096">88 eighty or ninety acres and it is a difficult thing under those circum stances. Professor Howard: I will tell you, I consider it much better if you can wait, and much more effective. The chief object is to get the material around the stems; and if you hare a condition that attacks these stems, you are going to have a great dropping of the fruit. As a matter of fact, in certain years you have a large dropping due to that. The scab attacks the stems of young fruits before the time they begin to swell, and unless those stems are sprayed so that you can get it around, then you are largely defeating the object of that application, in my opinion. With two outfits I should think you could get over your orchard by sunrise, up to the time the flowers were openinir up. I have sprayed trees when they are almost in full bloom. I have ne\er taken notes on that as an experiment in regard to spraying one tree when it is in full bloom and another just before and another one just after full bloom. Now, I would like to put on the second applica - tion when most of them put it on in this state, and finish it up just as rapidly as possible. Of course, all the talk that we have been making about getting it into the calyx I think is very important. I would rather omit any other application than to omit the calyx application. Lime-sulphur is, in my opinion, just as good for controlling apple scab as Bordeaux mixture, and Bordeaux russets the fruit, and it is this application where you get most of the russeting from. So the only excuse for using Bordeaux mixture is for this apple blotch that ti com - ing into the state. A Member: What do you recommend for the first spray' A. Lime-sulphur, or Bordeaux, or either one. Q. And for the second you use lime-sulphur? A. Yes, sir, by all means Q. Then after that, when it gets hotter weather, then what A. If I have apple blotch in an orchard, I would prefer the Bor - deaux mixture. You don't have a great deal of apple blotch in this state, this far north. Further on down in the corner they are getting it pretty bad. Q. Well, is there anything in spraying the latter part of July? A. I don't think you will experience much russeting due to the spray material at that time, but you are fairly apt to get what we call a spray burn. One is apt to get that from lime-sulphur. Shortly afternoon on a hot day we are apt to get that more from lime-sulphur than from anything else that you could use, and so 1 prefer Bordeaux later in the season. And if I know that blotch is in the neighborhood I prefer Bordeaux. Q. Do you recommend any cutting out of these blotch spores on the twigs, they sometimes attack limbs an inch through, don't they? A. Very seldom. A Member: There are some trees that occasionally develop the apple aphis, sometimes green and sometimes brown aphis. They come </seg>

            <seg id="p098">89 about the time of the codling moth. Generally the blossoms begin to open and remain on for about a v-eek or so, and my experience is that lime-sulphur or Bordeaux mixture do not affect those at all. Professor Howard: That is a good question, but I haven't had much occasion to find that in this state. In Wisconsin they were bothered by that, which you speak of, at the station there, and I made some tests when I was there against this aphis. If you will examine a young growth, you will find its small black eggs, and they hatch out about the time the stuff begins to swell, and it does most of its damage before the flowering time. I tried to put on an insecticide strong enough to control such as the ordinary spray does and yet kill the eggs. If you wait until they hatch, it is very difficult to kill them and not burn your young bud when it is opening. A nicotine solution will do it if you put it on before the buds have swollen enough and before the eggs have hatched. You can easily kill these bugs with that. Q. You do not recommend using it then with the first spray? A. That is too late. The aphides do most of their damage if you wait until the first scab spray. Q. It must be put on before that? A. Yes, sir. As a matter of fact 1 think we are worse scared than hurt with this aphis. I have seen them get on plum trees and just about wilt the twig, and about the time that they are going to kill the tree they quit and the tree comes out all right. Mr. Smith: I rannot say that thero was any perspective damage aa far as my own crop was concerned, but they were iu evidence. Speak - ing of the oyster-shell scale, there are occasional trees up among our associates up there where they have oyster-shell scale, where it is pretty badly infested. Of course, I think that lime-sulphur will kill it, but tell us how strong and when to put it on. A. I lost an orchard one year, but I found after I had lost it that a portion of it was very badly infested wfth oyster-shell scale. We went into that orchard just, about a week I should say. before the green begins to show in the first leaf bud and we put on a thorougb application of concentrated lime-sulphur. We diluted it about ten times as it comes in the mixture form. We have a spray there about three times as strong as you put it on for a fungicide. It begins to be active of course in a few days. I was in that orchard the following year after we put that application on those trees. A good test as to whether or not we had killed it was to look on the new growth that had bam made, and then the following year on the one and two-year-old wood, and see if they have moved up on the new wood, and see if we had done a good job. I would suggest thoroughness in spraying for oyster-shell scale, because if you give one absolutely thorough application, it is usually sufficient. The Chairman: I think that we will be obliged to draw thia sub - ject to a close, as we have three more papers, the election of officers, and a matter that we must hear Mr. Bassett on before we close the </seg>
            <seg id="p099">90 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY meeting for noon. I think the subject of spraying is one that we should spend three or four hours on. It is one of the most important of the three essential things in the growing of the apple crop, and we are liable to have to resort to spraying any time before the crop is grown. Cultivation, spraying and pruning, those are the three essen - tials for clean fruit. The next subject that we will have to pass to and one that we are interested in after we get the fruit grown is "Develop - ment of the Local Market," by Mr. A N. Ohler, of Lincoln. Nebraska. (Mr. Ohler not present.) The Chairman: It is now eleven o'clock, and it has always been the custom of the society to dispense with the reading of papers at that time and proceed to the election of officers and then hear the papers afterwards. But while the sergeant-at-arms is calling in the rest of the members, I think we will have Mr. Williams' paper on "Small Fruits for Home and Market," by Mr. L. O. Williams, of University Place, Nebraska. Mr. Williams: I don't want to take much of your time to listen to this paper, and the matter of discussion can be dispensed with of SMALL HU ITS FOH THK HOMK \M» &gt;l AltKkl By I.. O. Williams. University Place, Nebraska. This is too large a topic for me to handle satisfactorily if I treat it in the way it was handed me by the secretary. If I eliminate the "and." then by a simple transposition of the remaining words make the topic read "The Home Market for Small Fruits," it would suit my tempera - ment much better. In order to handle the subject as assigned me in a condensed manner, therefore, I shall MMM at the outset that who - ever fruits are good for the home are good for the market and vice versa. I shall, also, if I follow my natural trend of thought, em - phasize the market, and particularly the home market, phase of the subject. It is generally concerted by practical i rowers, am! I ;.m Mir. from my own experience that it is true, that the work of niitiketinj; sanlen and fruit truck is fully equal to that of growing it. My thoughts go back some forty years or more to the days of my boyhood when I began the job of learning to be a salesman. We were then located at Glen - wood, Iowa, twenty miles south of Council Bluffs and twenty-three from Omaha. It was a common thing in those days for the heavier growers to haul the bulk of their crop by wagon to these two city markets. Many a time have I answered the call of my alarm in the wee small hours of morning, pot up, fed my team, then myself, and was on my way for one of these distant markets several hours before sunup. How longingly I have watched the eastern horizon on a frosty morning wishing for "Old Sol" to hurry up and warm things up. Those were long days — from 2 A. M. to 9 or 10 P. M — that I often spent in </seg>
            <seg id="p100">91 the hauling and marketing of a single load of produce. We patronized railroads and express companies very liberally some seasons, but we found by close observation that we could compete with the latter very successfully and satisfactorily when we had a full load of fruit to market. The last season of my stay at the old home town I harvested 14,000 boxes of strawberries that were hauled mostly by wagon direct to Omaha. I paid a man $5 for each trip with his team from my berry patch to my commission man in Omaha. The berries arrived there in better condition and at a less cost per case than if they had been con - signed to the care of the express company. I have given you this brief recital of my early trials in marketing that you may see more readily the advantages of a home market. A Move Nearer the Home Market. I&gt;o you wonder that after nearly twenty years of these early ex - periences in hauling and shipping to these far-away markets that I was led to make a move toward a near-by market? At Council Bluffs, where I next located, I was within less than an hour's drive (with favorable weather and roadst of the city market. Place this one hour against five hours, multiply the difference by two and you have a saving of eight hours easily for each trip to market. If we allow but five trips to market per week, or twenty trips per month only, for six months of the year for truck and fruit grower to make, we find that he has gained just forty days of twenty-four hours each under this new move that I have described toward n near-by market. Estimating his time for self and team at $4 for a day of twelve hours and you h»y« a saving within the year of $320. Some of you may think this method of figuring rather vague. I believe my own experience more than justi - fies this estimate of saving. There is a decided advantage in being within easy reach of your market because of the closer touch you have with your dealers. You should at least be within easy telephone con - nection with your market. The Price for the Liocation. It will cost something to secure these near-by market locations, buc let us see how the extra cost will compare with the saving. We will say that the same kind of land twenty miles away from the city market can be bought for $100 per acre, where it would cost $200 within two or three miles of the same market. If I can save $320 in a year by the time gained in marketing, how long will it take me to pay thia extra thousand in the price of a ten-acre tract. The live grower who appreciates and knows how to work and hold a good market will stand a good chance to gain the additional price of several acres because of the extra prices obtained on the near-by market. Very often I hare had a picking of strawberries that would not hold up over night because of the weather conditions. When within an hour's drive of the market these perishable berries can be hurried from the field direct to the </seg>
            <seg id="p101">92 dealers and from these be dealt out to the consumers in time for their evening meal. Need for Rapid Transit The soft nature of our berry fruits require rapid transportation to market. They may be ever so carefully handled in picking, they may be placed in the cases and be ready for market in prime condition, and still be lost or seriously damaged in transit. The demand for fresh berries is very strong in our city markets. The grower who can place his strawberries on the dealer's counter within a few hours from the time they are picked has got the grower who depends on the express companies and commission men for marketing his berries beaten at tbe very start. It was my experience during my twelve years of berry growing at Council Bluff* — other things being equal or nearly so — that I could get as much for my berries at wholesale as these same dealers retailed the shipped berries for. This meant a gain of at least 50 cents per case in most instances. A well filled box of berries has a big ad - vantage in attracting a customer over the badly settled shipped box. Did you ever stand and watch the shoppers at the fruit stands or groceries as they select their berries and other fruits? How their eyes sparkle as they rest on the fresh, clean, well ripened fruits. The con - sumer with cultivated tastes will hardly stop to consider any difference in prices between the two grades of fruit -the best and freshest will be their choice regardless of the cost. Here are some raspberries shipped in but a comparatively short distance perhaps, but they have been through the hands of the baggage smashers and the commission men. and they show the juices that are oozing from the bottom of the boxes Alongside of these are some freshly picked-home urown raspberries of the same brand originally. They have the bloom of the berry still upon them and how attractive they are. The latter berries stand two chances to the other one in bringing a net profit to the grower. After the berries are gone from the market watch the grapes that come in, both those from the shippers and those from the home grow - ers. Notice the beautiful blue bloom that rests still on well-filled un - covered baskets of the home grower and compare it with the lid - covered baskets from the shippers. No matter how carefully the latter may have been packed, even though the berries on the top may not be broken, there is lacking that fullness and freshness tha* is so attrac - tive to the home grown product. The freshly filled uncovered basket has been found so attractive to the consumer who has an eye for beauty that many of the better class of dealers are willing to pay ■ bonus of two or three cents per basket for grapes that are put up in this way. Some of the growers in the vicinity of Lincoln last season used a six-pound basket, filling it up rounding so as to give this fresh, full appearance in the market. They obtained the same price for these as other grow- (iin»nmei&gt;&gt; K.nmn.l Kresh Berrie*. </seg>
            <seg id="p102">93 era received for the eight-pound basket-filled and covered in the or - dinary way. I have dwelt at considerable length on this feature of getting close to your market and of meeting the demands of the discriminating con - sumer. It is the big end of the small fruit grower's job, one that has not been studied carefully as yet. Those who have not yet learned how to grow these small fruits (the beginner's lessons) must look to other sources than this paper for their instruction. The Chairman: I suppose that we will hare have to dispense with the discussion of Mr. Williams' paper for a few minutes until the elec - tion of officers is finished. The first vice-president has now arrived. I am going to hare him take the chair and conduct the election of officers. Vice-President Hess takes the chair. The Chairman: Nominations are now in order for president for the next year. Mr. Brown: I wish to place in nomination for the next head of this society a man who has been with us off and on for a good many years; a man who is probably more responsible than any man in the state of Nebraska for the development of clean fruit; a man whom we can be proud to honor with any position in this society, and I now place be - fore you the name of Mr. Val. Keyser as a nominee for the office of president for the next year. Mr. Brown: If there are no further nominations I move that the secretary of this society be instructed to cast the unanimous ballot of this society for Mr. Keyser. Seconded. Carried Secretary casts unanimous ballot of the society for Mr. Val. Keyser. and Mr. Keyser is thereupon elected president for the ensuing year. The Chairman: The next office to be filled is that of vice-president Mr. G. A. Marshall: We should have a forest and landscape man for one of the vice-presidents. Our present incumbent served us for the last year, and as he lives in Omaha, I did not get to talk to him very much. We hare one of the board who lives here in Lincoln, and if it is agreeable all around I would like to place before you the name of Mr. Chapin for rice-president. My explanation is this, that he can handle the floral end of it and go to the fair grounds and back when - ever he wants to. The vice-president, who is one of the superintend - ents, should live in Lincoln, because the first part of the preparation of that ground, as Mr. Hess knows, is quite a lot of trouble and they have to lay that off and get it ready, and it seems to me that if Mr. Chapin had that position we could shove this off onto him. That is about all that fellow has to do, to do that and attend the board meet - ings. I am not trying to say that Chapin does not know much, but I am trying to say that we do not want to impose upon him. So I place the name of Mr. L. C. Chapin in nomination to fill this office. </seg>
            <seg id="p103">94 Mr. Brown: I move that the rules of this society be suspended and the secretary be instructed to cast the ballot of this society for Mr Chapin. Seconded and carried The secretary casts the unanimous ballot of the society for Mr Chapin, who is hereby elected for the ensuing year to the office of vice president. Chairman J. J. Hess: I think you made a good selection, and it is a good idea to have a florist for this office. As he has to do the work, it is a good thing to have a man here in Lincoln. Mr. Shubert : I nominate Mr. Howard for vice-president A Member: I move that the rules be suspended and the secretary be instructed to cast the unanimous ballot of this society for Professor Howard. Seconded and carried. The secretary casts the unanimous ballot of the society for Pro - fessor Howard, who is hereby elected for the ensuing year to the offlct of vice-president. Chairman J. J. Hess: The next nomination in order is for the oflicf of treasurer. Mr. W. A. Harrison: I would like to place in nomination the name of A. J. Brown of Geneva, who is interested in all kinds of horticulture and who is now going to start into the horticulture business for himself on a more extensive scale, and I think he would be a cood man. Mr. Brown: I think that Mr. Harrison is a little premature, and I could not give a bond for this office and there wouldn" t anybody know of me. I would like to nominate for this position our present treasurer. Mr. Peter Youngers, Jr., of Geneva. Mr. Harrison: I will withdraw my nomination of Mr. Brown Mr. Brown: I will absolutely decline the nomination anywa&gt; Mr. Christy: I move that the rules be suspended and the secretary be instructed to cast the unanimous vote of this society for Mr. Youngers. Seconded and carried. The secretary casts the unanimous ballot of the society for Mr. Peter Youngers. Jr.. of Geneva, who is hereby elected for the ensuing year to the office of treasurer. Chairman J. J. Hess: There is a vacancy on the Board of Directors. Mr. Harrison goes out and Mr. Chapin, being one of the vice-presidents, this will leave two vacant places to be filled. This board being a fruit. vegetable and floriculture board combined, I would advise you to con - sider that in making your choice and choose a man who is worthy of the place. Mr. Williams: I nominate Mr. W. A. Harrison to succeed himself Mr. Harrison: I wish to place in nomination the name of A. J Brown Chairman J. J. Hess: Are there any more nominations? </seg>
            <seg id="p104">95 Mr. Marshall: In order to facilitate matters I move that the rules be suspended and the secretary be instructed to cast the unanimous vote of this society for Mr. W. A. Harrison and Mr. A. J. Brown as directors for the short and long terms. Seconded and carried. The secretary casts the unanimous ballot of the society for Mr. W. A. Harrison and Mr. A. J. Brown, who are hereby elected for the ensuing year to the offices of the Board of Directors. Chairman J. J. Hess: That completes the election of officers. The secretary will now read the report of the auditing committee. REPORT OP AUDITING COMMITTEE. Lincoln, Neb., January 19, 1916. We, the auditing committee appointed .to audit the reports of the secretary and treasurer, have examined their reports and find them correct. C. G. MARSHALL. A. J. BROWN H. A. McCOMB. Report adopted Chairman J. J. Hess: The next paper is by Mr. Val. Keyser of Nebraska City, the subject "The Commercial Market and How Developed." DEVELOPING THE COMMERCIAL. MARKET. By Val. Keyser. Nebraska City. This looks like a big subject for a small man to tackle. However. the secretary has decided that the commercial market needs developing and has left it to the writer to show how this shall be done. The writer is almost tempted to say that an article on the philosophy of "dealing in futures" would be more appropriate at this particular time. The foundation for the development of the fruit business, of which the commercial market is an important part, lies iu the hands of the fruit grower. The grower has it in his power to build up or tear down the commercial end of the fruit business of this country. The real market for the grower's crop is the consumer, but we have come to recognize the man who buys fruit in a wholesale way, for a wholesale trade, as the commercial market. The wholesaler is an example of the big concern; his warehouse is the central point from which fruit 1* distributed. The volume of his business requires greater capital than is necessary to conduct either the business of producing or retailing the fruit. The wholesaler may sell every box or barrel of his fruit to the street vender, but the street vender is never recognized as the com - mercial fruit market. He is only a peddler. The commercial fruit market of today is not entirely governed by the law of natural supply and demand. The man who buys fruit in car - load lots for speculation cuts some ice in the fruit market of this </seg>
            <seg id="p105">96 country. The chief factor in marketing fruit on a commercial scale is the system of distributing it among the consumers. The usual route through which our fruit travels is from the grower to the wholesaler i though quite often the speculator buys the grower's fruit which he later sells to the wholesaler), from the wholesaler to the retailer, and, finally, from the retailer to the consumer. This is the established system for handling the fruit crop. Some people get ideas into their heads every once in a while that this system of distributing ought to be turned upside down. It seems to the writer that the established lines of business as we And them today which have been developed by years of experience are good and efficient: that the present system is both economical and efficient and will remain so for years to come. Naturally, we may expect development, reform and legal regulation, all of which will tend to prevent the man who stands between the producer and the consumer from getting away with too large a slice of profit Competition is a wonderful regulator and usually prevents any one concern from getting a monopoly on any particular line of the fruit business. It is the duty of every grower to study business methods, to learn the route through which his fruit travels on its way to the con - sumer. An understanding of the commercial side of the fruit business may not assist the grower in getting larger prices for his fruit, but he will be much better satisfied when he has an understanding of the real m»rket value of the particular kind and grade of fruit he has produced The speculator is a prominent factor in the market for the growers' fruit. It is the speculator who by skillful business methods points out the place in the commercial fruit business where natural supply and demand cease to govern and the speculator gets by with his rake-off. We must not regard the speculator as a menace to the fruit business. He has done a wonderful work in popularizing certain brands, building up new markets and boosting for the industry. The speculator rarely ever injures the producer, though sometimes he may work a hardship on the consumer. The most important factor which is hindering th&lt; - wholesome development of the commercial fruit market today is the grower. It is impossible to develop a market, which means creating a demand for any product, which is so inferior in quality and general condition that the producer himself would not recommend it. The time has arrived when in this country fruit that will not stand inspec - tion, fruit that will not stand up in storaee, or, at least, fruit that will not remain in good condition until it reaches the point at which it is to be distributed among the consumers, does not deserve a market and usually has trouble in finding a market. If the time ever comes when the growers can do and will do their part, then a subject such as the one assigned to the writer will be timely and most appropriate. When the fruit growers of Nebraska produce fruit which they can stand behind and recommend, fruit which will justify attractive advertising, fruit which will please the whole - saler, the retailer and the consumer, when this fruit is harvested with </seg>

Hess: Is there any discussion upon this paper. No discussion. Chairman J. J. Hess: The next paper will be "A Nebraska Hall for Achievements in Agriculture," by Mr. S. C. Bassett, of Gibbon, Nebraska. Mr. Basaett: I want to thank the Horticultural Society for the opportunity of presenting this subject here today. It is along a new line, to the horticultural people, who have been closer to agriculture than any other set which we have in the state. It is right next to agriculture and allied with us, and it is one of the oldest societies In the state, and the friendship is closer to agriculture all along the line than any one of the other twenty-two or twenty-three societies. What I have to present today might be summed up and called a history of agriculture. What we have achieved is a little different wording for it, but the history of agriculture, if we could have gathered and compiled a history of agriculture, we would know something about our Im - portance in agriculture, and what we have achieved in that direction. At Washington they have a history of a farmer, as they call it, but we flid not like the word "farmer," so we used the words "achievements in agriculture." \ NKBKASKA HALL OF AGKICX'I.TC KAL ACHIKVKMKNT. By S. C. Basnett, Gibbon, Nebraska. Its object — To gather and compile a history of achievements in griculture in the territory and state of Nebraska. Fifty years ago it was not generally believed Nebraska was or rou lil be made an agricultural state; that by means of agriculture we could support any considerable population within the borders of the state. At that date our lands were in a state of nature, the climatic conditions as affecting agriculture unknown, not realized; our agricul - tural resources and possibilities wholly unknown. The achievements of our people in the development of our agricul - tural resources in the past fifty years have been marvelous and many 4 </seg>
            <seg id="p108">98 of these achievements have, of necessity, been along lines new and original. The prosperity and happiness of our people, a realization of our ideals In civilization, our usefulness to mankind, has depended in largest measure on the development of our agriculture, and as yet no history has been compiled and written of the marvelous development of the agriculture of our state, of the achievement of our people in the interests of agriculture. As a people we have not shown due apprecia - tion of the value of sucb achievements, and the names of many of our people who have rendered valuable and lasting service to the state in the peaceful pursuits of agriculture are practically unknown, their services unrecognized. On the spur of the moment, and from memory only, let us enum - erate a few of the many achievements in the interests of agriculture, a history of which is well worthy of being recorded and their worth recognized. Beginning in the year 1850, at Fort Kearney, the keeping of an annual rainfall record, such records, state-wide in scope, continued and compiled to date and which includes the achievements of such men as Erastus Smith, Joel Hull, Prof. G. D. Swezey, and George Loveland. The achievement of R. H. Daniels, who brought from England richly bred herd of Shorthorn cattle and established a breeding her on his farm in Sarpy county in territorial days and which herd, it i understood, still exists. The achievements of Lawrence Bmner, whose studies and investi gations make us no longer fear the ravages of the migratory grass hopper, the chinch bug and other like destructive pests. tThe achievements of Doctor C. E. Bessey, such as the discovery leap and effective method for preventing smut in wheat and oat* I The achievements of many of our early settlers in the introductiot alfalfa and its successful cultivation. The achievement of our state experiment station in determining that alfalfa and corn provide a balanced ration for our live stock. The achievements of Professors H. H. Nicholson and Rachel Lloyd and Allen of Dodge county in their investigations as to the suitability of our soil and climate for the cultivation of the sugar beet. The achievement of introducing into our state and the trans-Mis - souri region of Turkey Red and other Russian wheats, which has ap - proximately doubled the returns per acre of our wheat fields. The achievement of C. C. White of Crete In determining the great value of the milling qualities of the Russian varieties of wheat. The achievements of Doctors Avery and Alvord of our State Uni - versity, in their successful efforts to make more valuable for commer - cial purposes, by a harmless bleaching process, the flour of Russian varieties of wheat. The achievements of such early settlers as Furnas, Pollard. Masters, Barnard, Allen, Williams, Harrison and others, whose strenuous </seg>
            <seg id="p109">99 efforts gave to us varieties of fruits and plants suited to our soil and climatic conditions. The achievements of such men as J. H. Rushton, George Haskell, Charles Harding, C. A. Clark and others in originating and developing the centralized method of commercial dairying. The achievements of our people, who in friendly competition at great expositions, world-wide in scope, have won distinguished honors with their exhibits of the products of their farm and herds. The achievements of students of our School and College of Agricul - ture, who in friendly competition in the Judging of live stock with students of like schools and colleges in other states have won highest honors. The achievement, greatest of all, by Doctor Charles E. Bessey, In the year 1901, in securing the enactment of a statute by our state legisla - ture providing that "The elementary principles of agriculture, including a fair knowledge of the habits and structure of plants. Insects, birds and quadrupeds," shall be taught in the rural and high schools and the normal schools of the state. The thought in mind is to establish, as a state organization, a Nebraska hall of agricultural achievement, whose principal object is set forth at the commencement of this article. That the home for such a society should be in the College of Agri - culture, State University — in the house of its friends. That on the University farm the regents of the University be asked to set apart a hall, to be known as "Nebraska Hall of Agricultural Achievement," on the walls of which, when they have finished their earthly labors, might be displayed portraits of men and women whose achievements in agriculture this society deems to warrant such public recognition; where might be displayed photos and engravings of plants and animals useful in our agriculture; where might be exhibited trophies won by individuals and state societies in friendly strife and competition in the peaceful pursuits of agriculture; where might be installed for study, information and handy reference a library devoted largely to a history of Nebraska agriculture, a history of the achieve - ments of our people in agriculture. Such a hall will have great educational value; such a hall will be an inspiration, not only to students in our School and College of Agri - culture, but to men and women all over our state interested in the cause of agriculture. The great cause of agriculture is entitled to be thus recognized. Those of our people whose achievements in the interests of agricul - ture have proven of great and lasting benefit to the state are worthy of being thus honored. Discussion. Mr. Bassett: The thought that we have in mind, in establishing a state organization, a Nebraska Hall of Agricultural Achievement, whose </seg>
            <seg id="p110">100 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY very object Is set forth at the commencement of this article, is that the home for such a society should be in the College of Agriculture at the State University — in the house of its friends. I have here a letter from the chancellor bearing upon this question, but as the chancellor is here I will not read the letter. But it has set forth that without any expense upon our part, or any appropriation, or raising any sum of money, we can establish at the College of Agriculture that which we are asking for and make a home for this society, if we are so disposed I will now ask the chancellor to talk to us for a few minutes § Chancellor Aver) : Mr. President and Gentlemen: 1 canit to hear . Bassett, and I feel a little embarrassed because I did not think that would take any of my efforts along this line as worthy to be men - tioned in this connection. This was entirely devoid ot any persoual interest in the matter, what I wrote to him, and my thoughts were onl&gt; for the good of the cause. We have had considerable correspondence with Mr. Bassett, two or three letters at least, and it seems to me an entirely feasible project and one that could be carried out very easily, because now is the opportune time. The money is available, and the only thing to carry out Mr. Bassett's scheme and make it effectual, as far as the material side is concerned, is to convince the regents, who are perfectly willing to be convinced, that there is a sentiment back of it to justify it. Now. aside from that, there should be some thought as to just what form we should put this suggestion. We are planning now for an administration building and also some better library facilities at the State Farm. It would be well, it seems to me. to ha\&gt; - the architects, before the plan soes on any further, provide for this Hall of Agricultural Achievement. We should take into consideration the purpose and nature of a hall of achievement. I have not. and I do not think Mr. Bassett has, any more definite notions than what he has given. I have seen places in the east where the tablet form was used to record the achievements of the students of the instituMon. This might take the form of a large room, that would have wood tablets, or bronze, or in some other form. As Mr. Bassett says, the pictures of the men who have done the real work might decorate the walls. I ha&gt;e asked different men. and one man in particular, if he thought the family and children of one man. who is still with us, and who did £oo&lt;l work in pioneer days, if his family would be witling to blow in f 25 on a picture, and he said he thought they could be worked to do it. Now a seems to me that it would be very easy to handle the expense matter &gt;u would not be embarrassed by going to the legislature and asking for any additional funds; it can all come out of the three-quarter of a mill building levy, a certain portion of which is to be spent at the farm by law. I do not think we would have to ask for any assistance, other than for pictures and things like that, which 1 have no doubt the families of these memorable pioneers would be proud to furnish. But there is another thing that I think, should be perhaps worked out a little more fully, and I think Mr. Bassett has worked upon this more </seg>
            <seg id="p111">101 than he states. It seems to me that we might get up some sort of a volume that would be the result of careful historical study of these matters, so that when this volume were presented it would be not only our own recollections and enthusiasms, but also the result of critical examination, and so that it would stand the result of scholarly examination. I presume Mr. Sheldon, who is here, would be willing to do this or to direct the work and compile such a volume. Don't you think the time is about right for that, Mr! Sheldon? Mr. Sheldon: Yes, sir; in fact the work has been going on for about two years now, working upon the history of the Board of Agri - culture. Chancellor A very: I imagine that Mr. Sheldon would find that as the work was gone into it would constantly grow, for with most every - thing that we begin to investigate we find it grows more and more. There may be some unknown hero of achievement that would be brought out by investigation. It would be perfectly possible to have through some state publications, or through some help from the Uni - versity, to have this published, and we could then have this room and library and all the achievements as well as the pictures. Now, I moat heartily endorse Mr. Bassett's idea, and I do not want to argue of course against having anything done that would seem to the next generation as immature and which would not stand the test of time, but neverthe less we must go at it carefully, and every investigation and statement should be verified through the records of the society. I think that Mr. Bassett has started an idea that will keep going for all time, and that the stimulus of knowing that one may acquire a reputation for worth and achievement in this way would be a very great advantage to the young men of the state, and particularly to the students of the College of Agriculture, whom I hope might see the inside of this hall occasionally. • Mr. Bassett: The first question was, should we present this matter? The next question is, has the matter merit? And if it has, who would help organize a society of this kind. This of course is preliminary. The next question is as to organization. I take it that anyone here would be a charter member of the organization. I would like to get an expression of some kind in reference to it, whether those who are present are struck with the idea and' are willing to organize an association at this time. Mr. Williams: Wouldn't you prefer to have resolutions passed approving of this idea and adopted by the whole society? Chairman J. J. Hess: I want to say that this idea. In my opinion, is the best we have had for years. While we are building this build - ing, it is necessary for us to take hold of it at once. I would suggest such men as Mr. Bassett and the chancellor, and perhaps Mr. Pollard, to form a committee to have it in charge. You will surely find us will - ing to assist you in any way we can. I know that Mr. Pollard's ideas are the same as the chancellor's. </seg>
            <seg id="p112">102 Mr. Williams: It seems to me it would be well for this association to take formal action in this matter, approving of this matter and method. I make it a motion that we as a society, the State Horticul - tural Society, heartily approve of the proposition as presented by Mr. Bassett here, for the establishment of a hall of agricultural achieve - ment, and ask the board of regents for assistance to build such a hall, Seconded. Carried Mr. Bassett: It is now after 12 o'clock, and I suppose your society wants to adjourn now, but I suggest that all who are interested in this movement remain in this room and we can perfect some kind of an organization. Mr. Christy: I move we adjourn Seconded. Carried 12 o'clock noon, January 19, 191fi, the society adjourned to meet at 2 o'clock P. M.. same day. 2 o'clock P. M., January 19, 1916, the society came to order pur - suant to adjournment, and the following proceedings were had and done and entered of record : The Chairman: In considering what questions we would take up for our program it was decided by the program committee, working with your secretary, that we would give one afternoon session of the society over to the discussion of ornamentals. You will notice from the subjects and men who will handle them this afternoon that we had that very strongly in mind. It seems to me that this is an important sub - ject. Why? Because this is one phase of horticulture that every com - munity in the state can enjoy. There may be a certain section of the state better fitted for the potato, another for the growing of apples, another for sugar beets, but every community in. ihe state can have something in the line of horticulture, and this ornamental phase of it gives us something to draw from. I wish to introduce this afternoon as the first speaker. Prof. Tell W. Nicolett, of the University of Nebraska, Lincoln, who will address you upon the subject "Beautifying the Home Grounds in the Country." which will be illustrated. He is a new man here, and in a new depart - ment just created by the University, that of landscape gardening. Professor Nicolett : Ladies and Gentlemen • The subject of beauti - fying the home grounds in the country is one, as you will see, of great latitude. It may mean the development of a large country estate or It may mean the development of a farm, but the principles which in the main underly the development of either are practically the same. This subject, as I said before, having such a large latitude, presents then a very interesting discussion. Not only may different developments be made along one single line, but naturally we have a great many differ - ent lines. That is to say: Suppose we have a piece of land. One man may want to lay out a farm upon it. Another man may want to lay out </seg>
            <seg id="p113">103 a country estate. The first Is a business proposition. It must be laid out for economic reasons, or business reasons. The second may be laid, out entirely for the man's pleasure. Not only may these different designs be made for each individual side, or spot, but every different side is different; that is, it has different factors which bear upon it. It has different outlooks, and elevations, and it had different types of soil, different lay of the land, and for these reasons then a design for a place will bear directly upon all of these factors. This paper which I have prepared is a brief one, indeed, but I think that it touches more especially upon the development of the farm. For this I have a few slides, not very good ones, but 1 think we may be able to illustrate some of these ideas by pointing them out on the slides. (Shows slides.) BEAUTIFYING THE HOME GROUNDS IN THE COUNTRY. li&gt; Tell \V. Mcolelt, Assistant Professor of Horticulture. University' o* Nebraska- Arrangement of BniWUngs. In the design of the grounds about the country home, whether they be of the gentleman's estate or of the farm, the plan of arrangement is of the greatest importance. It is not to be expected that the owner will always be able to carry the design in his mind, for it is almost im - possible to conceive a thoroughly practical scheme of arrangement with the greatest amount of beauty without the aid of some sort of a graphic representation on paper. There are several factors which must be considered by the farm home builder. The first one is that of convenience. The work on the farm is usually hard enough for the owner to perform without being forced to make unnecessary steps to and fro between illogically placed buildings. The topography of the ground will also bear a marked influence upon the arrangement of the buildings as well as upon the location and grade of the roads located upon the property. It would be better not to make a straight road, on ground that is rather hilly, if, by curving it to some extent, a minimum grade can be secured. The outlook should also influence the arrangement of the buildings, be - cause it would be unwise to place them in positions which would en - tirely cut off the best views to be obtained from the residence. The exposure to winds must not be entirely forgotten. For this reason a southerly exposure is in most cases the best. An adequate windbreak may be located behind the group of buildings to serve as protection to you and your stock, as well as offering an agreeable background for the picture of the grounds. The sanitary conditions are very important. Inasmuch as each farm must take care of its own sewage the sanitaries must be so placed that all danger of contamination will be impossible. The septic tank and open tile system of sewage disposal is highly rec - ommended to all owners of country homes. Its initial cost is very tow and its advantages many. Fire considerations should also be taken </seg>
            <seg id="p114">104 into account and much forethought exercised in the arrangement of the buildings, especially with regard to the dwelling as related to the rest of the structures. It is often possible to so locate them that the danger of fire spreading from one to another will he reduced to a minimum. To obtain a group of buildings which will be functionally located, as well as offering an artistic composition of building outlines and m«— e&gt;, is not a very easy task, but rather one which requires great study. The success of the design will depend very largely upon the composition of the masses It must be borne in mind that one of the main objects is to eventually create an agreeable and beautiful picture, composed of buildings, trees, and shrubs, and if the former are not arranged properly in regard to mass relationships it is often difficult to remedy the case by introducing trees and shrubs in order to attempt the concealing of certain defects. The beauty of all pictures, whether on canvas, paper or that of the landscape, depends very largely upon the composition of the elements of which they are composed. I vocation (if III*' ( Htliii;' The cottage should be locatwl with regard to views, exposure, sun - light, drainage and sanitation, as well as convenience When people try to decide where they would like to locate their house they feel that such and such a place would he very desirable because of the good views of the surrounding country which are obtained from that particular spot. This is a very good idea, inasmuch as an agreeable outlook adds much to the feeling of contentment and freedom so greatly desired in our households. I'sually the south or southeast slope is best for location of the cottage In this case the hill behind the house, with an adequate windbreak, will stop the force of the cold north and northwest winds of winter A southerly exposure permits sunlight to penetrate the living rooms throughout the day. thus de - creasing the chances of disease perms from thriving within the struc - ture. It will be very easily seen that if the house faces the south, with the farm buildings placed to the north of it, the warm winds of summer will come in contact with the residence first, thus decreasing un - desirable odors about it. The drainage and sanitary factors are im - portant. It would not be well to locate the house on low ground for several reasons. In the first place there will he no desirable views in such a location. Secondly, there is a certain amount of danger in the spring for the low lands to become flooded, thus increasing the chances of contamination. Low ground, to be able to support good grass and tree growth, must be drained, which will not in most cases be neces - sary if the farm house and other buildings be located upon the higher areas. The idea of convenience must never be allowed to become un - important in the minds of those who are contemplating the location of the residence on the farm.

Suitable Dettign of Cottage. In the small amount of time which is alloweU me here it will be impossible to dwell as long as I would like on the discussion of a suit - able design for the farm house. I will say in passing that it should be convenient, in order to amply satisfy the needs of the owner. It should be beautiful in outline, simple in its design and entirely fitting to its surroundings, inasmuch as the farm house or country dwelling must be the dominant note in the design or the grounds. In too many cases the owner has made the mistake of permitting the degenerate ginger - bread style of ornaments to be incorporated along the roof lines as well as on the porches of their homes. A simple and artistic residence is far better than the more elaborate designs, which are usually not appro - priate for the farm dwelling. Bear in mind that the house should be built as a business investment, and the original ideas which may be incorporated into the design will not in most cases be entirely pleasing to a prospective buyer. Permanent and Native .Material*. The use of permanent and native materials is always advised for any community. Wood is fast being superseded by brick and concrete, two materials which are very appropriate for construction purposes and at the same time are permanent in their character. There are several reasons why permanent building material should be used. In the first place it increases future valuation; secondly, it lessens the cost of repair; and thirdly, it makes country life permanent. All of these factors should be taken into consideration by the farm home builder. The cost of brick is only about 20 per cent greater than wood, but it is far the most economical in the end inasmuch as it lasts twice to three times as long, with practically no cost for repairs. The twenty to forty dollars which one spends every few years to paint the wooden house soon makes it fully as expensive as the brick one. If the proper color of brick is obtained, one is not so apt to produce a poor effect as i* so often the case with painted structures. People rarely make a mistake by painting their house white.. Bright colors, however, must be used very cautiously, because they do not blend well with the surroundings. Composition of Garden ami I ju\ n Areas. The plan of development should always be in keeping with the owner's station in life. One man may desire to spend two or three thousand dollars or more upon his estate, while his neighbor feels that $75 to $100 is all that he can afford. Naturally the cost of maintenance usually keeps pace with the initial cost of construction, and for this reason such a design should be made whose maintenance will be no burden to the owner. The question of upkeep should bear a great in - fluence upon the style of the design, or the intensity of development. </seg>
            <seg id="p117">106 |3ne of the first principles to be considered in the design of the itry home grounds is that the front lawn should be left open in the er and the boundaries planted with foliage. This principle is very &gt;rtant. The farm house should be the center of interest and all ir objects should be subordinate to it. If, on the other hand, the 1 were planted with specimen trees and shrubs, there would be a it many objects, each competing with the rest for the attention of observer Instead of producing one picture of the grounds with dwelling as the center of interest, there would result a great many hem, each lighting for supremacy. The boundary plantings, then, should appear as one mass of foliage, so placed and so designed that the eye is directly led to the house, the dominant object. These plantings should consist of trees and shrubs planted in groups, but never in straight lines. Hardwood trees should be used together with a few of the faster growing ones to produce immediate effects. Evergreens are always good inasmuch as they produce the much needed green color in winter when the leaves of the deciduous trees have disappeared. I A few specimen trees may be used regardless of the seemingly iron - md statement of the previous paragraph. Several large growing as should be placed on either side of the house in order to form a me to the picture as well as for shade. The elms and maples are ticularly good in this respect. Such trees as the Camperdown elm, aping elm, Tee's weeping mulberry, weeping birch and willow must used with great caution, or they are apt to detract from the unity of design and thus defeat the purpose for which we strive. The boundary planting should never be placed in such positions as will obstruct the best views from the house. It is just as advisable to frame these views by the use of foliage masse? as it is to enhance the view of the house as seen from the roadway, perhaps even more so. The object of beautifying one's place is not so much for the benefit of the casual passerby, but for the health and enjoyment of those who lire there. The beautiful views obtainable from the house can be made more important by emphasizing them by plantints One or two good vistas are much more to be desired than a great many mediocre ones. The type of tree which should be used for such purposes ought to be of a rather tall and upright character, and having the shape of an in - verted cone. The American elm and honeylocust are particularly desirable in this respect. Not only should the good views be framed, but the undesirable and unsightly objects should be screened. I do not mean to include the modern barns and other up-to-date structures in the list of unsightly objects to be screened from view. These need not be unsightly, but should be constructed with as much if not more care than the house itself, for it is possible for these designs to be entirely pleasing to the •ye. All of the farm buildings may be brought into the composition and •till be subordinate to the residence which should be, as has been stated </seg>
            <seg id="p118">BEAUTIFYING THE HOME GROUNDS 107 before, the dominant object. But there are other objects which mar not be entirely desirable to be kept in view at all times and which should not be woven into the composition; these objects, or view*, should be screened from sight by plantings, both of trees and shrubs. It is well to plant about the base of the house in order that the hard architectural lines may be blended into the more gentle flowing ones of the surroundings. Shrubs of the better flowering sorts may be used in this capacity, planted in groups of perhaps five to ten speci - mens. The foundation should be allowed to show in several places in order that the building will have the appearance of being supported by the ground instead of a belt of shrubbery. Groups of the lower growing shrubs should be placed in front of groups of the taller kinds. There are shrubs which bloom in May, others in June, others in July, etc., and by carefully arranging these it is often possible to have some - thing in bloom throughout the growing season. Hardy perennials may be planted among the shrubbery for the purpose of adding color and interest to the picture, but only those should be used whose flowers will not clash in color with those of the shrubs. The flower and vegetable garden is very often desired. It should be located in close proximity to the house, and either to the side or the rear of it. Usually such a garden should be surrounded by some sort of a barrier, such as a fence covered with vines or a hedge, either clipped or undipped. The vegetables can be grown in the center and the flowers along the border. The flowers belong in the garden and not in the lawn as they are sometimes used. Nature does not grow them in geometrically shaped beds in the midst of a closely shaven lawn area. It is needless here to discuss the proper placing of flower beds, but if the flowers are grown in the garden, or occasionally in the shrub borders, no one need feel insecure as to the appropriateness of it. Use native stock, because it is most appropriate. Use trees and shrubs that you know will thrive in Nebraska and not those that you have seen growing in Florida or in Ohio. Nobody knows more about the trees, shrubs and perennials that will thrive here than the nursery - men of this state. Apply for one of their catalogs and I am sure you will not find much difficulty in selecting the plants for your use. The walks and drives should be few in number, inasmuch as they cost a great deal of money to construct, as well as to maintain. These should be as direct as the contour of the land will allow. Use cinders for the walks, if possible, inasmuch as this material dries out quickly and makes a good, firm walk at all seasons of the year. Dirt roads are unexcelled for rural use. especially if they are kept dragged throughout the year. Artificial decorative features, such as arches and arbors, should be used with a great deal of care. They should be few in number and located in connection with the house or garden. Arches and arbors are used and located improperly more often than they are used correctly. </seg>
            <seg id="p119">108 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Maintenance. Neatness is the secret of success. The best suit of clothes will soon look shabby unless it receives constant rare. For this reason the best advice that I can give you this afternoon is not to undertake more than you know will be well taken care of; otherwise it will mean failure in the end. Continuous care is far better than intermittent streaks of lndustriousness and it is far easier for the individual. In order to have a good lawn it is absolutely necessary to roll it occasionally as well as to fertilize it once a year. The shrubs and trees will not as a rule live and thrive unless the hostile weeds which grow about them are kept pulled out at all times. After a while these same trees and shrubs will attain such a size that they can ably take care of themselves, at which time the hours spent in maintenance will be greatly reduced. In clos - ing let me repeat a previous sentence: "Neatness is the secret of success." The Chairman: This paper is to be followed by a discussion. If there are any questions you would like to ask Professor Nicolett re - garding the planning of a country home, I am sure he would be glad to answer them. He covered the subject so thoroughly, and it ia some - thing new to our society, that I suppose everybody is wondering what in the world we may ask in order to add to it. The Chairman: If there is no discussion, the next subject will be "Beautifying the Home Grounds in the City," by Mr. R. Tiniler. of Benson, Nebraska. BEAUTIFYING THE HOMK UUH.MIs IK THK CITY By R. Timler, Benson. Nebraska Mr. Timler: Ladies and Gentlemen: The subject of beautifying the city home grounds^ is to a large extent governed by the same prin - ciples as used in beautifying the country home, but the difference is that In the country you have more space to do the planning and can do everything on a larger scale, while in the city we are limited. While we can spend hundreds of dollars beautifying a country home, an ex - penditure of about $15 will cover the whole thing iu the city, and so along that line I have prepared a short paper, and I will give it to you. People are beginning now to realize what it means to have their home beautified. There has been a great change in the last six years. A short time ago, about ten years ago, when I came to Omaha, you could see scarcely any shrubs or plants in the yards, but it is all changed now, and they are now in a sort of a competition to see who can have the most beautiful lawn and yard on the street, and they don't seem to care much about expense either. Now they get shrubs that will grow, whereas it used to be in days gone by that they used to get shrubs that were not adapted to their locality. They would go to an expense of getting the shrubs and spend time watering them and caring for them </seg>

But the nurserymen are more reliable now, and you can be sure these plants will grow. Beautifying the home grounds is a point which is greatly neglected by a majority of the people. Every person that builds a house uses his greatest efforts to have a beautiful and conveniently arranged build- :nu. often without regard of cost. But beautifying the grounds Is mostly overlooked and neglected. But this is changing now. People are beginning to realize the value and beauty of plants. Neighbors are vying with each other to have the prettiest yard in the neighborhood, realizing that with a comparatively small cost they can obtain plants which are sure to grow and thrive and so can cover unsightly objects through plantings and show to passers by only the beautiful parts of the place. Where to Maul. At the first attempt to beautify the ground* one has to consider where and how to arrange the planting. The residence building should always be considered as the center of the picture and all the plantings as the frame to it. Care should be taken not to cover up pretty parts of the buildings, but the planting should be so arranged as bring out und show off the most beautiful parts of the architecture. In planting ny trees in a yard the latter point should always be kept in mind. Where to Start i'lantinu Ktrst. Where to plant first is not a very hard matter to decide. Look round for the most unsightly spots, which may be found in the sur- roundings or often in the foundation of the building or corners. In selecting a plant or plants to cover a given space one has to always consider the size of the same and accordingly select tall or low growing shrubs to nil in. The spread of the fully developed shrubs has to be kept in mind in making a selection. If the space is narrow, one has to select plants of upright growth, like altheas (Rose of Sharon), or use \ i UPS 1 n»ightl) Pence* ami Hnil&lt;Hng» If there is an unsightly adjoining building, the only plants to cover them are the I.onibardy and Volga poplars that are of quick growth and give the desired effect in a few years. If space is not limited one can use a screen of various other trees. In front of this screen of trees one can plant shrubbery bordered with various perennial and annnal flowers. If there is an unsightly fence to be covered up and space is limited, tall growing hedges are the most satisfactory, as they screen the fence even in winter time. To cover this with various vines would be con - siderable cheaper, but the drawback is the unsightly appearance in winter. If one wants to further beautify the place perennial and annual flowers can be used to advantage as a border. Care should be taken </seg>
            <seg id="p122">110 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY not to plant too close to hedge plants as the shade may smother out the lower parts of the hedge. Again, where space is not limit. mI one can create a better effect by the use of a continuous shubbery bed, of various kinds and of various growths and shapes, so as to avoid making the planting appear monotonous. To contrast such plant - ings one can use a few evergreens in foreground of planting. Cart - should be taken that evergreens are free on all sides and shrubs and other plants that begin crowding them should be moved or cut down. Where one's means do not allow such elaborate planting a row of spaced shrubs of one variety will create a similar effect, but it will take a longer time to make the showing a dense planting will make. Steps at porches are usually high and create mostly an unsightly corner and a shrub, or shrubbery if there is more room, will cover this and set off the house to better. advantage Again, at a corner there may be an unsightly downspout and a spreadinc shrub or vine would cover it up. In general, the planting should be so arranged to create I pleas - ing effect when viewed from the street If further plantings ;ire desired it is best to group them in the corners of the plat. The lawn should be free and not cut up with scat - tered plantings, as it is unsightly and difficult to take care of and mow such a lawn. Flower bed* should be of good size, either by themselves or con - sidered as an extension of the shrubbery beds Single plants of flowers should not be scattered over the lawn as they will not do well if trass grows among them and they are not properly cultivated and what is most important, as previously mentioned, it makes it very hard and tedious to mow the lawn. Roses should be treated the same way as other flowers and planted in beds at about IS inches distant This makes the care of them and the covering in winter an easy matter One does not need them to cover the whole yard in an attempt to cover a dozen roses. The proper place for beds is usually along walks, at side of steps. along porch, opposite sun rooms and hay windows. In laying out beds along walks one should keep them at least 30 inches away from walk as a nice grass border sets off the bed better and if the flowers drop oxer they do not interfere with the walk and furthermore in watering it keeps the mud off the walks. A very important factor Is the edging up of the flower and shrub - bery beds. A narrow edge about two to three inches deep will set oft the beds from the lawn and also make it easier to take care and mow the lawn. Distance to plant shrubbery in beds is between 3 0 inches and 3 feet for the front row of dwarf growing shrubs, with other shrubs 4 to 5 feet. Spaces between should be spaded up and well manured and always kept cultivated. It Is injurious to leave grass between the shrubs be - cause It hardly requires a month for the plants to fill the plant holes with roots and further expansion is hindered by the tough sod ana </seg>
            <seg id="p123">BEAUTIFYING THE HOME GROUNDS 111 often the necessary moisture is absorbed by grass. The space between the shrubs may look bare but this can be overcome by planting seeds and annual flowers between the shrubs. Perennials can also be used, but have to be watched and when crowded moved out into outer border. This is very satisfactory as perennials have to be transplanted every few years anyhow. Preparation of ground mul sue» of (throbs is an important factor to" consider Loosening up of soil to good depth should be considered of greater importance than manuring. The most economical way to loosen up the soil is by the use of dynamite. Most all up-to-date planters use dynamite and if you don't know of anybody to do this for you, write the Du Pont Powder Co., at Wilmington, Del. They will give you free of charge information and the address of the nearest man that can do the work for you. It is not advisable to plant very small shrubs and try to make a nursery out of your yard. Life is too short and shrubs are reasonable in price to lose a year or two of your life. Plant If pas - sible three and five-year-old shrubs only. All nurseries can furnish three-year-old shrubs and five-year-old ones of some varieties that are of slower growth. On south and west side of buildings people often find trouble in having any grass grow close to the foundations. The sod makes the ground so hard in time that no amount of watering will moisten the soil enough to keep the sod alive in the hot summer time. Such places make ideal rose beds if deeply spaded and then kept well cultivated. If ■it-sired to have continuous flower bed around those places a background of heat and drought resisting shrubbery should be planted so as to break the heat reflex off of the tender flowers. The parking is a greatly neglected space in front of most properties. Not only is the heat reflex from the pavement against it but in many cases the hose does not reach far enough to water it properly. What little water reaches it flows off before it moistens the soil. Most people hate to work the parking over as long as there are a few grass blades on it and sodders whom they turn the Job over for resodding often fail to lower the grade and so it comes that most all of the parkings are higher than the sidewalk and curbing. The sod in the parking should be at least an inch lower than the sidewalk so Xo catch all the rain water and make an occasional irrigating possible. A seeded sod is pref - erable as it makes a healthier lawn and drought resisting graaaes should be used. Trees in the parking are usually planted too close. Thirty-five or forty feet should be the proper distance. Would advise to plant a tree every twenty feet alternately with a fast growing tree that in time would be cut down for wood when they are starting to touch each other. Now, many people spend lots of money to have their trees butchered every few years, as they are too thick, instead of taking the evil at the root and have some fire wood for their fireplaces. I think it is much nicer to have one good tree with a beautiful spread to each lot than three or four butchered cripples. </seg>
            <seg id="p124">112 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY In the spring when the snow is melting every one is anxioush looking for flowers. Here is where we can make the greatest color display of the season by the use of various bulbs. Bulb! 1 are so cheap now that one does not need to buy them by the dozen, but ran easily afford to buy a few hundred. Planted in beds, along walks, along the very edges of the shrubbery bed, around single shrubs and any \acam spot one can find may be filled with them What more delightful wall; could one have than to walk alons a street in early spring where onr sees every yard lined with flowering bulbs. Parkings could be lined with flower beds and bulb beds also an&lt;l we could have in Nebraska just as beautiful streets as in California. But regretful as it is, most of the communities are not ready for such innovations on account of too nu - merous dogs running at large in residence districts and children would regard them as an obstruction instead of guarding as something for the benefit of the community. Many more people would plant bulbs if they knew that it is not necessary to take them up and replant them every year, but that they can be left in the same place undisturbed for several years. Plant the bulbs at least four inches deep so that when they die down in the summer they will be out of the way for cultivating the beds. In plant ing annual flowers in the same beds, plant the plants Detween the bulbs before the latter have died down entirelv , very small expense and they will grow in most any kind of soil make in a short time a nice bush to cover up some unsightly object "City beautiful" one begins to hear the talk everywhere. But .: one walks along a street in the residence sections, observing the beau - tiful buildings that line the street, one would reall&gt; admit that this i* the "city beautiful." Different so with the lover of nature that had baaa confined all day to a hot and close oifice down town Put him in the place of the first party and the beautiful architecture will look monoto - nous to him. The beautiful building*; crowding close to the street and some coming down to the sidewalk line will make hihi PMV for air and light. Picture yourself the same street with the houses pushed back, back yard nearly eliminated and the front yard made a gardenspot The city dweller would not need to spend much money and hasten to get away as soon as hot weather starts in. his whole street would look like one continuous garden. So in planting a new house, push it back and make a large front yard, then there is where you spend most of your time and not on the "back porch." This is what really will make the city beautiful.

That it doesn't do well? y Well, I suppose you would say that it is not hardy. Mr. Tiniler: Well, in lots of places it is not hardy. In &lt;f good many rases where it reaches a four-inch diameter it dries out. The Volga poplar is the hardier of the two and I recommend it to take the place of the Lombard}-. It takes more time for it to attain the size of the Lombard}-, but it is a nicer tree. You can space them farther apart than you can the Lombardy. For my part I am noiny to discontinue the growing of the Lombard) poplar and grow the Volga alone. Here i« another thing that you have to consider. You have nothing to take the place of it in similar growths. Out in the country you can prob - ably substitute all right and you can use different plants, but I refer to the city use We haven't enough room to have spreading trees, and in the city these poplars are about the only trees we can use in the city. Q. How old a Lombard}- poplar did you have? V The oldest tree I ever saw was one about n\e inches in diameter )wned by Mr. Sonderreger at Beatrice, and it will take you about eight ten years to grow them that size though. Q.

I of course am speaking of a country fifty or sixty .incoln and a little south. Fillmore county is my home I have never seen a tree eight or ten years of age in my county, al- hough I haven't known all of them possibly. It is just like it is with lot* of our other trees though Mr. Tiniler: You refer to the Silver I&gt;eaf Roliana poplar A. Yes. sir Mr. Williams: If Mr. Brown will come with me I can show him at least three trees in Lincoln which are at least twelve inches in diameter. and about twenty or twenty-five or thirty years old and very hardy.

University of Nebraska, on the subject "Rural School Grounds." Ill KAL SCHOOL f.KOI Mk By Prof. K. H. Harbour. VniviKily or NebraNlui. Lincoln, N'vbraeku. Mr. President and Members of the Association, Ladies and Gentle - men: Never before were so many horticulturists and floriculturists assembled in this city, und certainly never so many professionals from such widely separated localities. It is an act of temerity for a non - professional to appear before this trained body. The chief justification for according me a place on the program lies in the fact that geologic work involves travel with opportunities for observing what people are doing, especially for the betterment of school children. While it is impossible to take an audience down the long and devious paths of travel, it is possible, by means of the camera and optical lantern, to bring many historic and instructive scenes to an audience. To this assemblage the points of interest lie rather in what is to be shown than what is to he said. But we must proceed without further circumlocution, for there are at hand to be projected and de - scribed some sixty slides touching upon various phases of school grounds, school gardens, playgrounds, and the like. One's thoughts turn first of all to the little red schoolhouse which is cherished by the American people. Too often, however, the little red schoolhouse is but an educational sham, directed by boards who have neither training in, knowledge of, nor sympathy with educational methods. Too often its terms are short, the teachers young and inex - perienced, and the discipline weak. Many of the sturdiest people of America greatly deplore the fact thai our cities are ruled by foreigners, not by Americans. The reason for this control is plain. On coming to America the foreigner goes directly to the great cities. There his family has the advantage of the most advanced public school facilities. Accordingly, the young become well-trained men and women, capable of municipal management. It should be stated here that courses in the high schools of our large cities are equivalent to college training. Contrast this educational course with that given our splendid native youths from the rural dis - tricts. They are too often left untrained, or at best, poorly taught. Consequently they are barred in many instances from taking part in the affairs of the municipality, state, or government. It is very credit- </seg>
            <seg id="p127">RIRAL SCHOOL OROINUS 115 able to the foreigner to study and become qualified, but it is not so creditable to us that our own youths, for lack of training, must de - fault. Though said in jest, it is painfully true that "New York was discovered by the Dutch, is ruled by the Irish, owned by the Jews, and leased by the Americans." There is authority for the statement that (here are more Italians in New York city than in Rome itself, more Germans than in any other city save Berlin, more Irish than in Dublin, and more British than in any city outside of London. The pathetic part is that there are proportionately fewer native born people than in any other city in the world. Our rural youths should have the benefit of graded schools and high schools, as truly as the foreign youths in our great cities. The solution of this embarrassing problem lies in the centralized high school. No rural community should be satisfied until buildings, equipment ami teachers, equal to those in the cities, be furnished boys an. I &gt;.'irl.s of the country. A large part of one's life must be spent in school, where his growth is made, his character developed and his intellect quickened. No like period in one's life is so fundamentally important. Since this is so. it is the duty of every man to inquire if the fitness of things has been observed in and around the public school his community Observation leads us to believe that district schools and school grounds are singularly neglected. So rare is it to find a rural school surrounded by trees and shrubs that the attention is at once arrested when an example of this kind presents itself. In fact, this is not characteristic of the country school alone. We have visited towns where the same unfortunate conditions prevaile. In one such case, a commanding looking building, which cost $50,000, had stood for years in an utterly bare, sunburned lot. Ir some eleven years not a strip of sod. a single tree, shrub, vine, or flower had been planted. Aside from the excellent building it was a picture of abandonment. It could not have been better designed to repel pupils. There was nothing to inspire, give spirit, instill ideas of taste or encourage the children to attempt improvements in their own home yards. The children were trying to play in the scalding sun. The young generation of the place, which is always the most priceless single asset of a community, v.-as utterly neglected. Let it be noted that within a few miles of this same school we visited farms on which shaded groves and runways were carefully and methodically planted for the protection of swine. It is said that the welfare of young pigs is often more solicitously studied than that of our young children. Let patrons be as conscientious in providing shade for children as the farmer is for his stock. Neglect and disorder are bad enough, but there are other condi - tions even more pernicious. The town dump should never be centr.U, or even within the corporation, yet in too many towns the dumping ground must be passed several times a day by each school child. Chil - dren at the impressionable age should not be subjected to such com- </seg>

The flies which breed there are a menace to the health of the entire community. It is but necessary to mention cases of this kind to have them abhorred, and a few pictures projected upon thf screen suffice to represent this oft-repeated scene. Children cannot grow up in surroundings of this sort without savoring, to a degree, of the place. School grounds rendered less unattractive prove far more inviting to children, who are more willing to attend school. It seems as though any sacrifice should be made and everything done to encourage children in faithful and protracted attendance at school. It is truth fully said by municipal managers and tho&lt;*» informed that childr'-n who continue in school for a long periotl of years seldom fall into the pauper or criminal class. Nothing emUMfi such economic waste to i community as its criminals and dependents t Carefully compiled educational statistics in the I'niteil States show sputably that those who fail to attend the public schools stand but chance in 9,000 of ever being heard from in after life. Those who continue their training through the hiirh school increase their chances twenty-fold; that is. one out of every 450 are heard from afterwards Our public schools are the very bulwark of this nation, and the para mount problem is to hold pupils in the schools until the;, finish tht - high school courses. After that if a few wish to go to the universities It is well-advised, for there their chances are increased to one in ever\ twenty men. or 450-fold. School grounds, properly planted, are also useful to adults, since they serve as community parks where farmers and their families meet for neighborhood picnics. Schools and school grounds should becomt social centers in the country as surely as in the city It is worthy of notice here that certain farmers and ranchmen have found play anil community life so essential that they have dedicated Saturdays to recreation and rest for themselves, their children and their helpers. It is reported by communities trying this experiment that all concerued are much more cheerful, spirited and willins to work th&lt; week fol - lowing than they otherwise would have been. The country school grounds must be ample, and shoul.i be pio\id&gt;il with room for basket-ball, baseball, tennis, croquet, and other outdoor games, not forgetting swings and sand piles for the younger childreu Though expense should not be considered when the welfare of children Is in the balance, yet the first question will surely be "What are the costs?" The answer is that it is both easy and inexpensive to decorate rural school grounds. Accordingly neglect is utterly indefensible. Along every stream there are native shrubs, vines and trees well suited to decorative planting. These are to be had for the digging. It should be counted good practice in landscape architecture to make the best use possible of the native wild plants of the place. Experience shows plainly that teachers and pupils alike are easily influenced to </seg>

All. this, and more, may ensue with little or no cost to school :&gt;oards With free material and free labor available, it seems repre - hensible to let the grounds of our district schools stand unadorned mil unattractive. The power of suggestion is strong. A single enterprising citizen can, by a few words of suggestion, bring about in a single season a romplete transformation in the rural school yard of his place. It has been found by experience that as soon as a few simple native plants and trees are established in the school grounds, to relieve what would otherwise be a sunburned, dreary and repulsive scene, donations of first-class shrubs and plants may be counted upon. By making Mf - sestions. women may render their community one more signal service. No one is more intimately concerned in the education and welfare of sons and daughters than the mothers. Many of the finest municipal improvements have been thought out and proposed by women and women's clubs. True, the plans are generally executed* by men and the credit given to them, but this matters little so long as public Im - provements ensue. It must not be foreotten that in city and country alike men are held to fixed hours and exacting labor, and such matter* as the beautification of the school grounds may naturally be overlooked. Household duties, if not less exacting, are at least more elastic. Ac - cordingly the initiative in school betterment may, with great propriety. orieinate with the mothers, who are conceded to be in closer touch with educational needs than the fathers. If there is an iota of truth in the oft-quoted saying that "Farmers will do nothing for themselves," then rhe effort to alter this harsh decree should be that much more strenu - ous. Nowhere is there equal opportunity for beautification at such small expense. Owing to less rainfall in western Nebraska, the range of common trees from which to choose is narrow. AH things considered, cotton - woods seem the most desirable native trees because of their hardiness and rapid growth. Besides, they are beautiful for fifteen or twenty years, or until they grow ragged, when they may be rendered shapely and beautiful again by proper pruning. Cotton woods and Carolina poplars have the happy faculty of sending roots down to water. These are especially desirable in less humid parts of our state. In a few regions oaks do well and are choice shade trees. Soft maples are desirable, but require considerable moisture and are not as well adapted to the dryer portions of the state. Nowhere, and under no circumstance, should one yield to the temptation of planting that intolerable tree, the box-elder. Trees should be planted around the outermost edge of school grounds and should never encroach upon playgrounds. If school grounds are ample enough, and it is a reproach if they are not so in the country, a few trees should be planted In each of the four corners of the grounds. There should be a liberal u§e of </seg>

District schools in bleak and exposed places are bettered by a strong windbreak of willow, mulberry or Osage orange. In selecting shrubbery, it is well to choose simple native varieties. Common elderberry, found along our streams, is an admirable decoia - tive shrub. So is the Indian currant, a low growing bush, which may be found by the thousands in pastures and along highways and streams. As for vines, there is nothing superior to our native Virginia creeper, also called the five-leafed ivy All things considered, this vine is pronounced by many florists the finest single vine in the world Bitter-sweet, common in the wooded districts of the eastern portion of the state, is a beautiful though neglected vine. The importance of the common wild grape as a bold strong grower, of great effectiveness, must not be overlooked.

Scotch and Austrian pines are very good evergreens, but they are tall-growing trees, while the spruces are low and conical. If the school grounds are ample, numerous conifers should be planted. If the grounds are limited three or four at least should be used. List of Desirable Conifer?.. 1. Colorado blue spruce Very choice 2. Black Hills spruce. 3. Austrian pine. 4. Scotch pine. 5. Silver cedar. Of flowering plants, we can recommend only those which are the hardiest. First of all comes the Iris, which may be bought for two or three cents a root. Iris, it should be remembered, is so hardy that it is absolutely dependable in all portions of Nebraska. It requires no coddling and the leaves remain green throughout the winter. It must be remembered .that the Iris multiplies rapidly and grows better from year to year. We would particularly recommend that school boards purchase the finer grades of Iris, and when they multiply to a certain point in the school grounds, distribute roots to the farmers and ranchmen who are patrons of the school. This custom should apply to other plants as well. In time the school grounds may become a sort of community nursery. Next to the Iris my personal preference is for the Yucca, a plant pre-eminently suited to this climate. Its bayonet-like leaves are ever - green, giving a gratifying effect, summer and winter alike. The next choice would be peonies. Golden glow must not be forgotten, but it demands moisture and a rich soil, otherwise the results are not satisfactory. Hardy phlox is exceedingly desirable, but is subject to attacks of red spider and require a little care. Tiger lilies and lily elegans are extremely hardy and brilliant members of the lily family and are endorsed. Plantain lilies are desirable, since they flourish in shaded places. As a rule all annuals should be avoided. The one rule for the rural schoolyard is to select plants which are so hardy and self - reliant that they will flourish under neglect. Nursery Stock Salted to the School Grounds. 1. Japanese barberry, extra choice. 2. Purple barberry, fine. 3. Bridal wreath. 4. Snowball. 5. Persian lilacs 6. Red dogwood, for winter effect. 7.

The society met, pursuant to aa - iournment, and the following proceedings were had and done and •&gt;ntered of record: The Chairman: The first -subject on thp program for this morn - ng is by Mr. W. G. Rich, of Council Bluffs, Iowa, upon the subject ■Crape Growing in the Missouri River Valley." CiRAI'K (iROWIXG IN THK MISSOIKI VALLKY. By \V. (i. Kirh, Council Bluffs, lima. The fruit you have asked me to speak of is one of the oldest in his - tory. The vine has been cultivated from the remotest antiquity, on account of its fruit. Representations of it are to be found in the early sculptured monu - ments of Egypt. The Bible carries its history back to the days of Noah, who began to be a husbandman and planted a vineyard. Like other plants which have been from earliest times associated with man. it is impossible to discover its native locality. It is generally believed rhat in the mountainous region of the Euphrates and the Caspian sea to the northeast of Palestine is its original country. We learn that in i he days of Abraham the Holy Land produced its grape harvest. When Joseph was carried into Egypt he found the vine cultivated there. And we learn from the dream of the royal butler that the sweet and unfermentert juice of the grape was drunk by Pharaoh, and the men whom Moses sent to spy the land, whether it was good or bad. confirmed the description when they brought from the Valley ot" Eschol a branch with one cluster of grapes which they bore on a pole between two of their number. So numerous are the references to the vine and its products in the Bible that it would be impossible to bring them all to your notice. Now I am not going to tell you that we raise grapes that require a staff to carry the bunches upon, but I do say that in the Missouri val - ley, or rather in the hills adjoining, we can raise as fine Concords. Worden, Moore's Early and many other varieties of grapes as can be srown anywhere. These three varieties, in the order named, are our best commercial grapes. The best location for a vineyard is ai east or southeast and south slope, as they will not stand a north or west exposure. I would plant nothing but Number 1 one-year-old vines. It Is getting to be the gen - eral method with us to plant vines 8x8 feet, every fourth middle ten feet wide for driveway. Plant some low growing crop, such as potatoes or tomatoes, the first year, which helps pay cost and necessitates clean cultivation. In the fall the vines should be cut back to two buds and a little dirt thrown over them. In spring remove the dirt and let the vines grow the second year before trellising. We use the two-wire trellis, first wire two feet from the ground, the second three and one - half feet from the ground. We have adopted the long arm system of pruning, and find it much better than the old spur system. </seg>
            <seg id="p135">122 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY I have given you, thus, a brief outline of how I set out my vine - yard. We hare in the vicinity of Council Bluffs about one thousand acres in grapes, with an average yield of about one thousand baskets per acre. This year our average price per basket was eighteen cents. For home use would plant some Brighton, Niagara and Delaware, but these varieties are not as hardy as Concords and do not pay commer - cially. Discussion. Q. What is the outlook for the grape industry? A. At the annual meeting of the Council Bluffs Grape Growers' Association Mr. Keeline, our vice-president, stated he would put out twenty-four acres and the total new acreage would approximate 100, 000 vines. The outlook is better than ever. Armour &amp; Co. have promised to install a grape juice plant as soon as the acreage is large enough to support it. There were 35.000 vines set out last spring. Grapes will give greater returns than any other fruit crop that can be grown. Our grapes ripen about one week earlier than they do across the river at Florence and Omaha. Q. Is it just across the river? A. Yes Q. What system of pruning do you pursue? A. The old system was the spur system. Spurs were left with only two buds to each one and all laterals cut off. The new system is the renewal system. We grow and leave four or five laterals with ten io twelve buds to each lateral. This system was introduced by Professor Maney of Ames and tested in the Rich and three other vineyards. The average yield under old method was 1.000 baskets and the inrre; yield was 35 per cent. The production can be raised to an average of 1,300 or 1,400 baskets per acre. Could raise 2,000 to the acre, but don't care to do so. Leave four or five laterals on each vine Q. Do you practice a cover crop system? A. Sow soy beans and plow under. Field peas could I Q. Have you ever tried disking? A. Part of my vineyard was planted in 1879 and has, as you see, thus been there quite a while. !)ows were planted six feet apart W* - cannot use a disk in my old vineyard. I use a disk when I plant it under the new system of eight to ten feet. Q What distance apart? A. Eight feet. Eight by eight, and every fourth middle ten feet Tor a driveway. Then, when you harvest your grapes, you do not have to carry out anything. Q. How long do you advise the rows to be? A. It doesn't make any difference that I can see Q. How about the exposure? A. The slope should be to the south or east to be the best. North or west exposure is too cold and too hot upon them and kills them out. Possibly not every year, for I have had grapes grow and do well on a </seg>
            <seg id="p136">123 west slope for several years, and then you get a bad year and then they all go.. It doesn't pay for a man to put his money in something that there is no assurance that it is going to pay him or that it will get better. Q. What loss do you suffer from frost in the lower ground, and how high altitude would you pick to avoid frosts? A. Well, only once in a while on a low strip of ground they will get a late spring frost. Take the Concord grape and they will lots of time* throw out new buds and you will get a good crop anyway. But be that as it may. I would keep the grapes up out of the draw as much as I could Q. Do your old grapevines still continue to bear good after all this time A. We had a bad freeze and a dry winter, I remember, about twenty years ago and it hurt a good many of those grapevines. We injured that vineyard with a lime-sulphur spray. I am not saying any - thing about the lime-sulphur spray. I think we got on too much of it and did not get enough washed off and we burned the vines. That was in 1879, and it was a dry year. It is pretty spotted at the present time. Q. If it hadn't been for the spraying, you think it would be a good yi^lder now? A. Yes, sir, I do Mr. Marshall: In Washington county, Nebraska, there is about a half an acre vineyard that is now fifty-four years old and it bore a pay - ing crop last year. Mr. Rich: I don't think there is any limit to the age of a vineyard. I don't think they will ever play out. Q. This one seems to be bearing just as good as it did twenty yean ago, the one that I just referred to. A. Yes, and if you will keep that pruned back it will continue to do go. We had a vineyard in Council Bluffs that I worked in twenty years ago that I think was the first one ever put out in that part of the country. The vineyard was just let run and the vines grew out until they came to — well, they had grown wood at least fifteen feet from where it came out of the ground. That is on the Wheeler place. That is not the best way to grow them of course, but they seemed to get along all right. To say how long a vine will produce a good paying crop I have no way of judging. Q. (By a member.) Now, about these white grapes, don't they taste better than the Concord, when you want to grow them just for your own use? A. The Niagara will yield as much as the Concord, although they are a little more tender than the Concord. They will grow just about the same and just as many grapes. Q. Don't you think they are a nicer grape to eat out of the hand? A. I always want a few for my own use. The Delaware is a good on*, too, but in fact they are all gone, and there are a very few at the </seg>
            <seg id="p137">124 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY present time, that is, of the different varieties. While 1 am here 1 would like to have some man tell me if he knows anything of the McPike and grows it, and where I can get the vines. Mr. Williams: I know of a man out west of Lincoln that planted several hundred of those vines on the recommendation of a certain nursery. He got badly let down on the price. I think this vineyard was only planted about three years ago. As far as I know there Is no one growing them in the state, and they are not on our recommended list anywhere. Mr. Rich: I planted a few of what I supposed was McPike. That is what I bought and paid for anyway, but I got some rather expensive Concords. And I know of at least a dozen others that got the same very expensive Concords. Mr. Marshall: I don't believe you will be able to get McPike very easily in the United States this year. It so happened that a few weeks ago we had some inquiries from an Omaha party for McPike grapes. I have forgotten who it was now, but we went to looking up the proposition, taking it up with the leading wholesale growers of the United States, and we only found one man who would quote the McPike grape this year. Mr. Rich: Well, do you suppose if you went after this mar would get Concord or McPike? A. Well, he has the reputation of being an honorable nursery but I don't know what you would get. Mr. Rich: Row long have they been out? About ten year Mr. Marshall: I suppose about that long; I don't know A Member: I ate them about twenty years ago Mr. Rich: I judged that, from what few grapes I saw A Member: As I understand it, you don't think a vineyard » amount to very much if it is on a north slope? A. It will amount to something as long as you can keep it growing A Member: I had an acre at Aurora, Nebraska, and it was just slope enough so that it would irrigate nicely — a very light slope. Mr. Rich: I would plant a windbreak or something like that, if it has a bad exposure on the north. Member: Well, it has a windbreak. Mr. Rich: Russian mulberry makes a good windbreak Member: Isn't your clay soil a little better than the soil out on the prairie? A. It certainly is. Our drainage is much better. You take in heavier soil, your water doesn't get away as well after the rains, and you are troubled more with mildew. In the loose soil the water gets away. Even this is shown in the highways in the summer-time. You get a good big rain and you can run a car in twelve hours because the roads are dry. The downy mildew is one of the worst diseases you can get, and we have it wherever you get the wash soil. A Member: Do you believe in level cultivation? </seg>
            <seg id="p138">125 A. As nearly level as possible, because it saves the water. Mr. Williams: This plow you were telling us about; does that turn the soil upside down? A. Yes, sir Q. Well, I would object to that style of cultivation. A. Well, it seems to have worked with the most of our vineyards ivhere they are cultivated with that method of cultivation. Mr. Williams: We have a reversible disk in our vineyard and turn it back, and you get that way a perfectly level system. Mr. Rich: Of course we have a great many men though who think their time in the vineyard is time taken away from them, and thus the easiest way to handle it, they think, is the best. I like the kind I have better than anything I ever used, probably because I have six-foot rows and there is not room to use a plow in there. V Member: What do you consider the best tool in a vineyard? A. I should say that the sidehill plow and the reversible disk, if it was put out in an eight-foot row basis, would be the best. I would keep on disking it until the grass under the rows started pretty good, and then I would throw it back. Q. The first plowing you would plow away? A. Yes, sir. Q. That would give a good chance for the first hoeing? A Vi's. sir, and the disks would tjike it all out from undtr the \ ines and the next time throw it back. Mr. Williams: You would injure your roots and tear up lots of your roots? A. Not if you stir it up well. The roots of your grapevines will follow the cultivation. They will come up right under the cultivation. We trim the roots off and do not plant the full roots as we get our vines. If we did, we would be digging a hole too deep. We trim them off about seven or eight inches below the end of the cane, and then we set that in the ground on a slant. And you can spread your roots out a little easier and handle it and dig out the hole just the same as any other hole, only set it in on a slant. Q. Have you had any experience with terracing? A. In some places, but your ground will naturally terrace itself after you have cultivated it a while. Q. Do you advise planting your rows parallel with the hill? A. Yes, sir; not up and down. Q. I have some land that has an east slope on it and it is stony on that slope. Do you think that would be a good place for grapes? It is in the southeast part of the state. A. You have some good places down there to grow grapes and you an raise good grapes, too. Q. Well, it is too stony to be what you would call farming land on that slope. A. Is it good enough to grow grapes? </seg>
            <seg id="p139">126 • NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Q. I think it would grow them. A. Some of the men who have grown grapes in that soil would know more about it. Mr. Williams: I will say we have eighteen acres in soil like that which you say is pretty stony and we have it in grapes. But we haven't succeeded in getting a yield like they do around Council Bluffs, where they reach 1,000 and 1,200 baskets per acre. Our vineyard is compara - tively young yet, but our crop last year was around 800 baskets to the acre for the Concords. We expect to get more under this new system of pruning which we are adopting. There is a good point there. Every - body should adopt this long arm system, and it will bring you perhaps 200 baskets more to the acre. The Chairman: The next subject for our meeting is "Marketing Fruit and Vegetable Crops Individually or Through an Association," by Hon. Lou D. Sweet, Denver, Colorado. MARKETING FRUIT A.ND VEGETABLE CROPS INDIVIDt' ALLY OR THROUGH A&gt; ASSOCIATION. By Hon. Loa D. Sweet, Denver, Colorado. Mr. Chairman, and Ladies and Gentlemen of the Association: As some of you no doubt know, I am a farmer. I was a business man once, but started farming because I was told I could make considerable money at it. I started on new soil- -raw soil. We did not make any money at first, in fact we kept putting up money, and the government man came to us from the agricultural department of the agricultural college and we soon learned that our western soil, that is in Colorado, was short on nitrogen and humus and that we could add this nitrogen by growing a legume, which with us is alfalfa. This brings nitrogen into the soil in the form of nitrates After this crop lias been grown for three or four years we go in and turn under the last cutting for thai Eir, when about knee high, plowing it about four and a half inches sp in the fall and letting it lie all winter and decay, and then replow &gt;ut eleven or twelve inches in the spring. This equals twenty tons barn manure or organic matter per acre to our soil. We could only M about 135 bushels on the raw soil, and our average for the last four years has been over five hundred bushels of potatoes on the rotated soil. Losing money as we did during the first five years, I began to study and I have accumulated quite a library on agricultural subjects and soil and products of the soil. The marketing proposition they asked me to speak upon here, and I believe that Mr. Rich told you, if you got from it what I did, the first step in marketing the products of the El depends upon the same kind of business management of the soil, that is your business, that the banker or other business man puts o his business to make it a success. Learn your business thoroughly d learn your soil. Keep a live soil and take care of your business </seg>
            <seg id="p140">MARKETING FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CROPS 127 The first point in marketing is to have a high-class product to mar - ket. It is very easy to market high-class stuff. Potatoes from our ranch sold at $2 per hundredweight in Denver for the last five years, no matter what the price of other potatoes were. We put them up so that they ran from about 201 to 205 potatoes to the hundred pounds. That is about what that trade wants. There is no dirt or cuts, or culls. When we started in to market in the fall, a good sound potato was worth 60 cents a bushel; but our government report shows that about 90 per cent of all the potatoes that go to the market are skinned up and poor, and sell from about 35 to 40 cents a bushel. In my work I have studied the marketing, and was forced to do it in a way, in our own business. In the last two years I have been work - ing with the office of markets at Washington. A year ago last Novem - ber I was made chairman of the committee to visit the northwest and western part of the United States and investigate their methods of doing business, in the raising and marketing of their fruits. It was an interesting study and probably the most enjoyable one I had ever taken. Those people out there were so courteous, and they took par - ticular pains and time to show us everything they had, and it was the first time in my life I ever saw honest co-operation. Of course, as a rule, the American people do not do anything until they have to, but with the citrus fruit people and raisers of lemons and oranges they had to. They organized the California Fruit Growers' Exchange and later on got G. Harold Powell to manage it, and the nature of the system that is back of that proposition is just beautiful to see. It is a wonderful problem for those people out there, because they have a big industry and a long ways for the stuff to go to market. During the last decade the population of the United States increased about 21 per cent; that is correct, if I remember rightly. The con - sumption of lemons and oranges increased 78 per cent and a fraction, and that is due to business management. Day before yesterday, in Memphis, at the meeting of the fruit growers and western fruit job - bers down there, taking the orange crop for example, Mr. Powell presented figures to show that the consumer's portion is distributed as follow Fruit on the tree, 40.3 cents; harvest, 1.9 cents; packing, 6 cents; selling, 1.2 cents; freight and refrigeration, 0.6 cent; jobbing, 8.1 cents; retailers, 4.91 cents. The grower thus gets about 40 cents out of his dollar. Taking co-operation in its true sense, exemplified probably the best in the world is the example of Denmark. It was only a few years ago that Schleswlg-Holstein was taken away in the German war, which left Denmark in pretty bad shape, but by practicing co-operation today it is probably one of the wealthiest nations per capita we have.

            <seg id="p141">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 128 with which I am more familiar, means this for us, that the producers must come closer together in honest co-operation. We must strive to raise a better quality of product and put that up in better shape for the market, and especially in better shape than we are doing. If we had that already done, or if vie do that, I believe that the awakening of the business man, and the opening of the railroad lines, which is com - ing very rapidly now, realizing as they do that their success depends upon the producer, is going to help us very materially to push forward the work that our government has been doing or will be doing for us in the near future. For two and a half years they have been studying the conditions throughout the country, and they have gathered very many startling facts, from the beginning. There is many weak point* in the present system of marketing of the farm product, and there is much waste that can be easily eliminated. As we awaken to the better business principles that we are bound to have, we will naturally eliminate those we do not use. Reports from the various states that have put in the commission of marketing are very encouraging. I believe many of our states will do this. Our agricultural colleges of the country are filled to overflowing. You can hardly take up a paper of any prominence without seeing something in that paper about marketing or rural credits, or better marketing, or better agriculture, or better live stock. I had the pleasure of listening to an address last week of a very able animal industry man. He told us in that address that of the twenty-one million dairy cows in the United States over fourteen million of them were boarders. There is not a branch in agriculture today but what if we would go into it from a purely strictly business standpoint am! eliminate the waste but that it would mean a grand thing for us. Mr. O'Donnell of the reclamation service made a statement a short time ago in my presence that upon the North Platte project in Nebraska, for the year 1915, the farmer's oat crop was sold at about $8.50 an acre anil cost them about $12.50 an acre to raise. They made considerable money upon their beets, but on a number of farms or ranches, as they call them there, they found that by taking hold and co-operating with the farmers and helping to do it right that they have made a savinK of about five dollars an acre, that was absolutely going to waste on those farms. That is five per cent on |100 land. As I said in starting, that wherever I go and hear a practical and successful man talk like Mr. Rich, I deduct from that address, if he is a practical and successful man, the prinripl^s 1 have just enunieratPll, it. marketing the farm products. First, grow your product the finest; it is possible to grow it. Second, eliminate your waste. Third, pack your product as fine as you know how, and always have it uniform, if possible, for quality soon becomes standard. The people will ppy the price for good products any time, and the producer will be benefited in the long run, as will also the consumer, for he will get a better article. </seg>

            <seg id="p143">MARKETING FRUIT AND VEGETABLE CROPS 129 Going back to potatoes just a moment. You get on a dining car or go into the hotels or restaurants of our large cities and you pay IS cents for mashed potatoes and 20 cents for French fried, or 25 or 30 cents for half of a baked potato. Those people want quality. We sent one car-load of potatoes into New York city this fall pat up in cartons. Those wealthy people down there paid five cents a pound for them: they only cost them two and a half cents apiece. If they wanted cod - fish and potatoes and cream in the morning, it was rather cheap com - pared to something else they might have had. They had the best in the line they were eating that money could buy, and it did not cost them so much after all, when you come to look at it that way. Honest co-operation is growing very rapidly throughout the country, and in many instances in my travels I find what is said to be co-opera - tion is not co-operation, it is corporation. In the trip I spoke of I visited one locality where they said they had co-operation. They did not iiave it. because they had allowed men to come in and put in their money to start the matter and made a stock company of it. and allowed tie producers to get about 2 5 per rent of the stock, and thus the nat - ral results had to be that that company was run for the benefit of the stock, because these fellows had their money in it. True co-opera- }und out there, was where one man in an association had only jne vote, no matter how big a man he was, and the association then ■rent out and hired a manager the same as any big business would hire a manager and paid well for it, too. Then it was run with one aim in view, to get the highest price for their product, by putting the best grade they can possibly put on the market, in the best shape possible. here they get the results that are 80 satisfactory to the same price as anybody's potatoes. Eight to 12 and 12 to 16 are shipped back into Pennsylvania and New York and Michigan, and to all the eastern points. Quality: We cannot plant a poor seed, whether it is a vegetable or u fruit, or, as Mr. Rich says, a poor grapevine, or a mixture, and expect to get high-class products with it. We have first to be more particular with our seed-bed. Quite a little of his success, to my mind. is explained by the way he took care of his soil and crop, as well as his seed and quality of his plants. You will find that true in all our work where wm deal with the soil. And if we reduce that to two sentences. Probably the best result we have obtained in the United States with potato associations is in Idaho. They had trials and problems and mistakes in starting for the first season. During the past season, by putting in new cellars at the main points, and they only have four, and erowinii ;i little- better crop and planting better seed — oh. how impor- tant thai &lt;iuestion of i;ootl see.) is and taking a little better care of it. and then putting in power graders, that are made up in North Yakima. they started their potatoes on the up grade, from 5.5 to 8, and from 8 to 12. and from 12 to 16; 5.5 in our southern markets bring the </seg>

The soil needs the humus in the soil, because the building part of the soil lives on humus. The great Creator says He created all the world for life. The scientist says, we are all built the same. Anything that contains life was built of two properties, building and destroying. If we get a reasonable amount of sleep and a reasonable amount of even the plainest food, we throw oft these disease germs fifty to one hundred times a day. But those fellows who are living in dirt and filth and are weak, disease catches them and they cannot throw it off like the strong, and they are torn down The building part of the soil lives on decayed matter, or humus and we cannot eat our pie. and have it, too in nature. We find in reading that four thousand years ago the Jap and the Corean and the Chinaman knew that they could not Ml their pie. am! 1. nature, SO if they grow a crop off from this land here, nature consumes three of the principal plant foods — potash, nitrogen and phosphorus. To meet this loss they grow another crop of a different sort and the&gt; put back with each crop four tons of those elements and frequently get two crops out of it where they could have got but one. It is so simple and so plain that, if you have been trying t away from it, and finding something difficult, it is the reason you ar^ not getting any better results. Of course, as I have always maintained necessity seems to have to come to the American people before the&gt; rise up and change and make a radical move in any way. l'robablj that is due to the same cause. And the same thing is due to the reasor that abroad they arc doing m much better than we are in many re spects. Illustrating the potato again: In 1914, Germany, about large as Colorado and Wyomim. raised 1,980, 000, 00'&gt; bushels o potatoes, while the whole of the I'nited States raised about 350, 000, ( bushels, of one-sixth of Germany's production. That is ver\ simple, too. In New York state, where they have eaten out their soil, they are now planting their rows four feet apart and their hills two feet apart. On our ranch, where we have been rotating our crops and taking good care of the soil, we only plant seventeen thousand hills to their thirty to thirty-four thousand hills, and they have been doing it for forty years. Do you wonder that the soil is worn out° It takes the food in the soil to produce the crop The office of markets states in the result of their study to date thai the municipal markets in some of our cities, if properly handled, will help to remedy this condition very materially. They will recommend some little changes over the system that is now in effect. But with the growth of this country in population the production of high-class prod - ucts will increase, yet I believe we will be able to get remunerative prices for many years to come. It is quite true in the past that it wi raised a very large crop of any one of the vegetables or grains, the producer did not get only so much for it. The consumer paid just about </seg>

But it will only be changed as we, the producers, study and pducate ourselves and learn the conditions and broaden our viewpoint I thank you very much. Discussion. A Member: In regard to the packing house industry, do you not think we ought to havp co-operative packing houses the same as we are having farmers' elevators at the present time? A. For our farming produets do you speak of. or for the li\e stock? Q. For the live stock? \ I believe that the study of the live stock problems up to date would answer your question in the affirmative when it is truly co - operative. There are a number who figure there is going to be a period of co-operative packing house industry, but as yet there has been no such condition. We well know that the present packing houses ud the stock yards and the banks and the loan associations and all are controlled by the Big Five, you might say. We know today also that the little packing plant down in Pueblo sends its meat to Denver. Denver afterwards ships to Pueblo. That s an economic waste and the people are not going to stand for that ery long. We don't want that expense piled up on the public and they are not going to stand for it, and those things will be corrected, but they will never be corrected until the people demand it. \ Member: I live in Hamilton county, and the farmers' elevators have been very successful there. Mr. Sweet: That is the great point about co-operation. It is usually successful. And it has best been demonstrated and worked out today in the elevator proposition. They have handled it in magnificent shape. They have in Wisconsin creameries and cheese factories that are doing great work. There are today probably close to one billion of dollars in the agricultural products of the United States that are mar - keted or handled in a co-operative way. True co-operation is found in Denmark, where nearly all the products are handled in this manner. The agricultural output of the United States is figured at about ten billion dollars, and only one-tenth of it by co-operation. And the larger portion of that is by means of fanners' elevators, but the grain they handle runs up into money very rapidly. Mr. Williams: We find in the apple industry, as it is carried on down here, a great deal of losa. Mr. Sweet: The bpst district wp found in the apple industry was in the Hood river. At Hood River they raise two varieties of apples. They have splendid business management: splendid storage facilities. They have a manager there who is a thoroughly wide-awake business man. William Seig. And for their Newtown Pippin, which is their greatest apple, during the last three months they have averaged about twenty-three cents a box greater than anybody else in the United States for high-class apples. I don't know that I have ever seen a packine </seg>
            <seg id="p146">132 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICILTI'RAL SOCIETY house conducted so strictly up to business and a watcb on everythinu all the time. The manager of each section is held absolutely respon - sible for what he puts out, and they must not allow a cull of any kind to go in the box, nothing but high-class stuff. I believe, as I said in my first remarks, that we will have to put up quality if we are eoinc to make a standard and get our pay for it in any market. Q. Is there any district where they put up high-class stuff and then market the lower grade in a co-operative way also? A. Yes, sir; in several of those districts out there you will find that. But when it conies down to your low or Inferior grade they put that into by-products. The greatest co-operative canning factory we haw in the United States is at Puyallup, in Washington. That is a co - operative proposition, too, in a way. It is a wonderful thing to see. We spent a day there, from early morning to night, and about as inter - esting a day as we had anywhere. And their pack is all by-products you might say, except their raspberries, blackberries and dewberries, which they raise there in that little valley, and that is a very high - class product. They can these because they can't ship them. The bean industry of California, too, is a beautiful Illustration of co-operation and business management. It is wonderful to go in there and see the results they have achieved by common work, and through the manager they put in some few years ago. They thought they were going pretty steep when they paid him $12,000 to come there, but the first year he made them over $400,000. We find that we have to study our proposi - tion as a manager of a department store is studying it Marshall Field once said that the man did not live that rould drop down out of the sky and run a department store, but that we had to educate and take care of that proposition. Many times we find on the ranch that we get hold of a pretty good man and we do all that we can to keep him. but he generally gets away from us. We try to keep them though, for they are hard to get. ■ The Chairman: I have no doubt that Mr. Sweet has made a study this question and had a great deal of practical experience, from the manner in which he has handled this assignment. Yesterday I had a short paper on the subject of commercial marketing and how to develop it. I wrote that paper just as short and brief as I could and evaded answering all the questions that were expected of me. Why did I do that? Because I hadn't had any experience in developing the commer - cial market. I have had, though, a little observation since we have been working with fruit and with the association, and I have observed a few things, and I want to thank the Hon. Mr. Sweet for pointing out some of these fundamental principles. I tried to sound the trumpet a little yesterday, but I could not do it very well. I do know this, it is not worth while for a horticulturist to try and grow something that he has to beg somebody to take. The greatest problem before our associa - tion today is to educate the grower, and we are calling on the student to help us. So I will say here that I am glad to see that the depart- </seg>
            <seg id="p147">ITILIZING THE WASTE 133 ment out at the State Farm is getting in shape so that it will have a man for each line of work. We have down in Otoe county, where I live, a man whom you are not perhaps very well acquainted with, but you must get acquainted with him. He is also studying some fundamental things in this busi - ness. He has made quite a study of the canning proposition. They run a canning factory there and furnish employment to many men, and money to lots of farmers and people around Nebraska City for growing corn, and canning products. And so I take great pleasure in introducing to you Mr. John W. Steinhart, of Nebraska City, who will talk to you upon the subject Ttilizing the Waste in Commercial Orchards." I TII.IZINc. THK WASTK IX COMMERCIAL ()K( HAKKK By John W. Steinlutrt, Nebraska City, Nebraska. Ladies and Gentlemen: As the president remarked, I am from Otoe county and I feel that Otoe county is the birthplace of the state of Ne - braska, especially so in the line of growing fruits. We, down in Otoe county, were the beginners in many things and along many lines of endeavor. That Nebraska today is awakening to the benefit to be de - rived from the cultivation of its lands in the growing of fruits is to be commended, and I am seriously glad to be before you. 1 congratulate you that you have the courage to give of your time and enthusiasm to let people know and notice that our hills are productive along the line of fruit growing. Now, my subject was the matter of the disposal of the waate of the orchard. Strictly speaking it should be salesmanship in the disposi - tion of the products of the orchard. I am in the manufacturing busi - ness, and whenever I am in a town I go first to see the factories of that town. I am interested in the processes in the factory and I go through that institution, and I examine and look into how they prepare their products. And what interests me more than anything else if the office. I want to get into the office and I want to look into the faces of the men who are handling that proposition. I want to see whether they are keen business men and whether they understand salesmanship or not. There is no limit to the product of the factory if the man in the office has his hands in touch with the markets, so that as the product develops it goes to the consumer at once. A flood of waters is a terrible thing, and it is a waste and loss and everything else that is costly and destructive, and there is no occasion for a loss from a. flood if the en - gineer has gone and properly developed the channels for the flood waters when they appear. And that is nothing more than should apply in the markets and in the growing of crops. The flood times appear, especially in fruits. There is a flood time in fruit. You must not wait until the flood appears, but provide for it, so that it won't create disaster and loss. You must stand ready, so that you are abso - lutely master of the situation when the crop appears. </seg>
            <seg id="p148">134 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Now, the condition that presents itself with the apple grower is this: I find that the apple grower has in the first part of the season what he calls his supply of early apples, his summer apples. And when the June and Astrachan and Early Harvest come on the market, they are grabbed up eagerly by tbe consumer and the prices are right. Pretty soon the high tide arrives, and you have your fruit and you put it on the market, and the flood comes and low prices prevail, and there is in some places waste and disaster and loss. In the fall of the year you have your winter supply of apples. You have your three grade* Your perfect apples that you have worked with and sprayed and cared for in other ways. And science has come in and shown you how you can produce this perfect apple, and this apple is to you a pleasure and a joy. And it must be a profit, because labor avails not unless it has its return. The next is the apple with the blemish, uot a cull: I call it a cripple. This cripple must be forced out on the market and must be placed in the hands of the consumer, even ahead of the finished beautiful product which you have You shove it out ahead and it tills the markets, and about the time that the consumer is disgusted because of the poor quality that is presented to him out comes this finished product. But he is sick and sore of apples and won't have anything to do with them and your labor is lost. Now that is absolutely the poorest salesmanship on earth, and nothing could be so bad as that. Nothing is to be so regretted. I remember last summer all through our section we had a beautiful crop of apples. The Jonathan, which is our best apple, was fine, but on account of the season and on account of the excessive rains the number of seconds was greater than the number of perfect apples. And what happened. They put the Jonathan seconds out on the market, and when the finished perfect Jonathan apple ap - peared, there was no market for it at all. The situation is absolutely inconsistent, and something must be done with this second grade marketable apple, and something must be done with this waste, ao that you can market your finished product and get the proper returns That is where the manufacturer steps in; that is where you should join hands with the manufacturer and the canner and try in some way to solve this problem. That brings me up to the explanation of how a canning business is handled. At Nebraska City our special line is sweet corn, tomatoes, and pumpkins. Early in the season, just at this time, we are going out among the farmers and we are contracting for corn, tomatoes and pumpkins. We will contract all the way from two to five thousand tons of corn; from fifteen to twenty thousand bushels of tomatoes, and pumpkins, all the way from two to three thousand tons or more. When we contract ahead, we know where we are going to get our source of supply from and when we are going to get it. And just as soon as we have our contract with the growers we turn around to the jobbers and distributers and we say: "Here we have something to sell, and in the future, as it has been in the past, we will deliver it to you. for they </seg>
            <seg id="p149">UTILIZING THE WASTE 135 will give it to us, and we will put it into the finished product." And so in due course we sign a contract with the jobber, and he in turn goes to the retailer, and that whole system is blocked out ahead of the delivery of the product to the market. That is system, and with it there is no flood of tomatoes or corn or pumpkins. It is all arranged when these things are ripe and matured and ready to gather. There is no hurrying or scurrying around to find a market. As soon as the goods are canned, it is taken out of the warehouse and the whole thing is very natural and practical. How does this apply in the matter of apples* In my personal experience for the last twenty or twenty-five years I have labored down there to try and develop the canning of apples. But the producer doesn't think we are entitled to any quality. If we could go out and buy some apples to can, it would be all right. But the producer, if he has some old windfalls, or stuff of that kind, old Ben Davis, yellow in appearance and a good deal like rubber, that if when they happen to get into the can look like a piece of black lead, they will go and shove all that stuff off onto us and want us to can an article that will disgust the consumer when they open the can. If we wanted to go out and buy five thousand bushels of apples, we could not do it. We would ask a man if he would bring us in a thousand bushel of apples, and he will say: "I will see about it. If I can get a better price from a man down town, you can't have them." If I go to him in the springtime and say, "I would like to buy so many thousand bushels of apples, so that I can go to the jobbers and know at what price I can sell." he will say, "No, I will wait till the apples come, so that I will know the market price." And by that time, possibly New York state, or some other state, has come in and sold all the apples they have o sell, and for that reason we won't buy There is no reason on earth why the apple, the most wonderful fruit that God has given us, should not be used more extensively in the canning process. The only way the apple is used today in the can is where it is packed in water and used for pie purposes, and then the quality is generally poor, especially in the west. In New York state they will can uniform varieties of apples, like the Greening, or apples like that, and they can comes west and get all the way from fifty to seventy-five cents a dozen more for the case than we can, be because the grower or canner or somebody back there is Insisting on quality. I have talked with your president here and I see you have an association. n I rome to your association along in the spring of the year and contract for ten thousand bushels of Jonathans and Winesaps, and ten thousand bushels of other varieties, so that we can go out to the jobber this year and say. we are going to can the Jonathan and Winesap and so forth, and we are going to put on the can that the variety is a certain variety of hand-picked Jonathan or Winesap, so that when the con - sumer comes into the store he knows just exactly what he is buying and is just as safe as if he was buying it out of the barrel? Why shouldn't we be able to do that? </seg>
            <seg id="p150">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 136 Think of tbe millions and millions of dollars worth of canned goods that are sold and consumed in this country today and the per cent used in the way of canned apples, which is very small indeed. Canned peaches and pears and everything like that are sold by the car-load, and the canners in California go out and contract in bie blocks for the peaches and pears and so forth. They have to do it —they could not run their business any other way. If the apple grower says that the No. 2 apple should never go to a canning factory, it is a reflection upon the canning industry Why, it is generally stated that canning fac - tories use only windfall apples. I wish the canning factories of the United States would stand as a unit and say we will not take over our scales one pound of windfall apples. Send your windfall apples to the vinegar works. Give us your seconds, the apple that on its face has a blemish, but on the inside is good. The face blemish doesn't hurt; we can remove that. There are 101 ways for the handling of apples in the can. The canning business is just in its infancy. Why. within the last four or five years we have developed v hat is called the sanitar&gt; can. We had what was first called the cap -nC. hole can. The contents - was placed in through a little narrow hn-r and then you placed your cap on and then it was sealed or solder 1 on. It is now done awa&gt; with and now we have a can that has no t &gt;p on it all. and &gt;ou put your contents in the can and put the top on and it is clamped on by ■ mechanical process. There is no heat, or acid, or solder or anything like thai And you can put the contents in the can, the full size of the can. and of th«' product. You can put apples in whole, or anywa; j*w sanitary conditions And the far behind the canning industry now »r is realizing that all this care i rood-, makes me realize that th want to. and that has increased the that the United States government i and due to the fan that the ronsun being taken in the conservation of canning business is merely in its infancy, and I feel that this second grade apple that is your menace today, and for which you must tei some value, if you must put it out ahead of your perfect fruit, you had better come to the canner. Do like the nan who grows your sweet corn o^ tomatoes. He will sell his tomatoes to us at the rate of 3&lt;i cents ;i bushel. He doesn't have to sell at a local or retail price. But he is justified in selling to us in that way, because of what he p retail. The fact that we take the bulk of his crop enables him to sell them at that price. You would come to canner and maybe have to sell your srcond apple at souie less than you miubt feel you could get for it if you would ship it in bulk or some other way. but when you realize that when it goes into the can it is a conservation of the fruit, and along such a line that the product is used throughout the year, and that you will have your market open for your finished ami better product, you have solved your problem even though at the moment you take a less price for your No. 2 apple. As I said before, it resolves itself down to a matter of salesmanship </seg>
            <seg id="p151">137 Figure out tor yourself if it is not best to sell some of your product along lines that will not compete with your other lines, and if you get that into your system once, there will be no question of co-operation aa between the grower and the canner. As regards co-operative canneries, it is all right, and the time may come when every cannery in the United States is merely a co-operative institution with the grower. That may come, and it may not. In regard to the farmers' elevators, that prin - ciple is all right. Because you merely buy the grain and turn it on at a small profit. But in the canning business it takes thousands of things that are not in the elevator business. That is all 1 have to say. I am just soing to put this thought with you, whether as apple growers it will not be well to consider salesman - ship of the line, and go to the canner and ask him if he will not take your seconds, and if he will not attempt to develop the business of canning apples so as to use a greater volume of fruit in the years to come. I thank you IHsCllhxion The President: I think when the time comes and we get these young orchards started up and down the river we can take care of Mr. Steinhart's business. He has an idea there that is fundamental, and we can follow it to advantage — an industry that will take care of our waste. But we cannot afford financially, under the present orchards and the present system of conducting our business, where we can get dollar and a quarter a hundred for the twos mixed with number ones we cannot afford to take them out and sell them to him at the price he is willing to pay. As soon as these orchards are developed so that we have enough of the good fruit on the market, I thiuk at that time the canning business will be developed. A Member: I think Mr. Steinhart's idea of stating on the can the variety of apple would be a very good thing. I am a retailer of thirty - five years' experience. Our customers seemed to think that a canned apple was a canned apple, and that is all. Now I believe that is the way to create a demand for a certain variety of apple the same as they do in retailing the other fruit, and any other thing for that matter. I would sa* it is almost the hardest thing in the world to get a high grade Nebraska apple to sell. They are almost all Idaho or Washington or Oregon apples. It is almost impossible to get a good Nebraska apple, but we can get plenty of these seconds. Last year they had lots of them, but the people seem to think if they want to get a good apple you must get the western apple. 1 think in one or two instances I have bought apples from the Pollard orchard that were nice apples, but outside of that- well, I bought a car of apples from the Weaver or - chards that were nice, too — but outRide of those two orchards there are very few apples that compare with the western apples. Mr. Sweet: Just one point. While at Hood River on the trip I spoke of we happened to get there just about the time the government </seg>
            <seg id="p152">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 138 men had completed their experiment of the apple syrup. The report I have from Washington was that that experiment was so successful thai in the near future they are going to extend it thoroughly to all districts in the United States. A Member: If this can is to be labeled, isn't it possible thai Mr Steinhart could pay more for Jonathans or Grimes' Golden? Mr. Sweet: They told me out west that as soon as these canning plants get started, the growers, realizing what the canning plant meant to them, would get a much better price than they did at first, because the canner is demanding quality. The Chairman: There is one thing I would like to mention and it is this: The apple can be put in cold storage and sold in packages. There is no need of canning it except for trade that is too out of the way from the cold storage house. There is another phase of thia sub ject that perhaps everyone of us are interested in, and that is "canning the surplus." that Mr. Steinhart doesn't take care of and that the marketing end doesn't take care of, and I take great pleasure in intro - ducing to you Miss Hulda Peterson, of the University of Nebraska, of Lincoln. Nebraska, who will discuss that subject for you. CANNING THE SURPLUS By Miss Hulda Peterson, Lincoln, Nebr. Miss Hulda Peterson: I have just fifteen minutes to I have some things here I want you to taste. I am glad my connection is not altogether with the home economics department, and I feel thai I dare to mention it here, since one of the preceding speakers men - tioned it, and that subject is the boys' and girls' club work in Nebraska, and wherever I come in touch with the canning business through our boys' and girls' canning clubs, it is from that standpoint that I will talk to you more than anything else. We realize that in order that the factory might can the surplus that would otherwise go to waste, as Mr Steinhart brought out, we must create a demand for the products be - fore the factory can sell them. The home is not going to use commer - cial canned products unless they are taught how to use that product and realize what it means. It is a fact, regrettable as it may be. that we do not use one-tenth of the vegetables and fruits that we should, us* in our homes, and it is also a startling fact that over one-half of all our eatables and fruits, even in Nebraska, go to waste. Why up in the northwestern part of the state a lady came to me and said, "I wish I had known I could take care of my string beans. I did not know we could can them." This was in the month of October, and I said, "About what was the amount you should judge went to waste?" and she MM, "I did not use one-tenth of them." Now, if of your garden, or some other garden, about one-tenth went to waste, you see we would have our one-half anyway. We are encourag - ing our boys in home gardening for various reasons In the first place. </seg>
            <seg id="p153">CANNING THE SURPLUS 139 regarding the work in our towns and cities, I might state that requests have come to our institution with reference to putting a course of gardening work directly into the schools from over thirty towns in Nebraska. These requests have come from Beatrice. Holdrege. Grand Island. McCook and Alliance. If it goes into one-half that number, it means three thousand more boys' and girls' club members, or three thousand more gardens, ranging from 100 square feet up to an acre, that would be made productive this last year that have not been util - ized at all during the past year. Although the schools here have done a great deal along that line for many years, it was just this past year that the extension service was allowed to look in and give a helping hand in order that we might -•■i some information along that line. We have definite data from about two hundred boys and girls who had gardens in the city. The average net profit from those two hundred gardens, ranging all the way from lot) square feet up to 6,000 square feet, was about $239; the highest ranging about $735 net profit per acre. I mean this is net profit per acre, you understand. Now, then, the boys and girls are started in taking care of the waste in the city. Last year there were probably more gardens in the city of Lincoln than any other city of the middle west for its size, and in spite of that fact there were over Too acres of unutilized land within the city of Lincoln. From a survey made by the city it gives us 701 acres within the city itself. Multiply that with the average net profit, and you will have over a half million net profit. Now. then, we are giving to our boys and girls this summer vacation work, and one of the greatest problems with the boys and girls is to put their energies into channels where it is going to accom - plish the most good, and into a channel that is going to mean the building up of the best there is in those boys and girls, to make better i itizens of them. There is nothing that makes me feel worse than to ask boys and girls what they are going to do in the summer and have them say. "Nothing." The little fellow who says that, or the big fel - low, whichever the case may be, is certainly to be pitied. We are not building citizens of our boys and girls unless we give them something to do and something to carry out. Work outdoors is ever so much better for them, and. secondly, they are doing something from which they realize a profit in health and finance, and they get at the same time a little business training right along with it. And so I realise what a big field there is for the canning of the apple. Maybe I mis - understood the president a moment ago, but I think he said they could go into cold storage. But I canned some apples last fall, and here they are, and I would rather have the apple I canned last fall than the fresh apple of the cold storage variety. I am going to distribute some of these government circulars. It is called "Canning the Windfall Apple." Q. Do you use any acid in the canning of these apples? A. No. sir Q.

" This is a subject that the potato grower is interested in and Professor Hood is a new man in our institution, and has been here only a short time, and is the head of that department of vegetable gardening that we are paying more attention to than we did a few years ago. 1 now take pleasure in introducing to you Prot. Ceorge W. Hood, of the l'niver sity of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebraska. Seeds are the basis of our agricultural activities. The value of our crops are directly dependent upon the quality of the seed we plant. The success or the failure of any agricultural enterprise is entirely depend ent upon the ability of the seeds we sow to make a profitable plant. The question of seed purity is a vital one. This fact has long been recognized by our federal and state governments. Many of our states have passed laws for inspecting the seed, and equipment and material are available for the analysis of seed samples. Our growers cannot be ignorant of the fact that some legislation is often necessaiy to insure good seeds, because the ignorance or the carelessness of many of our seed firms are the means of the farmers losing hundreds of dollars annually. The question which will logically arise is. what is a good seed and how can a good seed be detected? Unfortunately this is a difficult question to answer and one that wilt admit of some discussion. A good seed may be easy to define, but to determine a good seed is not so easy. From the nature of the seed, it is evident that there can be more deception and more cheating in the seed business than almost any other. This condition is possible because in the great majority of seeds there is no difference in color, size, weight, or any other external ap - pearance that can be detected by the inexperienced buyer. Very few seed experts can tell the difference between an old and a new seed. (.&lt;M»|&gt; SKKI&gt;S \ KKSI S I'CKlli HKKDS. By &lt;««&gt;rn«* W. H&lt;mmI. </seg>
            <seg id="p155">Good Seed versus Poor Seed </seg>
            <seg id="p156">GOOD SEEDS VERSUS POOR SEEDS 141 Beside* the external characteristic there are certain invisible internal characters requisite to a good seed. These are not always easy to ascertain A good seed must be viable, which is the ability to sprout, it must have a certain degree of maturity; it must be sound, that la. free from any mechanical injuries, and lastly, it must possess a certain degr»»e of germinative energy. The maturity of a seed is a vital issue. Maturity is hard to define, because seeds will often germinate and grow and yet be immature. Therefore, we are compelled to say that the power of germination is not one of the distinguishing characteristics of maturity, unless we say that a seed is mature as soon as it will germinate, because many sssds. :is (or example the corn, will germinate long before its color, shape, weight or size indicates maturity. We are compelled to assume then that viability or the power to germinate is not coincident with maturity but precedes it. Immature seeds are, therefore, not good seeds, because the plant resulting from such seeds are weak and lack vigor. The germinative energy is an inherent character in every seed. It cannot be seen, nor can it be calculated, yet it is present in every seed, and the degree to which it is present often means failure or success. Germinative energy is that energy which is devloped when the seed germinates. It is sometimes called the speed of germination, and if present in sufficient quantity will cause the seed to germinate rapidly and make a good plant, but if reduced by age, unsoundness or maturity, th» resulting plant let will suffer and in many cases die. In determining the value of a seed many factors must be consid - ered. We have just learned but little can be told from the external appearance of the seed, yet their apparent characters must be given some consideration. These are shape, color and sjze. Experienced handlers of seeds can roughly judge their value from these qualities, hut unfortunately many seeds are processed and made to appear perfect in color and luster. This deception must be taken into consideration Mature, well-grown seeds usually have some general outlines, and each race has a distinctive shape. But in good seeds the endosperm and the embryo must All the seed coat and give it plumpness. If seeds are poorly grown this condition will not be present and the seed will appear shriveled, a defect often overlooked by the buyer. Good seeds, with few exceptions, have a distinctive color. This color is constant and variation in the color of seeds is usually due to varying degrees of ripe - ness. Poorly ripened seeds usually lack intensity of color and there - fore are defective. Again, some seeds change in color with age. There - fore, in general, seeds showing much deviation for the normal color should be carefully tested, before planting. Dullness of color Indicates poor seeds and should be looked upon with suspicion. Certain rwttit are characterized by a distinctive odor. The celery, carrot and parsnip seed possess odors well known to everyone. This odor is present if the seed is fresh, but it is gradually lost when the seed becomes old. To a limited degree then the odor of some seeds is an index to their value. </seg>
            <seg id="p157">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 142 Thus far we have been discussing the characteristics inherent to a good seed which have to do chiefly with the growth of the seed. There are. however, other conditions governing the value of the seed even should it possess these qualities, namely, the proper storage during the dormant period. Few people realize the value of proper storage in maintaining the quality of a seed. The seed grower must realize that the seed is not an inert dead object. Quite contrary to this belief there are changes constantly going on within the seed from the time it u - mature until it is germinated. We know that moisture and gases are given off and there are changes in size, as well as other internal changes with regard to the stored food. The life processes of the seeds are slowly but surely ebbing away, and if the seed is stored long enough the life gradually disappears and the seed is dead. In order then to aid the seed in storage certain conditions must be maintained, namely, it must be protected from heat, moisture and in some cases air. The seed must also be thoroughly cured before storage. Proper storage, therefore, is not a simple process, because each famil&gt; . genera and species require different storage conditions. The climate also exerts some influence on the stored seed. Some seeds when stored will keep much better in one climate than in another. In addition to the factors mentioned the influence of temperature on stored seeds is important in maintaining good seeds. Perhaps the&gt; should be kept at a temperature just above freezing, but it should be uniform. However, some variation from this temperature might be necessary in the case of poor seeds, but it may be said that seeds in general can be kept at the lowest temperature at which germination will not take place. The temperature should not be allowed to ma - terially increase without plenty of ventilation to permit the increased amount of moisture given off by the seeds to be carried away. Disastrous diseases which appear in certain regions and ruin great areas of a given crop are often the result of poor seeds. These seeds are poor because they carry the disease ■either in their tissue or harbor spores of a disease on their seed coats. Several familiar examples of diseases carried by the seed is the anthracnose of the bean and some diseases of the cabbage. In the case of the anthracnose the disease i.s a fungus and the hyphae grow through the pod and into the bean When the seed is ripe the fungous threads are dormant and remain so until the seed is planted. When the plant begins to grow the disease is then seen and the crop is affected. Infected seeds of this kind look the same as seeds not infected, and the buyer can easily be deceived. There is no way of treating these infected seeds even if it were certain the disease was present, and the only method of securing good seeds is in the careful selection of the pods which are free from the disease. In fact, where the plant is diseased, no seeds should be taken from it even if the pods appear to be clean. Another example of supposed seed infection is found in the cabbage rot. While there is some evidence to show that the rot enters the </seg>
            <seg id="p158">143 GOOD SEEDS VERSUS POOR SEEDS plant through the water pores, it seems also to be clear that the spores &gt;f the disease are also found on the seed and serves as a source of in - fection. Such seeds are often the cause of heavy losses and no seeds should be planted unless they have been treated with something to kill any spores that might be present on them. Mercuric bichloride, di - luted one part to 1,000 parts of water, is considered the best remedy. The seeds should be soaked for fifteen minutes before planting. The poor vitality of seeds and the disease infested seeds are not he only kinds of poor seeds. Many seeds are not true to name, and hese are very poor seeds. If you purchase a given variety, you not &gt;nly want the seed to come up but you want it to be the variety you elected. It is not enough for the seeds to be cabbage, because there is a great difference in the time of maturity of the several varieties. When you buy early cabbage of a given variety you don't want a late sort. The good grower can figure almost to the day when a given crop will be on the market, if the variety is right, but if it is not. he loses IH1H&gt; Th.- trueness of type is not all that is necessary. The purity of the sample is important. This phase of poor seed is more prevalent in the grasses and field crops perhaps than in the vegetable crops. Weed seeds or any other seed foreign to the sample are impurities, and the seed is poor. This is often the means of introducing bad weeds which often become serious pests to a given community. A careful and criti- ;tl examination of the seeds under a hand lens is important to deter - line the purity of a given sample. The size of seeds materially influences the subsequent yield. Ac- cording to some recent work by the Vermont Agricultural Experiment Station, it was learned that many seeds show decided gains in the seeds over small seeds. The merits of large lettuce tion o seeds showed an increased weight of the edible mature plants as well as better heading up capabilities, earliness and more uniformity of leadinc Radishes showed good sains in favor of large seeds. Beans ilso favored large seeds. In practically every case, with the exception peas, some decided gain was noticeable in favor of the large Mad ■v the small one. The weight and size of plants compared at differ- ent stages of growth shows that a continuous and permanent advantage exists in favor of large seed.' Therefore, large seeds of a given variety good seed After this brief discussion relative to the condition surrounding poor and good seeds the next step of importance is the remedy and the control for such losses. These mieht be summed up in the careful selection of the seed company and absolute sincerity in the honesty of the seed producer, the systematic testing of all seeds before planting and the regular remedial treatment for "11 seeds which are thought to carry any disease. The question of seed houses needs little comment. There are many scattered over the country, some are good and some are bad. Your </seg>
            <seg id="p159">144 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY judgment must be the criterion which will determine this factor The reputation of the man as to honesty and to sincerity must be the de - termining factors. Don't be deceived in buying seeds in highly colored packages which attempt to illustrate the plant which the seed inside will product- Colored prints are expensive and usually the seeds enclosed in such packages are worth little more than the container. Seeds are what you want and the less expensive the package the better chances you will have for getting good seeds. The colored package Is used entirely to attract the eye and to appeal to the imagination, but imagination don't make plants. It seams to me the better seeds will always be found in plain, strong packages, because the seeds will sell themselves if they are good, true to type and viable. Therefore, colored packages are not required to stimulate their purchase. The honesty and the integrity of the grower is not always sufficient to insure good seeds. Many timei? they mean well, but conditions over which they have no control, and many times not even known to them, influence the quality of the seed. To protect ourselves from thi.- un - certain factor seed testing should always be practiced. This is a simple operation and every grower should know what per cent of his seeds are viable. In all vegetable work, especially where large returns are expected and must be made by extra early crops, this is highly im - portant. Suppose you are expecting to supply a very early market and have neglected to And out what percentage of viableness you have The seeds are planted. Suppose you plant the usual quantity for a given area. Suppose every condition is favorable and after heini. in the ground for ten days you learn that the seeds are only 25 per rent viable. What is the result. Ten days lost, profits ruined and the market disappointed. The successful grower cannot afford to plant seeds the viability of which he does not know and be successful. It is the early crop that pays and it is the progressive grower thai mak the money. The testing of seeds is simple. There are several different kinds of seed testers, namely, the dinner-plate seed tester, the ttle germinator and the Geneva seed tester. Of this list the dinner-plate tester is ;he cheapest. but the Geneva tester the most efficient and the most eoonomi cal. For practical purposes the Geneva seed tester should be used. If a small sum of money would be in\ested in this simple piece of equipment and seeds tested systematically, many additional dollars could be made and a greater efficiency expected.

But I went away on a trip on the road and froze my nose, and when I not home I found I did not have time to rewrite my paper, so I will nive it to you the way it is. By G. H. Van Hoiiten. Lenox. Iowa, While this is not a subject of my own choosing. I do not believe that there is a more important subject for discussion at a horticultural meeting, for the reason that more people are, or should be, interested in the matter of gardening than in any other line of horticultural work; for no home can be complete without vegetables and, in order to have them fresh and in good supply, it is almost necessary to depend on the home garden rather than on the market. Especially is this true of those who reside in the country or even in our smaller towns, and even the city dweller, especially if the cost of living is an object, should have a garden. These thoughts were indelibly impressed on the mind when traveling in Japan, where no home is so small that there is not some attempt to grow something. If there is no ground where things - can be planted, then window boxes, or even the house top, is utilized to grow something, and even a few queer nooks and corners of ground, generally very small indeed, were made to yield the uttermost possible crop of something useful; and so, on my return to America, was im - pressed, an never before, of the prodigal waste of our people. On the liiriiis there ran bi no excuse on account of lack of land for a garden. nit even in our towns and cities it is seldom the case that there is not uom for something. I remember one town dweller in Iowa who hat! only a few square feet of ground and that under the eaves of a small house, and yet the space was utilized to raise a plentiful supply of lettuce and radishes, and as most town lots have some square rods of land that could be utilized for a garden, it seems inexcusable that more vege - tables are not grown. It should seem unnecessary to speak of the benefits and necessities of the case when so many people are complain - ing of the high cost of living, but when we realize the vast number of homes without gardens, the necessity is apparent. Some seem to think that teams and expensive tools are necessary in such rases, but if there is a will there is a way. and the tools absolutely necessary in such cases are a spading fork or spade, a rake, a hand weeder and a garden trowel, all costing, say. not to exceed a dollar and a half, and even part of these tools can be dispensed with and often two or more neighbors could use the same tools; and frequently tools could be borrowed, thus avoiding even this small outlay.

With good tools, in good condition, and with the work done under proper conditions, gardening is a pleasure, but with poor, dull implements or rusty or broken tools there is seldom found a more discouraging job than garden work, and it is one of the hard conditions of the life of some women that they have to do Burden - ing and under such unfavorable conditions. But, some may pay: Would you have women do such work as gardening? Well, many women do such work, and most of them delight in such work under favorable conditions, and should be allowed to work in the garden if they desire to do so, for there is health, pleasure and, sometimes, profit in such work; but the pleasure depends in a large part on the favorable conditions and the assistance rendered in doing such work. ■.location. Il often happens that the location of the garden is a fixture, and this is especially true in towns and cities, but on the farm it is sometimes the case that a garden spot may be selected The mis - take is common of makine the garden near groves or other trees, and this is a very unfavorable condition or circumstance, for best results cannot be had in such locations. If possible a well-drained piece of land should be selected, distant from trees or other obstructions that will interfere with best results.

It is often desir able to fence in a small sarden and then plant most of the potatoes, cabbage and many other kinds of garden vegetables distant from the poultry; and, especially potatoes, except ;t tew for very early, need not to be planted in the garden plat, but may be planted on any part ol the farm. or. if in town, on detached lots or land.

Seeds of the larger and heavier varieties, such as sweet corn, peas, beans, and other seeds needed in large quantities, should be erown and kept for home planting; while some of the lighter seeds, and especially where but a few are needed, can be bought, as five cents will usually buy all needed of a particular kind or variety.

If in doubt as to vitality of seeds, an easy way to test them is to take a plate and blotting paper, then scatter seeds, place another blotting paper over the seeds, pour on warm water and keep in warm place. rr-ufwing water as it evaporates, and in a few days it can be known as to the vitality of the seeds, for the top paper can be raised, and this method avoids the necessity of counting the seeds planted: for those that sprout are so conspicuous as to enable one to determine the pro- jriion of good seed. Bulk seed can often be bought in stores, and a little practice will enable one to pass judgment on many of them by tasting. For example, if the seeds look good and have a decided char- eristic taste, it is usually found that such seeds will grow; but if look old or chaffy and the characteristic taste is absent, let them alone, tor such seeds will generally disappoint the planter if he expects uood results from them. There are plenty of reliable dealers, and now, with the parcel post, it is easier and cheaper to depend on buying than formerly, and it generally happens that most planters, even if in the habit of saving seeds, will want some new variety or something for Preparation of the soil is an important part of gardening, and If done on a scale to justify, deep plowing is desirable, and fall plowing is especially to be recommended. A heavy application of well-rotted barn - yard manure is recommended, preferably before the land is plowed, but if this has not been done a top dressing will add to the crop. It will often be desirable, where the land has not been properly manured, to apply manure in planting, either in the trenches or hills as the planting is done, which will be of advantage in early germination and vigorous srowth. There may be conditions where it will pay to use a commer - cial fertilizer, but it is generally too expensive, except in certain cases or under special conditions, as our rich lands need more humus and the cheapest application is from the barnyard, which only involves, as a rule, the cost of the labor of the application. Hotbed* are desirable, but not necessary, unless a very early or large garden is desired. Two small beds would be better than one of larger size, for the reason that tomatoes and some other vegetables need more heat than cabbage and many other varieties. A bed of a size requiring but a single sash, or, better, two such beds, require little time and attention, will be found desirable; and yet tomato and cabbage and enough of other plants can be grown in the bouse in pans or boxes to meet the necessities in most cases. Plants grown in hotbeds or in the house should be hardened before planting in the open ground. Hotbed plants are best hardened in cold frames, while those grown In the house can be set outdoors during the day and warm nights, to be returned to the house or protected from cold when necessary. Have been told that an incubator is excellent for starting plants and throw out the remark for what it worth, never having tried that plan. </seg>
            <seg id="p163">148 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Planting is often done too early in the spring or when the land is too wet. A better plan than to plant very early is to plow or cultivate the ground, harrowing to firm it so weed seed will germinate, and an - other harrowing or cultivation to be given as often as once a week, so that weed seed will germinate and be killed, is better than to plant too early, for some seeds will not grow vigorously, even if they germinate, but will grow very slowly, and before they are large enough to cultivate the weeds are in evidence, to such an extent as to make success doubt - ful or the work expensive; and as much work can be saved by prepa - ration of ground before planting, thorough preparation is to be desired Planting should be done in straight, narrow rows and thick enough to insure a stand, for it is cheaper and better to thin than to fill up or have poor stand. In fact, considering the value of land and the cost ot weeding, it is often cheaper to sow in seed-bed and transplant than to plant in rows at first. This is particularly true of tomatoes, cabbage, cauliflower and some other varieties. Permanent (Jartlen. Under this designation is meant those varie - ties that do not require planting each year. There are three essentials for this part of the garden : Rhubarb or pie plant, asparagus and winter onions. "Oh," some one may say. "we do not eat rhubarb pies " Well, when fruits are scarce even the despised Russian mulberry mixed with rhubarb is relished, and those who like marmalades and fruit mixtures will use rhubarb in many ways, and as it costs little, lasts many years and is perfectly hardy and grows in any soil and climate, it is worthy of a place in every garden. Then asparagus is one of the earliest, best and easiest grown of all and should be srown in every garden. If anyone tries to get you to dig deep trenches, and then partly fill up with broken pottery and brirk-bats, just consider him "batty" and refuse to do anything so foolish. Neither need you kill and bury black cats as part of the preparation, for barnyard manure is all that is needed. As to deep planting; it may be an advantage in dry locations and for hot seasons, but cuttings will come later and may continue later, but plants from seed sown two inches deep and allowed to remain for permanent bed will do all right. Scald seed and after standing about twenty-hours plant and cultivate for first year, thinning and filling ur as needed in the fall, cover with well-rotted manure, and cultivate well each year until ready to use, but do not be in too great a hurry, but await the appearance of large, vigorous sprouts before cutting, which will be the third year, generally. Of course, some time can be gained by setting two-year plants, but five cents' worth of seed will plant, in a few minutes, as large a piece of ground as it requires a dollar's worth of plants to fill, and then the plants require more work; yet the extra cost and work are justified, for at least part of the patch, for it is too long to wait for the seed to produce returns. Rows should be five feet apart and plants thinned to two feet or less. Winter onions should be set in rows not closer than twelve to eighteen inches and in the early spring, or better still in the fall, if old tops die down, is to pull them </seg>

A planting will last several years and thinning can be resorted to to prolong the usefulness of the bed. Chives are so easily grown as to be worthy of a place in the permanent part of the garden. They are relished by some (or flavoring soups and any one who likes onions will appreciate them. Horseradish is a relish and requires little or no attention except to keep it from spreading. SalHify or vegetable oysters are easily grown and are greatly relished by some — in fact some prefer them to oysters, and by being packed in earth they can be kept in the cellar for winter use. Carrot* and parsnips are easily grown, and where relished should be in every garden, for no other vegetable can be grown more profitably* The latter are better after being left in the ground until spring. Only a small plot of ground is required for a plentiful supply.

In corn the Stowell's Ever pwa is still to be recommended, but there are now very early varieties. and if early, medium and late are planted, a succession can be had until Evergreen comes in, and later plantings can prolong the season Very late corn is often infested with worms, so as to take away the relish for this desirable vegetable, at the end of the season. Hummer squaHhes merit special mention. Boiled or even baked in the ordinary way are not particularly appetizing, but if boiled for about •my minutes and then twice baked, they just fill the bill, and as they are easily prepared, merely washing, then opened and seeds removed, then quartered and rooked, as above suggested, they are just excellent. If not convenient to twice bake at once, one baking can be deferred until next day. It may be that thrice baking would improve them, but there has been no opportunity to try them, for none have escaped from the second baking. As the hard-shelled variety will keep well into the winter, there is no need to be without this desirable vegetable. Chicory is recommended for those who need a substitute for coffee. It can be grown as easily as any other plant, is easily prepared and will keep for years if prepared and kept dry and one soon learns to like It. while, if mixed with coffee, most people do not notice it — probably being used to it in the days when adulterants were common; that la. before our present pure food laws. From seed costing five cents enough coffee can be made to last an old "coffee cooler" for a year and he will thrive on it. l.e&gt;s common yet desirable thing* that should be tried are ground cherries, husk tomatoes, artichokes, sweet potatoes, mangoes and gumbo or okra. All are easily grown. The artichokes should be </seg>

They grow very vigorously after being trans - planted and require plenty of room for best development. Pop-corn should be planted, and so it may be considered a garden rather than a field crop. New things should be tried, not only with the hope of better varie - ties, but new vegetables should be tried — one or more each year, and especially is this to be recommended, if there are young people in the home, not only for the good to come directly, but also for the educa - tional advantages and the mental development that come from acquir - ing new interests, and the stimulation of thought and investigation in - cident to planting, raring for and watchine new varieties and species. Celery and some other vegetables require special care that few growers care to give, and are yet very much desired. This is proven by the large plantations in Michigan, California and other states, the stalks being sent to all parts of the United States, finding ready sale and, besides paying transportation charges, commissions and other profits, yet enable the growers to acquire wealth. Tool* for Kardeninx. aside from the necessary tools suitable for the work found on the farm, are seed drill, hand cultivator, hoes, rakes, hand weeders, garden trowel, hoes, harrow cultivator, etc., but no one will need all these tools. A seed drill is an advantage, for the reason that a narrow row can be planted ; that is, seeds can be planted so that a hand cultivator ran cut close on each or either side of the row, while if planted by hand seeds are liable to scatter, being neither straight nor confined to a narrow space. Deep planting can be effected by mark - ing out, and if but a small planting a Warren or triangular hoe can be used. All tools should be kept sharp and bright, especially is this true if a woman or the young folks are to do this work. Some people are inexcusably careless in the use of tools Last year I loaned a rake to a boy and recently happened to have seen it lying on the ground, rusty and the handle roughened by the weather. Of course, my interest in that rake has vanished, also my good opinion of that boy. Frequent shallow cultivation is to be highly recommended. It re - quires but little, if any, more work if done this way than to let weeds grow. The crops are very much better and the satisfaction greater. In and during the season of 1914, which was so dry that some seeds did not germinate, excellent crops were raised, the success being due to frequent, light cultivation. It not only pays to cultivate often but it pays to keep weeds down, and this can be easily done if the work is done right and in time, while if left for a more convenient time may be neglected entirely or done at greater expense and detriment to the crop. Half as much well done bring better and more satisfactory re - turns than to do the greater amount in the way gardening is frequently done. Some are very energetic during the early season and then later relax their efforts, and then the weeds get in their work and the crop suffers accordingly. </seg>

            <seg id="p167">HOME VEGETABLE GARDENING 151 Transplanting should be done several hours after a rain if conve - nient, rather than immediately after rain, for after a rain the fibrous roots soon emit and then is a good time to plant. Of course, planting ran be done almost any time if water is used in transplanting, and but little is required for each plant. Plants of some considerable size, as a rule, transplant more successfully than very small plants, for the reason that the small plants have not a developed root system. In the evening is a good time to transplant, for there is lesa wilting, less evap - oration during the evening and night, at that time than during the day. A few plants should be left over for filling in any vacancies in case of failure to grow, or possible destruction by cutworms. It is much to be desired to have a complete stand than to have vacancies. After plants are established it seldom happens that the season is so dry that failure will result, provided frequent, shallow cultivation is given. And this should not scare any one, for, if there are no weeds, and tht&gt; ground is free from trash or obstructions, the work is rapidly done, and such work is a pleasure instead of a burden. It is surprising how much can be done in a short time with a good wheel hoe when condi - tions are favorable, and it should be the aim of the planter to keep conditions favorable, and no more work, in the aggregate, will be re - quired to do the work in the way suggested. For early cultivation a double wheel hoe, that is, one that will run on both sides at once, is desired, but later and for heavier work a single, high wheel is desired. It may be that there are satisfactory combined machines — that is seeder and hoe combined — but if so, would not know just what one it is. The bother of taking apart and refitting for each class of work amounts to about as much as the difference in cost of separate machines. But for small gardens a hoe and rake alone answer very well. Of course, for arge gardens, long rows, set wider apart, so that a horse may be used. is all right, but for the small garden, after the plowing is lione, the use of a horse can be dispensed with. In fact, many delay, procras - tinate and never do, under the excuse of waiting for a horse, and thus lose more than if they should go at it with only hand tools and do the work in that way. In small gardens the horse will tramp and break down a good deal, and the light, frequent work required can be done with hand tools, even if nothing better than a rake is at hand, for it is surprising how much ground can be gone over with a hand rake, and for a large part of the cultivation this will do the work admirably. A good, sharp, light hoe, if kept in good condition, that is, free from rust. is an excellent tool for the garden. luterplantinK is a more important proposition for the farmer than for the gardener, and yet has a place with both. For the farmer, who is so situated as to pasture with sheep, calves, pigs and other stock under suitable conditions, interplanting should not be neglected. Among the best crops for corn may be named rape, kale and turnips. In 1914 turnips interplanted with corn, and with no detriment to the </seg>
            <seg id="p168">152 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY corn, brought the writer more than $50 per acre, and in some parts of the field very much more than the sum named. Seed may be sown just before the last cultivation, or better still, after the cultivation, and covered lightly with harrow cultivator. The seed above referred to were sown just before a dash of rain and had no other covering and under favorable weather conditions need no other covering. Of course. it is not often that returns as above given can be secured, on account of low prices or lack of demand, but where the owner can pasture, as above suggested, a market is assured, the cost of planting and seed very little and the havesting nothing, and the crop is little or no worse on the land than if not so sown, for weeds are liable to be in evidence if not sown to the crop as suggested. In the garden, of course, interplanting is more restricted, yet it often happens that a crop is early, and then other crops may be planted between the rows or hills, and after the early crop is taken off the later ran have all of the ground, and this is much better than al - lowing the land to be idle and occupied with weeds, as is too often the case. The Thousand-Headed kale is an excellent inter-crop, for the plants can be taken from seed-bed and planted after early crops are harvested, or between rows of sweet corn and other crops, and hardly interfere at all with the main crop. The time was when both land and labor were cheap and it was not very material whether the land was fully utilized or not, but the time has come, and the future promises to be still more insistent, that all available should be derived from the land and that it should be made as productive as possible. I do not know that the time for intensive work has fully arrived, but do believe that the waste places should be utilized and the land made as produc - tive as possible and rendered more profitable than under the lax methods of the past. The subject of Interr-lar.ting is highly recom - mended ftor consideration and trial. But lor best results light. fraqMi culture is urged as proper preparation for such plantin Mixed »ee«l» can often be bought to advantage, especially is this true of lettuce, radishes, beets and tomatoes, for » single paper of one species is often sufficient, and these mixtures enables the planter to secure many varieties at small cost. The difference in season of rail ishen, of varieties mixed, will allow a succession from a single small planting, and with much less trouble than if planting had to be done from several papers of different varieties. The same may 1&gt;h said of lettuce and tomatoes. Of course, melons and vines generally mix the first year, and in such varieties as do that mixtures should be avoided Fall garden work should not be neglected, for large weeds that may have escaped destruction earlier should be pulled up, cut and carried off, in case the seeds are mature enough to grow. All grass should be eradicated in the fall and all litter that will prevent proper cultivation should be removed. Some things, especially the things in the per - manent garden, should be cultivated in the fall, with earth thrown towards the plants. A little work in the fall in such cases saves much </seg>

Many specifications and particulars have been purposely omitted, (or the reason that most seed catalogues give directions as to depth and other information as to different varieties, and as this paper hay exceeded, no doubt, the expected limits, it is thought best to refer planters to the source of information Indicated. Again, most people take agricultural papers which give explicit directions, and so those Inter - ested are urged to seek information from those desirable sources. The main aim and object, as I apprehend, in asking for a paper is with the hope that it will stir up interest, for if the interest is once aroused. and if the benefits and necessities can be properly impressed, there will be no trouble in acquiring the needed information. Moon |&gt;haho were an important item, so far as time and interest oncerned, in my early plantings, for the reason that many people nt that time believed that success depended on the moon's phases. The theory was that those things that grew and produced fruit above ound. such as corn, beans, etc., should be planted in the light of the oon. while potatoes and other root crops should be planted in the lark of the moon. Not being able to see that such reasoning was sound. 1 concluded to try it out, and so for some years experimented. keeping records of plantings not only at the right time, but planting ■ii ihe supposed wrong time.

They are easily raised, are one of the very best it flowers, lasting many days after being cut, and so generally well behaved that they are a favorite flower. They are suitable for all purposes and the large number of beautiful varieties that one can soon collect makes them almost indispensable for the flower lover. My method of planting is to furrow rather deeply, then allow ground to stand a few days and then run wheel hoe. with pointed shovel, several times, if necessary, to secure a narrow trench at bottom of furrow This will generally fill with loose earth, which does not interfere with the planting, for the bulhs are pushed down into the earth and lightly covered: then frequent, light cultivations slowly fill the furrow, and by the time the blossoms appear the bulbs are deep enough to retain mois- ture and hold the stalks from tipping the plants over. By beginning with the larger bulbs and then setting the smaller bulbs and bulblets i the latter being set in shallower trenches and covered lightly), there is no trouble at all in raisine splendid flowers with little time or </seg>
            <seg id="p170">154 trouble. By planting some later the blooming season may be continued until fall. However, as there is quite a difference in season, a suc - cession of bloom and for most of the season may be had from a single planting. The bulbs should be dug before freezing weather endangers them, and they may be stored dry in a room free from frost, or they may be left in cellar in boxes in earth. I prefer to keep them rather dry. The many new varieties — all beautiful and some of them won - derfully beautiful, lends an enchantment, and in the vegetable garden adds a beauty and an interest that must be experienced to be fully appreciated. As the years go by this interest increases with most people, as it surely has with me. IHKCUhsion. Chairman: This subject has certainly been covered in ex - pnt shape. Are there any questions'' A Member: A large bulk of the garden seeds are grown in Cali - fornia, and I don't think they will do well with us. and I would like to know if 1 am right about that. Mr. Rude: There are not very many varieties of seeds that are grown in California that will do good with us, and we ask the dealers when we buy them whether or not they are California grown seeds or not. for we don't want them. Mr Van Houten : For instance, take onions. This is not a good country to grow onion seed, and any man who has tried it year after year knows we ran buy it cheaper than '.\e ran grow it here. If I want oabbaue seed. I would rather have it from the Puget Sound region than any other place in the world. It is raised and shipped by the car-load. It is distributed to the people of the central part of the I'nilol States ;in&lt;l elsewhere in the country. Experience has shown that certain localities are especially adapted to growing certain things Take for an illustration the tulip bulbs grown in Holland. One of the bic complaints of the war is that we cannot set the things from France and Holland and Germany that we hav.- been getting right along. Mr. Rude: I would like to take exception to the remarks in regard to cabbage seed. I want eastern seed or Holland seed, instead of Puget Sound seed.

I move now that we nominate and make him an honorary member of this society, and extend the same cour - tesies to all our visiting members Seconded. Carried. LMr Williams: In regard to the squash business. The reason I ask is the fact that we may have to sow some summer squash as a substitute for the winter squash. I notice that the good "old mother" Hubbard that we thought so much of in days gone by is disappearing. I hare given up trying to gTow it. We used to raise it in great abun - dance in southwestern Iowa, but the market is now supplied by ship- </seg>
            <seg id="p171">155 ping them in from the far north, from Michigan, Wisconsin and Min - nesota. A disease seems to have taken hold of them, named at the station as the wilt. I was just wondering if Mr. Van Houten had studied this question so as to find any remedy for that. I certainly dislike to see this squash go. It is one of the finest of our winter vegetables and is equal to the sweet potato. I think it is retailing at five cents a pound on the market lately. Mr. Rude: We, too, thought we could not raise Hubbard squash. But six years ago I had a piece of land lying by my barn where the wash came down over it and I told my son to plant Hubbard squash on it. We did not get to it until the 6th day of July. At that time he planted a half an acre, and they came up all right. A neighbor had some chickens that ran over them, but they survived the chickens, although they destroyed a few hills. Our season is probably a little longer there than here, but we had a yield of better than four tons of squash from the land and we got two cents a pound for them. Since then we have never made a failure on squash. I raised better than six tons of Hubbard squash this year. I think the average farmer, if he keeps chickens and can plant the Hubbard squash near them, can raise it all right. If you go down you will find this wilt is spread by this big stink bug. You must pick the bugs. If you see you have a hill wilting, go in and pick the bugs and pull the whole thing up and carry it out in a box and be sure not to drop any of it. I don't know whether or not the chickens have anything to do with this, but we have raised squash every year for six years. And wherever you find this worm, you will find that is the cause of the wilt. Don't go in there and pull up a hill and carry it out in your hand, because you will scatter it as you go. You must take a box. Mr. Martin: In regard to squashes, I agree with every word the gentleman from Kansas has said about squashes. You will always get a good supply of squashes where you have chickens. You are never going to make vegetable growing a success in this state unless you have a good hand sprayer, and until you learn the enemies of each plant and find their hiding places and where they work. I have grown squashes very successfully right around the chicken house. I have my chickens fenced in and I do not want them in the garden. When my chickens began to hatch they go to the fence and the squashes are all around the fence. I watch the squashes when they come up and I fight those little yellow cucumber bugs first. I have sold a half a doxen squashes this year for 12V4 cents apiece, and I still have some. I tell you it is a business, just like any other business. Plant two or three crops in Nebraska; you can do that if the season is favorable. Of course, if it is like it was in 1913, when we could not get the water, we must get along with one crop. Mr. Rude: Don't plant the squash until in June, until the ground is warm, no that they will come up quick. They are a hot weather vegetable — the middle of June would be right here. </seg>
            <seg id="p172">156 Professor Hood: The methods of spread of this blight has been found out quite recently. The government has conducted investigations in regard to it and found it is carried entirely through the striped beetle. It was supposed a few years ago it carried it from one plant to the other, but recent investigation has proven that the disease is carried in the bite of the insect. They recommend the controlling of that in - sect by various methods. However, I think the squash bug is point to give us more trouble in Nebraska than the wilt. You must not spray with anything that will kill the plant, but you must use something that will kill the insect. It was very interesting to know about the relation of the wilt to the insect. It is held in the body of the insert. I think you will find in cases where the insect has been working that it will die in five or six days, and at that time there are probably only a few of them around. The President: We have quite a full program for this afternoon and I expect we had better pass to the next subject, and I take pleasure in introducing Mr. F. P. Rude, of North Topeka, Kansas who will address you upon the subject of "Potatoes: Producing Maximum Returns." Mr. Rude: From the first letter I received from yon, Mr Sooretar&gt; . I did not understand exactly what it was that you intended me to talk upon, and although I have covered the subject to some extent in a little paper I have here, it is probably not the way you wanted me to cover it. I have prepared it based on the way potatoes are raised in the Kaw valley. But I will not stick to this paper all the way through, for it is short and incomplete. POTATOKM: PKOIHVINC; MAXIMIM KKTIKNS. By F. P. Rode, .North Topeka, kansav I will not try to tell you when and where the potato originated or when it became a staple article of food, and how the growing of the potato has become one of the leading industries in many parts- of the world. I will try to tell you how we grow potatoes in Kansas, in the Kaw valley. We prepare the land for the next year's crop by plowing our land good and deep in the fall. Land plowed in the fall will stand more wet or dry weather than spring plowed land. The action of the frost pulverizes the ground better than any machinery that ran be used. In the spring, when we prepare our land for planting, if we have had heavy rains during the winter, we disk the ground and rross - harrow it and plant without any other preparation. We change our seed potatoes ever) year, using northern grown, which must be of good size and shape and true to name and free from scab or other defects. The majority of our farmers buy in the fall and store so that when spring comes we are ready to plant. We com - mence cutting a few days before we start the planter, so that it may t&gt;» - kept going. We try to get two or three eyes to the piece and the pieces </seg>
            <seg id="p173">POTATOES: PRODIVING MAXIMUM RETURNS 157 as thick as possible. All of our potatoes are cut by hand. We use an Aspinwall planter, which does tine work, although there are other good makes of planters. We make the rows thirty-two to thirty-six inches apart and drop the potatoes from ten to sixteen inches in the row. We sometimes plant as early as March 15, and always try to finish by April 1. We plant from ten to fourteen bushels to the acre, although this depends on the size of the potatoes. With us the early planting sives the best yield. All of our seed Is cut by hand. A good many years ago some of our large planters thought they must have machines to cut the seed, but they don't do it now. Upon a medium sized potato it will do very well, but on small or large ones it doesn't cut well. We usually blind cultivate; that is, we follow the ridge left by the planter, cultivating rather deep. This is done just before the potatoes appear above the ground. We then cross-harrow and this leaves our soil loose and free from weeds and is an important part in the cultiva - tion. We begin to cultivate as soon as the rows can be seen across the field, using a two-horse, two-inch, eight-shovel spring shank cultivator. Our plan is to cultivate six times, ridging a little the last time. By these frequent cultivations we are able to keep the soil loose anil mellow to conserve the moisture. After the potatoes have set. the cultivation is never deep or close to the row. A one-horse, five-shovel cultivator is often used at this time. We begin to spray as soon as the bugs appear, using one pound of Parts green and two pounds of arsenate of lead to fifty gallons of water, 'vhich can be made stronger if necessary. It has not been found necessary thus far to spray for blight in our locality. We have not found it necessary to dip our potatoes for scab as we use good, clean seed and by crop rotation have been free from the diseases potatoes are usually subject to. The time to begin digging and marketing is when the crop will make the grower the most net profit. Even if the crop is not fulh matured, we find that it generally pays to dig and sell early. Of course this depends on the condition of the crop and the prices that can be obtained from the crop after it is fully matured, and whether the potatoes are to be sold by the wagon load on the local market, which means less expense than when the crop is sold by the car. So often when sold by the car the price is low and when the grower has paid for teams and men he has very little left. The sooner potatoes are dug and sold after maturity the more bushels there will be per acre. The shrinkage after maturity is much greater than is generally admitted. Potatoes ready to dig August 1 will shrink between 10 and 12 per cent by October 15. The rodded turning plow digger is used, as it turns everything one way and will not clog if properly adjusted. Later, when the vines are dead, if there is not too much after-growth, the elevator digger is used. Wire baskets holding a little over a half bushel are used to pick in. The potatoes are sorted as they are picked up. the small ones remaining on the ground, the others are sacked and </seg>

He then knows the condition they were rhen he bought them. Potatoes that are consigned do more to k down the prices than anything else. I believe that if all potatoes ' sold f. o. b. shipping point for cash, we would not have srlutteii kets as often as we have had in the past. Almost all the potatoes grown with us are Early Ohio*, and the yield with us is 70 to 200 bushels per acre, making an average of 1 3 ■ • bushels per acre, with an average price of 64 cents per bushel The man that makes a business of growing potatoes grows more bushels per acre and better potatoes than the man that makes a side line of potato growing. A very close estimate of what it costs to raise an acre of potatoes, with the minimum of fin divided, is as follows Rent of land, $10; twelve bushels seed potatoes. 75 cents per bushel. %'■&gt;: cutting. 75 cents; plowing and preparing land for planting. $2 "■": I iting. |t; cultivation, *4; spraying. $1; digging and marketing 0; sacks, 14.55; other overhead expenses. $1. Many of you ma&gt; k this estimate too high, but you would find out if you hired every g done that my estimate cost would be low. This makes an aver cost of 30 cents and a fraction per bushel to grow potatoe- Now is just an average price to grow potatoes. You see I have nol wed anything for interest. I nave allowed land rent and wage? to: man and his team, and, of course, when you do that that does awai l the interest. I have figured this on the basis of 13n bushels h acre. The regular growers who make a business of it raise abou to 200 bushels per acre. But most of our potatoes are grown b] fanners and they raise about 75 to 100 bushels per acre Th&lt; ion for that, of course, is that the farmers neglect them and do no ly for the bugs as they should. So I am making an average cos b for the potato grower, based upon my experience. Discussion. A Member: How far apart are your ro^vs and whsst MMtl tween the hills? I A. The regular growers plant thirty-two to thirty-six inoht!- lut farmers plant farther apart. The hills are from ten to sixteen hes apart. IQ. Don't you think it is better to have more pieces and fewer eye a piece rather than to put more eyes in a piece? A. We find we have the best returns from two or three eyes A good many cut down to one eye, but there is not much vitality in that sire piece. In dropping, a planter will vary in the distance of the hills. but even at that it will be much more accurate than you could tet a boy to do it. </seg>
            <seg id="p175">159 Q How deep do you advocate planting? A It depends upon the earllness. We try to plant four or live inches, but the deeper you plant the later your potato will be. Shallow planting will make your potatoes earlier, but yon may sacrifice your crop if the weather gets good and dry. We get very nearly a perfect crop by planting with the Asptnwall planter. Mr Sweet: We planted two fields, one of about twenty-one and the other twenty-two acres, four years ago, using the Aspinwall for one field and the Iron Age for the other, and we made enough more off from the field planted with the Iron Age to pay for the planter. Of course that is a closer planter. Professor Hood: Do you get northern grown seed potatoes every year* If so, where are those potatoes wintered over? A. We buy northern seed every year. We prefer to get them our - selves in the fall. Most of us, of course, have outside storage. I have a storage under my barn where we regulate the temperature. If the weather is warm, it is open during the night-time and closed during the day. We keep it cool and we can carry them through until spring. Q When you are covering, do you heap the dirt up? A. Yes, sir. We cultivate and then after that we cross-harrow. I think I can convince a man and show him you won't hurt the potatoes as much as you will if you harrow with the row. Where you go across, 11 will only strike now and then some of your potatoes, and if your ground is mellow and it is inclined to drag, incline your teeth just a otch or two Mr. Sweet: We always cross-harrow. Mr. Rude: That is the only way to harrow (J Do you ever treat the seed? A We have never treated the seed. We have of course a good deal of land and we can change about every two or three years. We uroir about as much cabbage as we do potatoes. We find that by fol- lowing the cabbage with the potatoes we can get a good yield. We rais* twenty to twenty-five acres a year. Q How do you handle those potatoes you dig early, when the rkfi i&gt; paying the most money for the potatoes? Q. Well, most of our crop is cleaned up by the first of September. A~ soon as the sacks are filled they eo direct into the car. If it is hot, they are not allowed to stay in the sun at all. We often let them stay in the field at night to cool. The bulk of our potatoes are hauled to the Topeka market and sold on the tracks at the station. Q Do you use a six-shovel cultivator? v An eight-shovel. When the vines get large, we sometimes take oft the outside shovel after the first two cultivations. It is a strong - toothed cultivator, with a small shovel. Q. You spoke about getting the northern grown seed, from what states do you get that? 1 From Minnesota, the Dakota*, and Wisconsin. We try and get th»" R«*'l River seed always </seg>

Clifton, of University Place, Nebraska, on the subject of "Truck Farming." TRUCK FARMING. By Li. D. Clifton, University Place, Nebraska. On account of lack of time on my part, and a lack of patience upon yours, I shall not be able to go into this subject very deeply, but will take up a few of the most important questions, believing a general dis - cussion of the same will be of more value than anything I might offer. A few of the most important phases of the questions to be consid - ered are a market for your produce, reasonable distance to same, the kind of land to be used, the importance of good seed and the labor problem. Many other questions could be profitably considered if time permitted. I am taking it for granted the truck farmer is so located that he can market at least a greater part of his produce without shipping The same rules and methods of culture and marketing in the south will not apply to the north, generally speaking. My experience is that for the last few years many of the earlier vegetables have not been in as good demand nor have prices been as remunerative, owing to better shipping facilities wherein produce from the extreme south can reach us a few days after being packed It is placed upon the market long before it can be produced here, and by that time the consumer is ready for something new and it is ready for them. Canned and package goods supplant the fresh stock oftentimes, re - eardless of price or flavor, simply because it is less work to preparf them for the table. As to soil — valley or low level land is considered best for most vegetable crops, provided it is not subject to overflow and is not under laid with hardpan or gumbo, and free from alkali. Such land if deeply plowed will usually absorb all the rain that falls upon it without injury to the growing crop. Vegetables requirine the use of the wheel hoe planted upon rolling land are very apt to be badly damaged and often - times ruined by heavy rains, owincr partly to the fact that the ground must be put in the best of condition in order to use the drill and wheel hoe. Then again the truck farmer should be able to decide what kind of land is best adapted to certain crops. This decision must usually be reached by careful observation and experience, as but few of us have </seg>

            <seg id="p178">TRUCK FARMING 161 had the opportunities for studying the soil, its nature, composition and adaptability to produce certain crops. An illustration: Last summer a young man, a stranger, came to me, stating he was going to put out ten acres of onions and wanted to know what I thought of it. I could not answer his question until I knew how he was situated, kind of ground, etc. His ground was heavy wild grass sod and just being broken up. I considered such ground unfit for his purpose until some other crop, such as potatoes, well tilled, had been grown upon the ground, giving time for the rotting of roots, otherwise cultivation would be impossible. The question of good seeds has been taken up In another paper, but too much emphasis cannot be placed upon thin subject. Great is the loss as well as the annoyance to discover when too late that the seed planted was poor, or not true to name. A fanner living near here told me a little of his experience a few days since. A number of years ago our corn crop was almost a failure, feed was scarce, and we had a lot of cattle to winter. He conceived the idea that he would raise a lot of turnips and thus help to feed his cattle through the winter. After carefully preparing the ground he came to town and ordered ten pounds of turnip seed from the local seed man. Note the result. In a few weeks he had ten acres of as beautiful yellow mustard as one could wish for. Picking up a seed catalog recently I observed the following notice: That no warrantee, expressed or implied, as to description, quality, productiveness or any other matter" was given. In other words, they reserved the right in case they did not have turnip seed to substitute yellow mustard. In closing I would say to the man thinking of taking up this line of work to consider carefully the quali - fications, mainly, plenty of backbone, or better still, none at all. It is easier to hire a man to shovel concrete upon a street with the lercury at 100 degrees or to hire a man to carry brick up six flights Main and "let the other man do the work" than to hire a man for nd of work he Chairman : If there is no discussion of this last paper, I think that completes the program of the State Horticultural Society for the winter of 1916. I think we have had one of the best programs this year I have ever listened to. Some splendid papers have been presented by experts at nearly every session of this meeting. Out of twenty-flve who were to appear on the program there were only two absent and their subjects were covered by men who were acquainted with the subjwt matter which they probably would have presented. I want to take this occasion to thank, in behalf of the society, those members from other states who were so kind to come here as delegates and appear upon our program.

Mr. Williams: Before adjourning there is one matter I would like to bring before this society in connection with my attendance at the Southwestern Iowa meeting as a delegate from this society. I have made out a report and intended to band it into the secretary, and I came to look it up and I found I have lost it and may have to write another one. I want just to say this though: That towards the close of that session Professor Greene of the Experiment Station at Ames invited that society to hold its summer meeting at Council Bluffs, par - ticularly with relation to visiting the demonstration farm, which is located there. It is an orchard of forty acres, I think, which is operated under a lease of ten years, and where they have been making demon - strations in connection with various kinds of orcharding. The society accepted that invitation and expected to hold their summer meetine there. I had the temerity to suggest that this society might like to unite with them in joining that meeting, and they very promptly f-_\ tended the invitation to us. It would be a very proper thing for this society to take action upon that at this time. I move you that we ac- cept their invitation to meet with them at that time, the date of which will be given us later. Seconded.

            <seg id="p180">MISCELLANEOUS PAPERS AND REPORTS. IHK MISSOURI RIVER FKUIT RKOIO.V By li. 8. Herruo and T. A. I.eadlej . Lincoln, Nebraska. i rops of fruit, particularly apples, can be produced on the rolling lands along the Missouri river in southeastern Nebraska and southwest- ern Iowa that rival in profitableness the fruit crops of the best fruit regions in the United States. This was demonstrated clearly to all who joined in the horticultural field days of the Nebraska Horticultural Society and the Southwestern Iowa Horticultural Society on August 2, 3 and 4. The first day was spent in the neighborhood of Council Bluffs; on the second day the party visited orchards and vineyards in the vicinity of Omaha and drove down the Nebraska side to Nebraska City; the drive of the third day was from Hamburg, Iowa, to Glenwood. by way of Shenandoah. Growing fruit in the Missouri river region is simply a matter of planting the trees, bushes and vines and taking good care of them. The soil and climate are favorable. Good care Includes thorough cul- tivation, proper pruning and scientific spraying. Some of the apple orchards we visited have in the past ten years produced an average iet income of $100 an acre annually. And what some of those hor - iculturists about Omaha and Council Bluffs are doing with small &gt;st unbelievable Overhead Irrigation Plant. The grape vineyards, truck gardens and apple orchards around ouncil Bluffs were the objects of interest visited by the fruit growers i Wednesday. The first /stop was made at the farm of P. H. Jorgen- h is used an/overhend irrigation system for the vegetable rop In this system the water is applied as nearly as possible in the form of rain. Pipes are placed a few feet off the ground and about forty feet apart and are connected to a water reservoir on a nearby hill Into which the water is pumped from a well by an engine. Small holes are bored in the pipe every four feet and through this the water is forced in the form of a spray. A handle at the end of the pipe turns the pipe for its entire length and elevates or lowers the streams of water. The cost of installing this system is about $125 an acre, Mr. Jorgensen told the visitors. Such a system is particularly advantageous on land that is too rolling to permit ditch irrigation. 163 </seg>

There we saw twenty acres under glass, the houses being arranged in tiers on the side of a steep hill. To give an idea of the size and invest - ment of such an enterprise, Mr. Wilcox said that last year's serious hail storm destroyed six car-loads of glass for ihern. Insurance com - panies will not insure greenhouses at a regular rate so the floricultur - ists have formed a mutual insurance company among themselves. Car - nations and roses and some potted plants are the principal flowers grown under glass. The market for these flowers is outside the city almost entirely. Chicago takes a large number. A Perpendicular Vineyard. On the farm of Henry Ehler we saw several acres of grapes ■NWtaf on land so hilly that "if a man stubbed his toe he would fall off the farm." as one man said. The size and thrifty appearance of the vines indicated that they didn't mind the precipitous nature of their location. Probably they have been greatly benefited by the manure which Mr Ehler has applied with wheelbarrows. The weeds are kept down b\ mowing. A profit of about |9#C is realized Pvery year froi acres. At noon the party stopped on the farm of W. G. Rich, where i picnic dinner was served by the ladies of the party in the shade ol some large trees. More than 2uo persons ate dinner and listened t&lt; the talks made by Iowa fruit growers and visitors. Later in the evening the journey was continued to the apple orchard of the Iowa Experiment Station. This orchard was leased by the Iowa station in 1910, at which time it was in nearly as bad con - dition as the average uncared for orchard. It had never been sprayed and had been pruned but a few times. By proper pruning and spraying the production of the 900 trees has been increased from nothing in 1910 to 6,000 bushels in 1915. The object of the experiment, however, is to determine the effect on production and tree growing of varying amounts of organic matter. The orchard is divided into six plots, two of which are seeded to cover crops each year, two to clover, one to bl'le-grass, and one is tilled and kept free from weeds. The cover crop plats are seeded each year to some cover crop late in July or early in August. Plowing and cultiva - tion precede the seeding of the cover crop. Sweet-clover is the clover sod crop at the present time. The blue-grass is mowed ami allowed to remain on the soil as a mulch. The orchard is leased until 1920 and by that time it is hoped some valuable results will be available from this experiment. Spraying and apple grading demonstrations were given in this orchard by men from the Iowa station. The Florence Fruit District. The forenoon of the second day was spent in the vicinity of Omaha </seg>
            <seg id="p182">MISSOl'Rl RIVER FRIIT REGION 165 Few Nebraska farmers, interested as most of them are in train and live-stock production, know the extent of the fruit industry just north of Omaha in the neighborhood of Florence An enormous amount of fruit, especially grapes, is shipped from that community every year. The growers have an organization known as the Omaha Fruit Growers' Association, which employs inspectors to see that the fruit picked is up to the standard grades, so that the label of the association will be a guarantee of quality. Among those vine-covered hills at Florence a person might readily imagine himself in France or along the Rhine. First on the schedule was the farm of J J. Smith, northwest of Florence. This farm contains thirty-one acres, twenty-five of which is in fruit. Two apple orchards, consisting of 1,500 trees, occupy the ureater part of the area devoted to fruit culture. Last year these trees yielded 4,000 bushels of first-class apples. One of the orchards s eleven years old and the other thirteen years old. The older one MM set under contract, and the nurserymen were anxious to sell trees. they put them in too thick. Half of them will have to be cut out. The tree:! are pruned low, and half of the apples can be picked from the ground. Mr. Smith thinks the heads of the trees are too dense, but they must be thinned out gradually. Canker is giving trouble. If taken the first year it is cured readily, but after it has run longer than that not more than 30 per cent of the cases can be cured, said Mr. Smith. The ground is very sloping and clean cultivation is not prac- because of the danger of washing. Clover is grown among the trees and then cut and allowed to lie. Mr. Smith is secretary of the Fruit (Growers' Association. Twelve acres of grapevines should fill a few baskets. This is the area of grapes grown on the fruit farm of George Gould. Probably it doesn't make so much money as some other Goulds make on railroads, but it is a payine proposition. Ten of the twelve acres are planted to Concord grapes and the remainder to Moore's Early. The vines are cultivated with a disk. The crop this year is not a heavy one. but the tr.inche •■ rrc veil filled. On a fifty-acre farr.i Mr. U. B. I-etovsky. treasurer of the Fruit Growers' Association, has twenty-two acres of fruit, including everything commonly grown in Nebraska. Mr. Le - tovsky was formerly a city man, but he enjoys the small farm and makes a good living from it. Last year he sold $325 worth of straw - berries from a patch of one-half acre, and his vineyard yielded 5,000 baskets of grapes. Doesn't that make your mouth water? We did not see on the whole trip any better care given to trees, bushes and vines than on this farm. Farther west, rather on the edge of the Florence fruit district, we visited the farm of H. S. Lonergan. A more desirable country place it would be difficult to imagine, surrounded as it is by stately pines. Mr. Ixmergan is a good farmer and a noted corn grower, but like most (■•mmI Moii.j in Small Frail*. </seg>

Canker is killing the trees and a good many of them every year find their way to the wood pile. Old Or, I. Hid Mail,' Over. One of the best orchards in the vicinity of Omaha is that of G. F Beavers near Ralston. This sixteen-acre orchard is twenty years old. Mr. Beavers took charge of it about five years ago and began pruning, spraying and cultivating. The first year he obtained a crop of 4,000 bushels Last year the crop amounted to 7,000 bushels. Clean cultivation is given the trees, even to hoeing the weeds under them. An objection often made to clean cultivation is that the ground washes. Most of Mr. Beavers' orchard is quite level, but at one side where the ground is sloping it is beginning to wash. This orchard con - tains a large number of varieties, including Jonathan. Winesap, Ben Davis. Grimes' Golden. Maiden Blush and Northern Spy Mr. Beavers has just set out a young orchard of twenty acres, which shows his faith in the apple business in Nebraska. It was a long jump to the next place visited, the Pollard orchards at Nehawka in Cass county. After taking lunch at the Exchange build - ing at South Omaha, the trip was made by way of Fort Crook and Plattsmouth — one of the prettiest drives in Nebraska. We all would appreciate Nebraska more if Wt Knew it belter Owteg to the dearth of automobiles a large part of the party had to forego the from Omaha to Nebraska City Many went from Omaha to Hamt Iowa, and rejoined the party there.

He aims to give clean cultivation and follow definite system of spraying. These orchards have yielded some famous crops of fruit. Mr. Pollard does not expect so large a crop this year as he harvested last year, but the quality will be much better.

            <seg id="p184">MISSOURI KIVKR FRIIT REGION 167 Two Profitable Orchards. The tirst orchard visited on the Iowa side was that of J. M. Bechtel, a railroad freight agent who turned farmer. He has an apple orchard of seventy acres in which the trees are twenty-two years old. In twelve years there has only been one complete failure in this orchard, and it has produced over 20,000 bushels of apples in a single season. It has Hwn sprayed four times this year. The crop is estimated ;-t nbout 60 per cent of the yield of 1915. Mammoth Black Twig, Jonathan, Willow Twig. Missouri Pippin and Grimes' Golden are the principal varieties in the orchard. One mile north of Hamburg we visite&lt;i the orchard of H. A. Sim - mons &amp; Son, which contains fifty-five acres. Most of the trees in this orchard are twenty to twenty-five years old, but some of them have been set forty years. This orchard has averaged about 250 bushels to the acre the last five years. For a long period of years it has shown profr. of $ 1 it&lt;&gt; ar. acre.

The orchard is equipped with heaters, but they have not been used since 1910, and Mr. Simmons thinks they have hardly paid for the cost of installation The principal varieties in this orchard are Jonathan, Ben Davis, Mammoth Black Twig, Winesap, Missouri Pippin, Gano and Grimes' Golden. Orchard Heating Paid. One of the large orchardists near Hamburg is E. ('. Menser. He left medical college in his junior year to take up orcharding, and he has been signally successful at it. One of his orchards, a twelve-acre block of Jonathan trees, was on the schedule. Mr. Menser purchased this orchard a few years ago and almost paid for it from the first crop. He has a larger and older orchard on the bluffs near Hamburg. Or- I'hard heaters were installed in the Menser orchards in 1910 and their use that year saved a large part of the crop. Because the fruit crop was small that year apples sold for a hieh price and the use of the heaters proved profitable. Southeast of Sidney we visited an orchard of sixty acres in which the trees are about twenty-five years old. It is leased by F. P. Spencer, and the place is occupied by his son, C. R. Spencer. The principal varieties in this orchard are Ben Davis and Jonathan with some Grimes' (iolden and Winesap. Winesap trees have a IM per cent crop this vear, and the Ben Davis almost no crop; the other varieties are making about half a crop. Mr. Spencer sprays only twice a year in this orchard and in his orchard near Randolph, Iowa. His ten-year lease on this orchard has run four years. At the expiration of the lease the trees will be pulled out. One season several years ago the orchard yielded 12.000 barrels. Just across the road from the leased orchard Mr. Spencer has a </seg>

This young orchard was planted to corn the flrst season, and the ground produced enough corn to pay for the trees. planting, pruning and rabbit protection and leave $100 besides. "The Biggest Little Town.' From this place the excursion headed up the valley of the Nishnu botna (what a name for a river) to Shenandoah. It was a fine valley road, but we certainly had enough hills from Hamburg to Mr. Spencer's leased orchard. Naturally the country on the Iowa side is not greatly different from the country on the Nebraska side, but strangely enough the farmers of southwestern Iowa grow almost no winter wheat, and very little small grain of any kind. It was corn, corn, corn. Why should there be so much winter wheat on the Nebraska aide of the Missouri and so little on the Iowa side? Shenandoah boosters modestly call their town "The biggest little town in Iowa," and otherwise refer to it as "The buckle on the corr belt." It was quite a drive to this biggest little place that serves useful a purpose to the corn-belt, but one very worth while making The excursionists were the luncheon t'ies!s of the Shen series, the Mt.

From Randolph to Glenwood it was the same story — corn covered hills — but the roads were perfect all the way. Just east of Glenwood we made the last stop of the day and the trip at the farm of J. W. Carter. Mr. Carter has a young apple plantation of fifty acres, in which the trees are from one to three years old. They are Duchess. Jonathan and Grimes' Golden. The Grimes' Golden trees are top worked on Delicious stock to prevent loss from collar rot when the trees become aged. The trees have made a good growth and have a healthy appearance. Mr. Carter figures that the greater part of the trees planted in that country in the 80's and 90's will soon be dead through neglect, and that this will leave a good market for apples. He is a stock and grain farmer, but is taking hold of the apple business in a way that should make it succeed. Part of his young orchard he interplanted with crapes, but that he considers a mistake. No crop is grown among the irws in the rest of the plantation, because he believes that the trees n bv cared tor more cheaply without a crop among them. At Glenwood the excursion ended and the excursionists dispersed. Most of them left on evening trains.

HKLPFIX HINTS. By J. R. Duncan. Cherry trees should have but very little pruning after planting, thinning the main limbs to four or five being sufficient. Trim all side limbs off and cut main body of peach tree back to a height of thirty inches from the ground, after setting. This gives an opportunity for the tree to thoroughly establish itself the first summer and such limbs as may be needed can be grown to form the permanent head the first summer in the orehard. Wrap the ends of the single trees with burlap or old clothing when cultivating close to trees. Don't get so close that the harness names will bruise or injure overhanging limbs. An injury to the bark leaves an opening for disease to enter and the tree has a hard enough time to grow without having to combat diseases needlessly introduced. "Preparedness" is the cry these days. The fruit, flower and vege - table grower must first practice this if they are to be successful. All tools must be overhauled and put in shape before needed. Materials for spraying and seeds, plants and vines bought in good season. Are you prepared to grow the best crops in the most economical manner possible this year? </seg>

A large number 01 plants can be set in a day and a good stand secured by this method of setting. Where ground is dry, each plant should be watered. Don't set raspberry tips too deep. More of the loss in setting rasp - berry tips is too deep covering or setting upside down of the bud from which the new cane is to come than from any other cause. Set the tip so that the bud (which can be readily found by examining the young plant) is not over two inches below the surface of the ground. Set the plant so the bud is upright and pay no attention to position of portion of old cane cut off from parent plant when tip was dug. Press the dirt firmly about the roots, but do not tramp the dirt immediately on top of the bud. Give the plant a chance to grow and it will do its part if alive when set. Immediately after planting an apple, pear or plum tree the top should be pruned back rather severely. When the tree was dug the major part of the root system was left in the ground. In order to give the tree every opportunity possible to live the top must be cut back as much in proportion as the root system. Apples should be headed from twenty-five to thirty inches from the ground when setting one year trees. Trees with heads already formed should have the leader cut back about one-third its length and side branches about one-half their length. The framework of the tree should be started at this time. leaving only three to five main limbs upon which to build the mature tree. An open spreading head is the type that will produce the highest colored fruit most economically. ANM'AI, MEETING. The annual meeting for 1916 has become a part of history. If you were in attendance you were benefited by the good things that were heard at the meetings. Each session became an experience meeting. Those growers who were doing things exchanged ideas with those who wanted more help, each giving the other ideas and pointers that would help them in their work. This year the meetings were well attended and a lot of interest was shown. Nebraska is becoming a great state in all branches of agricultural activity. Horticulture as well as other phases of agriculture is forging to the front. On the program this year were several talks that were illustrated with stereopticon and moving pictures which impressed upon those who saw and heard the talk* the great opportunities that lie all around us for making Ne- </seg>

From time to time throughout the coming year we shall print the talks and discussions so that those who were so unfortunate as not to be with us may yet the benefit of some of the good things. The show this year, as in years gone by, was held in the city audi - torium. One-half of the room was given over to the apple show and the other half was used by the Corn Improvers for the state corn show and by the Boys' and Girls' Club workers for junior shows of corn, potatoes, canning, sewing and cooking. The show this year was one of the best in recent years. The Experiment Station had an excellent hibit showing the work of the station. The apple display, while not as varied as to number of varieties as in years gone by, was a good one. Over 2,000 plates of apples and about 170 boxes of apples were on display. Nebraska can and does raise apples that cannot be surpassed by those grown in any other section. The show this year opened a tjreat many people's eyes to the wonderfu' fruit that Nebraska can pro - duce, where proper care and attention are given the orchards. The horticulturist of Nebraska need not be ashamed of trying to make Nebraska the leading fruit state. We can do it and by all working together will soon reach our goal. The annual apple show is one medium whereby each year more Nebraska consumers are made ac - quainted with the product of Nebraska orchards. Let's keep the good work going and make 1916 the best year yet in the production of horticultural crops of quality. — February Horticulture.

These days, when the snow is melting so rapidly, makes one think that spring is near or at least we hope so. Are we ready for the spring work to begin? Are all the tools in first-class shape? Have you all your trees pruned and the brush and trash removed from the orchard There is still time enough before spring opens, but it is getting short Last year thousands of bushels of apples were put on the market which were a disgrace to the grower and to the community from which they were shipped. Other thousands were allowed to rot on the ground because no disposition could be made of them. First-class fruit did not go begging for a market but sold a* good prices. Why? If you were to go to the grocery store and the grocerynian would show you a bushel basket of apples that had spotted ones, wormy ones, little ones, large ones, scabby ones and clean apples all together, some well colored and some with no color at all and then showed you a basket of apples that were all the same size or nearly so, uniformly colored, free from insect or fungous injury, t-ach apple being in perfect condition, -.vhich would you prefer to buy? Even if the price was one-third to onp-half more per bushel for the good apples you would consider them the cheapest apples. Why not have all the apples placed upon the market like the latter basket. If every grower would prune, spray and care for his orchard as it should be the crop produced would be of the best grade and instead of feeding the crop to his hogs or letting it rot on the ground, a good price could be secured that would pay good interest on time and money invested. Nebraska has a reputation lor producing high quality fruit when properly grown. The trouble is that all the growers do not do their part to see that all the fruit is well grown. Some growers the past season gave their orchard the best of care and even though it was a season of excessive moisture they were able to harvest a crop of clean high-class fruit. If a few can do it, all can do it. Now is the time to commence (if not already commenced) to prune the trees so that they may be easily sprayed and the sunlight can </seg>

The horticulturists of Iowa and Nebraska had an enjoyable outing on the 2d, 3d and 4th Of August, When the leading orchards and vine - yards and gardens from Omaha and Council Bluffs south to Nebraska City and Hamburg were visited. The trip was based on what was originally an invitation made by the Southwestern Iowa Horticultural Society to the Nebraska State Horticultural Society to meet with them at the Iowa Experiment Station orchard located near Council Bluft&gt;. and was worked over into a three-day trip on both .sides of the river. That this movement may be broadened and built up until all four suite* bordering on the Missouri river fruit belt may participate is the wish Of those interested in arranging for the trip just completed. Hurriedly arranged, there were many things noted wherein any trips in the future may be made of greater value from an educational a* well as a publicity point of view. Without any question the territory embraced on both sides of the Missouri river can produce fruit that for flavor, color and size cannot be excelled by that grown in any section. The growers in this section should become better acquainted with each other's methods and work together so that the whole region would be placing on the markets of the world uniform grades of fruit, even though packed by different groups of growers, so that the excellence of the fruit grown might be more fully appreciated by the consuming public. The trip was carried out as per program with but few minor changes and omissions. The first day the visitors were introduced to the way the market gardeners grow the vegetable supplies for Council Bluffs; how the fruit growers by hard work and a "stick-to-itiveness" were able to take rough land that was not considered fit for anything except pasture land and make it over into fruit farms that annually </seg>

The noon hour as well as moat of the afternoon of the second was spent as guests of the Council Bluffs Grape Growers' Association at their annual picnic held on the farm of W. G. Rich. The ladies of the association served luncheon, which showed that Council Bluffs fruit growers while making a success of the fruit business had wives and sisters and daughters that were past masters of the culinary art. A short program was given in the afternoon, with talks by Profes - sors Maney, Beach, Greene, of Ames; Professor Cooper of Lincoln, and others. An orchestra rendered several musical selections. After the program the Experiment Station orchard was visited, where demonstra - tions in spraying, packing, etc., were given. On Thursday orchards and vineyards of some of the fruit grower* around Omaha and south to Nebraska City were visited, where the party spent the night. The following day the route led to Hamburg, through Riverton and Farragut to Shenandoah, where a banquet was served the visitors by the nurseries and seed house located there. After a trip through these nurseries the party journeyed north and to Randolph and Glenwood, visiting orchards en route. The ps along the entire journey were excellent and timely rains previously to the trip had placed the roads in excellent condition, set - tling the dust. The orchards visited showed that they were receiving good care and had good crops- of fruit. The average farm orchard noted along the way was in poor condition, and no fruit of any con - sequence to be seen. Fruit growing to be successful must be given the very best attention that the grower can give, and advantage of the best methods must be taken in order to make it a success The trip well repaid those who participated and was an eye-opener to some as the possibilities that are to be found in the great Missouri valley district STATE FAIR FRUIT KXHIH1T. By C. G. Marshall. Arlington, Nebraska. The fruit exhibits at the Nebraska state fair were up to the high standard maintained by the fruit interests of the state. Nebraska state fair fruit exhibits are recognized as the best staged at any fair in the central west. This high standard is gained of course, first, by class of fruit produced in the state, and, second, by the organization in charge of the collecting and placing of the exhibits. These exhibits are handled differently from any others shown at the annual state fairs. For all other classes of exhibits the state fair board offers and pays the premiums directly from its own treasury, while the premiums offered on fruit are given by the State Horticul - tural Society, which is In full charge of the fruit and floral shows.

Nearly 5,000 plates of fruit were shown this year, apples being the principal kind. Some of the county exhibits Included almost 100 varieties. The show was made up principally of varieties that ripened previous to the opening of the fair. The late-maturing varieties, of course, were shown in the single-plate class The outstanding feature of this year's show was the large exhibits of grapes and pears. These two fruits are growing in favor in Ne braska both for home and commercial purposes. The commercial planting of grapes has been increasing rapidly in the Missouri river hills section. These loess hills produce grapes equal in quality to any grown in the United States. The Omaha Fruit Growers' Association ships fifty to 100 cars each year to all markets in the central west and always receives the highest market prices for its product. The varie- ties are principally Moore's Early and Concord. Pears are grown commercially only in a limited way in southeastern Nebraska Planting; for home use is succeeding better each year planters learn how to handle their tress. C. H. Barnard of Pawne&lt; county was one of the largest exhinitor* of pears. Mr. Barnard siderable more than 100 plates of pears on exhibit He recomnif the Lincoln pear as one of the best for home use Apple* the Favorite Fruit. With the commercial fruit growers apples still hold the lead grow - ers exhibiting at the fair were more enthusiastic than ever over eastern Nebraska's merits. Marshall Bros, of Arlington, who were large ex - hibitors of apples, report their sixth consecutive crop of apples now maturing. Their fifty-acre orchard has netted them $17,500 in the past five years. This Is a return of $70 an acre per year. G. S. Christy of Nemhaha county told of two apple trees that gave a return of $8 4 in 1914. One acre of such trees would return $1,680. G. N. Titus of Nemahu county exhibited ten standar pies packed in bushel apple boxes. This display attracted considerable attention and was declared by many to be equal in appearance to the best of western boxed apples. Everyone knows the superiority of the flavor and quality of Nebraska apples.

HiUllH I III i;AI PKOKI.KMS Or' THE EXTENSION WOKKKK. li.v It. S. Hfrrirk. Extension Horticulturist. Ames, hi. Fruit growing with the average farmer in Iowa has been as a rule a neglected side line. Oftentimes the farmer gives as his reason for this that experience has taught him that fruit growing does not pay. However, as a rule this decision has been reached from the experience that he has had with three factors in regard to the harvesting of the m Amount of fruit at picking time. 1. Quality of fruit at picking time. Price received at picking time. It is absurd, but nevertheless true, that the average home orchard in Iowa has no place in the general routine work on the farm, except at picking time and oftentimes not then for the reason there is nothing to pick. In other words, orchard management, such as pruning, spray - ing and tillage, is seldom thought of. For these reasons the profits obtained are small. The extension worker along pomological lines has this attitude of indifference of the average farmer to contend with in regard to fruit growing. On account of this attitude it has been hard to get as good results along this line of work as has been obtained along other lines the Extension Department If fruit growing in Iowa could not be made profitable we would not have scores of orchaniists in the state making profits of from $50 to $100 per acre net every year as many of them have done. These orchardists in Iowa who are making money in the fruit business are those who are paying strict attention to the orchard management end f the business a.s well as to that of marketing. In other words, in rder to find a suitable market for orchard products it is first neoes- rv to have them well grown. In the Extension Department we are following that kind of a pro - gram. We believe that seeing is believing, so we carry on a great deal of our work by the use of demonstrations which are carried on as follows: Spring pruning and spraying demonstrations. Last year a total of 115 of these demonstrations were carried on in the state in as many localities. This work is done out In the orchard where one or </seg>
            <seg id="p198">180 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY two trees are pruned and sprayed. A total of 5,099 people attended, or an average of 40 people per demonstration. This year (1915) there were held ten summer spraying demon - strations in ten different counties in the state. A total of 1,130 apple trees were sprayed from three to four times. The average age for these trees was 15 years. The cost per tree for spraying three times with lime-sulphur and lead arsenate was as follows: Material, 8.4 cents; labor, 15.7 cents; depreciation, 1.56 cents; total, 25 2-3 cents per tree. An average total of 14 gallons of spray solution was used on each tree. Thirty-four trees sprayed three times produced on the average 7.71 bushels per tree, while thirty-four trees not sprayed pro - duced on the average of 5.05 bushels per tree, or a difference of 2 2-3 bushels per tree in favor of spraying. Besides this 75 per cent of the fruit from the trees sprayed three times was clean, while there was only 6 2-5 per cent clean fruit from the unsprayed trees. At picking time in two different orchards the apples from the sprayed trees were selling at 75 cents per bushel, while the owners were having a hard time to Ret 25 rents a bushel for the unsprayed apples. At this rate the fruit on the sprayed trees was worth $5.78, or $5.52 per tree after cost of spraying was deducted, and on the unsprayed trees only $1.26 pel tree. This gave a total net gain of $4.26 per sprayed tree over the ur sprayed. Some deuionstrational planting work by the use of dynamite has been done, also variety lists and plans have been made for planting new orchards. Three years ago the college clearing house was established for the purpose of placing the Iowa apple grower in touch with buyers. This year (1915) there were a total of 118 apple growers listed represent - ing a total of 159,484 bushels of apples for sale and a total of 103 apple buyers listed. We have no way of knowing how many bushels of apples were sold each year by means of the clearing house. One result of the clearing house was to place the grower in a posi tion to know the fruit conditions of the country. Several apple packing demonstrations have been carried on where an interest was shown in this kind of work. Numerous lectures and demonstrations have been given at short courses, institutes and farmers' meetings on orchard management. Fellow members of the State Horticultural Society, it will pay to advertise the fact that fruit growing pays in Iowa where properly done, and that it will not pay most years if the orchard is left to the mercy of its natural enemies. So let us all boost for clean apples, let us all preach the gospel for spraying and pruning, wherever we see the need. Let us keep our own orchards in the best possible condition, thereby - making them examples for our respective localities.— (Address de - livered before the annual meeting of Iowa State Horticultural Society. December 7. 8 and 9, 1915.) </seg>

The horticultural short course was held at Brownville, January 12, 13 and 14. The series of talks and demonstrations were given by R. F. Howard of the Department of Horticulture, University of Nebraska and Mr. E. H. Hoppert, extension specialist In horticulture. Despite the fact that these meetings were held in the midst of the worst blizzard of the winter, there were from twenty to thirty growers present at each session. Lectures were given, illustrative material, such as charts showing the chief insect and fungous pests, were used. Proper methods ami improper methods of making Bordeaux mixture were given. Pruning demonstrations were held In apple orchards and vine- yards The fruit growers of Brownville are well aware of the fact that they are located in a section especially adapted for growing fruit — particularly apples, grapes, strawberries and cane fruits. They do not need to be told of this. Most of the growers in this section, however, are beginning to realize that they have many serious problems to face and solve if their section is to build the reputation for itself that it deserves Methods of growing and marketing the fruit are the chief problems. The past season was a test one in so far as producing the crop was concerned. We cannot expect to often have a season so favorable for the development of fruit diseases. As a result of this, some growers are prone to overemphasize the importance of the mar - keting end of fruit growing. The writer is of the opinion that a proper and profitable disposition of the crop will follow naturally and largely adjust itself if the growers in this section will produce the kind of fruit that they are capable or growing. Nothing less than consistent pruning, cultivation i in most of the orchards! and proper spraying will do this The Department of Horticulture of the University is making an effort to meet the new problems as they arise in growing clean fruit. It has a general agreement with the growers at Brownville whereby it pro - poses to keep them in touch with its results of experimentation, its tests with new spray materials, etc. It proposes to do this by having general supervision of an orchard at Brownville. The extension spe - cialist will help prune the orchard and mix and help apply all spray materials. This will give the department an opportunity to keep in closer touch with the growers and study the problems at first hand. It is not supposed that the above method will revolutionize the fruit growing industry in one season, but it is hoped that closer association between the growers and their experiment station will result in helping to place eastern Nebraska where it properly belongs as a fruit growing section </seg>

Since weather conditions have delayed spraying operations tins spring, farmers will find it necessary to hasten this work durinc the rest of the spraying period if they are to protect their trees and shrubs from scale, plant lice and other insects which cause great injury. N E. Shaw, state nursery and orchard inspector, reports San Jose seal*- in every county in the state and says it is more generally distributed in cities and villages than in hraill districts. The life of a fruit tree depends on the control of this insect. Lime - sulphur solution diluted with seven parts of water, or a good soluble oil diluted with fifteen parts of water, is effectively used during March or April before the leaves are expanded. The spray may be applied with a power machine or a hand sprayer. The Ohio Experiment Station entomologists state that practically 0 0 per cent of all the good from spraying comes from that done during March, April and May. This period includes the dormant sprayings and those immediately before and after the blossoms appear.

            <seg id="p201">PRODUCING THE APPLE CROP 183 MM not expect to bring a lot of new information concerning apple production but rather add a little inspiration to the knowledge that the Kansas apple growers possess to assist in carrying out more effectively the thiugs we really know how to do. In order to deal systematically with the problems of producing a rop of good apples, the subject naturally divides itself into thre« neral headings or considerations, consistent with actual practice of e orchard management: First, pruning: second, cultivation; third. n As the writer understands the limitations of the subject, it is the mention of your secretary that this discussion should be confined to he bearing orchard, which in eastern Nebraska we would consider to be an orchard from eight to ten years old and upward. Of course, growing the apple tree is a problem for the nurserymen, but growing the young orchard up to bearing time is a problem for the orchardiat. The care which the young orchard receives is directly related to the producing power of the trees when they come into bearing. The writer's experience in producing different apple crops has been largely with old neglected orchards which were unprofitable to the owner and not very inviting to the grower, who is inspired with an ambition to give the apple tree a fair chance to show what it can do. Our first problem has been pruning these orchards. It is difficult to describe in words just how an apple tree should be pruned. We rarely \&gt;-r find two trees that can be pruned exactly alike. The grower sually allows the apple trees to carry too much superfluous wood. The food supply and energy of the tree is used up in worthless wood growth and acts as a hindrance to the proper development of the pple crop The general directions for pruning the average bearing apple tree* are Thin out the top, leaving a well balanced head if possible. It is important that the air circulates freely through the tops of the trees. Wt must also figure on free access of sunlight through the head of the when the foliage is heaviest. Varieties which have a tendency to grow too tall, producing rather weak, slender limbs and branches, like Missouri Pippin and Iowa Blush, should he headed back and not allowed to develop in their natural man - ner. The heading back practice will produce shorter, thicker growth. It facilitates spraying and makes it much easier to pick the fruit from the tree. Some varieties, like Grimes' Golden, Rome Beauty and Delicious, have a habit of bearing their fruit well distributed through - out the head of the tree. These varieties may be pruned with some - what thicker head than would be advisable in pruning Winesap, Jona - than or trees of a Ben Davis type. In handling the average neglected orchard in eastern Nebraska those growers who intend to give their orchard cultivation usually head the trees higher to enable better use of the orchard disk. Growers who intend to keep their orchards seeded to red clover often encourage the </seg>
            <seg id="p202">184 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SQCIETY growth of limbs closer to the ground. Most varieties of apples should be pruned so that the fruit is borne on the outer part of the head of the tree where the fruit is exposed to the sunlight and free circulation of air. It is easier to spray an apple tree trimmed in this manner, espe - cially when the foliage becomes dense. Tt is much easier to pick apples from such trees. Disposing of the brush after the pruning is done is no small job. In our own orchards we have usually cut out the larger limbs which were sawed into stove-wood. The fine brush was usually ricked in windrows and dragged out by means of a brush drag. Cost ot Pruning. It is difficult to figure the cost of pruning before the job is com - pleted. We have handled some orchards which cost us as much as {30 per acre to prune and paint the wounds, cut out and pile the wood, drag out and burn the brush. We have handled other orchards where the trees were younger, from nine to twelve years old, where all of the work connected with pruning and cleaning the orchard was done for $5 per acre. Value of Pruning. There is another phase of pruning in which we are perhap.- most interested, thai ix. the value of proper pruning measured in the fruit crop which results. The real value of pruning an apple is a phase of producing the apple crop in which we have tried to keep some records for our own benefit. This factor is also variable with the age and size of the trees. It is also affected by the vitality of the trees and is especially noticeable in working with a large number of varieties. Taking for example a fifteen-year-old orchard of mostly Winesap varieties, we estimate the value of pruning alone to net the grower from one to lour dollars per tVM. We have never noted ■ sjnpi&gt; - instance of loss, either iu amount of fruit produced or size and quality of the fruit, which could be justly charged against pruning where the job was properly done. Invariably proper pruning will pay for itself in the first season's crop. Time to Prune. The question is always asked at gatherings of fruit men, what is the best time of the year to prune an apple tree? Most experts on the care and culture of apple trees regard pruning in the month of June as most beneficial.

A well pruned tree will have a tendency to develop stronger fruit spurs and buds, because the strength of the tree is not used up in the growth of superfluous wood. Proper pruning also enables more thorough cultivation of the orchard, and last, but not least, a well groomed orchard appeals to the pride of the grower and adds inspiration and inclination on his part, which is so essential in giving a business dignity to the apple grower and to his method of producing apples. Cultivation. That most successful growers in eastern Nebraska are agreed that the bearing orchard, from the age of ten years and upward, should either be cultivated or seeded to red clover. An ideal system would be a combination which would allow the grower to keep the orchard seeded to red clover two or three seasons in succession, which would be followed by one or two seasons of thorough cultivation. Should the season be extremely wet, the first crop of clover may be removed as l hay crop. The second cutting should always be mowed and left on he ground as a mulch. In orchards where land lays fairly level, thorough cultivation can be followed for a longer period of years than would be advisable to practice on rolling ground. Keii clover is an ideal crop to be needed in the bearing orchard. It .nuts soil from washing, adds nitrogen to the surface soil, which the roots of the trees and used as plant food. Red clover m the trees anil increases the size of the fruit, but as a rule proper colorinn It has been clearly proven by extensive experiments carried on in different states of the Union that apples from a cultivated orchard would keep longer in cold storage than the same variety of fruit grown in an orchard that was seeded down with a grass or clover crop. M advantages of cultivation may be summed up as follows: Conserves soil moisture. :. Incorporates vegetation with the surface soil and thereby render - nore plant food available for the use of the tree. 3. Assists materially in destroying the harbor for harmful insects and diseases which are usually found in the affected leaves and trash which accumulates beneath trees. In eastern Nebraska, cultivation cannot be said to have any great advantage over some seeded crop so far as destroying weeds is con- cerned.

By double disking at right angles early in the spring and following this cultivation two weeks later, disking in the same manner so that the orchard is disked and cross-disked, we have been able to destroy a heavy blue-grass sod and work the soil into a tilth like that of a garden. We always start cultivation in orchards where it is advisable to use this method of orchard culture early in the spring, chiefly to conserve a supply of moisture. In case the season should be dry. we find that it is easy to handle the soil in cultivations which occur later during the growing season.

Apple blotch spores are beginning to be liberated about this time and in order to prevent infection the fruit should be covered with fungicide. Bordeaux mixture is more effective than lime - sulphur in combating this disease and where the infection is severe it should be used. Three pounds of bluestone and four pounds of lime to 50 gallons of water, with the usual amount of arsenate of lead, is a good formula. It is sometimes necessary to make another application of Bordeaux ten to fourteen days later to insure control. Ordinarily, in cases of light infection, one application will suffice, and in orchards where systematic and thorough spraying has been practiced it will not be necessary to use Bordeaux. The spray for the second brood of codling n&gt;oth should be applied when the moth first appears on the wing. This varies with the season. Sometimes it is as early as July first, and perhaps the next year it will be August first. In the latter case a spray applied July first would be of little value. When the moths appear as early as the first of July it will be necessary to spray at that time and again about the time winter varieties of apples begin to ripen, to prevent punctures being made by the third brood larvae entering the fruit. These latter sprays may consist of arsenate of lead alone if the season is dry and the scab has been kept under control by regular spraying during previous years; otherwise lime-sulphur should be added to control the fall infection. To determine the date of the appearance of the second brood of codling moth, band a number of trees during the month of June, pref - erably unsprayed ones, with strips of burlap from four to six inches wide. Leave the bands loose at the bottom. Examine for codling moth cocoons during July. Remove any cocoons found, by cutting out a small piece of the cloth to which it is fastened. Place the cocoons in a glass cylinder open at the top and bottom la lantern globe will dot and cover the top with a fine screen to prevent the escape of the moths. This cage should be set on soil which should be kept slightly moist and should be protected from rain and sun. As soon as the majority of the moths have emerged, the second brood spray should be applied. The moths deposit eggs as soon as they appear, and the young worms hatch in from five to ten days. The most economical sprayer is one which delivers the mixture in such a way as to cover the trees thoroughly in the least possible time. Spraying may be done effectively by using a hand sprayer of one quart capacity, but the time required for a thorough application is too great if much spraying is to be done. The things to be considered in buying a spraying outfit are: Size of the orchard to be sprayed; power of the outfit; capacity and durability of the pump. Gasoline power outfits are now made in many sizes. They are usually designated by the number of nozzles which the capacity of the pump will supply. A two-nozzle (mist) outfit will usually deliver </seg>
            <seg id="p209">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 190 three to four gallons a minute. The capacity of the machines raune from this up to the six-nozzle types which deliver from ten to twelve gallons a minute. These machines cost from $125 to $350, depending on the capacity. Hand-power sprayers are cheapest and most practical for orchards of less than 300 trees, unless labor is scarce. Such pumps cost $10 to $45. The size of the pump to purchase is determined largely by the time required to make the petal-fall application, since the time available for making this application is limited. -From Independent Farmer.

In order to protect the white-pine forests of the country from the disease known as the white-pine blister rust it is proposed to place a Federal quarantine on shipments of five-leaved pines and cultivated black currants from several eastern states. A public hearing on this question was called recently by the Federal Horticultural Board The states which it is proposed to quarantine on this account are New Hampshire. Vermont, Massachusetts. Connecticut. New York ana Pennsylvania.

The disease, it is said, can be controlled in the eastern states, where it now exists, but if it finds its way into the western forests there is no likelihood that its spread can be successfuly checked. At the present time these forests are free from blister rust, and it can only be introduced into them through nursery stock of flve-leave&lt;! pines or currants. A quarantine against the relati\ely limited traffic in this stock is, therefore, believed to be a necessary precaution. As an additional safeguard it also is proposed to prohibit the entrj of five-leaved pine nursery stock from Canada and of nursery stock of currants and gooseberries from Canada, Europe and Asia. The importance of protecting the white-pine forests from the blister rust may be inferred from the fact that in New England. New York and Pennsylvania alone there are still fifteen billion feet of ma ture white pine, valued at not less than $75,000,000, and in the Lake states twelve billion feet, valued at £96,000,000. Of these. twent&gt; billion feet are in private holdings and ten billion feet in national forests. The value of the mature sugar pine is placed in the neighbor - hood of $150,000,000, the greater part of which is in private hands In addition to its effect upon this standing timber, the spread of the disease would seriously interfere with the plantinp of troes.

It is estimated that in New England, New York and Pennsylvania there are not less than ten million acres to which this is applicable, and that in the Lake states there are another ten million. The proposed quarantine will not only be an additional protection to the ureat western forests, which are naturally isolated from the east by treeless plains, but it will protect as well those portions of the eastern states which now lie outside the infected area.

THK ItosK ( H.VKKi;. The rose-chafer, or "rose bug"' as it is often called, one of the most widel) distributed and troublesome insects with which the florist or pu-dener has to contend, is the subject of a new Farmers' Bulletin (No. 721i of the department, by F. H. Chittenden and A. L. Quaint ance. The insects appear as long-legged beetles of a yellowish-brown color, usually in the month of June. They strip all kinds of vegetables, traits, and flowers of blossoms and foliage, and where especially plen - tiful do great damage. In from four to six weeks after their first appearance they leave as suddenly as they came. Rosebushes and grapevines especially suffer from attacks of the insects, but the beetles are almost equally destructive to fruit, shade, and other trees and shrubs. When the rose-chafers are especially numerous, they attack even berries, peas, beans, and nearly all garden fruits and vegetables. In their attacks upon the grape, they first devour the blossoms; then they strip the leaves, leaving only a thin network, and later the young crapes are eaten. Whole vineyards and orchards often are devastated and whole crops in certain sections of the country are destroyed. Besides the damage done to vegetation, the beetles sometimes cause the death of young chickens. The chickens eat the beetles and poisoning results in the death of the chicken within twenty-four hours. Experiments have developed the fact that from fifteen to twenty beetles are sufficient to kill a week-old chick. The character of the soil bears an important relation to the appear - ance of the rose-chafer. Light sandy regions are greatly preferred as a breeding ground, while clay lands, unless near sandy soil, are seldom troubled. Methods of Control.

Any application that may be made is unsuccessful unless ap - plied almost continuously, for as often as the beetles on a plant are killed, others arise from the ground or from neighboring fields to take their place. Many so-called "sure" remedies. Including compounds of copper, lime, kerosene, and tobacco, have failed to give results when put to a rigid test. Whatever practice of a remedial nature is under taken, whether collecting or spraying, it should be begun at the first onset of the insects' attack and continues until they disappear. The work should not be confined entirely to those useful plants which it is particularly desired to preserve, as the insects attack many other plants.

With the first warm days of spring the larvae escape from the egg-shells in which they have lain dormant during the winter. Trees infested with larvae during the early part of the year, or those in the immediate vicinity, are perhaps more likely to be chosen by the parent moth tor the deposition of her eggs, and such trees at least should be searched The recommendations of the department's entomologists for the control of this pest are, briefly, as follows: As soon as small nests are detected they should be destroyed, as this prevents further defoliation of the tree. When in convenient reach the nests may be torn out with a brush, with gloved hand, or otherwise, and the larvae crushed on the ground, care being taken to ilestroy any caterpillars which have remained on the tree. The use of a torch to burn out the nests will be found convenient when they occur in the higher parts of the trees. In using the torch great care is necessary so that no important injury be done to the tree; it should not be used in burning out nests except in smaller branches and twiKs. the killing of which would be of no special importance. Nests in the larger limbs should be destroyed by hand, as the use of the torch may kill the bark, resulting in permanent injury. Tent caterpillars are readily destroyed by arsenicals sprayed on the foliage of trees infested by them. Any of the arsenical insecticides is Paris green, Scheele's green, arsenate of lead, etc. may The first two are used at the rate of one-half pound to fifty gallons of water The milk of lime made from two to three pounds of stone lime should he added to neutralize any caustic effect of the arsenical on the I'oliaue. The paste form of arsenate of lead is used at the rate of two pounds to each fifty gallons of water, and the powdered form at one-half this quantity tone fruits, such as cherry, peach, and plum, arsenicals are likely to cause injury to foliage and must be used with caution, if at h trees the arsenate of lead is preferable, as it is less in- all jurious to foliage, and on all trees sticks much better. In spraying for the tent caterpillar only, applications should be made while the cater- pillars are yet small, as they then succumb more quickly to poisons han when more nearly full grown, and prompt treatment stops further defoliation of the trees. — C.

At such times it is necessary to treat them the same as army worms While the methods which have been advised are valuable iu such cases, they may be too slow to destroy all the cutworms, and other methods must be employed. These include trenching, ditching, the plowing of deep furrows in advance of the traveling cutworms to trap them, and the dragging of logs or brush through the furrows. If the trenches can be filled with water, the addition of a small quantity of kerosene, so as to form a thin scum on the surface, will prove fatal to the cut worms.

The apple is adapted, perhaps, more than any other fruit to a great variety of uses in the household. Fully four-fifths of the ripe fruit is water and one-fifth solid ma - terial. About 15 per cent of the apple consists of nutritive materials. There are very small quantities of protein and fat, both not exceeding 1 per cent, while more than 14 per cent of the ripe fruit consists of car - bohydrates in the form of sugar. The food value of the apple, therefore, depends almost entirely upun this sugar. The flavor of the apple Is determined by the quantities of sugar contained therein as well as by certain ethereal oils, and by substance which is common to most fruits. known as tannin. The quantity of tannin in the apple is so small it produces no ill effects whatever. On thn contrary, physicians and hygienists are agreed that the apple is a very beneficial food to eat. in that it promotes a very vigorous digestion. There are several points to be remembered, however, in regard to the healthfulness of apples. The fruit may prove injurious when eaten in either the unripe or overripe condition.

That, at the present, the war in Europe will intensify the need for conserving our waste food products, as well as those ordinarily finding their way to the consumer's table, will be admitted. We have various industries engaged in transforming waste food products into palatable and nourishing foods, but there are entirely too few of them, in the first place; and, secondly, there is not the proper effort on the part of the producer to put this secondary or waste product of the farm in a somewhat marketable condition. it never increases the value of a secondary product to handle it la areless or indifferent manner. -operative marketing associations are necessary, but one of the purposes of such organizations should be to provide for the roper disposition of what are now considered waste products The national department of agriculture, as well as those of the siatts. with the agricultural colleges and experiment stations, should make the conservation and utilization of the waste products of the farm tter of special .study hr county farm apent and the Tanners 1 institute would be great itors along this line.

I found enough corn fodder unhoused during the month of January to feed all the live stock of the district for sixty days. This fodder had been left standing in shocks in the fields, exposed to all kinds of weather, until it was unfit for feed. Much of it was fed until an epidemic of cerebro-spinal meningitis caused the death of a. large number of the county's most valuable horses. Spinal meningitis in horses is directly traceable to a mould, or mildew fungus, which develops oti damaged or improperly cured coarse feeds, as hay and fodder. Farmers should be encouraged to study this subject more earnegtlj. An expanding market will make use of these secondary products if they are properly cared for. The farmer will soon find them an added asset to his farm which he has long neglected.

The same applies to all the cereals and vegetables known. Apples not wanted at elder mills, canneries or evaporating plants can be fed to stock. Cabbage and turnips will .save feed bills if fed properly. Some of the hardier vegetables can be kept in cellars or buried, and in this way will keep for a long period, and thus lengthen out tbe feeding season, and will add just that much to the food supply of the stock on the farm. Before the days of cold storage, fruit and vegetables were kept in pits in many cases an entire winter. Of late years there has not been so much of that. It is rather unfortunate that it has, in a sense, passed away, because there is a greater waste than when it was a general farm practice. Farmers should use every means known by which waste products can be utilized. It is just as easy to save a secondary product as it is to save a high-class product. Of course, this does not apply to products where decay has already taken place. Conserving 'hese products is not a complex problem. No superior intelligence is required to save and to put to proper use every item produced on the farm. The extravagance of the Ameri - can people has probably been the chief cause of this woeful waste.

Most varieties of apples commonly available possess the requisite amount of susrar when ripe, but not when green.

Iu many cases it k tbe practice to add water to the apple pomace after pressing, let it stand a while, and press again. This treatment yields an additional amount of juice, which, however, does not contain the requisite amount of sugar to make a good vinegar, provided the first pressing has been efficient. Avoid the use of juice made from a second pressing. "When practicable, it is a good plan to store the freshly pressed apple juice in some large receptacle, and allow it to stand a few days before putting it into barrels. In this way considerable solid matter held in suspension will settle before the liquid is placed in casks. The casks used should be well cleaned, thoroughly treated with live steam or boiling water, and they should not be over two-thirds or three - f»mrths filled with apple juice. The bung should be left out, but a loose plug of cotton may be placed in the hole to decrease evaporation and prerent dirt from falling in. The bung should be left out until 4.5 to 5 per cent of acetic acid has formed. "When the freshly pressed apple juice is at once placed in ordinary cellars, where the temperature during winter does not go below 43 to M degrees Fahrenheit, the alcoholic fermentation is complete in about six months, assuming that the work is begun in October or November, though 80 to 90 per cent of the alcohol is formed in half this time or By having the fermentation take place at a temperature of 65 to 7 0 degrees, the time can be considerably reduced; however, it ia not lesirable to have the alcoholic fermentation take place at much above 70 degrees, since the loss of alcohol by evaporation is increased. By - addition of yeast to the fresh apple juice, the fermentation can be com - pleted in three months or less, especially if the temperature is near to 55 to 70 degrees. It is suggested that one cake of compressed yeast, jr its equivalent, may be used for nve gallons of apple juice, if one esires to use yeast. The yeast cake is stirred with a cup of water, and fter complete disintegration is mixed with the juice. Whatever form f yeast is used, it should be fresh.

The acetic fermentation occupies from three to eighteen months or more, accord - ing to the conditions under which the fermentation is carried on. When the apple juice is stored in a cool cellar and left there until it becomes vinegar or legal standard, it requires from twenty-one to twenty-four months, or even more. When the alcohol fermentation is allowed to take place in a cool cellar, and the casks are then removed to a warmer place, the time of vinegar formation may be reduced from that given above to fifteen to eighteen months.

The "cold pack" methods of canning does not mean that the can - ning is done without heat, but simply means that the final sterilization is done after the jar or can has been completely filled, the rubber anil cap put in place or the tin can completely sealed. When using glass jars always utilize the jars yon ha\e on hand, but when you buy new jars, buy the best. They are the cheapest in the long run. No glass jar with metal or rubber in direct contact with the food product is desirable unless the cap is enameled, lacquered or vulcanized. Glass jars should be thoroughly cleaned and should be taken directly from hot water to be filled. Canned products in glass jars if exposed to light will bleach, fade and sometimes deteriorate in food value: hence the necessity of wrap - ping in paper. (Portions of bulletins written by Mr. O. H.

Pick up any catalogue of the better class of nurserymen and aeeda - men who grow and handle perennial plants and you will find under varying terms practically this representation of the perennial phlox: "Of the many perennial plants for the home planting and summer decorations none are of more importance than the hardy phloxes. They are not particular as to soils and are very hardy. Flowering as they do through a long season of continuous bloom, which may be greatly prolonged by judicious clipping of the flower stems, and em - bracing a wide range of colors, and growing as they do for many years th little attention, make them exceedingly satisfactory." I do not think the ordinary flower lover and grower has any ade - luate conception of the possibilities in beautifying the home grounds with this plant, as I see it but rarely at the farm house or the town lots, and if at all, usually a clump or two of one color, or at beat of two or three. The flower lover who has not tried phlox is missing something for his or her enjoyment, and, as I view it, the persons who have not enough of the aesthetic in their mental make-up to enjoy the companionship of flowers, for there is a companionship about them, are losing some of the true savor of life, the finer perceptions of the beauties in the natural world, which He has so adorned for our enjoy - ment, and in which we may each, if we wish and will, have a part, be copartners if you please, and thus add greatly to our own enjoyment and the pleasure of those about us. My earliest acquaintance with my subject was when, as a lad, I roamed the virgin Iowa prairies and her stream borders of copse and prairie groves, back in the fifties and early sixties, when late in May and early June acres, yes by the thousands, were to be seen with their grassy slopes so thickly interspersed with the wild phlox that the emerald surface of the landscape, in many places, was as rosy as a maiden's cheek out in the bright cold mornings of an Iowa winter. As I look back from the western slopes of life's journey, I think much was given to me in those days of the joy of appreciation of those beauties of His handiwork in nature, of plant and tree life, in all their wondrously varied phases and Infinite charm, to make them welcome, rapturously welcome, to the seeing eye. "Pity 'tis, 'tis true" many, many people lack the seeing eye. Another variety of the phlox grew in limited numbers and restricted By F. O. Harrington, \Villiainsl&gt;iiru. low*. </seg>
            <seg id="p226">206 areas along the sides of our sometimes marshy slough of the open prairies. Phlox maculata, of one color only, which perhaps might be called a bright rosy purple, with finely spotted stems, and varnished leaves. The dry land variety. Phlox paniculata canadensis. varied greatly in pink and purplish shades, down to an occasional pure white. Another form, Phlox divaricata, growing only in low moist wood - lands, ten to twelve inches in height, and also an early bloomer, grew in many shades of lavender, a few of them too dark for any shade of lavender, and, rarely, some toned down to pure white. These are scarce now, as even the woodlands are pastured and, like many wild plants, these do not take kindly to such treatment. I have some of these at my home, growing under shade, of selected and greath diversified colors. Today in my section of Iowa scarce a vestige of the wild phlox remains in their natural habitat. King Corn and his satellites reign in supreme occupation. The best type of this plant for our ornamental plantings is Phlox decussata, and this, in comparatively recent years, has been greatly improved, in a much wider range of colors and increased size of florets and a more varied blooming period, so that now, if the early and late varieties are chosen, and the heads of bloom are cut off, as soon as the individual blooms on them are thinning, these phloxes should blossom from the middle of June until hard freezing in late October. One way of producing very fine later blooms is to cut off near tht ground all of the flower stems before they have begun bloominy. or a part from each plant may be cut off to be regrown for flowering, of course much delaying that period. The phlox succeeds well in almost any soil or position, shaded (if not too densely) or open, and will continue in good condition and flower freely for many years without attention. Nevertheless, they respond quickly to thorough cultivation and liberal enrichment of soil. Where one is planting in restricted areas and desirous of best possible results trenching the soil before planting is advisable, working in a moderate amount of manure from the cow barns. In good rich garden soils very good results are to be obtained without such additional labor. Except with small seedlings I set the phlox eighteen inches apart, for the reason that with such room and with thorough cultivation the in - dividual blooms, as well as the heads of blooms, are far larger than otherwise and afford ample payment for the extra trouble. In exceed - ingly dry periods thorough occasional waterings are very advantageous. Again, for best results the plants should be dug up every third year, separated into small bunches and reset. Replanting may be done during the first half of October, thus allowing the plants to get well established before winter, but under the often severe winter conditions of Iowa I think it quite as well to set out as early in the spring as soil is in fine working order, and they grow right along, as though not dis - turbed at all. As a matter of fact, it is a plant that is very adaptable to conditions and, like the strawberry, may be transplanted at any </seg>
            <seg id="p227">207 time (luring the growing season, even in full bloom, if earth is not shook out too much or kept out too long. While the phlox is quite a hardy plant, it is of advantage to give it about the same protection as we give our strawberry beds for the winter. I have been growing many of the best of the named varieties as well as a large number of my own seedlings, some of these finer I think than anything listed in the catalogue. Seeds are selected only from the finest kinds, sometimes from certain kinds planted closely together with a view of cross-fertilization. These seeds are planted in beds with rows a foot apart across the beds to allow cultivation between, late in November, sown thinly in drills about one-half an inch deep. When freezing sets in the bed is mulched with three or four inches of straw to prevent too much alternation of conditions and possible drying out. Some brush or some old boards will hold straw in place against winds or chickens, if they have that ranee in winter. As soon as settled warmer weather comes in spring and the seeds are about ready to grow, which they will do under rather low temperature, remove all covering except about an inch of loosely shaken up fine straw, which allow to remain until you find by frequent examination that the plants are some of them peeping out, they look much like young clover plants, then remove all the mulch save perhaps fine chaff. Afterwards keep a mellow surface between rows until the young plants are three to five inches high, when they should be transplanted into well prepared beds. In these I usually set in rows twelve inches apart across the bed and five to six inches apart in the row. Keep well hoed as with other garden crops and in August and September these plants will all bloom, often with only one well branched head of bloom, but the individual florets are as fine as on older and stronger plants. Usually these continue blooming through October. Naturally enough they do not bloom as early as older established plants do, which usually with the earlier bloomers commence at, or soon after, middle of June. During the blooming of these seedlings it is interesting to watch for the first opening florets and find what is in store for your especial gratification in the way of new and bright colors or combinations of unusual size of bloom or of bloom trusses. During this period 1 mark those of special interest, take them up the following spring and replant into more roomy quarters for further trial. Otherwise than the removal of these selected plants the seedling bed is allowed to remain as it is for another season, sometimes two seasons. Of course they are too thick for best results. Nevertheless, a bed with a thousand plants in bloom affords a mass effect of wonderful color. When the blooming season comes around it is worth looking at and frequently too. Now I have only touched on some of the points of interest in this matter, but any of you will have opportunity to question me after I have taken my seat about any feature of my subject you may feel an interest in, and I will answer, if I know enough.

Advanced civilization is growing hungry for the beautiful and must have it. A flower is needed which can endure heat or cold, which is adapted to all the phases of our trying climate. The coming flower to meet this want is the iris. Our semi-arid regions and sand-hills comprise a fourth of our great domain. How the women with hearts aching for the beautiful try to raise flowers and fail. They try the peony, but it needs a great deal of moisture. The phlox cannot endure the withering sirocco. The columbine delights in cool and moist conditions. Many things which By «'. S. Haiii-on. York. </seg>

But the heroic iris will endure these adverse conditions and glory in them. They are a success in the eastern plains of Colorado, Wyom - ing, Montana, and in the hot, dry mesas of Arizona. In the awful heat of that state they thrive in cemeteries on the burning plains and when once established they defy sun and sirocco. What is the Secret of Their Kndurance? Here in Nebraska we sometimes have the most trying conditions. One year for fifty days the mercury was 100 and up. The hot winds were raging. There were only two inches of rainfall for four months. Peonies wilted and the tops died. The beautiful phloxes went down in the boiling heat. Other things vanished. Rut the iris laughed at it and dared the weather to do its worst. What Was the Secret? We often dig iris in August. We found the earth as dry as an ash heap just thrown out of a furnace. But the roots of the iris had .gathered the moisture and held it. They were full, plump and fleshy and when transplanted grew readily. In a great field of 150,000 we did not lose a plant of the rbizomatous croup. Nature kindly provides things for every region. When we find out her wants we should meet them. Again. In all our northern states we need flowers for Decoration day. When other flowers like the beautiful peony are scarce, the iris is - always on hand with its fragrance, beauty and cheer and we have the red. white and blue for soldiers' graves. By a judicious selection you have blooms for over two months. These are the early dwarfs, with their hybrids, then the intermediates numerous and resplendent family. Then the early, the medium and later Germans, then stately Monspurs and the Giganteas to bring up the rear. Here you have what you want. At a little expense the wife can go into her own garden and pick her bouquet fresh with the dew and adorn her table for two months in succession. It costs but little to get ■ start and then she can have glorious masses of them. There is a prejudice against the iris. A woman says: "Oh, they are nothing but the flags which grow in the swamp." And there she stands and declares we want to cheat her and we are frauds. Now just drag that woman away from the swamp. She will get her feet wet and catch cold. True some of the great iris family do grow in the swamp. But there are over 200 varieties that do not and cannot live in water. They must have dry feet. In a moist climate they should </seg>

            <seg id="p231">CONSERVATION OF WILD FLOWERS 211 and the conservation of wild plants. In my early days at Ames, the thought was, how best to clear a tract of the "useless" trees, why could it not be used for pasture or corn land. Today the attitude has changed. A widespread interest was manifested when the Register and Leader during the fall published an editorial commending the plan of Senator Kenyon to set aside a tract of land in northeastern Iowa for a national park. The thought occurred to Mr. Harvey Ingham and many others that the idea was an excellent one and that there are many places in Iowa that should be set aside for municipal and county parks. The woman's federation of Iowa has taken an active interest in this work, and they are helping the plan to preserve for future gen- rations some of the beautiful places in Iowa. We have a wealth of material at our doors in almost every county in the state. These places were made for our present enjoyment and for those that are to come. Should not the state of Iowa do something along this line. She is rich in her matchless soil and what it produces. Let the state put aside just a little while the idea that everything must be for agriculture. Let us rather encourage the idea that more should be produced on the ground that we now till. Let us now and then muse in the woods and enjoy the beautiful around us. It will make better men and women. Everyone in this audience recalls with pleasur - able delight the swamp on the farm where the marsh marigold (Calthit palustris) lifted its golden, yellow flowers in the sun. or the sunny and gravelly knoll on some farm in northern Iowa where the pasque (lower in purple clusters strongly defied the elements of weather. Per - haps you remember the long tramp in the woods in May when suddenly you found a few of the yellow lady slippers under some tree, or perhaps you remember the day in June when you went over a mossy bank and you came across the large white and royal lady slipper, or you found one of the real orchids with its roots tucked away in the moss. The lady slipper and orchids never were common in Iowa and hence the greater delight in finding them. You also recall that in the early days you went to the woods and here you found an array of early blooming plants like the Dutchman's breeches, hepatica, blood-root, bell-flower, May apple, rue, anemone, etc. Now go back to some woods after a lapse of twenty-five years and you find that these plants have totally disappeared or are becoming rare. The disappearance of plants in parts of Iowa may best be illustrated by railing attention to a few places and what has occurred in twenty - six years. Let me select the place known as the ledges in Boone county. The most interesting spot in central Iowa, about five miles from Boone and on the Des Moines river, is unique among Iowa beauty spots. It is a most picturesque place. A small creek runs through the ledges known as Pease creek. The sandstone ledges in some places are about 75 feet high and with a gentle slope extending to the top of the prairies of about 125 feet more. The sandstone rock consists of a </seg>

When I went there twenty-six years ago the small valley was heavily timbered, the most important trees were the corky bark elm (Ulmus thomasii), black maple (Acer nigrumi. black walnut (Juglans nigra). slippery elm (Ulmus fulva), bass wood (Tilia americana) and swamp ash ( Fraxinus nigra). In the spring the wake-robin (Trillium nivale) occurred in large numbers in the humus. The moosewood (Dirca palustris), red cedar (Junlperus vireiniana). buckthorn (Rhamnus lanceolata), pin cherry &lt; Prunus pennsylvanica), nine-bark (Physocar - pus opulifolius), dogwood (Cornus circlnata) were rather common over the hills or on the ledges. Today, however, these plants have become greatly diminished. The pin cherry only occurs in one place and comparatively few of these trees are left. The nine-bark, too, ha? been reduced to a few plants on the edge of an almost Inaccessible ledge. The buckthorn and nioosewood have not been found recently. Only two or three red cedars are left— though at one time fairly common. It was not difficult in those days to flnd a few specimens every year of the yellow lady slipper: now, however, this plant is rarely brought to us. Down in the valley the ground was covered with the May apple (Podophyllum peltatum), the Indian turnip (Arisaema triphyllum) and the Dragon's head (A. drarontinum). These plants, though still oc - curring, are rare. There were also a great many sweet Williams ( Phlox divaricata i and wild cranesbill i Geranium maculatum). The ledges are unique for central Iowa because of the occurrence of several interesting ferns, among them the walking leaf fern (Camptosorus rhizophyllu.- 1 . the common polypody ( Polypodium vulgare I , the Asplenium fllix-foemina. Adiantum pedatum, Woodsia obtusa and Cystopteris fragilis. These ferns, except the last, are all protected because they occur in inaccessible ledges. The latter fern is common in the woods. The reindeer lichen occurs on an exposed point. It is the only locality so far as I know in the state. The region is now subject to pasturage and the valley is used as a camping place. The people who use it totally disregard the rare plants found here. Generally these plants mean no more than weeds. I have also been somewhat familiar with another point in Hardin county, namely, Steamboat Rock. Here we have similar sandstone ledges along the Iowa river. The place is situated a few miles above Steamboat Rock. A few miles above Eldora there is a creek known as Pine creek, so called by the earlier settlers because of the abundance of white pine. The Steamboat Rock country contains a number of the rarer plants of the state. Of the trees, I may mention the white pine (Pinus strobus), the cherry birch (Betula lutea), paper birch (Betula papyrifera) ; of the shrubs, moosewood (Dirca palustris), dogwood I Cornus circinata), juniper (Juniperus communist, bush honeysuckle i Diervilla lonicera). There are also some interesting flowers like the white large lady slipper (Cyprlpedlum reglnae). yellow lady slipper </seg>

In the portion of the region protected the plants have a precarious existence because of the clearing of the woods above and the consequent drying of the soil. I am familiar with the region known as Woodman's hollow near Fort Dodge, a series of sandstone ledges along the Des Moines river below the city of Fort Dodge, about fourteen miles south. It is heavily covered with timber and where not pastured the timber contains an abundance of wild flowers. Great masses of the ostrich fern I Stru - thiopteris germanisa), the small Pellaea gracilis on the rocks, an abundance of Woodsia obtusa, Adiantum pedatum occur. It Is a botanist's paradise and the botanists of Fort Dodge do not wish to have it known that there are many rare plants in the region. Unfortunately the people of Fort Dodge know that it is about the only place in the vicinity where the ostrich fern occurs and wagon loads are carried out for planting. Northeastern Iowa, especially in Allamakee, Winneshiek and Clay - ton counties, is commonly called the Switzerland of Iowa. This refer - ence is not out of harmony with the picturesque conditions along the Mississippi and the broken, hilly, country, back intersected with a fine lot of streams that have cut their way through the limestone rock. One region has interested me for years, the Yellow river country, not many miles from Postville. Here was the old military road from Fort Crawford on the Mississippi passing through a timbered and sparsely settled country westward to Fort Atkinson in Winneshiek county, then an outpost. Here it was that Jefferson Davis spent a part of his mili - tary career guarding frontier settlers from the hostile Indians. There was an old pioneer mill on the Yellow river of near what is now Clark's farm. This mill, in its day, made many barrels of flour for the pioneers. Not far from the mill and on the other side of the stream are the high limestone cliffs with large fresh water springs coming from the base of the cliffs; these springs add their water to the stream. On these picturesque bluffs we have an interesting lot of plants. They seem out of place with the American elm, black maple, soft maple, slippery elm of the valley of the Yellow river or the white oak, red oak, green ash, blue beech (Carpinus caroliniana) and iron wood (Ostrya virginica i of the upland woods back farther in the hills. This interest - ing assemblage of plants on the hills belongs to a region much farther north. Here we have the balsam fir (Abies balsamea), Hlghbush cran - berry (Viburnum opulus, var.

The cool air from the crevices of the rocks and the abundant moss makes it possible for these plants to grow in this region In southeastern Iowa, not far from Muscaiine, is a region made up of sandstone known as the Wyoming hills. In this little protected place we have a mingling of the southern and northern plants, mostly, however, southern. The white pine is northern, so are the Aspleniun: nlix-foemina, Adiantum pedatum, of the southern ferns the Phegop- teris hexagonoptera and Aspidium acrostichoides, Aspidium golriianuni are abundant. The papaw i Asimina triloba), Gaylussacia resinosa, the white ash (Fraxinus americana) and the southern fox grape i Vitis cinerea) are southern. Fortunately this region is protected from de- struction. A public-spirited woman who owns the land will not perm its destruction There are many other place? in Iowa near every center tion that contain interesting places. Here the birds and wild life nr a haven of rest. To those who are interested in the wild life of our prairies will run that there are few protected places in this state. The original prairies which contained some of the most interesting plants have nearly ali passed away. Here and there may still be found a few of the prairie; with their original blue aster (Aster laevis i , the show} goldenro&lt;] iSolidago speciosa), the New England aster I Aster Novae-Angliaei, the meadow rue (Thalictrum purpurascens). the bunch flower t Melan thium virginicum), the purple cone flower ' Ecbinacea purpureai, tht sweet William (Phlox paniculatai, the small white lady slipper i Cypri - pedium candidum), the white habenaria i Habenaria leucophaea i . th&gt; large Canadian lily I Lilhun canadense), the Philadelphia lily i I. ilium Philadelphia) and more rarely the Lilium superbum The right of way of the railroads today are about the only pi that show a typical Iowa prairie of the old days. Here too the apgr sive European weeds are forcing the original inhabitants out. Th original prairie species lack the aggressiveness of the European or th native weeds. I want to make a plea for the preservation of these wild plants. I grant that we should make use of available ground for agricultural and horticultural purposes and yet, I believe, that we ought to find places to protect these wild plants from extermination. It is the duty of the state and nation to take hold of this matter During the past summer I spent a few days in the Rockies and on the Pacific coast. I must confess I am surprised at the apathy of the state or nation to look after its playgrounds. </seg>

Later it was our pleasure to visit the big trees or the red- ood i Sequoia sempervirens). At the Big Tree near Santa Cruz in alifornia the small grove of this majestic tree contains some of the truest of the species, with the exception of a few in the Muir woods MM San Francisco. A part of this grove is free to the public but a part of it is fenced off and a small admission of twenty-five cents will Imit you to the grove containing the largest tree. .Some of the trees are dedicated to a few notable personages like McKinley and Grant. Most of the trees have inscriptions of some uternal order. I have no objections to the placing of such monuments in appro- iate places around these trees. However, it does appear to me that a grove like this, accessible to travelers along the line of the S. P. R. K . should become the property, not of an individual or corporation. ut it should belong to the people. For this reason the state or national overnment should control this grove as one of the nation's play - rounds. This grove would then be more adequately protected from indalism and fires. I want to make an earnest plea, not only for the preservation for future generations of the beautiful places in Iowa, but for the nation's playgrounds. --(Address before Iowa State Horticultural Society, De - cember, 1915.)

It has performed a feat no civil engineer can emulate. Think of those roots so busily scurrying around in the earth, gathering food to send up the cambium highway to nourish the tree. See the tent cords thrown out to anchor it against the storms. Look at those trees on the outskirts. Among wild animals the strongest are on guard on the outside to protect the herd. So these sentinel trees guard their wards against the storms. Fool man cuts down the guards and the wards fall before the sweep of the storms.

When the little trees were large enough. I transplanted them in rows six feet apart and started a miniature forest. Twenty-live years after I went to see them. The trees were straight. The trees had fine bodies six inches through. They were miniature columns in a temple, holding up a canopy of green. The ground was covered with a thick carpet of needles. It was one of the most pleasing sights I ever saw. Then I thought. "What if I had planted forty acres?" I would have had a Mecca to which horticul - tural pilgrims would have flocked from hundreds of miles. I planted the trees and the faithful servants kept on working day and night and that beautiful grove was the result. Every tree you plant is your servant, and how faithful it is — no shrinking — always at it whether you are looking or not. Look at that cherry tree. How the tiny rootlets scurry through the soil — faithful children gathering food to send up to their mother. Look at that flood of bloom. Then the fruit grown till a mass of red gleams from the leafy coverts. There is a great difference between a patch of brown earth and your faithful Jonathan. What a marvel that little patch of soil, absolutely milked by thos.- busy foragers, and the extracts of It glowing in red beauty on the tree. Talk of chemists. Those quiet rootlets surpass them all. If you want to be in the realm of miracles, lay down your hoe a while and sit among your flowers. Your brain devised the plan, your hand planted the seeds and bulbs. "Behold the lilies, how they grow." Now sit there and think it out. At your feet are artists no human skill may imitate. Two peonies grow side by side.

A second cut on the upper side should be martf a half inch or more back of or beyond the first one. The sawing on the upper side should be continued until the limb falls. The first out on the under side is to prevent the splitting or stripping of the outer wood and bark as the limb falls, something which almost in - l ariably happens when a heavy limb is removed by a single cut fron. the upper side. This leaves a stub several inches long which must now be sawed off close to the trunk, or close to the larger supporting limb. as the rase may be. The stub should be held in place until completely severed. The final cut should be made so that its surface will conform as nearly as possible with the shape of the supporting limb or trunk. No projecting stub or stump should be left, as this interferes with the rapid healing of the wound. Preventing Infection of Wounds If the wood exposed by the final cut is healthy and there is no trace ot decay or disease, it should (as soon as the surface is dry) immedi - ately be painted with shellac, good lead paint, tar or asphalt, in order to prevent the entrance of decay-producing organisms. Without some such precaution, organisms of this sort are practically certain to gain entrance and cause serious damage to the tree in later years. From the point of view of rapid healing, shellac is the best of the coverings mentioned above, but it is much less durable. On the other hand asphalt is the most durable when properly applied, but probably inter - feres with the earlier stages of normal healing to a greater extent than any of the others. However, as the rapid healing of large scars is usually of secondary importance to that of preventing infection, asphalt is recommended" in preference to the others, when facilities for properly applying it are available. The asphalt should be applied while hot; consequently it is neces - sary to have some apparatus for keeping it melted. A brush of broom ion or rope should be used, as the hot asphalt will usually destroy brlstle.s. Because this method cannot ordinarily be handled conve - ntent ly by most people, coal-tar has come to be the most generally used preparation for covering large pruning wounds, while good lead paint lose second. One advantage of paint is that it can be obtained almost anywhere and in colors that will conform to that of the normal bark, and thus be less conspicuous than either tar, asphalt, or shellac when applied to a wound. A mixture of about three parts coal-tar and one part creosote has proved very efficient, and is easily applied with an ordinary paint brush, but in many cases it is advisable to re - paint with clear coal-tar after a few days, in order to make a more lasting waterproof covering.

This is why it is always recommended to plant it in spring instead of autumn. Further, it calls for a close pruning when transplanted. With this there is no great risk in planting it. The great height which the tulip tree attains in time calls for its planting where such a tree would be fittine, and this applies to both common and the fastigiate variety. The common form is increased from seeds, but it is a character of i hit tree that of, say IM seeds but perhaps ten or so would be perfect, so this must be remembered when sowing, them.

There are several of the cut-leaved forms of much merit . fitting them for use as pot plants and for trellis and similar work for which many other vines are used. One of these varieties, Hedera digitata, with comparatively small leaves, much divided, is of pleasing appearance. It is an excellent sort to use where the common ivy. with its large leaves, is of too heavy an appearance. Everyone knows what a heavy mass of green the common ivy makes in the course of time, when in addition to the clinging shoots there are numerous side ones as well. It is for positions where this heavy appearance is undesirable that the cut-leaved one, digitata, could be better used. When it clings properly there is a sheet of pretty, small foliage, close to the surface to which it is attached. When grown in pots for sale by florists, its neat, pretty foliage sells it without the additional merit o f its being a hardy ivy. Many persons find the English ivy in all its varieties reluctant to attach itself to walls and other surfaces of a smooth nature. There are two chief reasons for this in our experience, the lack of interstice - for the roots to enter, and often the glare of hot sunlight. There is no help for the first, but in the case of the second we have often foaml that by aiding a few leading shoots to hold fast to their positions for a year or so, the shade their foliage affords encourages newer growths to cling without help. This is why when ivy is set to north or east walls there is less difficulty in Retting it started than when it faces a sonth em exposure.

By Joseph Median. t'ydonia japonica, better known as Pyrus japonica to almost evt-i y - uh»- familiar with old-time shrubs, is not so often seen in shrub col - lections as formerly, and as it deserves to be. It is one of the early spring-flowering shrubs. Its large, scarlet flowers are so showy that easily holds its place as one of some dozen shrubs that one feels one ust have in a collection. In former days it stood alone in its color, but there are now a -ood half-dozen others at least, having among them white, rose, pink. irimson and shades of these colors, which in all are beautiful. A good uroup of these various colors is very pleasing and is an attraction of some of our public parks. Though all have prickly spines, some have fewer than others. In the way of growth, too. there is variation; some are taller than others, forming bushes four feet to five feet tall, though lesser heights are common, but all are more or less bushy. Their prickly nature has found them a place to warn folks to keep away from forbidden paths, for no one cares to run into a bush ol it. The scarlet flowers of the common one, japonica, account for one of its common names, "Fire Bush." The general name for It and all its varieties is Japan quince, which is not wrongly applied, for its fruits are not unlike the common quince in shape, though much smaller, in addition to both plants being in the same genus. These fmits are of pleasing fragrance when ripe and are often placed in clothes closets and bureaus because of this. In addition to this, the fruits may be used to make an appetizing tart jelly. The propagation of these shrubs is by root cuttings, of about two - inch lengths, made in autumn, and kept in sand in a cool place over winter, then placed lengthwise in rows, two inches deep, outdoors, in spring. — From Florists' Exchange. </seg>

Lilacs have been so long associated wit hthe early years of everyone of us that wherever there is space for the planting of a few shrubs a lilac of some sort has to be given room in a garden. The old Syringa vulgaris is still often seen, but mostly the plants were set out many years ago. There are now so many beautiful varie - ties to be had today. The lilac is Ions lived, accounting for the pres - ence of the old species on so many lawns, where they have stood, some of them, for half a century. There are now varieties by the dozens, some single, others double. The single ones always appear to sell the best of all, but the double ones are always interesting, and. as with the singles, they exist in many varieties. The following list of double sorts gives a good variety to select from: Alphonse I-avallf. bluish lilac: Belle de Nancy, pink, white center; lime. Lemoine, white; Michael Buchner, pale lilac; Maxime lornu, pinkish lilac. In common with all double [lowers, as the petals do not fall to th» ground as readily as the single ones, they make some display for ;i longer period than do the single flowered. The ease with which lilacs grow when budded on the Privet has led too many propagators to take advantage of this method of propagation. With care in cutting off all buds on the Privet stock when planting lilacs so increased, there is no danger of havine Privets spring up from the stock later on.

Diervillas have been so hybridized and added to by varieties that one hardly knows which class any one of them belongs. However, the name under which our present subject is known indicates it is a varie - gated variety of D. rosea. Many of our older florists will remember the introduction of the common rosea 'o our collection, when advertise - ments of it read something like this: "Weisela rosea, a grand new shrub from China."

There is a type of much taller growers, of which Arborea versicolor may be taken as an example. This has more vigor - ous, upright growth than rosea while not devoid of bushiness, while the color of its flowers are much the same. It should be said here that. though rosea is supposed to represent a rose colored flower, in the cue of our Weigela rosea it is while in the bud that this color is displayed : when expanded the inside color is white, a charming combination. Returning to Arborea versicolor and its strong growth, made in Ally summer, if this growth is shortened some in August it results in forcing outside shoots, which usually display loose panicles of flowers. In this way a second, or autumn display of flowers may be had, very welcome at that season. Botanists know of two native Weigelas here, one, W. tritlda, grows northern woods — even along the Wissahickon. within the city of Philadelphia; the other, sessilifolia, is from the mountains of Carolina and Tennessee Neither is the equal of those of Asiatic origin.

In the design and construction of the farm house the question of utility alone should not be the determining factor. The first thought should be the making of a home. The amount of money to be invested in the building of the home should not be determined by its relation in size to the balance of the plant, nor by the amount that is necessary </seg>

The average city dweller in buying a house for a home does not proceed solely on the basis of what he can expect to secure in case it is ever desirable to place the house on the market. He is not likely to consider the purchase of a home as a financial in - vestment, but as a social one, which will enable him to secure for his family the comforts and conveniences that he could not secure in a rented house, and to have for his family a genuine home, a genuine home life. If he is able when the time arrives to dispose of his prop - erty to financial advantage, well and good; if not, he considers, and properly so, that he has made a good investment from the social side. There is no panacea that will cure the yearning for city life evi - denced by the country boys and girls of today, but there are certain conditions, which, if established, will add materially to the attractive ness of life in the country, and should therefore prevent them from flocking to the cities merely to avoid life on the farm.

Mam-y, Assistant Chief in Pomology, Iowa Agricultural Expert - in. in Station, Ames, Iowa. Excerpts from Bulletin 160, Iowa Experiment Station.) Grape pruning experiments carried on near Council Bluffs during the season of 1914 for a comparison of the "spur" with the "long cane and spur renewal" system showed that the vines pruned after the long cane system yielded, on the average, 41 per cent more grapes than the spur pruned vines. These results indicate that the long cane system la of value for the southwestern and other sections of Iowa where grapes are grown. However, it must be recognized that these results are for one year only. Further experiment with the two systems must be carried on before the long cane system can be recommended un - reservedly. The pruning experiments grew out of a survey made by the pomology section of the Iowa Agricultural Experiment Station in the summer of 1913 for the purpose of obtaining data relative to the methods of vineyard management in the vicinity of Council Bluffs. The one operation that attracted the most attention was the "spar" </seg>

It is unlike the grape pruning systems that are used in the other grape growing regions of the United States and it was later de - cided to investigate it thoroughly. This style of pruning gives the impression that there is too much non-producing vine in comparison with the amount of bearing wood left for fruiting. This particular system of pruning perhaps had its origin in the fan type. The first grapes planted in this region were pruned according to the low-headed fan system. Each year the old canes were cut back to near the surface of the ground one-year-old canes which each fall earth for winter protection.

The main object was to prune according to the long cane system and at the same time reduce the amount of old vine, replacing the heavier wood with vigorous young unes and renewal spurs During the growing season it was evident from the set and dis - bution of the fruit that the long pruned vines were going to give the highest yields. June 20, 1914. an inspection of the experiments was made by a large group of the grape growers and all were impressed with this fact. The fruit on the spur pruned vines was mostly bunched jgether along the top wire in a rather compact mass. Very few unches were produced lower down on the vines. the spring of 1914 the bloom on the vines in all the vineyards ry abundant but heavy rains at blossoming time caused a poor it of fruit in many of the vineyards. The failure of the flowers to rtilize properly resulted in small and loosely formed bunches. The ruit produced was of good size and high quality. However, the yield las shortened considerably. The grapes from the vines in both systems of pruning ripened at bout the same time. The fruit was then picked and the weights ecorded for the individual vines. In all the experiments only the normal vines were considered in jring the averages. In both the spur pruned and the long pruned rows some of the vines were not in normal condition, being diseased, too young for bearing, or severely cut back, or, as with two of the the grapes were not ripe at picking time. Conclusions. It is realized that too much dependence should not be placed on the results of one year's experiments. However, the fact remains that in the Dorland, Rich. Johnson and Konigmacher vineyards the production from the plots pruned on the long cane system average 41 per cent higher than the plots pruned by the spur method. Such a showing indicates that the long cane system must have some good features. If it is to be of real value every grape grower should set aside a few vines and test the system for himself. (■rape Pruning, To prune a grapevine intelligently the pruner necessarily must be acquainted with a few of the simple principles connected with the growth of the vine, viz.: 1. The fruit is produced on shoots which spring from the one year wood and therefore the pruning of the vine is primarily a renewal proposition. A certain amount of wood of the previous year's growth must be saved each year for fruit production and provision made to provide for a renewal growth which can be used the following year. 2. Generally speaking, operations which reduce the vijor of the </seg>
            <seg id="p258">236 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY vine tend to promote fruitfulness and factors which limit fruitfulnesa tend to promote vigor. If too much of the new wood is left on the vine, overbearing results. On the other hand, if too little of the new wood is left, the vigor of the vine is directed to the production of woody growth. In this connection, bending, girdling or twisting the cane injures the tissues and cause? a loss in vigor and an increase in fruiting capacity. The best pruner is the one who takes consideration of these prin - ciples. Acting accordingly, he shapes and adjusts the main body of the vine to the training system which he has in mind as an ideal, and prunes the bearing part of the vine so that it will be renewed from year to year, never allowing the vine to overbear but making it bear to its full capacity. Pruning Old \ iu&lt; &gt;. The suggestions which are here given for pruning are applicabl particularly to the conditions in southwestern Iowa. However, the same principles and type of pruninc can be adapted with but a few exceptions to all parts of the stat« In southeastern Iowa, in localities where the soil is poor, less bear ing wood must be used in order not to overtax the vigor o? the vine Black rot is also more prevalent in the eastern part of the sta order to control this disease more easily, the canes selected lit arranged on the trellis so that good circulation of air will be insured Old vines which have been improperly pruned for a number of years present about the same pruning problems in all cases. Th&lt; training already has been determined and the pruning merely a matter of renovation. The old non-productive wood must be r and one-year canes substituted for the production of fruit Where old vines have been spur pruned for a numbt x they have been in Council Bluffs vineyards, they necessar quired an excessive amount of non-bearing vine. The reason for this is because with the spur pruning no provision is made for renewal canes. With grapes the greatest growth takes place in the highest shoots and on the shoots farthest away from the main trunk result, at pruning time, the highest shoots, being the strongest, are naturally selected for spurs. Year after year this selection is followed, so it is not at all surprising that all the fruiting wood is on the top wire or that the side arms extended out eight to ten feet. In changing from the spur system to the long canes with renewal spurs the pruner must remember several things. The weakest fruit buds on a cane are the ones at the base and at the extreme tip, whereas the strongest are located six or eight buds out from the base. This statement may perhaps be disputed, but if actual observations are made of the long cane when in fruiting, it will be seen that the best bunches are on the shoots coming from the buds in the middle portion of the cane. </seg>
            <seg id="p259">237 GRAPE PRUNING With spur pruning it will be noticed that many of the spurs do not produce fruiting shoots, but on the contrary throw out heavy non - productive shoots which sometimes grow to a length of twenty feet or more. The reason for this growth is simple. The few buds at the base of the cane, which was spurred, were not fruit buds and consequently expended their vigor on wood growth. The fact that the lower buds are not well adapted for fruit produc - tion is made use of in the long cane pruning. Long canes are selected for fruiting and others are cut back to two buds so that they will receive the extra food supply and produce strong woody growths. The production of fruit is much influenced by the type of fruiting ne which is selected by the pruner. The best type of cane to choose for fruiting is one about the thick - ness of a lead pencil. The nodes on such a cane are short and the buds are round and plump. A cane of this type, having ten to twelve such buds, is ideal for the long cane system. Some pruners are inclined to select the heavier canes with long nodes and wedge-shaped buds. The fact that cane has made an unsual gTowth Indicates that the formation of fruit buds has been sacrificed at the expense of wood growth. The Concord, and more particularly the Moore's Early grape, when planted on rich soil, throws out a growth of heavy canes which are vered with short lateral shoots. In this case the heavy canes must necessity be utilized. In doing so the average pruner will usually carefully clip off all the laterals, not realizing that some of the best fruit is often produced from these side shoots. The laterals should not be removed entirely, but cut back to one or two buds. The bad the base of the lateral is not a good one for fruit production. When a vine is found with an excessive wood growth, it is an indlca- on of too much vigor. Such a vine may be given more fruiting canes o use up the excess of plant food or the canes bent or twisted to nduce fruit production. It is more profitable to raise grapes than seless wood Time for Pruning. Pruning of grapes can be started at any time after the wood has ripened up in the fall and before the sap starts flowing in the spring. If the vines are to be laid down for winter protection, the pruning should be done before the ground freezes. Perhaps, the spring is the best time to do the work from the fact that in some seasons parts of the vine are winter-killed and if these happen to be the canes which were pruned in the fall, it is impossible to replace them, whereas with the spring pruning it is nearly always possible to find on an unpruned vine a sufficient number of canes which have come through the winter uninjured. Pruning should not be done when the vines are in a frozen condition as the canes are then very brittle and easily broken off. Summer Pruning. Summer pruning is practiced considerably in the eastern part of </seg>
            <seg id="p260">NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY 238 this state, mostly, however, by growers who maintain the position that the bunches require sunlight for ripening- At Council Bluffs and in other parts of southwestern Iowa the vint'S make a very dense growth. Sometimes they are at least two feet across, yet the grapes ripen per - fectly. This vineyard produced over three tons of grapes to the acre. Only one picking was necessary as a'l the grapes ripened early and evenly. The only summer pruning done was to remove the surk.Ts from the base of the vine about the middle of July. Sometimes much damage is done by indiscriminate summer pruning, especially the kind where the pruner goes into the vineyard with a corn knife and pro - ceeds to hack away at the young growth. The objection to this practice is that instead of diverting the energy of the vine into fruit produc - tion, the vine is apt to increase its growth activities by throwing out laterals which fill up the trellis, interfere with the circulation and tend to hinder rather than aid in the development of the fru I'liiniii- Vomit; Vines Grapevines as received from the nursery are either one or two years old. Many of the best growers prefer good one year plants. When planting the young vine, the growth is cut back to two fye* Two or more shoots will start from these eyes and after they have made a growth of six to t.velve inches all but the strongest shoot should be broken off. This throws the entire growth into the single shoot. Usually too little attention is given to the summer care of young vines. They are usually allowed to throw out a number of shoots, none of which makes sufficient growth to train to the trellis the second year. Vines which have made a weak growth the first year arc bene - fited by again cutting them back to two buds the second season. This practice strengthens the root system and insures better canes for tyine up to the first wire the third year. Provide Trellis at End of First Year At the end of the first year a trellis should be supplied. &lt; &gt;ak or cedar posts set 18 to 20 feet apart should be used in the construction. The trellis should be strung with No. 11 galvanized wire. If two wires are used, the first is placed at 30 inches above the ground and the second about 26 inches above the first. Better training of the vine can be accomplished where three wires are used. In this arrangement the first wire is placed at 30 inches, the second at 43 inches and the third at 56 inches. The wires should not be fastened to the end posts by staples, but should be wound on some sort of a simple reel. This simplifies the tightening of the wires, which is a necessary operation each season. Pruning the Second Year. The pruning for the second year, provided the vine has made the proper growth, will be to head in the single cane and tie it in a vertical position to the first wire of the trellis. Early in the following growing </seg>
            <seg id="p261">239 season the buds along the lower part of the stalk should be rubbed off and the growth thrown into the four or five upper ones, which are allowed to remain in order to form the head. Third Pruning Determines Type. The third pruning is the one which in a large measure determines the future type of training for the vine. There are a large number of different types of training, all of which have their good and bad features. The one type which has naturally adapted itself to Iowa conditions the fan system. With the proper distribution of the bearing wood. this type of training combines many of the features of the other styles and is peculiarly adapted to producing a large amount of grapes of good quality. The pomology section is planning to carry on experiments in which types of training now in practice in various sections will be tried iut under Iowa conditions. A report on these will be made when data obtained The fan system may be trained vith a permanent single stem reach - to the first wire, or in regions where laying down is necessary the newal canes may be started from a short stalk near the ground. &gt;me fruit will be produced on the short arms during the third season. However, with the average young vine the wood should be headed back pretty severely so as not to permit the young vine to overbear. By pruning to long canes each year and providing renewal spurs ir base renewal is always possible and, in addition, the arms ne are not lengthened out to crowd other vines on the same Pruning Tools. &gt; efficient work, the pruner must be equipped with the right uols, the most important of which is the hand shears. There any types of these on the market, some good and some wholly ork. The type of hand pruner, having a ratchet nut r tightening the blade, may be purchased at from $1 to $2. It does t pay to buy cheap pruners. Shears without the lock nut may be less expensive but they will continually give trouble by the nut working loose and thus permitting the blades to be sprung apart. A pair of hand shears having a ratchet nut, together with a small keyhole saw, make an outfit which is efficient and easy to carry around. Wrapping the handles of the hand pruner with adhesive tape, or with leather from the top of an old shoe, gives the hand a better grip. Some - times the heavy double pruners, or snagging shears, may be used to advantage. However, they are clumsy to carry. The keyhole saw will cut easier and can be carried in the pruner's pocket. Tying Up the Pruned Vines. Tying up the canes after the pruning is finished is almost aa im- </seg>
            <seg id="p262">240 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY portant as the pruning itself. This work is usually performed by women and boys who know very little about the principles of pruning or training. Good pruning and ideals of training are often ruined by a poor tier. Whoever does the tying should be instructed in some of the principles of pruning. The best material for fastening the canes to the wires is jute twine. In making the tie. the twine is first given a wrap around the wire and then tied about the cane. This prevents the cane from slipping on the wire or being injured by rubbing back and forth. The main body of the vine should be firmly secured to the wires. This is important because if the body of the vine is swayed by the wind, the cares when loaded with fruit and foliage will break as a result of the pressure. The canes should be curved on the wires where possible. If the canes are tied in a vertical position the growth is thrown to the highest buds, but if the cane is bent along the wire, or is recurved over the upper wire in umbrella style, and tied to a lower one, the mechanical injury caused by the bending tends to decrease the vigor of growth and consequently the energy is diverted into fruit production. Checking the growth by recurving the canes also tends to throw the growth vigor into the replacing spurs, which is desirable from the standpoint of the production of renewal canes for the following year. The grape cane borer ( Schistoceros hematus, Fabr. i has been very destructive In some of the vineyards in western Iowa. This little insect can be controlled best by pruning out all the infested canes and then burning all the prunings. It has been a common practice in the Council Bluffs vineyards to nil the soil washes with the grape prunings These filled-in places have become breeding places for the borer and the injury from the insect in the vicinity of the wash usually is very severe. In the practice of spur pruning the pruner usually neglects to remove many of the old spurs and thus provides an excellent breeding place for the beetles. When renovating an old vine, care should be taken to cut out all of these old stubs and burn them. The grape cane borer is so easily controlled by burning the prun ings that it should never be allowed to gain a foothold in the vineyard Bibliography of More Important Publications on (.rap.- I'liunn^ In the preparation of this bulletin a number of more important publications on grape pruning were consulted.

This subject is of as much importance to the Nebraska growers aa to our Iowa friends. DEVELOPMENT OF STRAWBERRY CULTURE IX FIFTY YKAK.s. By C. F. Gardner. O*mge, Iowa. We learn from authors on fruit culture published from forty to fifty years ago that it is only in a comparatively recent period that the small fruits have been considered of sufficient importance to command the attention and call forth the energies of the skillful horticulturist. From all the information we can gather from history we infer that with the single exception of the grape very few of the small fruits common here now were known or cultivated in ancient times. Those that are mentioned are named only in some wild legend of field or forest, rendering it apparent that their cultivation and improvement were left for a people of a more progressive age. The strawberry in some form will grow and thrive in almost every part of the United States where other plants grow, yet, strange as it may seem, seventy-five years ago it was scarcely known except as a wild fruit. My father, N. C. Gardner, who was born in 1805, told me that there were few signs of strawberries planted out in the fields u grow berries for the market previous to about 1840 and not to amount to very much until long after that time. It is very probable that more strawberries are shipped into New York city on a single day in Ma&gt; or June at the present time than had ever been seen in that city during rir its entire history previous to the time mentioned We have only to look back a few pMn comparatively speaking, to ascertain all that has been done in cultivating and improving the strawberry, currant and gooseberry. In former times nature without the assistance of man supplied the most of the small fruits in quanti - ties adequate to the demand and of such quality as would satisfy un - cultivated tastes. But when the increase of population came on so rapidly that the supply of berries from the woods and meadows did not equal the demands of the market something had to be done. In the meantime a demand for something better had arisen. Many new and improved varieties were discovered as chance seedlings, growing here and there by the wayside and in the corners of the fences and other byplaces. Along about this time the pioneer plant breeders be - gan to see the advantage of assisting nature by making crosses be - tween different varieties. Not many years passed before the progress was remarkable. We learn from Shakespeare that in 1483 the garden of the Bishop of Ely, at Holborn, in England, was celebrated for its excellent straw - berries. They were no doubt the common wood strawberry of that country, one red and the other white. In 1578 Lyte mentions only the </seg>
            <seg id="p265">DEVELOPMENT OF STRAW BERRY CULTURE 243 wood strawberry. The first improved variety mentioned in France was about 1682 and it is mentioned again almost 100 years later by Duehesne The persistency with which some species like the above reproduce themselves from the seeds is remarkable, but no more so than the equally great variations that are constantly being developed in others. The wild native strawberry found in the state of Virginia and in all the eastern states, in the woods and the fields i Kragaria Virgin - ianai was introduced into England in the early part of the seventeenth century. They paid little attention to it for a hundred years, but after long lapse of time they discovered that by merely sowing seeds new arieties greatly differing from the parent plant were readily produced. In a short time after this discovery the plants they created were rapidly diffused and received the care they deserved. It is the most fragrant of all known species, possessing a delightful aromatic perfume not surpassed by any known variety. It was a robust and vigorous grower, withstanding our severe cold weather in the north with a little cover - ing of straw. With good culture it stood up under the burning sun of midsummer. In this country it assumes very distinct characters in different locations. Those planted in the western states vary greatly from those planted out in the eastern states, and they retain these peculiar characteristics for a long time. Among the varieties grown forty or fifty years ago one could recognize many whose parentage can be traced to the western plants. At the same time there were others which could be traced back as coming from the eastern states. I will mention a few of each class and the older members of this society will more readily recognize their peculiar characters than they could by any description of mine. It was noticed that the western class produced the softest, largest and most acid fruit. The best known of the western type were Austin, Iowa, Downer's Prolific, Green's Prolific, General Scott, and Victory. Victoria was an English seedling that appeared in 1867. Of the eastern type were Scarlet, Jenny Lind, Scott's Seedling, Boston Pine. Brighton, Pine and the like. The various forms of the F. Virginiana in different portions of the United States gave rise to much discussion as to whether all these variations should be classed as one species, or separated into different ones. At that time Dr. Asa Gray classed them all as one species. The importation from South America of F. grandiflora gave a new impetus to strawberry culture in Europe. In 1867 it appeared to be valued there more than any other. At least one would judge so from the fact that almost all the new varieties imported at that time to the United States showed more of the characteristics of F. grandiflora than of any others. This may account for the many failures of the foreign varieties in this country. The severe cold of our winters in the north - ern states and our hot, dry summers are two extremes that they cannot stand up under. But the introduction of these plants here may have </seg>
            <seg id="p266">244 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL, SOCIETY awakened a taste for more thorough experiments in strawberry culture and by hybridizing them with other good varieties produced new ones of real value. In this country the first great advance in strawberry culture was when Mr. Hovey produced his seedling in 1834. This was a pistillate plant and the largest and best variety that had ever been produced here. Its appearance gave rise to a great deal of discussion about the sexuality of strawberry plants, a subject that I have no time to discuss. The Wilson strawberry originated with John Wilson of Albany, N. V., and was not known much before 1857 (the year I landed in Mitchell county, Iowa, on the first day of March). All horticulturists agree that the Wilson did more to advance the culture of strawberries than any varieties that have appeared since the Hovey. 1 might have men - tioned before this that when my father was ten years old (1815) there appeared a seedling of some variety of the Virginiana called Wilmot's Seedling. It had several other names in different localities of which he told me, but they have gone from ruy memory. These plants, how - ever, helped to build up the great strawberry column. The President Wilder originated with Mr. Wilder, Dorchester, Mass., in 1861 and was selected by him as the best result he had obtained from many thousand seedlings in thirty years' continual experimenting. It was considered a good berry in 1869. We all remember the Jessie, Sharpless, Haverland, Crescent, Ju - cund, Parker Earle, Triumph, DeLand, Bederwood, Warfleld, Enhance. Splendid, Wolverton, Bubach, Greenville, Bldwell, Captain Jack, and hundreds of others that could be named. The generations of the straw - berry are so short that nearly all the varieties I have named and a thousand of other kinds that were sold in the general market are now practically extinct. Their places are filled by a long list of modern plants of which you can read their names in our annual reports, the Dunlap generally taking the lead. A home market would be best if one could have it. It is, however, a well known fact that few strawberries are eaten in the neighborhood of where the largest crops are grown. Along the gulf coast they begin to ripen in February and at once they are shipped north over a vast territory as far north as 26 degrees north latitude. Hence the necessity of a variety that will bear shipping. The berries must be picked as soon as colored and some kinds before they are colored. About 50 degrees is the best temperature to keep the fruit. Very few people realize the extent to which strawberries are now cultivated. They are brought upon our markets by nearly a thousand trains of great modern fruit cars, thirty or more to the train, to supply our business centers with this luscious fruit. The greatest advance of all has been made in the last few years. I speak of the advent of the fall bearing varieties, which has extended the season from the time common strawberries begin to fruit through June, July, August, September, October up to the time of heavy frost. </seg>

            <seg id="p268">A WIDER MARKET FOR BERRY GROWERS 245 For the beginning of this race of plants we are indebted to Mr. Samuel Cooper of good old York state Seventeen years ago or in the fall of 1898 the first of this race of fall bearing varieties was found in a row of Bismarck strawberry plants set in the previous spring by Mr. Cooper. The plants he found had sixteen runner plants, all of which had ripe fruit, green fruit. blossoms and buds on in October. From these plants has developed the great race of plants known as everbearing or fall bearing straw - berry. There are now in existence more than a thousand different lave been developed by cross-fertilization and growing seedlings and judicious selection. Cooper produced Pan-American, Vutumn, "Superb, Onward, Forward, Advance and Peerless. Rockhill produced Progressive, Americus and others. The Gardner Nursery Company produced the Perpetual, Prince, Myrtle, 480, Danville, Milo, Improved Autumn. Helen, and a long list of other varieties bedded out in the fields for further trial. This fall twelve acres of plants set in he spring of 1915 produced 22,565 quarts of fine large, marketable jerries. During the season it was estimated that 5,000 quarts were polled by floods and violent storms. Those we shipped averaged 13 •■nts per pint. In our home market in Osage we kept the price at 15 :ents per quart the entire season until it froze up. As I have Mid fore, I think the new race of plants have come to stay and in a short time will take the lead of all other varieties. Seeds of this new race of strawberries germinating the first of May and transplanted the first week of July to the field, many of them bear fruit during September I October. I never knew common strawberries to bear fruit the first r from seed. This shows that a great change has been going on in the nature of he plant during these long years of cross-breeding and constant seleo- The only way to keep any variety true to name is to keep plant - the choicest plants and destroying all rogues as fast as they appear. This is easier said than done. If it is not done the variety will grad - ually disappear and soon you will not have a genuine plant of the kind you started with. This is true of all strawberry plants. Seedlings keep springing up here and there and soon take complete possession of the ground. During all these years there has been a steady increase in the size of the berries grown on the fall bearing plants. This season we bad thousands of them that run over four inches and a half and some went to five and three-quarters inches in circumference.—-(Ad - dress given before Iowa State Horticultural Society, Des Moines, Iowa.)

In the important raspberrv districts in the Puget Sound country 2.0in&gt; miles has hitherto been regarded as the most distant market to which berries rould be shipped, In practice this means that fresh Washington raspberries do not tome farther east than Minneapolis and that the surplus, if utilized at all must be canned. Government experiments, however, the results ol which are now published in Bulletin No. 274. indicate that with more careful methods of handling and shipping the Washington crop o; berries could be sold over a much wider ranee of territory. The most common causes of decay in berries while in trar after arrival on the market are mold fungi, usually gray mold o mold. Neither of these fungi is likely to injure firm, sound b but they spread quickly where the fruit has been injured in ha or is overripe and soft.

Several lots ol each kind were held in an i for varying periods and then examined for the percentage of Other lots were held a day after being withdrawn from the reft it: car and then examined.

The carefully handled fruit showe.l ml: 2.2 per cent decay, but with the commercially handled this percentag&lt; had risen to 26.7, or more than one-fourth of the entire shipment When the fruit was examined a day after it had been taken out of th&lt; ice car, the evidence was equally strong in favor of careful handling Carefully handled fruit that had remained four (lays in (he 'ar wai found a day after its withdrawal to show only 1 per cent of deca; against 17.5 per cent in commercially handled berries.

It was found, for example, that there was less decay in the carefully handled berries at the end of eight days than in the commercially handled berries at the end of four.

The difference between the carefully handled and the commercially tandled lots of berries consists chiefly in extra care in picking and in he scrupulous exclusion of any soft, overripe berries. Ordinarily the icking is done by unskilled labor, children being frequently employed n this way. It is, of course, extremely difficult to make them realize :he necessity for care, but the comparative success of certain growers n keeping down their losses shows that much improvement in this espect is possible. The most common injuries to the berries are due o their being broken and bruised while being removed from the )ushes or being mashed in the hand while picking. If the berries are pulled with three fingers instead of two, and pulled off straight instead wise, much loss can be avoided. Mher cause for decay is the inclusion in shipments of overripe *• rnes Because of the danger or injury in sorting it is not possible to he berries after they have once been picked and placed in the The pickers, therefore, must be instructed to pick only sound If the patches are picked over once a day it is much easier &lt;•(•■ this rule. If they are left unpicked two or three days there such a large proportion of overripe berries that some of them vitably find their way into the cups intended for long-distance nts. A soft berry will not only soon break down and decay but by offering an opportunity for mold to develop will con - to the decay of the entire cup. This point, the government say, can not be too strongly emphasized e best of care, however, the weather must remain a very actor in determining the success of shipments.

This ation purchased a canning factory some years ago which it is now operating as a co-operative enterprise. The cannery serves as a bal - ance wheel for the industry. When berries are too soft for shipping they can be used for canning purposes and a total loss is thus avoided. The real profits, however, must always come from the shipments of fresh berries, and for this reason, the demonstration of the fact that by careful handling shipments may be extended to practically twice the present territory, is regarded as of the utmost importance to the berry growing section.

I Mm. an The Hill System The hill system consists in growing the single plants in rows with all runners kept cut off and the entire strength of development diverted to the one plant. The single plants are set from twelve to eighteen inches in the row and the rows from two and one-half to three feet apart. By concentrating all the energy of the single plant in pro - ducing new crowns a larger, more vigorous root system and larger and more uniform fruit is produced. The total number of berries produced will not be as great as in other systems, but the percentage of large berries will be much the greater in the hill system. This is one of the best systems to use in growing a small patch for home use where space is limited, in which case the rows would be narrowed down to two feet or less. Single Hedge Him System. The single hedge row system is one where the single plants in the rows are allowed to form enough runners to form a continuous single row of plants and all other runners are removed. The plants are usually set out from twenty to thirty inches apart in the row and the rows same distance as in the hill system. Each mother plant is allowed to set two runners, one on either side, turned directly into the row. This system, next to the hill system, forms larger and more uniform crop of berries than any other. Like the hill system this system is best adapted to small patches or where labor is plentiful. Double Hedge Row System. In the double hedge row system the "mother" plant is allowed to set six runners. One is allowed to set. on either side directly in the </seg>

This really gives hree rows of plants, which develop into large strong plants, devoting H their energies to producing fruit instead of a lot of useless plants. Rows in this system should be spaced about three feet apart and plants rom two feet to thirty inches in the row, depending upon the variety. Where horse cultivation is practiced the distance between rows should be proportioned accordingly. After the six runner plants have set. then all other runners must be kept off. This system eliminates crowd - ing and gives each plant plenty of sunlight, air and plenty of space for root development and food. It is the ideal system to use where a larsp uniform crop of fancy fruit is wanted The Matted Rom System &gt;&gt;' matted row system is the one most commonly used. Less and time is required to grow berries under this system than any The plants are set in rows three and a half to four feet apart om twenty to thirty inches apart in the row. AH runners are 3( il to kiow and the plants spaced from six to eight inches apart. v plants are allowed to set at will and crowd much closer than The cultivator is the only implement used to narrow the row, set so as to plow up any runners that may set in the path, or between the rows. Usually the matted row is allowed to become wo feet wide, leaving balance of space for a path in which cul - 1 can be kept up as Ion:? as necessary in the summer. Practi- the commercial patches are grown under this svsteiii. The lhle with this system is allowing too many plants to set. This rank, heavy foliage when the season is one of excessive mois - the berries are as a consequence poorly colored, soft and poor On the other hand, when the season is dry, there being so plants, not enough moisture and food is available for each plant iperly develop its crop of fruit and the fruit soon becomes small nfit for market. If the matted row is to be used, it should be latted row. The row of plants should not be over eighteen ith and each plant spaced so it will be about six inches next one. All other runners should be cut off. The average r&lt; growing strawberries wants fruit and not plants and foliage, each plant room to develop properly and see that it has plenty of t food and moisture and it will do the rest. Any system needs lots pU ire to keep the plants growing as they should. Where help can be red easily and a fancy product can be marketed at good prices. the more intensive systems should be employed. When an th ordinary product is desired which will be sold in the ordinary way, hen the cheaper and easier methods of growing should be adopted. </seg>

Up until a few years ago, however, the proper way to treat them was not understood and the varieties had not been improved as they are today. Now they are a very profitable crop, being a constant source of increasing income from June until the snow flies. This is not all. Where is there a fruit more luscious or more desirable than big red strawberries. The little home garden is not complete without its bed of everbearing strawberries, so the family can be supplied from June to frost with this splendid fruit. Now lo not try to grow them as you do other strawberries: if you do you * ground 24 inches by 24 inches. This will give yc the hill system and next set your plants. Now get the Francis, a variety that is vigorous and lmrd&gt; the continuous bearing propensity much more pronounced man ar other everbearing varieties. The Francis is a large, fine u|&gt;i&gt;e;trin berry, very firm, an excellent shipper, of good strawberry flavor and an attraction on any market, commanding Rood prices during tl regular strawberry season and when other berries are yone, fane prices. Mr. W. F. Lindall. -a Michigan grower, realized $50u an aci from the Francis last season In growing this berry, in addition to what has already oeen said about their cultivation and manure, they should be cultivated well after growth starts in the spring, then the individual hills should be well mulched to conserve the moisture and keep the berries from be - coming sandy. The open rows between the hills should be cultivated through the entire season. One thousand two-hundred pounds of a commercial fertilizer an - alyzing 3 per cent nitrogen, 6 per cent phosphoric acid and 8 per cent potash should be applied per acre each year. It would be best to make [ail. These everbearing strawberries are heavy feeders. The plan know is only a machine, given to man in this natural order 01 t with which to convert plant food element* in the soil into fruit. for man's use, and if there is no plant food in the soil, the i&gt;hi powerless to produce any fruit.

From Fruit Belt I \ l-.KIth \i:i\&gt;. STRAWBEBIUES. By &lt;i. S. Christy, Johnson, Nebr. Everbearing strawberries have been sold by certain nurseries for uny years, but as these plants were the Frigaria elatior of Europe, the plants would not stand our climate and the purchaser soon found he had been "faked." When a real berry came out that would bear ? season, too many people believed there was something myste - or .supernatural about it and that the mysterious touch of a wizard was necessary to bring forth fruit. e many queer questions at the state fair prompts me to give a trawberry history, as my experience with the everbearers began »ith testing varieties for the originator before the plants were put on fce market. There are wild berries in England known to the student as Frigaria vesca. The delicious wild berry of the United States kno-.vn as Frigaria Virginiana and the big insipid wi!d berry of Chili, Frisaria Chiloensis. Horticulturists began trying to improve these as as the seventeenth century and have devoloped our many common ttw; Honey and Wilson in the last century making the most marked improvement. There is but one way to increase varieties of berries and that is by the seed. While varieties are perpetuated by runners, there can be no mixture of varieties from growing in the same bed any more than there is danger of a red pig turning black if fed with black pigs. To make a cross between plants or pigs requires sex. What Honey and Wilson were to the last century Rockhill and ooper are to the present, except that the latter have given their ttention to the everbearing plants by introducing the wild everbearing Frigaria elatior. Nothing more mysterious about it than there was in introducing the blood of the little fat China pig to make the easy fattening Poland-China hog. Knowing the plan of producing varieties and the nature of plants, it becomes easy to grow for specific purpose. HAKVESTIXft URAPKS. For home use or for making wine, grapes should not be picked </seg>
            <seg id="p275">252 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY until they are fully ripe. Many varieties become highly colored some days, or even weeks, before they are fully matured; but they are really ripe and in the best of condition for use until the stem of the bunch begins to shrivel or soften so that it can be easily bent. Even tor market the fruit should not be gathered until very nearly matured, as it ripens but little after being removed from the vine. The unripe fruit may soften somewhat on its way to market, but does not become sweeter or better flavored and will retain the excess of acid, which dis - appears when the grapes are ripened on the vines. Gathering grapes for market should be done onl\ in fair weather when the vines and fruit are not wet with either dew or rain. The stems should be cut with a knife or scissors, and the bunches should be laid in shallow wooden trays or baskets for carrying to the packing shed. Baskets holding five, eight or ten pounds with covers fastened hy wire hooks are the best packages in which to ship, as they an- inex - pensive, easily handled in transportation, and convenient and tempting to purchasers. The fruit should be allowed to lie a few hours so that the stems will become slightly wilted and all diseased, unripe an I bruised berries should be removed before packing begins. The knMhM should be placed in the baskets with the stems downward and packed snugly, the smaller bunches MM used to fill the spaces Mwm larger ones. The top of the fruit should be about one-hall an above the top of the basket, and should je level ami even, baskets should be so full that some pressure will oe needed to brin, cover into place, though the pressure should not be so great as to c the grapes or to break them from the stems. A basket which i. - packed closely will never carry the fruit in good condition, and w fruit is sold by weight, close packing is economical. The nan.e o variety as well as the name and address of the grower shoul stenciled on the tops of the covers before they are put in place. I or inferior fruit will seldom pay for shipping and will not add u good reputation of the grower Nearly all our grapes ripen in July and August while the weath. is still warm, and it is difficult to keep them any great length of tin: without placing in storage, which is expensive. They can be kept short time by wrapping each bunch in paper and keeping in a co. OJ place. Still better results will be secured by placing a layer of cotton batting in the bottom of a box, then a layer of fruit covered by another layer of batting. Not more than two layers of fruit should be placed in a box, and the upper layer should have a thick layer of cotton. Neither of these methods will be found profitable for market purposes but will often be desirable when a little fruit is to be kept for some special pur - pose. There is considerable difference in the keeping qualities of the different varieties, and in general the late keeping sorts will keep longer after being gathered than will those which ripen early in the season.— From "Growing Grapes In South."

Read the letter written by the Railway Commission to the railroads it-lative to the car peddling or retailing rule as issued by the railroads mentioned. The rule reads as follows: "Peddling or retailing of fruits, vegetables or other commodities from cars in the yards of the (company) will not be permitted." At the hearing on November 17 mony showed that cars were held in regular course of business )&gt;■ wholesale houses and large shippers for from ten to thirty days and he contents delivered direct from the car. It was a common practice or non-perishable products to be loaded on cars and held an indefinite ength of time waiting for better market conditions. That other com- nodities besides perishable products were delivered from car to con - umer. That the only people who desired or had asked for this rule he wholesale commission merchants and part of the retail ealers. They desired to regulate competition in the handling of fruits nd vegetables, with the regulation to be left to their discretion. No figures were given at the hearing relative to personal injury suits growing out of this class of traffic, if it may be differentiated from egular freight traffic. It was brought out that a shipper could ship a ar of fruit or vegetables to a town, have it set out at any point of side-track where unloading could be facilitated, take a sample and step just off the railroad right of way and sell his product from the sample to as many different people as he could and each person could go to the car and get their fruit in any quantity that they desired. The railroads would gain nothing by this rule and the shipper would be incon - venienced by occupation tax and other things that his competitors could devise. The consumer would pay the bill. This is not only a question of opening a market for the apple grower, but one of distribution of the products of the producer to the consumer. We are in a period of evolution in marketing the products of our farms. There are certain links in the chain of distribution that must be eliminated and others kept. Which one shall it be? Shall we say that all products must be handled through certain channels or will we say that we will leave all channels open and let competition eliminate the ones which reduce the price to the producer and adds to the consumer's cost. Co-operation among the producers and consumer is being consummated as fast as possible. Shall the producer or producers' organization deal direct with the consumers or consumers' organization? Study the letter over carefully and ask yourself the following questions and answers from our own observations: Are fruit and vegetable shippers serious </seg>
            <seg id="p277">254 offenders as compared with shippers of other commodities in holding cars and thus causing a shortage of cars during the year? Should this rule be enforced against the fruit and vegetable shipper and not against all shippers of other commodities? Is it more dangerous to unload a car direct where previous sales have been made or than where sales are direct from cars to same number of people? Lincoln, Nebr., Dec. 13, 191 Mr. Charles Lane, G. F. A., I'nion Pacific Railroad Company. Oman Nebraska Mr. H. H. Holcomb, G. F. A., C, B. &amp; Q. Railroad Company. Omaha Dear Sirs: The commission has carefully considered the rules and regulations published by you prohibiting the peddling or retailing of commodities from your cars in your yards. As at present advised, we have concluded that in the promulgation and publication of said rules you are actinc within your strict legal rights. The abrupt discontinuance of this privilege, which we understand has been granted shippers on your line for the past twenty or thirty years, has and will, we believe, curtail the distribution and consump - tion of certain staple food products, such as fruit and vegetables, to a marked degree. This condition will undoubtedly obtain until a better organization is effected as between producers on the one hand and consumers on the other, and greater co-operation and better sales methods developed on the part of local merchants. The information and data developed at hearings and conference with the commission demonstrate conclusively the fact that certain fruits and vegetables can be handled in bulk and distributed from your cars at a considerably lower cost than results when it is packed and distributed through warehouses or other agenc It likewise must be conceded that the lowering of the cost to the consumer has and will increase the consumption, has and will provide a market for certain grades of these commodities that otherwise would go to waste, and to that extent has and will increase the volume of your traffic. That the privilege of peddling from your cars has reduced the cost to the consumer, developed a market for the producer and increased the volume of traffic will not, we believe, be seriously ouestioned. We recognize, and it is admitted by the shippers, that the exercise of this privilege has — (1) Delayed the release of cars to an unreasonable extent: (2) Increased the risk of the carrier to personal injury suits; (3) Increased the switching costs to a degree that clearly dis - tinguishes it from the traffic in the same commodities handled in the usual way. The delay in the releasing of the cars is admittedly the serious </seg>
            <seg id="p278">255 cause for complaint on your part, and contributes directly to the in - creased liability for personal injury and to the increased switching costs. The present demurrage charges of $1 per day over the free time allowance have admittedly contributed to a marked degree to the delays in releasing cars. We believe that a greater charge for this privilege and possibly an ascending scale of detention charges for prolonged time of detention might alleviate if not cure the evils which you are trying to correct. The Interstate Commerce Commission has held that carriers may impose charges necessary to compel the removal of freight from the carriers' terminals and the prompt release of equipment, and has ap - proved so-called detention charges in addition to the regular demur- agi charge. Providence Fruit * Produce Exchange vs. M. C. R. R. o., 36 I. C. C. 307. The United States supreme court, in the case of the Great N. R. R. Co. vs. Minnesota, ex rel. R. &amp; W. Commission, 238 U.

This commission is authorized under the law to modify and sup - lement the demurrage rules and charges applicable to Nebraska, and in is order in the "Apple Rate Case," 6 N. R. C. Rep. 154, according the stopping in transit" privilege to finish loading or partly unloaded to shipments of apples, pears or peaches, said: "It is contended by the carriers that the allowance of this privilege will result in shippers holding cars, particularly .for the purposes of unloading, a considerable length of time, beyond the free time allow - ance of forty-eight hours, thereby contributing to a greater or less degree to car shortage during periods of heavy traflic movement, and that a greater rental or demurrage charge should be assessed when the stoppage in transit privilege is used, than the present demurrage charge of $1 per day. "If additional rental charges or demurrages were applied by car - riers to the other classes of traflic accorded the 'stoppage in transit' privilege, we would unhesitatingly apply the same to the traffic under consideration. "Further, our refusal to fix an additional charge at this time shall not be considered as final. If it shall appear that the exercise of this </seg>

Should your companies be disposed to continue the "peddling privilege" under different rules and charges than obtain at present the commission will be pleased to have you submit for its consideratior and approval any recommendations in the premises. Yours truly, HENRY CLARK, JR., Chairman 8TATH DKPARTMKXT OK FARM MAUKKTS IN IhVHO There are three distinct divisions in the Idaho law under which this state department of farm markets operates. In the first place there is the free state employment bureau, through which farmers desiring help, or farm laborers desiring work, are brought together without expense to either party. This part of the work has already proven its worth in the few months it has been in operation, filling a need that cannot be supplied properly in our territory at least by the federal department of labor or any other medium. The duties under the second division include the investigation c literature pertaining to colonization or settlement sent out of the stat by promoters, real estate dealers, or others, and the warning of hoim seekers against inaccurate or misleading statements. ;is we! prosecution of wron^-doers when evidence shows that a hoi has been taken advantage of in any way. Idaho, like other states, is suffering from the unfortunate promotion of a few y when many settlers, who were either unfitted for ng. or ■» through misrepresentation of conditions, came onto the land with in - sufficient funds. An important feature in this connection is the receiving direct from owners descriptions of farm property for sale and the maintaining of a properly classified list of such property for the inspection of prospective buyers Attractive holdings in various parts of the state can often be purchased at figures that remove the incentive for a settler going into undeveloped sections and taking up raw land. We ascertain the present occupation of our correspondent, whether he has had any previous farming experience, and, if so, how much and where, his preferences in the way of climatic conditions, acreage, type of farming, etc.; also the number of children in his family and the age of each, on account of the school and farm labor problem. With these and other facts we are better enabled to make of him a contented and prosperous, permonent settler. The third and principal division of the Idaho farm markets law is the one concerning the better distribution of farm products. This part of the work is, of course, the slowest to get fully under way.

Realizing the natural advantages of Idaho for dairying over most of the present leading dairy districts of the country, and the consequent future possibilities of the industry, seeing the chaotic conditions exist - ing at the time in most of the creameries and cheese factories of the state, the lack of uniformity of product, disorganized and wasteful net hods of marketing the product, etc., I have organized a butter and heese scoring organization, through which every factory in the state has an opportunity to know monthly how their product compares with that on the market, and through the council of the judges they are shown how to overcome faults. With a standardized, higher quality product a better market is assured; but, in addition to this movement to improve quality, the co-operative factories have been brought to - gether into an organization through which supplies are brought to - gether, markets being developed co-operatively, uniform methods of accounting being installed; such of the product as goes direct to the retail trade being sent out under the same brand for all the creameries, etc. Through this organization it is hoped to develop and put the dairy industry of the state on a firmer foundation. In addition to this work ic helping the factories already in operation, I have persistently kept on the trail of the unscrupulous creamery promoters who have been operating throughout the state, to prevent them from unloading on the farmers plants worth $2,500 for five to six thousand dollars. The de - partment has counselled with the farmers in dairy communities, help - ing them organize without the promoter, get better arranged and better equipped plants, and for half the cost. The crop and market reporting service instituted by the farm mar - kets department in Idaho is another instance of general rather than individual help. At potato digging time this fall it was found that the large, speculative buyers, who in years past have been getting the bulk of the state's potato tonnage at their own figures, were paying only 45 to 50 cents per hundred on the ground; that the government crop reports showed that there was a big overproduction of potatoes through - out the United States this year, that even Idaho had a far bigger crop this year than last, and that over 50 cents per hundred could be ex - pected this year. Seeing that the growers over our state were being made the victims of a government crop-reporting system that was worse than worthless, in that the early and late potato crops were lumped together in their statistics, and that while the southern crop of early potatoes had been large, the northern crop of early potatoes, on the other hand, was way below last year — and the only potatoes affect - ing the Idaho crop, the early potatoes long since having been consumed — I immediately advised the growers over the state, through the press and through circulars distributed throughout the potato-growing dis- 9 </seg>
            <seg id="p281">258 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY tricts, under no circumstances to sell at present prices, not to be less than last year, that my advices even from Idaho showed at least a 30 per cent less tonnage than the government bureau of statistics was crediting our state with, that potatoes were worth at least 80 cent* per hundred at the time, and not to sell until they could get that price. Within two weeks from the time the true crop situation was placed before our growers the buyers were offerinc the growers 20 to 3&lt;&gt; cents more for their potatoes than they had just two weeks previous told them they could expect for the season. And the price is still Koint up, getting closer to the dollar mark every day. What is true of potatoes is true of other crops as well- -and the work has hardly begun. But the possibilities for help in the dissemina - tion of honest crop and market information are simply enormous — and what is being accomplished in Idaho ran be duplicated in any other state. — (Address delivered at Chicago before National Confereii. Marketing. ) THK ADVANTAGES OF A HitAM&gt;. The practice of labeling or branding fruit and vegetable paal is a point worthy of some consideration. A great many growers fail to grasp the importance of this feature, particularly with reference to the sale of their produce each successive year. They seem to hesitate abo.it the small addition, and do not consider that the money spent in this way will result in a quicker and more profitable sale of their products during the coming seasons. It has been only within recent years that t growers have made any attempt at marking their fruits and vegetabl-s before placing them on the market. In practically every other branch of industry producers have marked their goods with some label, brand. or trade-mark to distinguish them from the productions of others. Th^ sale of these products is greatly influenced by this distinction The man who puts up an honest pack of first-class fruits or tables in uniform, well constructed packages need never fear that the money spent for attractive labels will be wasted. For instance, .i grower, after carefully grading and packing his produce, puts his label on each package, they go to market, are exposed for sale, a buyer purchases them and upon examining the contents finds he has received full value for his money. He immediately looks to see where the product came from and by whom packed. The next time he has to purchase this same product, whether the same season or the next, he looks for this brand. Thus the label has accomplished two purposes: It has been a guarantee and has served as a means of advertising. There are two styles of labels used in marketing fruit and vege - table packages, the ordinary stencil or stamp, and the one printed on paper to be pasted on the package. The former usually has the name &amp;the variety contained, where, and by whom grown. The latter, in lition to this, may be made up in colors and have a picture of the </seg>

By Kfverely T. (i«ll««»y, Dean of the New York State College of Agriculture. * Paper delivered January 27 at the meeting of the Western New- York Horticultural Society at Rochester, N. Y.) For a number of years it has seemed evident to those whose buai- MM it is to study, weigh and give heed to the changes taking place in the production of crops, and the bringing of these crops from the pro - ducer to the consumer, that we were approaching a new phase of development and that careful attention must be given to this phase tf agriculture is to prosper. We have parsed the pioneer stage; we have pretty nearly tilled up the vacant places: we have expanded until we are touching elbows in many places with our neighbors, and in a good any instances we are actually crowding them. All this is merely another way of saying that we have entered on a phase of keen competition, and that competition has extended and is continuing to extend beyond state lines and beyond national lines. It has become world-wide. Now comes a cataclysm of war, and after a year and a half of this unprecedented conflict^ we can see that it is introducing other factors to which, as sober-nunde«i men, we must give heed. The industry for which this society stands, and to which it has given its best efforts for so many years, is one that will prosper in direct proportion to the surplus capital available over and above what is required for what may be called the necessaries of life. In the world of business, capital is like water, constantly seeking a level. It may be temporarily held in a place or country under certain artificial restric - tions, but eventually it will flow out and seek a level. Prior to the war there had been an accumulation of capital, an accumulation to the extent that there was a comfortable feeling that some of it could be expended for things that, while not absolutely essential, were nererthe- </seg>
            <seg id="p284">260 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY Ies8 good things to have. But tor nearly seven hundred days, now, and no one can tell how much longer, the world has been getting rid of this surplus capital or wealth at the rate of something like thirty to forty million dollars a day. America is in the somewhat paradoxical posi - tion of forming a part of the world and yet accumulating some of the capital that the world is destroying It may be true that when the war is over we shall have a new crop ot millionaires, but even so. this does not alter the situation in so far as the total capital is concerned, and as someone has recently said, "there will be very little new furni - ture on the stage of the world for a considerable time. If then- is much difference in the roads and railways, and in shipping, it will he for the worse. Architecture, domestic equipment and so on will In - unfortunate if in 1930 they stand where they did in the spring of 1914. On the battlefields of Europe and the adjacent countries are bein? expended the comfort?, luxuries and progress of the next century." Is it not true that we are already beginning to feel the pinch of this situation, so far as the production and marketing of fruit and other similar commodities are concerned? What is the meaning of the fact that for the past two years the staple products, like wheat, corn, oats and even cotton, are finding ready markets and are commanding good prices, while special crops, like fruit, certain types of vegetable.--, and flowers, are moving with extreme slowness and, in soim instances, at least, are virtually stagnant. There probably never has been ■ period in the last quarter of a century when the florist busines.- \&gt; dull as it is today. It is at its lowest ebb. Flowers are a luxury and would naturally be one of the first crops to feel the effects here noted The more specialized vegetable crops would be next, and fruit would follow. War may not be the only factor involved in thi on. du it is playing a part, along with the psychological state ol the publi mind, which for want of a better expression we put down as lark o confidence. So that if there was need, prior to the world s conflagration, tor those engaged in the fruit industry to most seriously receive, weigh an-.i act upon the many suggestions and recommendations laid before this body and other bodies of a similar nature for meeting the new and changing economic conditions, there is double need for it now. In the last analysis, the future prosperity of this country will, in a large measure, depend upon the efficient production of commodities ibat we may in an efficient manner exchange for other commodities. For the next ten years, and perhaps for the next twenty years, the commodities in most demand will be those which the world most seriously needs, both in the way of agricultural commodities and manu - factured commodities. So that it would seem reasonable to look for - ward to a period of expansion and growth in the production of staple crops, and the contrary for those crops, such as perishable fruits, which do not come under this category. This Is the general situation as we see it, affecting more or less the </seg>
            <seg id="p285">DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING OF FRUIT 261 entire fruit industry, but naturally affecting some types of branches more than others. Then there must be considered certain very funda - mental matters which in a sense are local, but local only 80 far as we view the situation with the United States and its immediately outlying dependencies as the field. I might use the citrus fruit industry to illus - trate the point in mind. This industry, as we all know, is growing with tremendous strides. It will continue to grow. The majority of those in it and of it are developing to a degree the power of coordination, and the ability to develop and apply the highest methods of. efficiency to every phase of the work. Compared with other fruit industries, the production, distribution and marketing of citrus fruits is as the well - drilled, coordinated army corps is to the uncoordinated, undrilled, in - efficient, raw militia. An aggressive unit of this nature is out to dis- iose of its products. With its standard and guaranteed brands, now jractically having the sanction of the federal food Jaw, thus in effect inn; I'nited States brands; with its elaborate unified system of iting. parking, storing and marketing; with its corps of iidvwn- tigaiive and informational agencies, it must be reckoned with ionsiderin&lt;; the economics of other fruit production and fruit mar - keting, no matter where found. The activities of this organization would seem to have particular significance to New York fruit grower*. ially to New York apple growers, for there is rapidly develop- situation where the orange, with what is behind it, can hold the price of the apple on off years, when they would naturally be high, to the level of normal years, when prices are not very much above the cost of production. This means that the years of good profits in apple crowing will become fewer, as prices tend to become stabilized by the presence of another fruit, which, to judge by the manner in which it is presented to us and pictured for us. has all the advantages in its favor. We have now developed our thesis to a point where we may sum - marize by saying that the problems in the marketing and distribution of fruit, hitherto complicated and involved, have become almost in - finitely more intricate by a world-wide economic upheaval, which we must face and appraise at its full value, then act according to the light that is given us. What shall this action be? What are we going to do about it? What kind of a program shall we propose to meet the situation? For it is truly a situation, and not a theory. First, we must have a tre - mendous amount of education. We already have considerable. We need a vast amount more, and we need it so seriously that I do not see that there is any occasion for quibbling over the fine points, so long as we a-e creating a state of mind. What we need first is a state of mind. We can get this by continually hammering away at the essentials to be done. We can get it by revival meetings. We can get it by state - wide auction sales. We can get it in many other ways, not to mention the way we usually do get it, and that is by being starved into it or frightened into it, as the case may be. But let us seriously ask our- </seg>
            <seg id="p286">262 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY •elves the question whether there 1b any real necessity for permitting ourselves to sink all the way to the bottom before we can be brought to realize that there is a way to the top. Experience is against us in this respect, but nevertheless we should continue to put forth our best efforts in the direction of brinignig men together voluntarily rather than through fear or some form of centralized control. So that we must continue for a good many years to exert every influence and to en - courage proper activities to the end of creating a state of mind. Our difficulties now are not so much of a business nature as they are of a moral or ethical nature, and these can be met only by a spread of knowledge of the right sort. But you may very properly be saying at this time that I am dealing with generalities; that I am advancing the same kind of general state - ments that have been advanced a sreat many times before, and you may follow this up with the query as to whether there is not something concrete or specific that can be offered. There are some very practical problems in regard to fruit storage and transportation in their relation to marketing, standardization of grades, market surveys, a market news service, utilization of surplus fruit products, advertising, collective effort in packing and grading, collective effort in transportation, the centralized packing bouse, etc. I question whether much could be accomplished by bringing here a spe - cific account of some particular piece of work at some particular place along the lines indicated. Because such a specific piece of work had been successfully done in one place would not necessarily mean that it could be successfully done in another place. The complicated and widely varying conditions that generally make themselves manifest in any of those economic questions must govern the application of any such procedure or methods as are followed in the spraying of crops, the drainage of the soil, and even the application and use of fertilizers As we view the situation, however, it appears that there are certain things to be done, and that these may be formulated into a program of work. It has been my experience in matters of this kind that we begin to make real progress when we can program our field of action. If our own minds are not clearly organized, we cannot expect those whom we are trying to serve to profit much from any action that may be proposed Let us, therefore, attempt to outline a program, not with the expec - tation that this program is to be put into effect all at once, but as something that may be looked forward to as at least a beginning in a very complicated field. When the question of the federal government's participation in the marketing problems was first under consideration, all kinds of propositions were submitted. It would have been very easy at that time to have encouraged a movement which would have resulted probably in placing in the hands of the government officials a million dollars to do things which a great many people thought the government ought to do, but which in reality the people themselves must do. Fortunately, this difficulty was avoided, and the government </seg>
            <seg id="p287">DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING OF FRUIT 263 embarked on a safe and sane policy of action which it would well profit some of the states to study before point; too deeply into the socialistic field. As a tirsi requisite in our program, there should be a state-sup - ported organization, one of whose functions it would be to aid the fruit growers: 1st. In the discovery and bringing together of comparatively email groups of men with a common motive and a common purpose. 2d. In guiding and directing these groups, through demonstrations and experiments in the matter of better productions, stabilization of production, standardization of products, development of special brands, protection of brands, advertising of brands, centralized packing, and centralized markets. 3d. The discovery and bringing together or federating of effective, efficient, and properly educated small groups, with common interests and a common purpose, with large working units, and to look after, stay with, and stand by these units, as long as service may be required. 4th. The organization of market surveys to ascertain the potential possibilities of production and the potential possibilities of consump - tion. This work should also include a corps of official crop advisers, whose duty it would be to keep in touch with market conditions and market needs, also in touch with organized units and the federated units engaged in production, packing and marketing. 5th. The study, investigation and demonstration of the practi - cability of consumers' selling agencies in large centers of population, and the articulation of this work with the small packing units an&gt;i the federated packing units. 6th. The study and development of a market news service &lt;n co - operation with transportation companies, selling agencies and produ - cing units, this service to be federated with similar services in other states, and a federal market news service. 7th. The study, investigation and demonstration of improved methods of financing co-operative organizations, both as small units and as federated groups. 8th. The study, investigation and reporting upon the legal ques - tions involved in collective efforts in the marketing of products, to the end that organization may be effected and conducted in accordance with the best interests of public policy. A few words of comment now in order to make our meaning plain. First, let it be understood that the program outlined is one of evolu - tion. It does not propose to do the things for the people that they should do for themselves. It does plan to get the facts, assemble those facts, and see that they are applied through demonstrations in such form that they will leave a permanent record. Lecturers, talks, preach - ments and such things will have no important place in this program. I am outlining here nothing especially new. It is practically the pro - gram that was inaugurated twelve years ago in California, which has </seg>
            <seg id="p288">264 evolved into the biggest and most successful marketing organization of its kind in the world, the California Fruit Growers' Exchange. The only difference is that in California work the federal government was the agent that acted as the director of an evolutionary movement, and it was fortunate in securing the leadership of a genius in the ahape of G. Harold Powell. The fact that Mr. Powell, with all the forces of the government behind him, brought his work to a point where it could stand without the government behind him is, in my opinion, Ms greatest achievement. So that the success of whatever is undertaken along this line must, in the last analysis, be measured by the ability of those helped to eventually stand alone The country is strewn with wrecks of organizations that were lean- ers from the beginning, stayed leaners to the end, and then toppled over when the supporting prop was removed It will be noticed that we start with a study of small groups w it h common interests and a common purpose. There are already many such groups, and there are agencies at work helping them. I refer more especially to the farm bureaus. These bureaus may very prop erly become clearing houses through which the experts of the state marketing service may eventually operate. The farm bureau might very properly form the nucleus around which would enter the demon - stration work in organized packing, grading, branding, advertising and marketing. Through these farm bureaus could also be disseminate the information and help that could come from the market surveys, tht market news service, the financing of collective effort and broad* questions involved. Such a state organization as here outlined must necessarily have other functions than those of aiding the product: fruit. The critical questions, however, lie with the perishable product and such other products as milk, poultry and eggs. A state-support marketing organization, call it what you please, would find itself ful occupied for a number of years with the products named and, in opinion, would make more real progress by limiting itself to certa definite things for a time until the more important principles are estab lished. Based upon plans made and put into effect by the feders government, I should estimate the expense of such an organization as here outlined to be for the starting and minimum figure $5i"&gt;,ono an - nually, with a maximum cost, say at the end of five years, of $100,000 annually. As a second part of this program, there should be systematic work organized and carried through by the college of agriculture with the following objects in view : 1. General courses for all classes ot' students, designed to develop social preparedness and social consciousness of working together and living together. 2. Special courses designed for the training of leaders capable of acting as managers and directors of organized interests and federated units, capable of conducting and directing investigative and domon- </seg>
            <seg id="p289">265 strative work in marketing and distribution, which may be undertaken by the nation or state, capable of taking charge of and directing pro - ducers' selling agencies in the large centers of production. The mini - mum cost of this work would likely be about $10,000 per annum, with the maximum amount not exceeding $25,000 per annum. As a third and last feature of the program we would advocate a oncerted movement on the part of all those societies, associatioas and other organizations in the state interested in the production, marketing and distribution of the more perishable products, to the end of securing the help required to advance the vast interests involved, and to tbe further end, through educational movements, of broadening the view - point and vision of both producers and consumers. This might be best effected by conferences of representatives from the various societies, associations and other agencies involved, where a definite program of action could be decided upon. Such conferences might very properly be railed by the state Department of Agriculture. Summarizing, we submit the thesis: That we are entering ipon a new and important phase in the economies of fruit production, fruit marketing, and fruit distribution. That we must recognize and act upon the broad questions and issues involved. That we must come to an agreement as to a program of work whereby the state, co-operating with other states and the federal government, will, through evolution - ary procedure and methods, render such aid as will enable the people to aid themselves. That all history and all experience show that per - manency and success in organized effort come only through forces operating from within. That the state has a vital function to perform. That the people have vital functions to perform, and that a program is submitted denning these functions.— From Fruit and Produce Marketer. MAKKKT1NG FRUIT. By A. F. ('oilman. Corning, Iowa. This paper is not prepared for the commercial fruit grower. To him marketing fruit is a profession. He has or must study hi? pro - fession to succeed.

He must market in small clean boxes to suit the wants of his customers for city trade demands the best and is willing to pay for it. He must make three grades and learn now to graue and never put No. 2's in a No. 1 package. Good fruit never looks good in a dirty package. Never cater to the slum trade. They usually barter on the price, want to buy on time and are never ready to pay The modern way to market fruit is in neat 'lean boxes. Aiwa -s live the golden rule in business. Follow these suggestions and you can always grow and market fruit in Iowa. — (Paper delivered before Iowa State Horticultural Society, December 7. 8, !&gt;, 1915.) We have heard and read much in recent years regarding co-opera - tion in marketing fruit. There is another field for co-operation that has been neglected. I refer to the field of production and wish to offer a few suggestions as to the opportunities tor co-operation that may hf taken advantage of in this line. In these days of inflated prices or speculative values that have been attached to real estate, it becomes almost impossible for a man without capital to make a successful start in the fruit growing industry. Here is a field in which the man with suitable experience in growing will do well to join hands with a man with the needed capital in the successful prosecution of this industry. We have a number of young men, most of whom are graduates of our agricultural and horticultural schools, who have tried out this plan of co-operation with marked success. In a few instances these students who have the advantage of some capital with a good supply of courage have made cash leases of various orchards and are "making good" at their job. These cash leases, whirh can be secured for a term of three years and upward, are, in my judgment, preferable to leasing an orchard on the shares. Good judgment is required to enable the parties interested to determine upon an equitable price for the lease of a given orchard. The conditions of soil and trees, their age, bearing habits, varieties, nearness to market, etc., must be carefully considered. A hundred-acre orchard near Lincoln was leased a number of jears ago by an experienced grower for a terir of five years for a price Cf |7 per acre per annum. This lease was renewed at the end of the first term for another three years on the same terms, which fact indicates a satisfactory deal for both parties. I know of other leases being made la the orchard districts of the southeast corner or our state, where the ■oil conditions make the orchard more valuable, for which the lessee pays from |10 to |15 per acre yearly. &lt; O-OI'KRATION IN &lt;;itO\VIN&lt;; FltUT.

            <seg id="p291">267 O-OPERATION IN GROWING FRUIT performs all needed pruning, spraying and cultnuiion T and in most cases furnishes his own teams and tools. Many farm orchards that have suffered serious neglect perhaps have never been pruned or sprayed systematically have by means of these leases made to experienced growers and professional students of horticulture been redeemed from destruction and brought into profitable bearing. An - other form of co-operation that is being tried out near our capital city is the union of capital and experience in the form of organized stock companies. Seven years ago next spring I began the development of a forn-acre tract of unimproved land, converting it from a cornfield and prairie into a general fruit farm. There were six or us that formed the company, incorporating under the name of "Suncrest Fruit Farm." The capital stock was placed at $8,000, divided into Shares Of $100 eacn, the various stockholders owning from five to fifteen shares euch. My fifteen shares were secured in return for a certain acreage of fruit stock furnished and planted. A contract was made also by which I waa to »iock and plant the balance of the tract and rare for the same tor a term of three years. The first cost of the land was 1100 per acre, the present valuation is placed at 1250 per acre. For the past three seasons the proceeds from sale of fruit have been from $2,000 to 12,500 each season. The planting consists of eighteen acres in vineyard, fifteen acres in cherries, with intermediate spaces planted to blackberries, currants and strawberries. The remainder of the tract was planted to apple, f ;ach, plum and pear. For the past three years we have had a man and family living on the place to whom we have entrusted the full care and management the past season. This man, by the way, came to us from Nampa. Idaho, where he had spent four years of fruitless toil and sev - eral thousand dollars in a vain effort to develop a fruit ranch. Our contract with the manager this year was made on the share basis, he receiving three-fifths of the gross receipts and returning the other two-fifths to the company. The company furnishes team, tools, sprayer, house and needed buildings. The manager pays for all labor of cultivation, harvesting and marketing and the purchase of fruit packages. More liberal terms for the manager must be made another season. We find the items of labor and fruit packages are too large a factor of expense for the manager to bear alone. A two-thirds share to the manager, from which he is to bear all expense of labor and two-thirds the cost of all fruit packages, will be the basis of our contract for another year. The net returns to the company the past year has earned a dividend of six or seven per cent to the stockholders. While the returns have been slow and below the expectations of the early dreams of most of the stockholders, we have good hopes for larger returns from year to year or until the full development stage is reached. Five years ago another stock company was organized for the purchase and develop- </seg>

These two horticultural enterprises by stock companies are good samples of the opportunities afforded for the co-operation of capital and talent in developing the fruit industry. — (Address delivered before annual meet - ing of Southwestern Iowa Horticultural Society.) ADVICK ABOIT APPL.K GROWING AM) NKI.MNf. By Waldo (;. Paim- No doubt you who are engaged in the fruit business have had the doubtful pleasure of listening to a great many statements containing panaceas for the ills of the apple industry. Some have been of value, others have not. But all have their indeterminate effect in arousing jwblic interest in the vital questions that now confront us. I take it we are all agreed that perfection has not been attained in the apple business. That is as it should be, for once we allow our - selves to drift into that easy state of entire satisfaction, just that moment will we start going backwards. For in this age of changing conditions and methods there is no middle ground, no standing still — relatively speaking. The minute we stand still, that minute we fall behind, for the others will be forging ahead. But I do not wish to be misunderstood in my position — I am not an alarmist. I am merely seeking light in the solving of certain vexing ■problems. I am as firmly convinced of the substantial and wholesome future of the apple business as I am convinced of the present favorable status of the wheat business. There is nothing inherently wrong with the apple industry; there are merely a few problems of more or less intricacy which must be solved, and which surely will be solved, before .the industry will go ahead to the extent it deserves. Out of the mass of things written and spoken on the problems o tlie industry two things stand out pre-eminently important. These are First — Necessity for co-operation on a large scale in marketing Second — Imperative action is demanded to eliminate waste of poorer grades of fruit. Each of these has wonderful possibilities. Together they embrace minor problems of the industry. Their solution demands the imme - diate and intelligent consideration and determined action of the best minds in the Pacific northwest. The ramifications of the benefit derived are too numerous, and I shall not dwell on these. There Is no question that the apple is eminently qualified to take its place as the world's fruit. The fact that it can be eaten just as it etmes from the trees and can be cooked in so many appetizing ways gives it a decided advantage.

There were one-fourth less bearing apple trees in 1914 than in 1900, 151,323,000 in 1910 as compared with 201,794,000 in 1900. But the decrease is not so bad when you consider that there were nearly 66,000.000 trees not in bearing when the census was taken. Many of these will never reach bearing age. The old trees are &lt;lying fast, the mortality in ten years being about 25 per cent. So, in spite of the heavy planting, we are not holding our own in production, considering the increase in population and the greatly increased and more nearly universal demand. But before the apple can gain gain the recognition which comes only trorn universal use it must be placed in the hands of the consumer at a price within reach. This is not a question of selling a few thousand car-loads of fancy apples at equally fancy prices. It demand! the producing and selling of vast numbers of car-loads at prices within reach of all. Now we come directly within the field of the first problem I mentioned a few moments ago, the necessity of co-operation on a large scale in the marketing of the crop. In this country of ours we have the soil and the conditions neces - sary to raise apples of the finest quality in every particular. But with - out an effective means of getting them to the people who demand them, they are in the same position as diamonds on an uninhabited desert isle. The diamonds, to have economic value, must be taken to some place where there is a demand for them — From Green's Fruit Grower. CO-OPKKATIVE ASSOCIATIONS. It is possible for growers to sell either individually as independent producers or collectively as members of a co-operative association. In either their individual or collective capacities producers may sell direct to the consumer or through existing marketing agencies, popularly termed "distributors" or "middlemen." Attention is called to the fact that the producers are the primary distributors and that to the extent of their intelligent, effective control over the distribution of their products are they successful in the busi - ness side of agriculture. The average farmer has not been alive to the problems attendant upon the distribution of his products, and. in con - sequence, has left the middleman to perform a service which as a pro - ducer he might have performed for himself. Out of real necessity farmers' co-operative associations have been created, and the development of this movement is being increased and Improved constantly to meet the growing demands for better service. Co-operative marketing associations are producers' organiza - tions which are organized for the purpose of grading, packing, shipping and selling products grown by members of the association. The association takes charge of commodities either at the packing </seg>
            <seg id="p294">270 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY shed or at the shipping station, according to the contracts with men bers or the custom in the particular community, and usually has full charge of the produce in all sales transactions. Many association'- sell subject to the confirmation of the srowor, but in other instances the grower allows the association to take entire charge of the shipment. It is customary in the sale of citrus and deciduous fruits to pool the returns for definite periods, varying from a day, week, or month to the whole season. Pooling means that the returns from all sales bv the association within a given period are combined. The returns from each variety and grade are separated, and divided among the members a( cording to the amount, variety, and grade shipped during this period by each grower. Where the product of the association is of standard pack and grade, the method is fair to all concerned Some associations make substantial advances to growers either for planting expenses or as an advance on expected returns at the time of shipment, ranging in some cases from 50 to 75 per cent of the ex pected selling price. Most well-established associations sell direct to the wholesale trade or Ihrouph salaried representatives or private brokers who are situated in the principal market centers of the country and who, in addition to actually selling the products of the association, keep the central office well informed as to market conditions and pros - pects. The representatives or brokers in many cases represent the association upon the auction, which is used sometimes in special lines. Some shipments are consigned, although this practice is uncommon with associations in the west, and is being eliminated gradu nearly all organizations The charges for cost of selling range from 2 to lo per ct selling price, the usual charge being 5 per cent. In 1913 th selling cost of boxed apples by all of the associations in the Pacific northwest was 7 per cent. This included an assessment for advertising. The usual practice is for the association to announce a certain tax per box or unit to cover the expected selling and other costs. After the sales are made this amount, together with other deductions, such as advances made to growers, is subtracted from the gross proceeds and the balance returned to the growers Co-operative organization is more highly developed in the west than elsewhere in the United States. More than 50 per cent of the apples and other deciduous fruits of the northwest and middle Rockies and the larger portion of California fruits are distributed and marketed by co - operative organizations of the growers. In the middle western, south - ern, and eastern states many special products, such as strawberries, peaches, apples, grapes, onions, potatoes and other vegetables, are dis - tributed co-operatively in a large way. There are individual organiza - tions that do an annual business in the millions, and it is estimated that the farmers' associations of the United States will transact more than $1,000,000,000 worth of business in 1915. — From Bulletin No. 266, Office of Markets, United States Department of Agriculture </seg>

Such treament is, on the whole, profitable, but has several limita - ions which should be clearly recognized to prevent disappointment, tccording to the specialists of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. rhe object of disinfecting seed potatoes is to destroy the germs of scab md other surface parasites which might otherwise be planted with the eed and infect the new crop. Only surface infections are reached by his method. It is only partially effective against deep pits of common icab. Formaldehyde is less effective than corrosive sublimate against he black sclerotia or resting bodies of Rhizoctonia, or russet scab, and igainst powdery scab. Neither chemical, as ordinarily used, will de - 'troy silver scurf. Either one will kill surface infections of black-leg, neither will reach the internal infections common in tubers from k-leg hills. Neither fusarium wilt nor late blight infection in potato ubers can be reached by any seed treatment, nor can any of the non - larasitie diseases of potatoes, such as mosaic, leaf roll and curly dwarf. prevented. (See Farmers' Bulletin 544 for descriptions of these roublei Clearly, therefore, the most important precaution against these iiseases is to select clean, disease-free seed potatoes from healthy, rigorous plants, as determined by field inspection during the growing &lt;eason and at harvest. Seed treatment should then be applied as an additional precaution. It will not be effective, however, if the soil where the potatoes are to be planted is already full of disease. Soil Conditions) ami Potato Diseases. Soil conditions have an important relation to potato tuber diseases, and many of these are widely spread throughout the country, perhaps native to some soils. Common scab is favored by a neutral or slightly alkaline soil, and seldom gives trouble in acid soils. It is, therefore, increased by liming and by fresh stable manure, wood ashes, and alkaline fertilizers, such as nitrate of soda and ground bone, while acid phosphate and sulphate of ammonia tend to diminish scab. Rhizoctonia occurs to some extent in nearly all soils, but appears to attack potatoes most when the conditions are unfavorable to the best development of the potato plant. Bring the land to an ideal state of tilth to minimize loss from Rhizoctonia. Powdery scab is worst on cold, wet or poorly drained soils. Black - leg, on the other hand, is carried by infected seed. No potatoes show - ing a deep brown discoloration at the stem end should be planted. DiSINFK&lt; T1ON OF SKEIJ POTATOK.S. </seg>

It is not a substitute for corrosive sublimate or formaldehyde, but is a good drier for rut seed. Applied to scab infected soils at the rate of 500 pounds per acre it reduces scab, but such heavy applications cannot be generally recom - mended as profitable. Preliminary experimental trials are a&lt;h How to Disinfect See«l. The formaldehyde treatment consists in soaking the potatoes, before cutting, for two hours in a solution made by adding one pint of for - maldehyde to thirty gallons of water. The solution can be used re - peatedly. The gas treatment is no longer recommended. Corrosive sublimate is used at the rate of 1 to 1000 for one and a half to two hours. Dissolve two ounces of the salt in hot water and dilute to fifteen gallons. This is a deadly poison. Use with great care. It must also be kept in wood, porcelain or glass vessels as it attacks metal. It is more effective than formaldehyde, particularly au-ainst Rhizoctonia and powdery scab. Do not use the same solution more than three times as the strength diminishes with each lot of potatoes soaked. To treat large quantities, set several barrels on a slightly elevated platform. Fit a plug in a hole in the bottom of each barrel, nil with potatoes, cover with solution, let stand two hours, draw off solution and pour into another barrel. Increase the number of barrels in proportion to the quantity to be treated. Another method is to use a large wooden vat or trough, into which the potatoes in sacks are lowered by a rope and pulley, and later hauled out. drained and dried on slatted racks. Seed potatoes may be treated several weeks before planting, pro vided they are not reinfected by storing in old containers or storage bins. Sprouted potatoes are injured by treatment, but will throw out new sprouts. In general, however, potatoes will not be injured by following the above directions. Many growers believe germination is improved by treatment. — U. S. Department of Agriculture. Americans should eat more greens than they do at all seasons of the year, in the opinion of J. S. Gardner of the Missouri Agricultural Experiment Station, because they are palatable and help to keep one in good physical condition. In the spring many people eat a few meals of the old standby leaf crops, such as spinach, lettuce, and dandelion, and then forget that these or similar crops should be grown and eaten throughout the summer and canned for winter use. When warmer weather makes the spring crops woody or bitter, the tops of cabbage and beets may be used, and still later chard or New (&gt;KOW &lt;;.\KI&gt;K\ GREENS. </seg>

They should be tarted early in the spring, usually about the time early cabbage is set nit Chard is sown at the rate of one or two seeds per inch in drills at least eighteen inches apart and when the plants begin to crowd they are gradually thinned out so that they finally stand six inches apart. The plants so removed are cooked and used much as spinach is. The leaves of those that are left to reach a larger size may be cooked in the same way and the stems may be creamed and served as asparagus is. The leaves and stems may be canned either together or separately, aa greens are needed even more in winter than in summer to vary the restricted diet. In ordering seed no mistake will be made in specifying "Lucullus," which has proved a very good variety. New Zealand spinach is unlike the ordinary early spinach in the manner of growth and the appearance of the leaves. It is a large branched plant with leafy side shoots which are pulled and used like those of the ordinary spinach, which is a squatty, rosette-like plant. New Zealand spinach should be thinned to stand twelve inches apart in rows at least two feet apart; three or even four feet will be better, especially in rich soil. If the narrower spacing is used the plants mast be trained in windrows as sweet potato vines sometimes are. If the plants grow too rapidly, the tops may be canned about as ordinary spinach is. The foliage should not be allowed to accumulate too much or stay too long on the plants, for the more greens that are removed the more succulent tops there will be, and with the proper manage - ment the plants will thrive and produce a great deal of food until frost In selecting and preparing the soil for these "greens" see to it that too thin a soil is not picked out and that there is plenty of well-rotted manure worked into it, both for the sake of the plant food and be - cause it will enable the soil to hold water and withstand drought. — College of Agriculture, Columbia, Mo. HND1XG THE BEST POTATO VARIETIES BY TEST. By Charles L. Todd, Oswego County, New York. When I first became interested in growing potatoes and realized that I had soil and climate here naturally adapted to them, one of the first questions I undertook to settle was what are the best varieties; and as I felt that I could settle on nothing definite by studying bulletins, catalogs, etc., I undertook the samewhat costly and slow, but more sure, process of buying and testing varieties for myself. I have bought and tested almost every American variety offered for sale by seedsmen and growers in the past decade, having over one hundrd varieties under test in a season. </seg>
            <seg id="p299">274 I Such testing requires careful, accurate work to keep all varieties perly labeled, both at planting and in storing, and for many varie - requires more than one season. The poorer varieties can usually be inguished and dropped out at one season's trial, but it is sometimes d to decide among several of the best varieties and requires two. ;e or more years to find the best or to find if you have bought the le varieties under more than one name. Several of the best varie - resemble each other so closely that it is hard to distinguish be - en them, which partly accounts for the present confusion in varie - to some. While I found this testing rather expensive and slow, yet I found it interesting and I think thai it paid me well. It occurs to me that perhaps the results and conclusions I arrived at will be of some benefit to some potato growers of the Market Growers' Journal. I Taking those I have found the best in their order of ripening, for t early I know of nothing better, everything; considered, than the old 38 Triumph, sometimes called Early Sunrise, Stray Beauty, etc., and, at seem to be its white or partly white sports, the White Triumph, !ck Lunch and Norton Beauty. Whether these are seedlings or rts from the old Triumph I am unable to say, but they all seem to re the same characteristics except that the latter three are streaked h red and white instead of having all red skin, giving them a better &gt;earance perhaps than the old all red Triumph. They are all very ly, good yielders for so early a variety, fair to good in quality, md in shape, splendid keepers and not inclined to sprout too early the approach of spring. They are especially good varieties to grow a first early for local markets. I think a strain of these with skin white would be desirable and perhaps can be grown by careful I A little later and having somewhat the same general characteristics the Bliss Triumph, but stronger, larger and all white tubers, comes Irish Cobbler, commonly called Cobbler. It is the great early ship g and market variety of the present time and deservedly popular for yield and general rugged character. Its eating quality is good, but I the best, and it has rather too deep eyes, but is usually the best mey-maker of all early varieties, especially as a shipper. Either the bbler is sold under several different names or several other named rieties resemble it so closely that the difference is indistinguishable e the Early Eureka, Early Surprise, Early Petoskey, Standard, auty, etc. But I know of nothing I would prefer to a good strain of s genuine Cobbler. tThen there are several other fairly good early varieties, as the Early o, that sometimes may be valuable for a local market, but usually Cobbler Six Weeks, Bovee, Early Harvest, etc., will be found the it profitable. A few days later than the Cobbler comes the old Early Rose, and there are several other red long varieties of the same season introduced </seg>
            <seg id="p300">FINDING BEST POTATO VARIETIES BY TEST 275 the Early Rose was originated, making it practically impossible the olH ppnninp Kitrlv Rtw Tint this nrnhnhlv mukm nn ihffpr- 1 old genuine Early Rose. But this probably makes no differ - new varieties are no doubt seedlings of the Early Rose ind practically duplicates of it. The Early Rose is still quite popular and a good yielding and eating variety. Just following the Early Rose comes the Manistee, Northern -Heauty nd others of that class, raid-season or late mid-season varieties, good ielders and of nice shape but red skin varieties and only medium in quality. But few markets want a red potato, especially as late varie - ties as these, and it will not usually pay to raise them. This brings down to the main crop late varieties, the most of which can be classed under two heads, one the upright top and purple blow am varieties, usually called the Carman class, and the other the more spreading top, white blossom varieties, usually called the Green Moun - tain class. There are several varieties of these that are well known und splendid varieties, making it difficult to decide on the best. Of the Carman or upright purple blossom varieties there are the old Rural New Yorker No. 2, Carman No. 3, Livingston's Banner, Sir Walter Raleigh, World's Wonder and several others. I decided on the Banner (Livingston's Banner) and Wonder (World's Wonder) as the best of this class. The latter variety is a very late variety and in this northern climate should be planted early, as it requires about the whole season to mature in. The Banner is not quite so late a variety. but practically as good a yielder. Of the Green Mountain class I decided on the Green Mountain, Jr., and the Manum's Enormous. I suppose the Green Mountain, Jr., is either a seedling or a good strain of the old Green Mountain. Where the soil and season suits them they will sometimes outyield the Banner and Wonder, but are more liable to blight and rot in poor season. In fact. I think all of the spreading top white blossom varieties are little more susceptible to blight and rot than the Carman purple blossom varieties Besides these I have named among the late varieties there are many other good ones, especially for garden or family use, but the markets do not want a red or red streaked or long tuber variety for the winter. Under different conditions of soil, etc., others might arrive at differ - erent conclusions than I have, but I think we can all agree that we want to raise the best varieties we can find and from my tests I have decided to grow the Triumph and White Triumph, Cobbler, Early Rose, Manum's Enormous. Green Mountain, Jr., Banner and Wonder, and my two new varieties, the White Early Hebron, which I think better than the Early Rose, and the Golden Rural, which with me is a magnificent very late russet variety of the Carman class. From eight to twelve varieties is enough to perfectly cover the season. The large number of varieties sometimes offered by seedsmen Is confusing and useless. It requires very close attention to keep so </seg>

Of course, the seed grower or dealer must have enough varieties to perfectly cover the season, but the more he can reduce his number the more likely he is to keep varieties from getting mixed. The general grower wants but two or three varieties and those of the boat of their season. Southern growers want the best early yield - ing and shipping varieties. Here in the north we only raise early varieties for local markets and seed purposes. Our great main crop varieties are the late ones, taking about the whole season to grow in and being harvested in September and October, when they keep nicely until spring. — From Market Growers' Journal. CAU8EM OF POORLY FLAVORED MELONS. By M. L. BenNon, Union County, Illinois. One of the greatest causes of disappointment in melon growing, either for home use or market, is the tasteless or insipid melons so often found. In many cases the vines will appear healthy and promis - ing within a few days of the ripening of the crop, yet a larger propor - tion of the fruit will be of poor flavor, and sometimes almost the entire crop will be of this description. Very often these poorly flavored melons will look good on the outside, be fairly well netted and of full size and weight, making it difficult for the buyer to distinguish the bad from the good. It is this very fact that is one of the great drawbacks to melon growing for market. Many growers, either from ignorance or otherwise, will place these melons on the market; the consumer buys them, is disgusted with the quality, and not being able to judge of the quality from the appearance of the melons, quits buying, causing the market to become glutted. No gardener should knowingly sell melons of this class. It is not only poor business, but it is not honest Sometimes melons fail to attain their highest perfection of quality from growing on unsuitable soil or from excessive rains at ripening time, but in the vast majority of cases I believe it due to one of two causes. First, from the larvae of the striped melon bug. Every gar - dener knows of the injury caused by the matured bugs, but only a few realize the damage cause by the larvae, which are very small white worms. The bugs lay their eggs near the ground on the stem of the vine and the worms when hatched feed on and bore into the stem beneath the surface of the soil. I have frequently pulled up infested vines so full of the worms as to be almost eaten off. Vines infested with these worms are more or leas checked in growth, sometimes caus - ing them to wilt and always injuring the quality of the fruit. I find arsenate of lead an effective remedy, one teaspoonful to one gallon of water, sprayed on the plants while small to kill the bugs, and later on poured around the item of the plant sufficient to moisten the soil to a </seg>
            <seg id="p302">CAUSES OF POORLY FLAVORED MELONS 277 depth of two or three inches. Often badly infested vines will revive and become healthy after an application of poison around the stem. The second, and by far the more serious cause of poor melons, is the melon blight or rust, now as prevalent in all melon growing sections. It will destroy fields of the most promising melons in a few days and no vine affected with this disease can mature a finely flavored melon. It is also worse on late planted melons than early. The only remedy la to spray thoroughly with Bordeaux mixture, commencing when the vines begin to run and spraying about every ten days until the matu - rity of the crop. The important point is to commence to spray before the disease appears, and do it thoroughly. After the disease has made its appearance it is useless to try to check it. I regard it as neetaauy to spray in order to grow fine melons as for any other fruit. </seg>

The family garden can be grown in the orchard and furnish a iberal supply of all kinds of vegetables for summer and winter use. In those portions of the state where rainfall is sufficient or irriga- tion is practiced and small fruits thrive enough strawberries, rasp - berries, gooseberries and currants can be grown between the trees to supply the family needs and in favorable seasons have a surplus for market. orn (either sweet corn or any field variety) is one of the best crops grow in the young orchard We must cultivate the vegetables, small fruits or corn and in so ioing we are cultivating the trees. An example of intercropping is cited that has come to our notice shows what can be done along this line. One orchard in Cass county has been cropped to corn as above Jvocated. The rows of trees are 33 feet apart and at the seventh year the owner was still raising five rows of corn in each of the strips between the rows of trees. This little orchard of 150 trees which occupied about 4 acres of land produced in 1911 the seventh year from planting 200 bushels of Jonathan and Gano apples and 80 bushels of corn. CAUTION : We must not forget that we are growing an orchard and the crops grown between the trees are to utilize the land until the trees are large enough to take the entire area. Be careful in planting the crop in the young orchard to allow ample space along the rows of trees so that they may be carefully cultivated and yet not be injured by having limbs or bark on the trunk broken by cultivator or horses.
