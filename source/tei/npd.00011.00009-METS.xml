I within the limitations defined by statute, the courts cannot 
jrfere solely on the ground that such action may be reded 
as unwise or improvident, or that conclusions have

conditions existing and the circumstances MfMr

soluttlv void. (Chicago B. &amp; Q. R. Co. v. Cass County, 51

113. (1897. ) The tax agent of a railroad company in the 
year 1H95 and for several years prior thereto, listed for taxation 
with the officers of a school district a bridge which was 
a part of his principal's railroad, erroneously believing that 
such bridge was within the limits of such school district. The 
railroad company paid the taxes assessed by the school district 
against the bridge for all the years prior to 1896. It 
then brought suit to enjoin the 1895 tax on the ground that 
said bridge was, as a matter of fact, not within the limits of 
such school district. Held, (1) that the action did not call into 
tion the legality of the organization of the school district; 
(•_') that if jurisdiction to levy the tax was a franchise or privilege 
within the meaning of section B, subdivision 3, chapter 
79, of the Compiled Statutes of 1895, and such franchise or 
privilege was called into question by the action, still tne court 
was not required by said statute to conclusively presume anything 
further than the legal organization of the school district; 
(3) that the court was not required to conclusively presume 
that the bridge was within the limits of the school district because 
it had assumed the right to tax it for more than one 
year ; (4) that the court was not bound to presume that the 
bridge was within or without the limits of the school district; 
i ."&gt;) that the xitux of the bridge was a question to be determined 
from the evidence; (6) that the railroad company was not 
estopped from maintaining the action because of its conduct 
in listing the property for taxation; (7) that a proper remedy 
of the railroad company was injunction and not f/no warranto.

Apportionment.

/'linns to compel the levying of taxes for the payment of 
bonds issued by a school district, and it is apparent that the 
tax if levied in one year would be a burden upon the taxpayers 
of such district, the court, as a condition of granting relief, 
may apportion the levy over such number of years as not to 
be oppressive. (State ex rel. Gregory v. School District,

115. (1900.) Taxes levied to create a general fond of a

be drawn within the amount of such levy, although the money 
may not have been collected and on hand in the fund with w 
to pay the same. 61 Neb. 3. 

Validity of. 

16. (1897.) A school district issued a bond under and in 
&gt;uance of subdivision 15, chapter 79, of the Compiled Statof 
1895, and a sufficient amount was raised by taxation 
paid to tbe county treasurer by the taxpayers of the dis, 
in accordance witb the law for the purpose of paying raid 
1 according to its terms, but before the maturity of the 
1, the treasurer, without the knowledge and consent of the 
.er of the bond, lost the money by depositing the name in 
lvent banks. Held, such loss did not fall upon the bond 
er, and that the tax levied by the county board upon the 
&gt;erty of the school district to pay the balance due on said 
1 was proper. (Jacobson v. Cary, 51 Neb. 7»»2, 71 N. W 
) 

P. 7. (1899.) A tax to pay a judgment against a school 
rict cannot be levied and collected, when' the max imam

822.) 

118. (1876.) It seems that if the records of a school district

' authorized to levy, its collection cannot be c-nforc«Ml Bat 
mere failure to specify on the tax duplicate of the county 
the uses to which taxes for various purposes of the district 
to be applied will not invalidate th»&gt; levy. The several 
us may properly be included under the head of "school 
trie tax." To ascertain what the district has done re¦ding 
the levy of taxes resort must be had to tbe school 
trict books, which should show what taxes have been voted, 
I for what particular purposes they were levied. (Burlintr

119. (1886. ) Where a school district issued its bonds for the 
purpose of borrowing money, and afterward was sub-divided 
into other districts, it is the duty of the taxing officers to levy 
taxes on the property of the original district sufficient to pay 
the indebtedness, but they have no power or authority to levy 
such taxes on real estate which had never constituted a part of 
the district. (Thatcher v. Adams County, 19 Neb. 4*r&gt;. 27 N.

No. 6 of Hamilton county, while comprising three townw 
of land. Soon after said taxes were voted, and before the 
' of the same, two and one-half townships of land were 
iched from said district, and formed into school district No. 
Held, that the taxes thus voted should be levied upon dist 
No. 6, as it existed at the time of the levy, and not as it 
ted at the time they were voted. (School Dist. v. School

under section 1, subdivision 14, of the act "to establish 
a system of public instruction," approved March 1, 1881, is 
indebted on bonds previously issued for school purposes, upon 
such consolidation being effected, the new district not only becomes 
invested with all property rights of the former, but also 
becomes answerable for its debts; and a tax for their payment 
is properly levied on all taxable property within the new district.

L (1882.) A certificate from the county superintendent of

the division of the district, the taxes voted by

number constitutes one-third is a judicial question to be determined 
upon any competent legal evidence. Neither the number

notices of such election, of the holding of such election 
and the result thereof, and of the issuance of said

bonds, and to provide a sinking fund for the final redemption 
of the same ; that such taxes were collected by the 
Cuuuty treasurer and paid on said bonds within five years next 
before the commencement of an action upon them, held, that 
such payment was sufficient to take the bond upon which it 
was paid and indorsed out of the statute of limitations, although 
the payments had been made with money collected by 
virtue of an unconstitutional statute. (School Dist. v. First 
Nat. Bank, 19 Neb. 89 ? 26 N. W. 912.) 

VI. SCHOOL DISCIPLINE 

Ditturbana 

162. (1877. ) On the trial of a person charged with wilful disturbance 
of a public school, it is competent for the defendant 
to prove that he was a member of the district school board, 
and that what he did was in pursuance of an order of the board 
and in the honest discharge of his official duty. And it is error 
to exclude such testimony. (Bays v. State, 6 Neb. 167.) 

Studies. 

13. (1891.) The school trustees of a high school have 
ority to classify and grade the scholars in the district 
cause them to be taught in such departments as they may 
a expedient; they may also prescribe the courses of study 
textbooks for the use of the school, and such reasonable 
3 and regulations as they may think needful. They may also 
lire prompt attendance, respectful deportment, and dili:e 
in study. The parent, however, has a right to make a 
onable selection from the prescribed studies for his child 
ursue, and this selection must be respected by the trus, 
as the right of the parent in that regard is superior to 
of the trustees and the teacher. (State ex rel. Sneibley </seg>

Hi". (1882.) The statute specially authorizes the director of a 
school district to employ teachers either with the assent of the 
moderator and treasurer, or one of them, or by their direction,

entered into on behalf of the district by the director and treasurer,

defendant had not derived an income from other business than 
that of teaching during the existence of the alleged contract. 
Held, that an instruction that "the plaintiff, if he is entitled to

Limitations. 

185. (1887.) The legal maxim, "Lapse of time does not bar 
the state," can only apply in favor of the sovereign power, 
and has no application to school districts or other municipal 
corporations deriving their power from the sovereign. The 
statute of limitations runs for or against school districts in the 
same manner as it does for or against individuals. (May v. 
School Dist., 22 Neb. 205, 34 N. W, 377.)

Prenentation or Claim. 

186. (1896.) It is provided in the law enacted for the government 
of school districts of the class of the one herein sued 
"that all accounts shall be audited by the secretary, approved 
by a committee, to be styled the committee on claims, and no 
expenditure greater than two hundred dollars shall be voted 
by the board except in accordance with the provisions of a 
written contract; nor shall any money be appropriated out of 
the school fund except on a recorded affirmative vote of a 
majority of the members of the board, and said account and 
the records of said board in cities of the first class shall at all 
times be subject to the inspection and examination of the 
auditor of such city". Held, that the presentation of a claim 
or account to the secretary or committee on claims was not a 
condition precedent to the commencement of an action thereon.

No. 9 could maintain an action for the amount collected

duty of the county superintendent to ascertain and detere 
the amount justly due to such new district from the disi 
nut of which it may have been, in whole or in part, 
ned, and no action can be maintained by the new against 
old district to recover for its share of such property withsuch 
determination In case of such division there is likeb 
no right of recovery, where the old district has no proty

The legislature has declared that the decisions of the State 

Superintendent shall be held to have the force of law^until re- 

versed by the courts. 

"He (State Superintendent) shall decide disputed points in 

school law, and all such decisions shall be held to have th« 

force of law till reversed by the courts." Section 4, subdivis- 

»VIII, chapter 79, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 
is a fact worthy of notice that the Supreme Court of this 

State has reversed only two rulings of this department withia 

the last twenty years. 

The school laws referred to herein are the School Laws of 

Nebraska as revised and amended in 1901, chapter 79 of the 
Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1901, unless otherwise 

specified. 

One object of this publication is to give school officers and 

I hers a better understanding of the legal machinery govng 
matters of educational interest. Were these questions 
jerly understood and then carried out in accordance with 
law, many petty quarrels and much serious trouble which 
n work a great detriment to the schools, might be 

averted. 

It is hoped that city superintendents and high school princi- 

tas well as county superintendents will find these decisa 
great help to them in the discharge of their official dut- 
Those who teach school law in institutes will find this 

edition valuable in interpretation. </seg>

PREFACE. 

It must be remembered that the decisions are based upon 
the laws now in force. Every legislature makes some changes 
in the school laws. Hence, these rulings will necessarily be 
modified by new laws enacted or old ones amended or repealed. 
In cases where there is no law to govern and no decision of the 
court to guide, the State Superintendent has been governed by 
the counsel of the attorney general of Nebraska and by the 
Supreme Court rulings of other states. 

1&gt;n questions of importance not answered in the school laws 
n these decisions, be free to write this department. But 
me urge upon the county superintendents especially a carestudy 
of this edition of decisions of the school laws, and of 
Supreme Court rulings cited therein, before writing. The 
preme Court of Nebraska has laid down the following rules 
rerning the interpretation and construction of statutes : 

R) In the interpretation and construction of statutes, 
rtainment of the intention of the legislature is the end or 
&gt;ose to be accomplished. 

E) Where a law is plain and certain in its terms and free 
ambiguity and a reading suffices, no interpretation is 
ed or proper. 

This department, with its limited office force, is overburdened 
with official correspondence. The official decisions, important 
and unimportant, average two hundred a month. 
Superintendents who master this edition, the school laws and 
Supreme Court decisions on school matters, will add to their 
influence and success, beyond measure, as compared to those 
who neglect to qualify themselves for the legal duties of 
their office. There are weak, careless, and indifferent superintendents 
as well as the same kind of teachers. The superintendent 
who is industrious and makes himself fully acquainted 
with the duties of his office and knows how to apply the law of 
common sense is always a success. Do not expect a specific 
ruling for every phase of a case that may arise. Apply the 
law of common sense and act, — calmly, deliberately, decisively.

I. DECISIONS WHICH APPLY IN COMMON 

ALIEN 

A Legal Voter, When — An alien, male or female, who possesses 
all of the qualifications relative to age, residence and 
ownership of property, or having children of school age, is a 
voter. The matter of being an alien does not enter into the 
question. 

ATTENDANCE 

At Nearer School. — See section 4a, subdivision 5, School 
Laws. 

Eipulsory. — The following are the rulings of this departrelative 
to compulsory attendance at public, private or 
hial schools: 

In answer to the question whether pupils not less than seven 
nor more than fourteen years of age are required to attend school 
fora pariod equal to two-thirds the number of weeks the school 
district in which such person may live is required by the laws 
of the state to maintain a public school in order to share in the 
apportionment of the state school funds, or two-thirds the 
number of weeks of school voted at the annual meeting or determined 
by Ihe school board in cities, it is the ruling of this 
department that it is two thirds the number of weeks the 
school district is required by law to maintain a public school 
in order to share in the apportionment of state school moneys. 
(See section 14, subdivision 2, School Laws of Nebraska for 

In answer to the question whether the attendance of children 
at a school where the English language is not spoken and 
only the first principles of arithmetic are taught — almost the 
entire time being ' devoted to reading and writing a foreign 
language — for pupils not less than seven nor more than fourteen 
years of age, may be considered as meetinsr the requirements 
of the law, it is the ruling of this department that in 
case exemption is claimed on account of attendance at a private 
or parochial school as provided in this law, or on account of </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

attendance upon suitable instruction elsewhere given, 
the public school in the district where such person may live must be 
the standard of requirements in order to m-eet the demands of this 
law. This includes the number of weeks they shall attend 
school, the course of study they shall pursue therein, and the 
fitness of the instructor. Relative to the course of study the 
legislature has prescribed but a single subject that shall be 
taught in the public schools of this state, viz., physiology and 
hygiene, with special reference to the use of alcoholic drinks 
and other stimulants and narcotics upon the human system. 
Other subjects are left to the officers of the district board, who 
shall have the power to cause the pupils to be taught in such 
branches and classified in such grades or departments as may 
seem best adapted to a course of study which the school board 
of any district shall establish by the consent and advice of the 
county superintendent. The parent, however, has a right to 
make a reasonable selection from the prescribed course of study 
for his child to pursue, and this selection must be respected by 
the school board, as the right of the parent in that regard is 
superior to that of the trustees and the teacher. 

If it were the opinion of a majority of the district officers 
that it would be to the b^st interest* of the school to include a 
foreign language as one of the branches in the course of study, 
they woulo have the authority to do so by the consent and advice 
of the county superintendent. Such foreign language 
should not be used as the medium of instruction in other 
branches, but it may be studied simply as a language. Therefore, 
any private or parochial school, or any instruction elsewhere 
given, in which the English language is not spoken, 
and only the first principles of arithmetic are taught — almost 
the entire time being devoted to reading and writing a foreign 
language — for pupils not less than seven and not more than 
fourteen years of age, is not fulfilling the requirements of the law. 

But before this law can be carried into effect, the county 
superintendent must secure the adoption of a course of study 
in every district of his county as set forth in section 3, subdivision 
5, School Laws of Nebraska for 1901. The trustee** 
of a High school district have authority to prescribe the course 
of study for their district. </seg>

children subject to the provisions of this act, who shall violate 
or fail to comply with the provisions of this act, shall be deemed 
guilty of a misdemeanor, and shall, upon conviction thereof, 
be punished by a fine of not less than five dollars and not more 
than twenty-five dollars. 

foards of education in cities shall appoint one or more truant 
ers. In any case where the district board in districts other 
) city districts shall not appoint any person as truant officer, 
director shall art as such truant officer. 

These rulings are based upon the counsel of the attorney 
general; section 3, subdivision 5, Schuol Laws of Nebraskn for 
1901; sections 1 and 2, subdivision 16, of said laws; and the 
decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska as set forth in the 
Nebraska Reports, Vol. 31, p. i.":.'. 

Truant Officer. — According to the spirit, if not the letter, of 
the law a county truant officer may be chosen in a similar 
manner to the adoption of a county course of study. The 
county officers' association may elect or endorse any good man 
for the office, but his services will not be mandatory upon a 
single district until its board takes specific action and makes 
the county truant officer the truant officer for such district. In 
fact, a county truant officer would have no jurisdiction whatever 
in a district where the district board refuses or neglects 
to make him the truant officer of such district, for section 2, 
subdivision 16, says: "In any case where the district board 
shall not appoint any person as truant officer, the director shall 
act as truant officer. " A county truant officer's salary should 
be pro rated among the districts which appoint him as truant 
officer of their respective districts. 

BIBLE READING IN THE PUBLIC SCHOOLS 

The opinion in this case. State ex rel. Freeman v. Scheve, 
was filed October 9, 1902. Under the ruling of the supreme 
court the respondents have forty days in which to file a motion 
for a re-hearing. This period will close with the 18th day 
of November, 1902. This motion will probably be passed 
upon at the next sitting of the court which will occur the same 
day, November 18, 1902, and probably close the next day 
thereafter. In the meantime matters remain in statu quo. If </seg>

the motion for a re-bearing is overruled, a mandate will issue 
to the lower court. Its effect will be to stop the reading of 
the Bible and all* religious exercises in school district No. 21 
of Gage county. The decision jyroprio vigore — by its own force — 
acts only on the parties to the suit. The only persons who can 
be guilty of contempt of court in disobeyine the writ of mandamus 
in this particular case would be some person connected 
with that particular school or school district. 

I tut do not mistake me. This decision is point blank and 
reaching in its effects. Lawyers have a rule called stare 
fix — to stand or let it stand as decided — which obtains in 
matter I am discussing. Nearly one hundred years ago 
ef Justice Marshall in the case of Marbury v. Madison held 
t the supreme cou it of the United States was the interpreter 
the constitution of the United States. This view is now 
lerally accepted as to state constitutions. So, when what 
j be called a test case has been passed upon, it is accepted 
;he true interpretation in regard to both the constitution 
i the statutes. 

io far has this rule been carried that when one state interts 
its constitution or one of its laws and another state adopts 
constitution or the law, such interpretation becomes a part 
the law and of the constitution so adopted in the new state. 
s is a rule that prevails in most of the other states. 

i'he decision of the supreme court is not an exoression of the 
nion, personal or official, of the members of that court rela-3 
to the wisdom of reading the Bible in the public schools 
af conducting religious exercises. It is simply an interpreion 
of the constitution of the state of Nebraska as it exists. 
Ige Holcomb, however, concurs only in part or specially, 
I says: "The Bible itself is not a sectarian book and it is 
erroneous conception to so regard it." 

I submit herewith a complete copy of the opinion of the court. 

Very respectfully, 

W. K. Fowler,

OFFICIAL DECISIONS. 

State Ex Rel. Freeman v. Scheve* 

No. 11351. Opinion filed October 9, 1902. 
Commissioner's Opinion. Department No. 3. 

ISxercises by a teacher in a public school in a school build, 
in school hours^and in'the presence of the pupils, consistof 
the reading of passages from the Bible and in the sing"of 
songs'andjhymns'and "offering prayer to the Deity in 
ordance with^the doctrines, beliefs, customs or usages of 
barian 'churches or religious organizations, is forbidden 
the constitution of this state. 

Imes, C. Section IV of Article I of the constitution of this 
e is as follows: "All persons have a natural and indefeasright 
to worship Almighty God according to the dictates 
heir own consciences. No person shall be compelled to at-1, 
erect or support any place of worship against his con;, 
and no preference shall be given by law to any religious 
ety, nor shall any interference with the rights of connce 
be permitted. " 

Section XI of Article VIII of the constitution reads as fol- 

"No sectarian instruction shall be allowed in any school or 
institution supported in whole or in part by the public funds 
set apart for educational purposes." 

Daniel Freeman is a resident tax payer and a patron of the 
public school in School District No. 21 in Gage County. He 
applied for and obtained an alternative writ of mandamus running 
to the School Board of said District, alleging that against 
his protest and in disregard of his objections and in opposition 
to his demands, the Board permitted a teacher employed by 
them in said school, to engage daily in school hours in the 
public school building, in said District, and in the presence of 
the pupils, in certain religious and sectarian exercises consisting 
of the reading of passages of her own selection from a 
book commonly known as King James' version or translation 
of the Bible, and in singing certain religious and sectarian 
songs, and in offering prayer to the Deity according to the 
customs and usages of the so-called Orthodox evangelical 
churches of this country, and in accordance with the belief 
and practices of such churches, the pupils joining in the singing 
of such songs or hymns. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

The return to the writ admitted the foregoing recited facts, 
except that it denied that the exercises complained of were 
sectarian, but the teacher, who was produced as a witness, admitted 
that she regarded them as constituting a religious worship 
and that she conducted them solely for that reason. That 
they are correctly so described there can be no doubt. Protestant 
sects who maintain, as a part of their ritual and discipline, 
stated weekly meetings, in which the exercises consist 
largely of prayers and songs and the reading or repetition of 
scriptural passages would, no doubt, vehemently dissent from 
the proposition that such exercises are not devotional or not in 
an exalted degree worshipful, or not intended for religious 
edification or instruction. 

Eat they possess all these features is a fact of such uniil 
and familiar knowledge that the courts will take 
ial notice of it without formal proof. 

That such exercises are also sectarian in their character is 
not less free from doubt. For more than three centuries it has 
been the boast and exultation of the Protestants, and a complaint 
and grievance of the Roman Catholics, that the various 
translations of the Bible, especially of the New Testament, 
into the vernacular of different peoples have been the chief 
controversial weapons of the former, and the principal cause 
of the undoing of the latter. For making of such translations 
Wycliffe, Luther, Tyndale, and others, have been commended 
and glorified by one party, and denounced and anathematized 
by the other. Books containing such translations have been 
committed to the flames as heretical, and their translators, 
printers, publishers and distributors persecuted, imprisoned, 
tortured and put to death for participating in their production 
and distribution. 

The several popular versions differ in some particulars from 
each other, and all differ from the Catholic canon, both in 
rendition of passages from which sectarian doctrines are derived 
by construction, and in the number of books or gospels, 
constituting what is regarded as the written record of Divine 
revelation. In addition to this, there are persons who are 
convinced, upon grounds satisfactory to them, that considerable 
parts of the writings accepted by all Protestant denominations 
are not authentic, while devout Hebrews maintain tha </seg>

OFFICIAL DECISIONS. 

the New Testament itself is not entitled to a place in the true 
Bible. These diverse opinions have given rise to a great number 
of religious sects or denominations. To some of these 
sects the reading in public of any portion of any version of 
the scriptures unaccompanied by authoritative comment or explanation, 
or the reading of it privately by persons not commissioned 
so to do by the church, is objectionable and an offense 
to their religious feelings; to some, the utterance of public 
prayer, except recitations from scripture, is a vain and 
wicked act; and to some, the songs and hymns of praise in 
which others engage are a stumbling block and an offense. 

We do not think it wise or necessary to prolong a discussion 
of what appears to us an almost self-evident fact, that exercises 
such as are complained of by the relator in this case, both constitute 
religious worship and are sectarian in their character 
within the meaning of the constitution. 

Nor do we feel inclined to make what might be looked upon 
as a spurious exhibition of learning by quoting at length from 
the many judicial decisions and utterances of eminent men, in 
this country, concerning the subject. Perhaps the case most 
nearly in point because of similarity both of facts involved and 
of constitutional enactments construed, to those in the case at 
bar, is Weiss et al. v. The School Board, 76 Wis., 177; 44 N. 
W. Rep. , 976. There are three separate and concurring opinions 
in this case by three of the eminent judges of that court. 
The discussion includes a thorough review of both the legal 
principles involved, and of the historical aspect of the controversy, 
and for the most part, and in essential particulars, voices 
our own views. We think it, therefore, sufficient for our purpose 
to direct attention to that authority. 

But there is another matter deserving of consideration in 
this connection. Secular education of children within prescribed 
ages, is by a statute of this state, made compulsory. 
Punctuality and regularity of attendance at the time fixed for 
the beginning of and throughout the daily sessions of a district 
school are of first importance, both as measure of discipline 
and for the development of a trait, or the formation of a 
habit, of extreme importance to the students in after life. 

Kery justly and almost, if not quite, necessarily, pupils are 
lired to conform to these regulations, or incur the penalty </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

of loss of rank in deportment and scholarship. Unless opinions 
of universal acceptance in this country since the foundation 
of our government are at fault, it is a policy of the 
highest importance that the public schools should be the 
principal instruments and sources of popular education, because 
they exert more than any other institution, an influence 
promotive of homogeneity among a citizenship drawn from all 
quarters of the globe. But if the system of compulsory education 
is persevered in, and religious worship or sectarian instruction 
in the public schools is at the same time permitted, 
parents will be compelled to expose their children to what they 
deem spiritual contamination, or else, while bearing their share 
of the burden for the support of public education, provide the 
means from their own pockets for the training of their offspring 
elsewhere. 

It might be reasonably apprehended that such a practice, 
ides being unjust and oppressive to the persons immedily 
concerned, would by its tendency to the multiplication 
parochial and sectarian schools, tend forcibly to the deletion 
of one of the most important, if not indispensable, 
adation stones of our form of government. It will be an 
[ day when anything happens to lower the public schools in 
tular esteem or to discourage attendance upon them by 
Ldren of any class. 

The district court without consideration of the merits of the 
controversy, adjudged a dismissal of the suit upon the ground 
that the practices complained of were so far within the discretion 
of the District Board as not to be subject to control by 
mandamus. In that opinion we were, or at least the writer was, 
at first, inclined to concur. More mature reflection has, however, 
convinced us that this view is erroneous. The administration 
of the public funds for educational purposes is entrusted 
solely to these Boards, and the nature of their office, we think, 
especially enjoins upon them the duty of seeing to it that 
the constitutional prohibition is observed. It may be unnecessary 
to remark that neither the writer nor the court is intended 
to be committed to any view of any of matters of theological 
or exegetical controversy touched upon in the foregoing 
discussion. '"All that is 'intended to be said is that such matters,

Sedgwiuk, J. I concur in the conclusion reached by the 
Commissioners solely on the ground that the exercises complained 
of were "sectarian instruction" within the meaning of 
the constitution. 

Holcomb, J. (concurring specially) : I concur in the foregoing 
opinion in so far as it is held therein that the exercises 
which it is sought to have eliminated as conducted in the district 
school in which respondents are school officers, violate 
the constitutional provision declaring that no sectarian instruction 
shall be allowed in the public schools. As to the views 
apparently entertained and held to in the opinion to the effect 
that the exercises complained of constitute thereby the schoolhouse 
a place of worship within the meaning and contrary to 
the section of the constitution wherein it is ordered "No person 
shall be compelled to attend, erect or support any place of 
worship against his consent," I do not agree. In my judgment 
such an interpretation is not justified by any sound rule 
of construction as to the meaning of the provision quoted. 
Moore v. Monroe, 61 Iowa, 367 ; Pfeiffer v. Board of Education, 
77 N. W. Rep. (Mich. ), 250. If the views therein expressed are 
sound, then it would seem that it is in the power of any taxpayer 
to prevent religious exercises in any of the penal, reformatory 
or eleemosynary institutions in the state and to close 
the doors of the state capitol to the chaplains of both branches </seg>

of the legislature. Provisions in substance, if not in the exact 
language of our constitution relating to freedom of religious 
worship and exemption from involuntary support of any place 
of worship, are found in very many of tht&gt; constitutions of the 
different states of the Union. With the exception of the case 
from Wisconsin cited in the opinion, I know of no authority 
holding to the view that exercises in public schools, or other 
secular institutions, of the nature and character shown to have 
been engaged in, in the case at bar, would constitute the place 
where held a place of worship within the meaning of the fundamental 
law. Says Judge Cooley, who as an author in this 
branch of jurisprudence ranks highest: "The American constitutions 
contain no provisions which prohibit the authorities 
from such solemn recognition of a superintending Providence in 
public transactions and enterprises as the religious sentiment of 
mankind inspires, and as seems meet and proper in finite and 
dependent beings. Whatever may be the shade of religious 
belief, all must acknowledge the importance of recognizing in 
important human affairs the superintending care and control 
of the great Governor of the universe, and of acknowledging 
with thanksgiving his boundless favors, or bending in contrition 
when visited with the penalties of his broken laws. No 
principle of constitutional law is violated when thanksgiving 
or fast days are appointed, when chaplains are d3sign«ted for 
the army and navv, when legislative sessions are opened with 
prayer or the reading of Scriptures, or when religious teaching 
is encouraged by the general exemption of the houses of 
religious worship from taxation for the support of the state 
government." Cooley's Cons. Lim. (5th ed.) p. Gflfc 

Nor do I wish to be understood as holding to the views that 
it is not within the discretionary power of the authorities of 
school districts to sanction, if deemed wise, under proper restrictions, 
the reading of the Bible or portions thereof or readings 
therefrom in the public schools. The Bible itself is not 
a sectarian book and it is an erroneous conception to so regard 
it. Altogether, aside from its theological aspect the Bible has 
a historical and literary value surpassed by no secular writings. 
Its moral teachings and precepts are of the purest and highest 
and appeal to the noblest impulses of mankind as no other 
literary production ever has. Can any one successfully con- </seg>

tend in the light of the contemporaneous history of the times 
that the constitutional framers and the people who adopted 
that instrument intended to altogether exclude the Bible 
from the schools? If such had been the intention would not 
the members of the convention have expressed themselves 
in such language as could not be misunderstood? A constitutional 
provision concerning religious freedom should, it is 
said, be construed in relation to the state of the law and custom 
as they existed at the time of its adoption and the courts 
can take judicial notice of customs and usages in regard to 
the use of the Bible in the public schools. Pfeiffer v. Bd. of 
Ed., City of Detroit, supra. 

The provisions of the constitution on the subject of sectarian 
instruction in the public schools should be construed so as to 
give it the scope and effect intended by its framers Mid 
the people who adopted it. This is accomplished by firmly 
excluding therefrom all forms of instruction calculated to 
establish and confirm in the minds of the students those theological 
doctrines and beliefs which are peculiar to some osJy 
of the different religious sects. 

Further than this we are not warranted in going. 

BOARD — POWERS AND DUTIES. 

Cannot Borrow Money. — There is no provision for aothortsiaff 
the board to borrow money for the use of the district 

Discharge Teacher for Cause.— The school board has the right 
to discharge a teacher for cause, and after such di*i harge the 
teacher has no right to continue the school, even if the ca— 
be thought insufficient. The only coarse than open to the 
teacher is an action for damages. Whether the teacher eoaU 
draw pay for the full time of the contract, would be a qoeatkm 
to be determined by process of law. 

Expel Pupil When Welfare of School Demands It.— The law 
empowers a school board to suspend or exoel a pupil fraai 
school who is guilty of gross misdemeanors or persist— t dieobedience, 
whenever in their judgment the inter— ta of the 
school demand it; but such suspension shall not extend bi/uaJ 
the close of the term. In case of emergency the teacher ssaa* 
suspend a pupil and refer his actions and the roaaon tberasor 
immediately to the board. </seg>

Pient of Pupils. — School boards are empowered to 
governing their schools. If they see fit to admit

"An action of mandamus will lie and may be maintained to 
reinstate a pupil in a school, if the action of the officer or 
officers by which the party was refused admission to or continuance 
in the school was an arbitrary or capricious exercise 
of authority." 57 Neb. 183. 

Relative Authority of School Officers and Parents. — The school 
trustees have authority to classify and grade the scholars in 
the district and cause them to be taught in such departments 
as they may deem expedient ; they may also prescribe the 
courses of study and text-books for the use of the school, and 
such reasonable rules and regulations as they may think needful. 
Tney may also require prompt attendance, respectful 
deportment, and diligence in study. The parent, however, 
has a right to make a reasonable selection from the prescribed 
courses of study for his child to pursue, and this selection must 
be respected by the trustees, as the right of the parent in that 
regard is superior to that of the trustees and the teacher. 31 
Neb. 552. 

Ient Rojms for School Purposes. — It is within the authority of 
school board to make temporary arrangements for carryon 
the school whenever this matter is neglected at the 
ual district meeting. The school board should rentabuiJdand 
pay for the same out of the funds of the district. It 
ot only a right but it would be a duty incumbent on the 
x)l board, to so provide room and teachers for the pupils

it is a duty incumbent upon them to satisfy themselves 
the teacher is a legally qualified teacher. The certificate

Right to Require Excuses for Absence and Tardiness. — Our stat- 

utes confer upon the school board the power "to make such 
rules and regulations as they may think necessary for the government 
of the scholars." This grant of authority includes 
the right to require excuses for absence and tardiness. It </seg>

ought to be remembered, however, that very moefa depends 
upon the manner of enforcement of soch a ml«. A ras^tfalsM 
harmless and proper in itself might be enforced in socb a way 
as to render it exceedingly obnoxious and almost nimndaribls 
to parents and pupils. If a certain rale is beneficial to the school, 
it ought not to be difficult to convince parent* of it* osef alswss ; 
for certainly no one is more interested in the Beffaia of the 
school than the parents who entrust their children to ito iastraction 
and discipline. Attendance rales should be enforced with 
the greatest courtesy and consideration, and they will nncnuntsr 
no serious opposition from the parents for the benefit of whoa* 
children they are intended. 

| r hen Primary Pupils May Enter.— It seems quite reasonable 
., after the last primary class is once fairly started, ao 
ils should be permitted to enter the school anless they cm 
sue the studies of some class already formed; otherwise the 
or two who enter later will require as much time aad at;ion 
from the teacher as would an entire class. As a rale* 
ils who are too young to enter the lowest existing claes will 
: very little by waiting until the beginning of the next tetsa. 
fact, in most cases it would be better for them to do so. 
h a regulation seems, therefore, to be proper and reason;and 
within the power of the district board; and if unforced 
i spirit of moderation and courtesy, and with a sincere 
rt to secure the sympathy and cooperation of the people, 
ught to meet with no resistance. 

BONDS — DISTKKT 

Amount Voted. — In the amount of bonds that a school district 
may legally vote, the amount of outstanding bonds mast be 
reckoned, notwithstanding the fact that there may be money In 
the bond fund to pay the same. 

Compromise.— It has been held by the Supreme Court that 
sections 27-32, subdivision 15 of the School Laws, do not ess* 
power a school district to issue its bonds and deliver them to 
parties in compromise or to take the place of an indebtedness 

by school district warrants. 

Rate. — A school district board has no authority to date du&gt; 
t bonds on a day prior to the date of the election sathortl- 

ing their issuance. The fact that bonds were dated on a legal 

holiday would not of itself invalidate them. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Election May be Attempted the Second Time in One Year. — 

There is no school law that would interfere with the holding of 
a meeting oftener than once a year to vote bonds. If the necessary 
voters sign the petition and the proper notices are 
posted, even though the bonds may have failed at a former 
meeting, the proceeding would be legal. There is no provision 
for adjourning a bond election. 

tinner of Voting, Qualifications of Voters, Etc — All persons 
are qualified to vote in a school district on any school 
tion are entitled to vote upon the proposition to issue 
s of the district whenever such question is properly subid. 
Where it is proposed to vote bonds in a common or 
i school district, the proposition may be determined in the 
&gt; manner as any question legally submitted at an annual 
ing, so that the exact number voting and favoring the 
osition may be known and recorded. The election must 
y ballot. 

Territory Affected in Payment— All of the territory embraced 
in the district at the time the bonds were voted is subject to 
a special tax liquidating the bonds, no matter if, by subsequent 
divisions or changes, some of tbe territory of the bonded 
district has been annexed to other districts.

Fractional District. — In the case of a change in the boundaries 
of a fractional district it is necessary that the entire district 
(the parts lying in both counties) should be token into consideration 
; and the number of legal voters residing in both 
parts should be made the basis in determining whether ft 
sufficient number of voters have signed the petition in question. 

In order legally to make any change in the boundaries of a 
fractional district, it is necessary that petitions be presented 
to the superintendents of both counties affected, and that both 
superintendents grant such petitions. 

New Districts. — See Sixth, Sec. 4, Subdivision 1, School Laws.

Change in Census Report. — It is within the authority of the 
county superintendent, under section 4a, subdivi-i 
make changes in the census reports of districts affected by the 
transfer of pupils, and it is the duty of the county superintendent 
to make changes in conformity with such transfers if the 
director or directors refuse to do so. 

|)irector Liable to District for Neglect. — If, upon notification by 
county superintendent of inaccuracy in the census report, 
director fails to correct th« same, he becomes personally 
)le for whatever amount of the stato apportionment the 
brict loses by reason of his neglecting to file a complete ret 
with the county superintendent. 

Enumeration of Indians. — The children uf Indian* who are 
citizens of this state should be enumerated in the school renew 
of the district and the county of their legal residence. Such 
children share in the apportionment of the state school funds, 
and should be counted in determining the salary of the county 
superintendent of such county. 

I 'he Supreme Court of Nebraska has decided the queetion as 
what 'Indians are citizens of this state. The court held: 
y the provisions of said act (the act of Congress, approved 
&gt;ruary 8, 1887. entitled 'An Act to Provide for the Allotit 
of Lands to Indians in Severalty, etc.'), all Indians born 
bin the territorial limits of the United States, to whom 
tments of land in severaltyj have been made under the pro- </seg>

visions of said law, or other law or treaty, and all Indians born 
as aforesaid who have^voluntarily taken up their residence in 
the United States separate and apart from any tribe of Indians 
therein, and adopted habits of civilized life, are made citizens 
of the United States, and such Indians residing in this state 
are residents thereof. The actual issuance or receipt by an 
Indian of a patent for lands allotted to him under the act is 
not necessary to constitute him a citizen of the United States. 
When he has accepted the land allotted, taken possession 
thereof, and otherwise complied with the law, he becomes 
entitled to his patent, and his citizenship attaches." See 
37 Neb. 299. The act of Congress, February 8, 1887, contains 
this provision : ' 'In the expenditure of money appropriated 
for any of the purposes of education of Indian children, those 
children of Indians who have taken lands in severalty under 
existing laws, shall not by reason thereof, be excluded from 
the benefits of such appropriation." In the light of the 
Supreme Court decision in this state and this act of Congress, 
it is evident that Indians who are citizens of this state may 
elect to send their children either to the public school of the 
district wherein .they reside or to a government Indian school. 
In either case the children of such Indians should be listed in 
the school census of the county wherein such Indians are 
citizens. 

K numeration of Minors Gone to War. — Minors who have gone 
ar should be enumerated in the school census of the disof 
their residence, which is usually with their parents. 

Improper Enumeration. — Under the statutes, only children who 
are bonajide residents of the district, or who have been transferred 
into the district under the provisions of section 4a, subdivision 
5 of the School Laws, can legally be enumerated in 
the school census of such district. The fact that pupils living 
outside of a district have been improperly included in the census 
of such district would not render such pupils legal residents 
of the district, nor give them school privileges therein. 

CLOSING SCHOOL 

Burning of Schoolhouse. — If it is a physical impossibility for 
the school district board to furnish a house in which the school 
may be taught, the teacher could not draw pay during the time </seg>

school is closed on account of the burning of the school boose. 
If it is possible for the board to provide a house iii which tbe 
school may be taught, the teacher's pay will continue during 
the time school is closed on account of the burning of the 
schoolhouse. It might be well, however, for the teacher and 
board to compromise under such circumstances. 

Epidemic Disease. — If a teacher is employed for a definite time 
and during the period of his employment the district officers 
or board of health close the schools on account of the prevalence 
of an epidemic disease in the district, and the teacher 
continue ready to perform his contract, he is entitled to full 
wages during such period; provided, there is nothing in the 
contract to the contrary" . 

|[oltdays. — So far as schools are concerned, the statutes of 
iraska make no provisions for legal holidays. A teacher, 
he absence of anv provision upon the matter in his conit, 
would have no authority to close school upon the soed 
holidays without being legally required to make up the 
e so lost to the district. However, a district board has 
tiority to make provision for closing school upon such days, 
in case the board directs that school be closed upon any 
cified day, the teacher would legally draw pay for such 

Lost Time. — A teacher may make up lost time by teaching 
on Saturdays only by permission of the board. 

Efhen the school is closed for a few days in order to repair 
lages done to the building by a storm, the teacher is not 
nd legally to make up the time so lost, providing he holds 
self in readiness to continue the school during tbe time 
ool was closed by order of the board. 

CONSOLIDATION 

The consolidation of school districts is one of the most important 
and delicate of the superintendent's duties, always to 
be performed with great care and deliberation. It must not 
be confused with the discretionary power of the superintendent 
to create a new district from other organized districts upon 
petition signed by one-third of the legal voters in each district 
affected. See condition first, section 4, subdivision 1. The 
creation of a new district under this provision will not permit </seg>

            <seg id="p070">

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

the discontinuance of any district. The consolidation of 
school districts contemplates the discontinuance of one or more 
districts every time a consolidation is perfwcted. "One district 
may be DISCONTINUED and its territory attached to 
other adjoining districts (or district), upon petitions signed 
by one-half of the legal voters in each district affected." 
See fourth condition, section 4, subdivision 1. 

It must be remembered that the petitions for the consolidation 
of two or more school districts shall contain an exact 
statement of what changes in district boundaries are proposed. 
The notices of said petition shall be likewise specific relative 
to changes proposed. Said notices sjiall be posted in tbree 
public places, one of which places shall be upon the outer door 
of the schoolhouse, if there be one, in each district affected, or 
territory not organized into districts proposed to be attached 
to an existing district, at least ten (10) days prior to the time 
of presenting the petitions to the county superintendent ; provided, 
that changes affecting cities (districts organized under 
subdivision 14 or 17) shall be made upon the petition of the 
board of education of the district or districts affected. 

Suppose districts Numbers 1, 2. 3 and 4 of a certain county 
desire to consolidate with district No. 5. Separate petitions 
must be circulated in each of these districts, 1, 2, 3 and 4, asking 
to be discontinued and to have its territory attached to 
district No. 5, which district shall retain its old number. Four 
separate petitions must also be circulated in district No. 5; one 
asking that the territory in district No. 1 be attached to district 
No. 5 ; one asking that the territory in district No. 2 be 
attached to district No. 5; one asking that the territory in district 
No. 3 be attached to district No. 5; and one asking that 
the territory in district No. 4 be attached to district No. 5. 
This plan is somewhat cumbersome, it is true, but under the 
existing statute it is the only legal way. The consolidated 
district shall take the number of the said district No. 5. and 
be under the control of its officers until the annual meeting 
when it may organize as a High school district, provided, it 
contains more than one hundred and fifty children between the 
ages of five and twenty-one years. See section 1, subdivision

On the 9th of April, 1872, school district No. 9 of Hamilton 
county was formed, eighteen miles in length and six miles in 
width. The formation of school districts and the power to 
change or modify boundary lines of same under the statute 
as it then existed was a question entirely at the discretion of 
the county superintendent. There was no limit to the extent 
of school districts, neither was there any law providing for 
the free transportation of pupils. However, the legality as to 
the formation of this district was tested in the district court. 
This court held its formation legal. The case was appealed to 
the Supreme Court, where the judgment of the district court 
was reversed. In discussing the principle of law which should 
govern in such cases, Justice Maxwell said: "A school district 
being formed for the purpose of affording an education 
to all the children of school age within its boundaries, is or 
*hould be limited in extent by the distance scholars are able 
to attend school. No satisfactory reasons can be given for including 
lands in a school district so remote from the school 
that it is impossible for those residing on those lands to attend, 
It is imposing a burden upon the owners of such property, 
from which they derive no benefit whatever." 

I his decision was no doubt responsible for the six-mile limit 
ch prevailed for several years in the formation of school 
ricts. But since there is a law which provides for the free 
isportation of pupils when the distance from school shall 
ler it impracticable for them to attend without transporta, 
the legislature of 1901 deemed it wise to repeal the sixs 
limit in the formation of school districts. It is reasonable 
resume, however, that the Supreme Court would hold again 
I a school district should be limited in extent by the dis:e 
that scholars are able to attend school. Therefore, this 
artruent will hold that the consolidation of schools must 
y with it the provision for the free transportation to and 
q school of all pupils when tne distance from school shall 
ler it impracticable for them to attend without transports- </seg>

proviso : ' 'That the portion of this act requiring attends"' 
in a public day school shall not apply in any case • * * where 
the child lives more than two miles distant from the school by 
the nearest practicable traveled road ; unless free transportation 
to and frcm schcol is furnished to^such'child. " Any consolidation 
of school districts not meeting this nrovision of the 
law will be held null and void by this department. 

i r here several districts are consolidated, the new district 
only becomes invested with the property rights of the 
ner, but also becomes answerable for their debts. This

CONTRACTS. 

Equally Binding on both Parties. — The contract between the 
school board and a teacher is a mutual obligation, equally 
binding upon both parties. Neither party can with impunity 
rescind such contract; and either party violating the provisions 
of such contract would be answerable in damages to the aggrieved 
party. It requires a majority of the board to legally 
accept a teacher's resignation. 

|»ral — In order to be legal and binding upon the district, it is 
necessary that a contract be in writing. If not in writing 
existence must be fully proven. If it can be proven that a 
cher was elected by the board, that he was notified of such 
2tion and clearly indicated his acceptance of it, the contract

concerned or not. In the absence of a written contract the </seg>

minutes of the director or secretary of the board would show 
the time for which a teacher was elected. 

Teacher Cannot set Contract Aside of Her own Free Will. — In 

I a teacher breaks a contract made between herself and a 
ol district board, trie board has a right of action on the 
inal contract, and may maintain: (1) A suit to obtain damfor 
the loss sustained by the breach; (2) a suit to obtain 
ific performance of the contract by the other party. Or, 
le court were to find it difficult to assess the damages, or 
ild fail to enforce a specific performance because it cannot 
rvise or insure its execution, they could, by injunction, 
rce the promise not to teach elsewhere during the time 
red by the injunction. See Clark on Contracts, 702. 

PUNISHMENT. 

Corporal. — The statutes of Nebraska are silent as to the right 
of a teacher to inflict corporal punishment, and the matter 
seems never to have been brought before our Supreme Court; 
but the holdings of Supreme Courts of other states are quite 
uniform and positive in the matter, and are in substance as 
follows : A teacher in charge of a school stands in the place of 
the parent while the pupils are under his or her control and has 
the same right to command and to enforce obedience which the 
parent has in the home. This right includes the infliction of 
corporal punishment in a reasonable manner and with the 
proper motive. If it can be shown that the punishment was 
cruel or excessive or inflicted with malice on the part of the 
teacher, then such teacher is liable to prosecution and punishment. 
As a matter of educational policy, there is no question 
that corporal punishment is to be used only as a last resort; 
and our best teachers almost invariably succeed in avoiding it. 
Nevertheless there are cases, growing out of unusual perversity 
or unfortunate influences at home, which make its use advisable 
and sometimes even indispensable. While the constant 
aim of the teacher and school board should be to reduce the 
use of this method-of discipline to a minimum, there can be no 
question as to the legal right of the board to authorize, and of 
the teacher to employ, corporal punishment, under proper circumstances, 
in the proper manner, and with the proper motive.

PUPILS. 

Control of Pupils while off School Premises.— Let us divide the 
question at issue into two parts: first, the teacher's authority 
over pupils on the way to and from school ; and second, his authority 
over pupils at other times and places tban in school, on 
school grounds, on the way to and from school, or during school 
hours. The laws of Nebraska do not touch directly upon the 
matter of the teacher's authority over pupils on the way to and 
from school. Several decisions of different Supreme Courts, 
however, seem to indicate that where there is no statutory 
provision to the contrary, the teacher may exercise a reasonable 
control over pupils on the way U&gt; and from the schoolhouse 
in all matters of conduct which affect the interests and 
discipline of the school. This authority must be exercised 
with great discretion on the part of the teacher, and he will be 
liable for any flagrant perversion or abuse of it. The teacher 
stands in the place of the parent at school and has the same 
jurisdiction over the conduct of the pupil there that the parent 
has at home. It seems to be a simple deduction from this 
principle that the teacher has authority over the pupils at all 
times when they are thrown together in consequence of their 
attendance at school ; and it would be very disastrous to school 
discipline if the teacher were denied a reasonable control over 
the actions of the pupils on the way to and from the schoolhouse. 
This right, therefore, seems to belong to the teacher 
by implication without any express statement of law to that 

For acts committed in or about the homes of the pupils, it 
would avoid a source of much trouble and irritation if the 
teacher would consult with the parents, reasoning with them, 
if they are reasonable, and parents usually are when the facts 
are fairly stated and they see that some action is necessary for 
the erood of their own children. Teachers should not be arbitrary 
or dictatorial. Parents have rights and are or should be 
the proper guardians of their children, and responsible for 
their acts in school and out. ¦ Many parents would prefer to 
punish their children themselves for misconduct in school and 
would do so more severely than the teachers, if applied to in 
the proper spirit. </seg>

this department that a teacher has the legal right to detain 
pupils after the regular school hours, when circumstances 
make it necessary. 

Entrance; Limit as to Time. — See Attendance. 

Expulsion and Suspension. — The statute empowers the school 
district board to suspend or expel pupils from the school, and 
it also provides that "such suspension shall not extend beyond 
the close of the term." The expression "term " is not defined 
in the statutes. In the absence of any definition on the part 
of the board, the word term would naturally apply to the entire 
period during which school is in session during the school 
year. But where the school district board has made and 
adopted a series of rules by which the school year is divided 
into specific terms, the board would have no authority to suspend 
a pupil for a period extending beyond the close of the 
current term as defined in said rules. 

Female — Majority at 18. — Under the statutes of Nebraska 
(section 3, 212 C. S. 1899), the minority of a female child ends 
at the age of eighteen years. Where a woman between 
eighteen and twenty-one years of age elects in good faith to 
make her residence in a certain school district, and does 
actually reside therein, she has the right to free school privileges 
in said district. 

I'ree School Privileges. — Children of school age are entitled to 
3 school privileges only in the district in which their parents 
legal guardians make their legal residence. To be a legal 
irdian one must have been so recognized by a court of proper 
isdiction, with such guardianship made a matter of record 
the court. 

Graduation Does not Forfeit School Privileges. — A person who 
graduates from the public schools of Nebraska does not lose 
his privilege of attending school by reason of his graduation. 
He has a right to continue the same studies in the same school 
and will have the same privileges as the school guarantees to 
other pupils in the matter of text-books, etc., providing no separate 
classes are required for his instruction. 

Mav be Excluded if Exposed to Contagious Disease. — A boy of 

K school district is attending school in another district and 
been exposed to smallpox ; he boards at home, which is in </seg>

the first district ; his brothers and sisters attend school in the 
home district. Under these conditions it is the right and duty 
of the district board of the home district to refuse admittance 
to the brothers and sisters of the boy who has been exposed. 

Punishment of. — See Punishment. 

RESIDENCE 

To acquire a domicile or residence in a school district, two 
things are necessary : the fact of a residence in a place, and 
the intent to make it a home. A domicile or residence once 
acquired remains until a new one is acquired. Mere intention 
to remove without the fact of removing will not change the 
domicile ; nor will the fact of removal without the intention to 
change the residence. A person once established in any place, 
the presumption of residence continues unless rebutted, and 
the burden of proof is upon the party alleging the same. 

VACCINATION 

Compulsory. — There is no express statute in this state making 
vaccination compulsory or imposing it as a condition upon 
the privilege of attending our public schools, neither have we a 
Supreme court decision bearing upon this particular point. 
Our Supreme court has decided, however, that a school board 
has the power to adopt and enforce appropriate and reasonable 
rules and regulations for the government and management of 
the school under its control. The question of the right of a 
school board to exclude pupils from school if they are not vaccinated 
has been passed upon by the Supreme court of Michigan. 
The decision rendered is to the effect that a standing 
rule prohibiting unvaccinated pupils from attending school 
could not be established, though] temporarily during an epidemic 
the board may exclude persons who have not been vaccinated. 
The Supreme court of Indiana has held that a local 
board of health has power to require that no unvaccinated 
child be allowed to attend the public school during the continuance 
of a threatened smallpox epidemic. 

Under the existing Statutes of Nebraska and in the light of 
these Supreme court decisions, it is the ruling of this department 
that a standing rule prohibiting 'un vaccinated pupils from 
attending school Jcould yiut^.be enforced, though temporarily </seg>

            <seg id="p077">

during an epidemic the board may exclude persons who have 
not been vaccinated. And during such epidemic, it is not only 
the right of the board but its duty so to do, upon a concensus 
of opinion of the practicing physicians. 

II. RURAL AND VILLAGE SCHOOLS 

ANNUAL MEETING 

Cannot Relieve Treasurer of Responsibility for Monev Lost. — It 
is not within the authority of the voters at the annual meeting 
to release a. treasurer from being responsible for monevs paid 
out illegally or lost by him. 

I-annot .Select Teacher nor Determine Wages. — It is not within 
i authority of the annual meeting to determine the wages to 
paid to a teacher ; the school board is the proper authority 
Bx teacher's wages. Neither can the annual meetine deterie 
whether the teacher shall be male or female. 

Etermine Length of Term.— Section 14, subdivision 2, of the 
3l laws, provides that the legal voters may determine at 
annual meeting the length of time a school shall be taught 
e district the ensuing year. 

Illegal to Vote no School. — Mr. W. K. Fowler, State Superintendent 
of Public Instruction, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir : — I 
have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter relating 
to the duty of the legal voters of a rural school district 
to determine the amount of taxes which shall be levied for 
school purposes. You have requested an opinion upon the 
following proposition : 

"Where no levy was voted at the annual meeting for school 
purposes, or where the district voted to have no school, or 
where no action was taken by the annual meeting to provide 
for school, what is the method of procedure to insure the 
children of such district their right to attend a free public 
school?" 

I 'he question presented is important, but not free from perxities. 
The people of this state when they adopted the 
sent constitution declared a purpose to grant to all persons 
ween five and twenty-one years of age the right to instruci 
in the common schools. An enlightened citizenship was 
ught to be essential to the proper and efficient administion 
of the form of government adopted. To provide oppor- </seg>

tunities for education is therefore one of the chief concerns 
of the state. A school district is organized pursuant to law 
for educational purposes, and is clothed with power to carry 
those purposes into effect. The idea that a school district may 
defeat by ballot the purposes of its creation and thus deprive 
its resident children of educational rights guaranteed by the 
constitution, is not to be entertained for a moment. A vote to 
deny such rights is void. An election resulting in a decision 
to close the common schools for a year, except on account of 
an epidemic or other good reason, is an absolute nullity, where 
it deprives schoolable children of their rights to free instruc- 

Ihe manner of enforcing a child's rights to educational adtages, 
where such rights have been denied by the conacy 
of the electors of a rural school district, is therefore 
problem for solution. In this connection permit me to call 
r attention to the following constitutional and statutory 
visions: 

PPhe legislature sha.ll provide for the free instruction in the 
mon schools of this state of all persons between the ages 
ve and twenty -one years." (Constitution, article 8, section 

I The legal voters at any annual meeting shall determine by 
3 the number of mills ou the dollar of the assessed valion 
which shall be levied for all purposes, except for the 
ment of bonded indebtedness; which number shall not exi 
twenty-five mills in any year: provided, that in districts 
ing four children of school age, or less, the levy shall not 
eed the sum of $400.00 in any year; and in districts having 
•e than four and less than sixteen children of school age, 
levy shall not exceed the sum of $50. 00 per child in addition 
he above." (Compiled Statutes, chapter 79, subdivision 2, 
tion 11.) 

"They may also determine at each annual meeting the length 
of time a school shall be taught in the district the ensuing 
year, which, to entitle the district to any portion of the state 
f and, shall not be less than three months by a legally qualified 
teacher in the district which has less than thirty-five pupils, 
nor less than six months in districts tnat have between thirtyfive 
and one hundred pupils, inclusive, nor less than nine </seg>

OFFICIAL DECISIONS. 

pupils; and whether the money apportioned or voted for the 
support of the school therein shall be applied to the winter or 
summer term or a certain portion to each." (Sectionl4. ) 

"Every person having legal or actual control of any child 
or children not less than seven nor more than fourteen years 
of age shall each year cause such child or children to attend 
the public day school, for a period equal to two-thirds the 
number of weeks the school district in which -such person 
may live is required by the laws of the state to maintain a 
public school." (Subdivision 16, section 1. Other provisions 
follow excepting children under certain enumerated circumstances 
or conditions from the operation of this section. ) 

As already stated, the mandate of the law is that there shall 
be school. A fair interpretation of the statutes justifies the 
conclusions that there shall be at least three months of school 
each year. There must be at least one term. Schoolable 
children are required to attend school at least two months of 
every year. Provision is made for school in districts having 
four pupils or less. Upon the legal voters of a rural school 
district the law imposes the duty of voting revenue to run the 
schools. They may provide lor more than three months of 
school, but they cannot provide for less. They may determine 
at the annual meeting whether the school funds ' 'shall be 
applied to the winter or summer term or a certain portion to 
each." 

Ii'he "legal voters" of a school district who have so mueh 
ver, are not the whole district. They comprise only a f raca 
thereof. Children, as well as women who cannot vote, 
citizens of the district. Children are not only entitled to 
protection of the laws but they are entitled to educational 
raDtages for which the laws provide. The legal voters at 
annual school meeting therefore do not act for themselves 
ne, but they act for the entire district in relation to duties 
nted out by law. Legal .voters at an annual meeting are 
,rged with public duties relating to one of the most essential 
ctions of government. 

Eor purposes of the present inquiry it matters not whether 
legal voters at an annual meeting are regarded as public 
:ers or as individuals. The result in either situation is the </seg>

            <seg id="p080">

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

same, since the duties imposed upon them by law are duties 
which they owe to the public. If they are looked upon as 
officers, or as a board charged with public duties, then the 
power of the courts to compel them by mandamus to provide 
necessary revenue to support the schools cannot be doubted. 
Officers who are required by law to assess or levy taxes for 
school purposes may be required by mandamus to perform that 
duty. (State v. County Board, 6 Neb. 454; Hancock v. District, 78 
la. 550; HaU v. Selectman, 39 N..H. 511; Williams v. City of New 
Haven, 68 Conn. 263). 

If legal voters at an annual meeting are regarded as individuals, 
then they are individuals charged by law with the 
performance of a duty to the public. They cannot avoid a 
public duty on the ground that they are individuals. It has 
been decided by the Supreme Court of this state and by other 
courts that a duty enjoined by statute upon an individual may 
be enforced by mandamus, where the duty relates to the public 
welfare. (West Point Water Power Co. v. State, 49 Neb. 218; 
Hainet v. People, 19 111. App. 354.) 

E&gt;r the reasons stated I am of the opinion that the legal 
rs of a rural district, in a proper case, may be compelled 
landamus to vote revenue for school purposes. 

The remedy by mandamus, however, cannot be invoked before 
the annual meeting, for the reason that it cannot previously 
be known that the legal voters will attempt to evade 
their duty and refuse to vote the necessary funds, but after 
there has been an annual meeting at which they failed to vote 
necessary taxes, a parent or guardian of a schoolable child 
may maintain in the district court an action for a writ of mandamus 
to compel the legal voters to meet and vote revenue for 
school purposes. Failure of the electors to vote the tax at 
the time designated by statute does not prevent the legal performance 
of that duty at a later date. (Carothers v. i oard of 
ation, 16 W. Va. 527). Where the petitioner invoking such 
a remedy is one of the legal voters of the school district he 
should pray for a writ to compel the other legal voters to unite 
with him in voting such taxes. In the improbable event 
that no one can be found in the district who is willing to bring 
suit, still the rights of the children will not be lost. One of 
the duties imposed by statute upon the county superintendent </seg>

of public instruction is "to secure general and regular attendance 
of the children of his county upon the public schools." 
(Compiled Statutes, chapter 79, subdivision 7, section 8). He 
cannot perform this duty unless the schools are open, and the 
schools cannot be kept open without revenue. The power of 
the superintendent to require the attendance of pupils implies 
the power to invoke the aid of the courts to prevent the 
wrongful closing of the schools. Where the law imposes a 
duty upon an officer, and the duty cannot be performed without 
the assistance of the court, the officer may apply for a writ 
of mandamus. (Holland v. State, 23 Fla. 124; Merrill on Mandamus, 
section 231.) To prevent the wrongful closing of the 
public schools for the want of revenue the county superintendent, 
according to my understanding of the law, may apply to 
the district court for a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel 
the legal voters of a rural school district to meet and vote 
taxes pursuant to the requirements of the statute. This is the 
view taken by the Supreme Court of this state in a case involving 
the same principle. (State v. Holcomb, 46 Neb. 623. ) 

Very respectfully, 

(Signed:) F. N. Pkout, 

Lincoln, Jan. 10, 1902. Attorney General. 

Quorum. — As the law does not prescribe the number of voters 
necessary to constitute a quorum, any number of voters, when 
assembled at an annual district meeting pursuant to legal 
notice, would have authority to transact the business of such 
annual meeting. 

APPARATUS AND SUPPLIES 

Annual Meeting Cannot Limit Funds For Necessary Supplies. — 
There is no authority for the annual meeting to instruct the 
board not to exceed a certain sum in the purchase of necessary 
school supplies. 

Promissory Note for Payment of, IlkgaL— It is not within the 
authority of the school district board to issue a promissory 
note of the district in payment for goods or supplies furnished

would be upon the person signing the note, and not upon the 
district </seg>

See section 14, subdivision 2, School Laws. 

Fractional District. — The "one-fourth" apportionment should 
be made to each fractional district without regard to the question 
whether or not any children of school age reside in such 
fractional portion of the district. (See section 6, subdivision 

Term Required. — Where a district maintains the amount of 
school necessary under the provisions of section 14, subdivision 
2, and the proper reports are made by that district, it is entitled 
to share in the state apportionment, notwithstanding the 
fact that the voters at the annual meeting determined to have 
a greater length of school than was actually held in the district. 

Eime Taught by Unqualified Teacher. — The time taught by an 
ualified teacher cannot be taken into account and reckoned 
part of the time required by statute to entitle a district to 
re in the apportionment of the state school funds. 

BOARD — POWERS AND DUTIES 

/. The. Director 

A de facto Officer. — Where the director of a school district 
was appointed to fill a vacancy in November, 1875, and accepted 
the office, and thereafter performed all the duties pertaining 
to the same until April, 1877, held, in an action on the 
contract of a qualified teacher, signed by him as director in 
October, 1876, that the court will not inquire into the strict 
legality of his appointment. He being a de facto tjker, the 
district is bound by his acts. 9 Neb. 53. 

Iontract with Teacher. — It is the duty of the director to conit 
with the teacher when so authorized by the moderator 
treasurer, but should he refuse to make such contract, 
i it would be within the authority of the moderator and 
usurer to make the contract. The moderator and treasurer 
eno authority to make such contract until they have given 
director an opportunity to make it. 

Custodian. — The director is the proper person to keep the 
records of the district. 

Delegate Authority. — The director of a school district cannot 
legally delegate to his wife, or to any other person, the power </seg>

            <seg id="p083">

OFFICIAL DECISIONS. 

to act in his stead in contracting with a teacher. However, 
if such director should, in concurrence with one or more members 
of the district board, employ a teacher and agree upon 
the terms of the contract, he might instruct his wife, or other 
third person to draw up the instrument in accordance with 
such agreement and sign his name thereto: then it would be 
his contract. The mere physical act of a third party's writing 
the director's name under his direction does not involve any 
exercise of discretion or judgment. 

|»raw Orders on County Treasurer. -It is the duty of the dist 
director to issue orders upon the county treasurer in favor 
the district treasurer for money on hand in the county 
isury, in order that the district indebtedness and current 
«nses may be properly paid. In case the director refuses 
bout sufficient reason to issue such orders upon the county 
isurer, he may be compelled to do so by mandamus proceed 
s in the district court. See 22 Neb. r&gt;2. 

Furnish Supplies. — Section 13, subdivision 5 of School Laws, 
provides that no school officer shall be a party to any school 
contract for building or furnishing supplies except in his official 
capacity as a member of the board. This, of course, does 
not apply to supplies furnished in any other manner than un¦nitrnrf. 
Section 13, subdivision 4, expressly states that 
the director shall, with the concurrence of the other members 
of the board, provide the necessary appendages for the 
schoolhouse and keep an account of all expenses incurred by 
him as director. This section clearly implies the duty of the 
director to provide all necessary supplies in such a manner as 
he sees fit when not otherwise directed by the board. His account 
must be audited by the board; and if any items are 
found incorrect or any charges exorbitant, corrections can be 
made at any time. 

Oath. — It is not necessary that the director of a primary 
(common) school district take the oath of office. His filing an 
acceptance and assuming the duties of the office are all the 
necessary steps. 

EEficial Certificate of Director Evidence of Due Notice of Calling 
:ial Meeting. — .The official certificate of the director of 
hool district tbat notice of a certain special school meeting

meeting twenty days before the holding thereof, in three of 
the most public places in said district, which certificate was 
introduced and received in evidence under a stipulation of 
parties, in which it was recited that such "stipulation is for 
the purpose of using the same as testimony, instead of the 
plaintiff or defendant being obliged to take depositions to 
prove the same," held, to be evidence of the due publication of 
the notice of the calling of such special school meeting. 21 

No Power to Act Alone — The duties devolved upon the members 
of the school district board, or upon the moderator and 
director, by section 8 of chapter 79, Compiled Statutes, can 
only be performed by those two officers acting in conjunction. 
Any attempt on the part of either of them to perform such 
duties alone and without the joint action of the other, is ineffective 
and void. 22 Neb., 48. 

2 The Moderator 

Cannot be Compelled to Sign Contract.— There is no law compelling 
a moderator to sign a contract for supplies. His 
signature is not necessary to the validity of the contract, but 
if the contract was made at a meeting of which he had no 
notice, the contract itself is called in question. It has been 
decided that such contract is illegal. A contract with a 
teacher is an exception to this rule. 

Ilandamos Will Compel Him to Perform His Duty.— A moderator 
used to sign an order properly drawn upon the treasurer 
the matter was submitted for adjudication to the county 
enntendent, who, after investigation, found that the ofr 
refused to sign the order for insufficient reasons. Held, 
t under the statute the county superintendent had the right, 
behalf of the district, to apply to the proper court for a 
it of mandamus to compel the officer to perform his duty. 
Neb., 655. 

I Way Vote — The moderator has a right to vote at school disct 
meetings on all questions pertaining to school matters, 
case of a tie vote, however, he could not cast a second vote 
break the tie. 

No Power to Act Alone. — See "director."

Officer de Facto — When a person elected to the office of moderator 
of a school district fails to file with the director of the 
district his written acceptance of the office, but immediately 
after his election enters upon the discharge of his official 
duties, by presiding at school district meetings, countersigning 
school orders and performing all other duties required by 
law of such officer, without objection from any one, for more 
than a year, held, that the failure to file a written acceptance 
did not forfeit his title to the office. 30 Neb. 360. 

I Refusal to Sign Report to County Clerk of Lawful Tax Levy. — One 
moderator of a school district, refused, to sign a report to 
county clerk of the lawful taxes voted by his district at the 
mal meeting. Held, that it being a duty enjoined by law, 
would be compelled by mandamus to sign the same. 11 

i. Th' Treasurer. 

K.ccount for Funds. — It is perfectly proper for the moderator 
director at any time to demand of the treasurer that he acnt 
for funds which^he may have on hand. 

Ilppears for District.— It is the duty of the treasurer of a school 
trict to appear for and in behalf of his district in all suits 
ught by or against the same, unless other directions are 
en bv the qualified voters at a district meeting, except his 
jrests are adverse to the district, in which case the director, 
the absence of other directions, shall appear. When the 
ion is not brought^by the treasurer, the petition should state 
e cause. 

Bond.— See Bonds— Official. 

Iustodian of Funds.— The statute as well as the Supreme 
irt recognizes the district treasurer as the legal and proper 
x&gt;dian of the funds for his district, provided, of course, the 
I treasurer has furnished bonds as provided in sections 4 
8. subdivision 4, school laws. A district treasurer who 
complied with these provisions could apply to the district 
rt for a writ of mandamus to compel the director and modsor 
to issue warrants on the county treasurer in his behalf 
the funds belonging to his district. 

Biold Over. — In case a district treasurer-elect fails to file a

if elected to the office; and he has twenty days after the annual 
meeting in which to file a new bond. 

Liability. — Moneys in the treasury must be used for the purpose 
of paying outstanding warrants, and the treasurer is liable 
under his bond if he uses money for any other purpose as long 
as there are warrants outstanding against the fund. 

Must not Pay out Money Except on Orders. — The law does not 

template that the treasurer shall pay any bills out of moneys 
nging to the district except through the regular channels: 
on orders drawn by the director and countersigned by the 
erator. 

tefusal to Pay Orders. — If the treasurer refuse through conacy 
or for insufficient reasons to pay the orders legally 
wn upon the district, it shall be the duty of the county supitendent 
on behalf of the district to apply to the proper 
rt for a writ of mandamus to compel the officer to perform 
duty. 

EIea=e. — A school district has no authority to release its 
iurer from liability for money lost or misapplied by him. 
b. 293. 

Surety — The director and moderator should not become surety 
upon the treasurer's bond, for the reason that they are the 
officers whose duty it is to approve such bond ; but after having 
siened the bond they would be estopped from denying the validity 
of the same, and would doubtless be held liable thereon 
in the event of the defalcation of the treasurer. 

Ireasurer and His Banker. — It is not within the power of the 
isurer of a school district by a general deposit of funds 
i by virtue of his office to create between such district and 
banker the relation of debtor and creditor. A banker by rering 
on deposit from a school district treasurer funds known 
»e held by the latter in his official capacity becomes thereby 
ustee for the beneficial owner with respect to such funds, 
the same may, upon his insolvency, be recovered by the

after the annual meeting does not forfeit his office. His 
entrance upon the discharge of the duties of the office is 
sufficient. The filing of a bond by the treasurer-elect is held 
to be sufficient acceptance. 

Admit Non-resident Pupil. — See section 4, subdivision 5, School 

fppointment, Vacancy. — Where a tie vote occurs in the elecof 
a school district officer, it is not within the province of 
county superintendent to appoint an officer. 

I in outgoing officer is not competent to assist in appointing 
successor. If a vacancy exists in the office the old officer is 
longer competent to act on, behalf of the district, and 
ancy can be filled by appointment or election. 

ILudit Bills. — A bill against a school district should be made 
i in due form, itemized, and presented to the board for their 
isideration. Action should be taken thereon and the warit 
issued in acordance with such action. The director should 
justified in demanding an itemized statement. Heisresponle 
for drawing orders on the district and should know defin[y 
for what purpose the money of the district is used, so that 
may be able to report to the voters at the annual meeting. 
e director must also make out an itemized statement of every 
I he presents for expenses incurred by him in his official 
»acity. 

I Certain Contracts not Binding Upon Districts. — A contract 
ered into and signed by persons styling themselves as 
ector and moderator of a school district, is their individual 
(tract, and not binding upon the district. The action of a 
jority of a school district board will not bind the district, 
hout notice to or participation therein of the other mem•s.

he is a de facto officer so long as he is permitted to act in that 
capacity, and his acts as such officer are binding upon the 
district. 

Election. — Section 1. subdivision 3 of the School Laws provides 
that school district officers shall "be elected by ballot. 
However, in case, by the proper motion being carried, the 
secretary or clerk is instructed to cast the ballot of the meeting 
for an officer, it would be construed to be an election by 
ballot within the meaning of the section just referred to. 

No one can be elected a member of the school board unless 
he receives a majority of all the votes cast. 

Kie school law makes no provision for casting lots in case 
tie vote on member of a school board, and it is not a legal 
ess of selecting an officer. Another ballot should be taken. 

K There a district officer is elected by acclamation for the full 
a at the annual meeting and # has performed the duties of 
office for a time extending beyond the next annual election, 
s entitled to the office the full term for which hj was elected. 

Ernish Supplies. — A member of the committee on purchase 
supplies shall not be a party to furnish supplies to the 
¦ict, except in his official capacity as a member of the 
d. See Section 13, Subdivision 5, School Laws. 1901. 

General Ore of School. — The district school boards shall have 
the general care of the schools, and shall have the power to 
cause pupils to be taught in such branches and classified in 
such fgrades or departments as may seem 'best adapted to a 
course of study which the school boards of any county shall 
establish by the consent and advice of the county superintendent 
thereof, and the school of each district shall cause a 
record of thejadvancement in each branch of study of all the 
pupils to be kept in a 'book to provided for this purpose; 
and it is hereby made the^duty of each district board, or of 
one of their'n umber empowered by the board, to attend all 
meetings called "by the county superintendent |for the purpose 
of^adopting or revising'a course of study for the advancement 
of the district'schools/of making rules and regulations as they

regular attendance and progress of children at school. See 
Section 3, Subdivision 5, School Laws. 

I [old Over. — When a person elected to a school district office 
s to qualify, the old officer holds over till his successor is 
:ted or appointed and qualified, unless the old officer holds 
office by appointment. In such case there is a vacancy and 
Vacancy may filled by appointment of the board, or 
,n election at a special meeting called for that purpose. 

Liability. — The other members of the board should not be 
sureties on the treasurer's bond. treasurer should not be 
allowed to draw money from the county treasury until his 
bond has been filed and approved ; and the individual members 
of the board authorizing such draft, in the absence of the 
necessary bond, would be liable to the district for any loss 
resulting therefrom. 

tjalification. — One who is not a resident of a school district 
)t eligible to any district office therein. All the qualificanecessary 
for a school district officer is that he be a legal 
r in the school district. " 


Ixords an i Papers. — When a district voter is legally elected 
a annual meeting to a school district office, and files his 
ptance within ten days after such election, he is entitled 
ossession of the books and papers belonging to such office 
he second 'Monday of July following his election; and any 
iute that may arise between him and his predecessor is no 
ind for the remaining members of the board to declare 
office vacant. It is the duty of the outgoing officer to 
i over to his successor the official papers, records, etc., 
aining to his office. 

Removal. — Two members of a school board cannot of their 
own volition remove the other member from office. The only 
way to remove a school district officer is by proper action before 
a court of competent jurisdiction. 

Ezsignation. — If an officer resigns at an annual district meetand 
his resignation is accepted by the board at the meeting, 
voters present may elect a successor to complete the term 
ffice. 

I 'he general rule is that the resignation of an officer should 
presented to the board or the officer who has authority to 
the vacancy so created. At the time of the annual meeting </seg>

            <seg id="p090">
500 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

the resignation of a district officer should be presented to the 
meeting; at any other time, to the district board. 

Iile of Schoolhoose. — A school district board cannot legally 
a schoolhouse or site without being directed to do so by 
legal voters at a district meeting. When the district has 
uthorized them by a two-thirds vote (Sec. 15, Sub. 2, School 
rs) it would seem proper for the board to advertise and 
the same to the highest bidder. 

Salary Provided for by Each Annual Meeting. — In order legally 
to pay the school district officers a salary, it is necessary that 
provisions for such payment be made at the annual district 
meeting; but it is not within the authority of the annual meeting 
to make provision for the payment of such salary for more 
than the ensuing year. 

(acancy, How Filled.— When vacancies occur in school boards, 
vacancies are filled by appointment or by election at a 
:ial district meeting. If by appointment, the appointee 
r es until the next annual meeting; if by special election, he 
r es for the remainder of the unexpired term. 

CONTRACTS 

Board Member Must not Have Pecuniary Interest. — Section 13 
of subdivision 5 reads as follows: "No school officer shall be 
party to any school contract for building or furnishing supplies, 
except in his official capacity as a member of the board." 
The spirit of section 13, subdivision 4, seems to authorize the 
director to furnish, under the direction of the board, in such a 
way as he may see fit, such supplies and repairs as are necessary 
for the proper maintenance of the school. It seems 
equally clear that the statutes give the district board no authority 
to make extensive repairs or to incur large or unusual 
expenses without the consent of the district meeting. Any action 
of public officers is voidable if vitiated by fraud. When 
school district officers employ each other for services to the 
district involving pecuniary profit, the transaction bears on its 
face a strong suggestion of collusion and fraud, which presumption, 
however, may be overcome by competent evidence 
of good faith.

the publishers. It is left entirely to the board's discretion, 
but no such contract can be legally made for a term of years 
under the provisions of this act until the proper bond is filed 
by the publishers. 

i Relationship.— "No contract with a teacher shall be valid uns 
agreed to either by all the members of the district board 
by two members of such board who are not related to the 
irth degree to the said teacher and whose terms of office exid 
beyond the date of the term of school contracted for." 
regard to a relative hiring a relative, the law applies to 
sstions of consanguinity, but not to marital relationship. 

Teacher's. — The director and one other member of the board 
may contract with a teacher without notifying the third member, 
but a contract made by the other members of the board 
without first giving the director an opportunity to make the 
contract would be void. They may make a valid contract, 
however, if the director refuses to do so. See section 11, subdivision 
4. 

COURSE OF STUDY 

i\ Foreign Language. — If it is the wish of a large majority of 
i patrons of the district that a foreign language be taught, 
j board would have authority to allow this to be a part of 
; course of study. A foreign language should not be used 
the medium of instruction in other branches, but may be 
died simply as a language. 

Right to Select Studies. — The parent has a right to make a 
reasonable selection of the studies he desires his child to pursue 
from the course prescribed by the district board, and this 
selection must be respected by the trustees, as the right of the 
parent in this regard is superior to that of the trustees and the 
teacher. 31 Neb. 552. 

Kho Prescribes the Course of Study. — See "General Care of 
k&gt;1" under "Board as a Body." 

SCHOOLHOUSE 

Care and Custody of. — This question has given rise to much 
controversy, and many disputed points still remain unsettled. 
The following opinions seem to be well founded: </seg>

            <seg id="p092">
502 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

1. The schoolhouse was erected for school purposes, and 
cannot legally be used for any other purpose that will interfere 
with its use for this. 

tA room in a schoolhouse not needed for school purposes 
r be leased for any purpose not injurious to the school or a 
¦iment to the usefulness of the other parts of the building 
school purposes ; but the contract for such lease cannot ex- 
I beyond the close of the school year. 

3. The right to determine whether a schoolhouse shall be 
used for other than school purposes belongs to the voters of 
the district when assembled in a lawful manner ; but when the 
district has not acted on the subject the board has control until 
some action is taken by the district. But neither board nor 
district has any right to allow the schoolhouse to be used in 
such a way as to interfere with the school. 

4. If the voters of the district wish to use the schoolhouse 
for meetings of various kinds, there seems to be no good reason 
why they may not so use it so long as they do not interfere 
with the school work. The decisions of the supreme courts of 
Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and many other states confirm this 
view. Kansas, New Jersey and West Virginia confer upon 
the trustees, by statute, the right to use the house for such 
purposes. In the absence of any decision by our own courts, 
the above rulings will govern this department. 

Insurance. — Section 3462, chapter 43, Compiled Statutes of 
Nebraska for 1901, lists country schoolhouses aud contents 
among the things named in said section that may be legally 
insured in mutual insurance companies. 

I [umber, in Rural District. — While it is a very unwise policy 
a rural district to have its money invested in two schoolses, 
there is no legal objection to such a plan, provided 
i and equal'privileges are given to each and every pupil in 
district. 

Plans for Buildin?. — Subject to certain restrictions, the qualified 
electors of school districts are entrusted with the power to 
determine what sort of a schoolhouse shall be erected, and 
the extent of the expenditures therefor ; and when so determined 
the school board has no authority to change the same, 
and thus bind the district for an increased expenditure. </seg>

            <seg id="p093">
503 

OFFICIAL DECISIONS. 

Removal. — It is not within the authority of the voters at a 
special meeting to move the schoolhouse. This may be done 

Repair. — The amount of money to be used in the repair of^the 
schoolhouse is in the discretion of the board to determine. 

Sale. — A school district board (other than in cities) cannot 
legally sell a schoolhouse or site without being directed to do 
so by the legal voters at a district meeting. When the district 
has so authorized them by a two- thirds vote (section 15, subdivision 
2) it would seem proper for the board to advertise and 
sell the same to the highest bidder. 

SCHOOLHOUSE SITE 

Adverse Possession. — When a school district has held open, 
notorious, and adverse possession of a certain schoolhouse site 
for a period of ten years or more, there is no doubt that such 
site is the legal site of the district. 

Improving. — A school district has a right to put down a well 
a site on which the schoolhouse is located, even if they have 
deed for said site. 

Lease. — If a school district fails to have a lease for its schoolhouse 
site recorded, and a deed is given to another party for 
land containing said site, the lease the district has from the 
first owner is no longer in force. It is necessary to secure a 
lease from the present owner and have it recorded. 

Sale. — A school district board cannot legally sell a schoolhouse 
or site without being directed so to do by action of the 
legal voters at a district meeting. 

I lection and Change. — The phrase "designate a schoolhouse 
" has reference to the first location of a schoolhouse site 
i newly organized district. The county superintendent's 
tority to determine where such site shall be established, 
n no site can be determined upon by the voters of the dis, 
has reference also to the tirst location of a schoolhouse 
in a newly organized district. The county superintendent 
no authority to determine the schoolhouse site when it has 
i once established. Neither is there any authority for 
urning the annual meeting for the purpose of changing the 
when once established. The Supreme Court in its interation 
of the law in section 8, subdivision 2, school laws, </seg>

            <seg id="p094">
504 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

said: "It will be observed under the foregoing statute that a 
schoolhouse site when once established can be changed only at 
an annual school district meeting. There is no authority of 
law for changing such a site at a special meeting." 

Where is the Site ? — The literal and legal schoolhouse site is 
the place actually occupied by the schoolhouse. All distances 
relative to site and transfers are measured from the schoolhouse. 
Therefore, a moving of the schoolhouse to a different 
part of the school grounds is a change of site and can be done 
only under the provisions of section 8, subdivision 2, school 

SPECIAL MEETING 

Call. — Upon the presentation of a petition signed by five legal 
voters.of the district, the board, at their discretion, or any 
member of the board, may call a special meeting by posting 
the proper notices. However, it is not obligatory upon the 
members of the board to call such a meeting. 

iannot Determine School Term. — A special school district 
ting has no authority to determine the length of school to 
held in the district the ensuing year, nor to determine at 
,t time in the year such term shnll be held. The legal 
on of the annual meeting upon these subjects is final. 

Ixmty Superintendent May Call, When. — In case a district has 
school officers, the county superintendent should call a 
sial meeting for the election of school officers upon the petiof 
five legal voters of said district. In case there are not 
legal voters in said district, then every legal voter should 
i the petition for a special meeting. If said voters should 
ise to sign such petition, then the county superintendent 
jld apply to the district court for a writ of mandamus to 
pel such voters to make legal provision for school in such 
rict. 

Reconsider Action. — A majority of the legal voters of a district, 
at a spasial meating, may reconsider their previous action of a 
special meeting. 

taestions which can be determined only at an annual meetcannot 
be changed at a special meeting. 

Elidity. — No business can be transacted at a special district 
ing except that specified in the call for said meeting; but 
ict of doing business not mentioned in the call does not </seg>

[II. HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS 

|:cepting Office. — In such case, where the new board meet 
in ten days after the election and elect one of their own 
ber as director, and each files written acceptances of office 
him, under the belief that he is the proper custodian 
eof, the mistake made in the election of the custodian 
le acceptances will not destroy the right of the trustees 
le office after the expiration of the official terms of their 
ecessors. But such custodian should at once deposit the 
ptances with the director then in office, in order that they 
it be preserved with the records of ||the district. 17 N 


C innot Change Back to Former Organization. — After a school 
district has once been legally organized under subdivision 6 of 
the School Laws, the mere fact that the enumeration of pupils 
falls below 150 would not of itself destroy the organization as 
a High school district. The statutes make no provision for 
changing a High school district back to a primary (common 
school) district. 

Change from High School to City District Organization.— The 
school law is rather indefinite in setting forth the steps necy 
to change from a High school district to the city district; 
but from the latter part of the provision in section 3, 
subdivision 14, all that is necessary is for the mayor to give 
public notice to the electors of the district of the number of 
persons who shall be chosen by them as members of the I 
of education for the school district at the ensuing annual election 
of city officers. 

Commencement of Term. — Under the provisions of section 1 of 
subdivision 6 of the school law, as amended in 1885. when a 
school district elects six trustees to act as the officers of the 
district in lieu of the board of three, the official terms of the 
old board expire on the second Monday of July following. 
Until that time the trustees-elect are not the proper officers 
of the district. 17 Neb. 553.

ing more desirable because less precarious, and therefore retains 
in the profession the services of the most competent 
persons, and in my opinion the legislature wisely left the 
matter to the sound discretion of the board. It may be urged 
that in some instances the authority to employ a superintendent 
for two or three years may be used to forestall the action 
of the newly elected members or to defeat the will of the 
people, but since only one-third of the members go out at a 
time, the danger is not very great when compared with the 
advantages. Every power vested in public officials is liable 
to abuse. But the fact that the power may be abused is not a 
sufficient reason for holding that it does not exist. Official integrity 
of public officers is properly presumed. A desire on 
their part for the prosperity of the schools whose affairs they 
manage, and a proper regard for the rights and opinions of th« 
incoming members of the board, can, in most cases, be relied 
upon with confidence. 

Ejction of Teachers.— In a board of six members it requires 
affirmative vote of four members to elect teachers, fill 
ncies in the irembership of the board and make any apiriation 
of money. 

Eie law regarding a relative hiring a relative applies only 
rural or village district as organized under subdivision 3, 
a board of three members. 

Power to Adopt and Enforce Reasonable Rules. — The board of 
trustees of a high school has power to adopt and enforce appropriate 
and reasonable rules and regulations for the government 
and management of the schools under its control. 35 

A rule which makes it the duty of a teacher to keep a record 
of the standing of each pupil in the studies pursued by 
him, of his attendance and deportment, to send each month by 
the pupil a written report of the same to his parent or 
guardian, and which requires such parent or guardian to sign 
and return the same to the teacher, is a reasonable rule. 35 

Kelathre Authority of School Officers and Parents.— The school 
.tees of a high school have authority to classify and grade 
scholars in the district and cause them to be taught in such 
irtments as they may deem expedient ; they may also pre- </seg>

scribe the courses of study and text-books for the use of the 
school, and such reasonable rules and regulations as they may 
think needful. They may also require prompt attendance, respectful 
deportment and diligence in study. The parent, how* 
ever, has a right to make a reasonable selection from the prescribed 
courses of study for his child to pursue, and this selection 
must be respected by the trustees, as the right of the 
parent in that regard is superior to that of the trustees and 
the teacher. 31 Neb. 552. 

Reinstatement of Pupil. — An action of mandamus will lie and 
may be maintained to reinstate a pupil in a acbool, if the action 
of the officer or officers by which the partv was refused 
admission to or continuance in the school wan an arbitrary or 
capricious exercise of authority. "&gt;7 N&gt;

Examining Committee.— The board of education of a city district 
organized under the provisions of subdivision 14 is authorized 
by section 19 of that subdivision to appoint mm esam 
ining committee whose certificate entitles the holder to all the 
benefits arising from any teacher's certificate issued la tfcfc)

Superintendent, Certificate of.— A superintendent of city schools 
is an officer of the board rather than a teacher, and the statutory 
provision makimg it necessary for teachers to hold certificates 
does not apply to superintendents of schools organized 
under subdivisions 14 and 17. However, boards of education 
may make any requirements in their rules and regulations 
which their judgment dictates. 

Superintendent, Election of.— The election of a superintendent 
for a term of three years tends to make the profession of 
teaching more desirable because less precarious, and therefore 
retains in the profession the services of the most competent 
persons, and in my opinion the legislature wisely left the 
matter to the sound discretion of the board. It may be urged 
that in some instances the authority to employ a superintendent 
for two or three years may be used to forestall the action 
of the newly elected members or to defeat the will of the

single, independent district, in no way affecting or interfering 
with the work'or organization of each individual district. The

legally levied and collected, for the purpose of paying the 
tuition of the graduates of the rural or common schools at the

Free Attendance at Nearest High School. — If a majority of the 
votes cast in any county is in favor of the establishment of the 
adjunct district, then those pupils whose education cannot 
profitably be carried further in the rural or common schools 
of such county will be entitled to free attendance at the nearest 
High school of approved grade in the county of their residence. 
If a majority of the votes cast in any county is against the establishment 
of the adjunct district, then none of the pupils 
of the rural or common schools in such county will be entitled 
to free attendance at any High school during that school year. 
In a county where a majority vote is against the establishment 
of such adjunct district, the question may be again submitted 
at any subsequent annual meeting. In cases where the question 
carries, the adjunct district may be discontinued by a 
majority of those electors voting in the manner providing for 
its establishment. 

Free Public High Schools. — If a High school desires recognition, 
the district must organize as a High school district 
under the provisions of subdivision 6 at the annual meeting. 
However, a district can not organize under the provisions of 
subdivision 6 unless the census shows more than 150 children 
of school age. It might be possible to annex parts of adjoining 
districts to help out in the increase of the census to the requisite

Renewal and Endorsement. — In case a county superintendent 
endorse a certificate which is not in force in any county at the

renewal by a county superintendent of a certificate which was 
issued by himself or by his predecessor is not an endorsement 
under the provisions of section 4, subdivision 7 of the School 
Laws. Section 5, subdivision 10 authorizes, by implication, 
the county superintendent to renew a certificate. Teachers 
should present their certificates for renewal before their expiration. 
This will assist in maintaining their legal and professional 
standing as teachers. County superintendents may, 
in their discretion, refuse to renew certificates which have

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPOBT. 

Registration. — There is no statutory provision authorizing 
the county superintendent to register a professional state 
certificate or a University of Nebraska state teacher's certificate. 
The same is true of the certificates issued by Belle vue 
college and Doane college. It is recommended, however, that 
county superintendents register these certificates (without 
fees) in order that their records may show who are legally 
qualified teachers in their respective counties. 

" Each holder of a certificate from the common school course, 
or a diploma from the higher course, of the State Normal 
school shall, before he begins to teach, register the same in 
the office of the county superintendent of the county in which 
he shall teach ; and for such registration he shall pay a fee of 
one dollar, which* shall go into the institute fund of said 
county. The same is true of two year state certificates and 
three year state certificates granted by the Fremont Normal 
school and the Nebraska Wesleyan university. 

Teachers in city districts are exempt from registration of 
certificates by the county superintendent. 

Renewal. — The renewal of the elementary (two year) certificates 
issued by the State Normal school of Nebraska, Fremont 
Normal school and the Nebraska Wesleyan university is without 
warrant of law, and is, therefore, null and void. 

STUDENT. 

Examination- — It is the intent of the free high school attendance 
law (sections 5-8, subdivision 6) that students' certificates, 
provided for therein, should be issued by the county superintendent 
chiefly upon graduation from the country schools. 
There will no doubt be cases, however, in which it is desirable 
and advisable for the county superintendent to examine candidates 
at his own office at various times throughout the year. It 
is recommended that when such examinations are found necessary, 
they be held in connection with the monthly examination 
of teachers. It is especially urged that county superintendents 
make the requirements for students' certificates in all cases 
sufficiently thorough and searching so that no certificate will 
be issued to any student who is unable to take up and pursue 
advantageously and creditably the work of the ninth grade in 
the high schools of the county. </seg>

Fee— There is no authority in the statute for the county 
superintendents' charging a fee for examining candidates for 
students' certificates. 

COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT 

Authority Prescribed by Statute.— See 6 Neb 

Ixclusive Authority on Examinations. — The statutes empower 
me but the county superintendent to examine candidates. 
county teachers' certificates. He alone must be renponsifor 
the markings and standings baso.l on such examinals 
; but there seems to ba no statutory restriction aa to the 
hod he must employ in satisfying himself as to the "tandof 
each candidate in each branch. 

Must Investigate Request for Writ of Mandamus.— Upon request 

I a writ of mandamus, section 11, subdivision 3, it becomes 
duty of the county superintendent to investigate the rn it 
at once; but the law does not require him to find (dacidf) 
t the officer complained of refuses through contumacy or for 
efficient reasons. The county superintendent exercises in 
i matter judicial authority, and he cannot be compiled by 
idamus proceedings to bring in a particular finding or deon. 
If the county superintendent should see fit to cornice 
mandamus proceedings against the officer complained 
tha action shoull ba br ) l^ht "on bih\\t of t

Office, Location of. — The statutes (section 3, subdivision 7,) do 
not provide that the county superintendent shall keep hi 
fice at the county seat, as is specially provided in *9 of 
certain other county officers; namely, the county clerk and the 
register of deeds. In the absence of such provision. »• 
view of the fact that a large part of the work of the county 
superintendent is required to be done away from the county 
seat, thus preventing his being in attendance at any office 
every working day, the countv superintendent has a right to 
perform the clerical duties of his office at such point as in to 
him most convenient ; he must, however, attend at the county 
seat on the third Saturday of each month for the purpose of </seg>

tie duty of the county commissioners to provide a suitable 
n or office for che accommodation of tne county superinlent. 
In case the county commissioners have, in accord-3 
with this provision, provided a suitable room or office at 
county seat for the county superintendent, they could not 
required to provide another room or office for him at 
ther place. 

Salary. — By referring to section 4731, chapter 79, Compiled 
Statutes of Nebraska for 1901, it will be seen that the county 
commissioners, or a majority of them, present at the first regular 
session of each year, shall determine the compensation to 
be paid the county superintendent, but such compensation 
shall not be less than the minimum salary fixed for that class in 
which his county belongs in all counties having a school population 
of two thousand or more. In counties having a school 
population of less than two thousand, a per diem of not less 
than three and one-half dollars, or more than five dollars for 
each day actually employed in the duties of his office, is fixed 
by the statutes. The number of days necessary for the duties 
of his office shall be detei mined by the county superintendent, but 
the number of days so employed shall not be less than the 
number of school districts in said county, and one for each 
precinct thereof for the examination of teachers. As to the 
number of days necessary for the duties of his office , however, 
the superintendent should be governed by reason, precedent, 
and efficient work. He should present an estimate to the 
county commissioners at the first regular session each year of 
the number of days necessary for the duties of his office. 
Said commissioners should include in their estimate for the 
salaries of county officers for the year this estimate of the 
county superintendent. 

I is evident that it was not the intention of the legislature to 
t the salary of the county superintendent to the minimum 
pensation. Next to the teacher, the life of the rural school 
le county superintendent. Facts show that in nine cases 
of ten, where there is real progress, you will find an earnwide-awake, 
up-to-date county superintendent. In such 
is, it would seem the part of economy, as well as justice and 
lorn, not to limit his salary to the minimum fixed by the 
ute, but to fix it according to the amount and efficiency of his 
k. </seg>

legal voters in any district becomes less than three, the county 
superintendent shall act as the third officer of such district. 

Shall Appoint Officers of Board, When?— See section 2, ssbdi 

vision 6. 

Shall Examine Reports of District Boards.— Section 10 of subdi 
vision 7 provides: "The county superintendent shall examine 
into the correctness of the reports of the district board*, and 
may, when necessary, require the same to be amended." This 
implies the authority of the county superintendent to examine 
the records of the district in the hands of any district officer, 
whenever, in his judgment, it is deemed necessary: and it is 
the duty of the district officers to produce such records upon 
demand of the county superintendent.

Apportionment. — See Apportionment of State Fund* — Tim* 
Required. 

Appropriation of Funds. — See (11), page 155, School Laws, 1901 

Ikmd Sinking Fond, Investment of.— It would be proper for tb» 
nty treasurer to invest fifty per cent of the fund* in his 
ids for the payment of the bonds of a certain school district 
registered warrants of that district, after b« has been SO 
horized by the county board in accordance with toe prorids 
of section 15, chapter 93, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska 
1891, and after the board of said school district has author 
i him so to do, in accordance with the provisions of section 
of the same chapter. The district warrants so paid by to*

Building Fund. — The annual district meeting has authority to 
vote from year to year a fund for building purposes. The 
money belonging to such fund may be paid oat by the district 
treasurer for no other purpose than that for which it was 
raised, unless such money be transferred to another fond by 
action of the voters at a district meeting in accordance with </seg>

            <seg id="p112">
522 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

the provisions of section 13, subdivision 2 of the School Laws. 

Di bursements. — The district treasurer is authorized by law to 
pay out the funds of the district only upon order of the director 
countersigned by the moderator, and he is answerable to the 
district for all moneys received by him on behalf of the district 
and not paid out upon such orders. 

Fees and Costs Unclaimed.— All unclaimed fees and costs which 
have been actually paid into the court and not demanded for 
the period prescribed by statute, whether arising in civil or 
criminal cases, should be paid over to the treasurer of the 
county and by him credited to the common school fund of the 
county. County warrants issued in satisfaction of such fees, 
not having been actually paid into court, would not, in my 
judgment, be subject to such forfeiture to the school fund. 

Fines and Licenses. — Our statutes do not specify the particular 
fund into which the money derived from fines and licenses shall 
be placed. It remains, therefore, at the discretion of the board 
of education to apportion money so received to such funds as 
may in their judgment require it. This does not apply to fines 
and licenses paid into the county fund and apportioned by the 
county superintendent among the districts of the county. 
Funds so apportioned can be legally applied only to the pay 
ment of teachers' wages. 

Local fines arising from the rules, by laws, and ordinances 
of cities, etc., are to be paid over to such cities, but all such 
fines, penalties, and license moneys must go to the support of 
the school of such city district. 

General Fund Applicable to any Valid Claim.— Money derived 
from taxation, voted to the credit of the general fund, in accordance 
with section 11, subdivision 2, of the School Laws, 
may be legally paid upon order of the director, countersigned 
by the moderator, in satisfaction of any valid claim against 
the district. 

Insurance Money. — Where a schoolhouse built with funds derived 
from the sale of school district bonds was burned, and 
the insurance money paid to the district, such insurance money 
took the place of the money derived from said bonds, and could 
legally be applied, in the first instance, only to the purpose 
for which the said bonds were originally issued. </seg>

            <seg id="p113">

Payment for Instruction in Private Schools. — It would not be 
within the authority of the district to authorize the school 
board to provide for a part or all of the instruction to be given 
in a private school and to pay for it out of the public school 

Recovery when paid to Unqualified Teacher. -District money 
paid to a person as teacher, who is not legally qualified, can 
be recovered from the individual members of the board 
authorizing such expenditure. 

I iking — Custodian in Cities. — The treasurer of the board of 
ation in cities is the proper custodian of the school funds 
te district, and the county treasurer, who is the collector 
1 taxes in the county, should turn over to the board of 
ation on their order the sinking fund just as he does other 
ey raised for said district. Section 13, subdivision 15, 
ing the county treasurer custodian of the sinking fund, 
ies only to school districts that are not organized under 
livision 14, schools in cities, or subdivision 17, schools in 
•opolitan cities. 

Iransfer — The statutes provide (section 13, subdivision "J. ) 
; money in the district treasury may be transferred from 
fund to another ' 'after the purpose for which it was raised 
been accomplished and after all debts for which the fund 
able have been discharged." It is held that "the purpose 
been accomplished" within the meaning of the statute 
;n the voters decide to abandon such purpose or to reduce 
amount required therefor. 

Tuition for Instruction in Neighboring District. — See section 4c, 
subdivision 5, School Laws.

Statutes of Nebraska for 1901, in addition to the fees for 
certificates and institute as provided therein, says : 

"To which sum thus raised the county commissioners ahnU 
add each year the sum of twenty-five dollars from the general 
fund of the county, and if they deem it desirable they may increase 
the amount to any sum not to exceed one hundred dollars

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Attendance Compulsory. — The matter of compulsory attendance 
at the county institute is discretionary with the county 
superintendent. He is empowered to annul or revoke the 
certificates of those who do not attend. 

Itcuse From. — Teachers who hold professional certificates 
entitled to some considerations to which those are not enid 
who nold third, second, or even first grade county certifiis. 
It seems to me unjust and a lack of recognition of 
&gt;larship, experience and professional spirit to force teachers 
ling professional certificates to the same requirements as 
»e holding second and third grade certificates. I am most 
ihatically in favor of excusing teachers from institute who 
nd any good summer school six weeks or more as compared 
) the one or two weeks institute. 

E tractors — Certificate and Employment. — In this state it is not 
3sary that instructors in institutes should hold licenses or 
ficates. The matter of employing such instructors rests 
ely with the county superintendents. 

Must Teachers Make up Time Lost in Attending Institute? — Section 
2, subdivision 10, reads: 

"It shall be the duty of the county superintendent and 
teachers to attend the institute of their county, or district in 
case of joint institutes, at least one week for the purpose of 
comparing notes, planning or outlining the work for the current 
or coming school year, and to study methods of school 
work and the science and art of teaching." 

Section 6, subdivision 10, says : 

EFhe county superintendent shall notify all teachers and the 
•ds of all school districts in his county of the time when 
institute will begin, and all common schools shall be closed 
ng the continuance of the institute." 

Section 7 of the same subdivision provides : 

Krhe county superintendent may, at his discretion, revoke 
certificate of or refuse to grant a certificate to any teacher 
&gt; fails or refuses to attend the county or joint institute." 

Kote the application to "common schools" in section 6, subsion 
10. The nearest approach we have of an existing 
ute to a definition of "common schools" is found in section 
nbdivision 6. Said definition is as follows: </seg>

OFFICIAL DECISIONS. 

"Schools not having more than eigh f - grades or years of study 
shall, for the purposes of this act, be deemed common schools, and 
schools having more than eight grades shall be deemed high 

The decision of this department, therefore, applies'only to the 
common schools. In the light of the law quoted, and upon the 
advice of the attorney general, it is held that teachers in common 
schools in this state are not obliged to make up the time 
to the district during which schools were closed on account of 
institute; provided, of course, that said teachers were in attendance 
at said institute, and that there was no provision in 
the contract to the contrary. 

Emc and Time of Holding. — It is discretionary with the 
ty superintendent as to the time and place of holding: 
tute. 

SCHOOL DISTRICTS 

Annexation of Unorganized Territory. — The superintendent 
has discretionary power to annex to any existing district any 
territory not organized into districts, upon petitions signed by 
one-half of the legal voters in the said district and in the said 
territory proposed to be annexed. But where there are no petitioners 
in the unorganized territory, it is obvious that no petition 
can be presented to the county superintendent; and 
therefore he cannot act in the matter. 

Bonds — Consolidated Districts. — "Where one of several school 
districts, consolidated under section 1, of subdivision 14, of an 
act to establish a system of public instruction approved March 
1, 1881, was indebted on bonds previously issued for school 
purposes, upon such consolidation being effected the new district 
not only becomes invested with all the property rights of 
the former, but also becomes answerable for its debts; and » 
tax for their payment was properly levied on all taxable property 
within the new district." 15 Neb. 1. 

Change of Boundary — When must Superintendent Act Upon 

Petition ? — There seems to be nothing in the law which would 
require the county superintendent to render his decision upon 
petition for change in district boundaries at the time said petition 
is presented. As to how long a time he may hold his decision, 
is a matter left entirely to his discretion. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

P&gt;f Property — When. — The division of property and 
it be made at the time of the division of the district, 
and children transferred temporarily are not to be 
account in determining the division of property or 

Indebtedness does Not Follow Attached Territory. — In changing 
the boundaries of a district, or where a part of one district is 
attached to another district, the district to which said part is 
attached would be under no obligation to share the indebtedness 
of the district from which said part was detached. 

Indebtedness Shared by Attached Territory. — When a part of 
unorganized territory is attached to a district, it will have to 
share the indebtedness of the district to which it is attached. 

Lapse of District. — The statutes do not provide for the lapsing 
of a district by its becoming depopulated or by the removal of 
its district officers. It is still a corporation and the funds 
belonging to such corporation are subject to the valid claims 
against the district. Upon its becoming repopulated it is the 
duty of the county superintendent to deliver to a taxable 
inhabitant of such district a notice in writing of the re-opening 
of such district and specifying the time and place of holding 
the first meeting, which notice with the fact of such delivery 
shall be entered upon the record by the superintendent. The 
said notice shall also direct such inhabitant to notify every 
qualified voter of such district, either personally or by leaving 
a written notice at his or her place of residence, of the time and 
place of holding said meeting at least five days before the time 
appointed therefor. And it shall be the duty of such inhabitant 
to notify the qualified voters of said district accordingly. 
For the law governing the return of this notice and the record 
of notice and the re-opening of such district, see the law as set 
forth in sections 7 and 8, subdivision 1, as in the case of the 
organization of a new district. 

At this meeting of such school district, provision should be 
made for school in accordance with the requirements in section 
14, subdivision 2.

often unwisely distributed throughout the course, and any </seg>

change of sentiment or opinion against the use of alcohol seems 
entirely disproportionate to the outlay of time and effort that 
has been made. There is frequent and unnecessary repetition, 
and diminished interest and dislike of the subject are prevalent. 
Text-book instruction could, with profit to the cause and to the 
school, be limited to the higher grammar grades. The use of 
charts in common schools showing morbid physiological conditions 
is generally condemned. 

TAXES 

Annual Meeting most Tax when Needed to Carry on 

School. — See Annual Meeting — Illegal to Vote no School. 

I Election, if all Children Move from District. — In case a school tax 
)ted at the annual meeting of a regularly organized district, 
the levy is made in pursuance of such vote, the property 
ers would not be relieved from payment of the tax on the 
ind of the removal of the pupils from the district. There 
Id be no occasion for maintaining a school under these con&gt;ns, 
and these taxes collected would stand to the credit of 
district and would be available when occasion required the 
ntenance of school in that district. 

County Clerk Must Levy Tax in Accordance with Certificate. — It 
is the duty of the county clerk to levy the school tax in accordance 
with the certificate properly signed by the members of the 
school district board, and it is not within his authority to go 
behind said certificate, if upon its face it authorizes a legal 

Idgment. — The district court may issue an order on the 
lty board to make the necessary levy for the satisfaction of 
dgment against a school district; and when the taxes 
ved from such special levy are paid into the county treasury 
the duty of the county treasurer, under the direction of the 
•d of county commissioners, to pay the same into court for 
satisfaction of said judgment claim. The district voters 
i nothing whatever to do with this claim, nor should it be 
. oat of moneys derived from taxes voted at the annual 

Btmit of Taxation. — It is the ruling of this department that 
maximum levy for school purposes that can legally be voted 
i school district is twenty-five (25) mills (except for the </seg>

            <seg id="p118">

payment of bonds and the purchase or lease of a schoolbouse). 
Any other construction would do violence to the law and extend 
the taxing powers of a school district beyond the limit 
therein prescribed. 

Time of Making Levy. — The mere failure of school district 
officers to give due notice to the county clerk of the levy in 
said district before the said clerk's books were completed and 
turned over to the treasurer, will not invalidate the levy. The 
court would, without doubt, grant a writ of mandamus compelling 
the clerk to insert the levy and make the necessary 

Transferred with Pupil. — See Transfer — Renter. 

TEACHER 

Kje Limit- — The law makes no mention of age qualification 
applicant for teacher's certificate. It has been recomded 
that no certificates be given to persons under sevenyears 
of age unless they show exceptional ability. 

Authority Over Pupils- — See Pupils. 

Detaining Pupils After School.— See Pupils. 

Discharge of. — See Board — Powers and Duties. 

Duty to Keen a Record. — See (5) page 158, School Laws, 1901. 

Janitor Work. — Unless a teacher agrees in his contract to build 
fires and sweep the schoolhouse he cannot be compelled to do 

Resignation.— It requires a majority of the board to legally 
accept a teacher's resignation. The contract between the 
school board and a teacher is a mutual obligation, equally 
binding upon both parties. Neither party can with impunity 
rescind such contract: and either party violating the provisions 
of such contract would be answerable in damages to 
the aggrieved party. 

Revocation of Certificate. — See Certificates. 

Salary Cash— Not Warrants.— A school district cannot compel 
a teacher to take school warrants in place of salary ; but if they 
have no money on hand it would seem to be the part of wisdom 
for the teacher to accept warrants in payment of his 
salary, for the reason that warrants draw interest. After a 
teacher has accepted warrants in payment of his salary, and 
cashes them at a discount, the board is under no obligations to 
make ur&gt; the discount. </seg>

school without being authorized to do so by the district board. 
However, it would be within the authority of the district board 
to ratify such an action of a teacher in case of an emergency, 
providing that the substitute be a legally qualified teacher. A 
teacher under contract with a district could not properly demand 
of the district payment for the services rendered by a substitute 
appointed by him without authority. However, in case the 
substitute, a legally qualified teacher, were permitted, with 
the knowledge of the district board, to teach the school, said 
substitute would have a valid claim against the district for the 
value of the services rendered by him. 

Wages Continue — When. — See Closing School. 

TERM 

Date of Beginning — The legal voters at the annual meeting 
have authority to give general directions as to the time of 
holding school in the district (see section 14, subdivision 2); 
but the fixing of a certain date by said meeting for the 
beginning of school would not be binding on the board whose 
duty it is to attend to the details of school management. A 
substantial compliance with the legal direction of the annual 
meeting is sufficient; and a slight variation therefrom would 
not invalidate a teacher's contract which is otherwise regular. 

Definition. — See Pupils — Expulsion or Suspension. 

May Not Be Extended. — When an annual meeting fixes the 
number of months of school to be held in the district the ensuing 
year, if it is sufficient to entitle the district to share in 
the apportionment of state school funds, this length of term 
may not be changed at any subsequent meeting. 

I falter and Summer. — Is it legal to have twelve months of 
x&gt;l in a school district having less than 100 children of 
doI age, six months in the summer for the smaller children 
lower grades, and the other six months in the fall or 
ter for the larger pupils? Section 14, subdivision 2, 
as the legal voters at each annual meeting the right to 
jrmine the length of time the school shall be taught in the 
rict the ensuing year, and whether the. muney apportioned 
the support of the school therein shall be applied to the 
ter or summer term, or a certain portion to each. There is </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

no legal objection to the plan suggested, provided of course 
that due notice is given every parent who has children to send 
that such a proposition will be considered at the annual meetiiig. 
Section 3, subdivision 5, gives the district school board 
the general care of the school and the power to cause the 
pupils to be taught in such branches and classified in such 
grades or departments as may seem best adapted to the course 
of study which the school board of any district shall establish 
by and with the'consent of the county superintendent, and to 
make such reasonable rules and regulations as they may think 
necessary for the government and health of the pupils, and of 
devising such means as may seem best to secure regular attendance 
and progress of children at school. In the light of 
this law. there can be no legal objection to dividing the school 
into grades during the spring and summer term which shall 
accommodate the primary and intermediate pupils, and likewise 
grade the school for the fall and winter term so as to accommodate 
the more advanced pupils. 

TEXT-BOOKS 

Ends for Purchase. — Text-books may be paid for out of any 
s on'hand belonging to the general fund, to the incidental 
, or to a fund especially provided for this purpose. 

Includes Supplies. — Tn passing upon the constitutionality of the 
free text-book law, in discussing the word "supplies" the 
following language is used by the judge rendering the decision: 
"We do not think the term 'text-books' should be 
given a technical meaning, but that it is comprehensive enough 
and does include globes, maps, charts, pens, ink, paper, etc., 
and all other apparatus and appliances which are proper to be 
used in the school in instructing the youth, and we conclude, 
therefore, that the act under consideration is not broader than 
its^title,"*and that the term 'school supplies' found in the tenth 
section of the act is not foreign to the term 'text-books' found 
in the title of the act, but is germane to and comprehended 
and included within the t«rm 'text-books. " 

Saning Books. — The law provides thafc text-books shall be 
ed to pupils while pursuing a course of study in the 
ols. **It is the duty of the board of education to place books 
te disposal of pupils who need to study in the evenings. </seg>

pupils of certain classes cannot study profitably outside of 
school hours, it is proper to place reasonable restrictions upon 
the use of books at home by such pupils or classes. It is not 
within the authority of the school board to loan text- books, 
which are the property of the district, to be used in schools 
held outside the district. 

Must Furnish. — Subdivision 18 of the School Laws is mandatory, 
and it is not within the authority of the annual district 
meeting to vote not to furnish text-books; and under this law 
any patron of the district, by the proper legal proceedings, 
could compel the district board to furnish his children, pupils 
in the school, the necessary text-books, notwithstanding any 
action or failure to act on the part of the district meeting. 
Some patron of the district should apply to the district court 
in behalf of the district for a writ of mandamus to compel the 
board to furnish to the children of the district the necessary 
text-books. See the case of Ambrose Affholder et al. v. Stat of 
Nebraska ex rel. Peter McMullm, 51 Neb. 91. In this case, in 
the district court of Burt county, Peter McMullen made application 
for a peremptory writ of mandamus to compel Ambrose 
Affholder and others constituting the school board of district 
No. 58 of said county to purchase and furnish to the children 
of school age of said district the necessary text-books in accordance 
.with the free text-book law. An alternative writ was 
issued, and for a return thereto the school board interposed the 
defense that said act was unconstitutional. The writ was 
issued as prayed, and the school board appealed the case to the 
Supreme court. The Supreme court sustained the district 
court. A writ of mandamus will not issue where it is not within 
the power of the respondent lawfully to comply, or where 
it would otherwise be unavailing. 46 Neb. 857. 

Pupils Responsible for.— Section 9, subdivision 18 of the School 
Laws provides that all books purchased by th« district board 
shall be held as the property of the district and loaned to 
pupils of the school while pursuing a course of study therein, 
free of charge ; but the district board shall hold such pupils 
responsible for any damage to, loss of, or failure to return 
such books at the time and to the person that may be designated 
by the board of suoh district. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

TRANSFER 

Annual Meeting has no Power. — The transfer of pupils provided 
for in section 4a, subdivision 5, of the School Laws, is 
made entirely independent of any action of the annual district 
meeting of either district affected. In other words, the annual 
district meeting has no power to authorize or prevent such 
transfer. 

Ipplication. — The application for transfer must be made not 
r than the annual meeting. The county superintendent 
' notify the directors a little later, but the county superinlent 
should be notified by the applicant not later than the 
ual meeting in order that the transfer may be legally made. 

Apportionment. — Children transferred to an adjoining district 
under section 4a, subdivision 5, are included in the census of 
said adjoining district and their share of the apportionment is 
paid to such district. There is no statutory provision 
authorizing the payment of a pupil's share of the state apportionment 
to the credit of any district other than that in which 
said pupil is enumerated. 

Attend Nearest School- — Pupils transferred from one district to 
another under section 4a, subdivision 5, should attend the 
nearest school of the adjoining district. 

Cannot be Re-transferred. — Wh«n a transfer has been made 
under section 4a, subdivision 5, it becomes a matter of record. 
The reports from the two districts are made up on the basis of 
the change, the school apportionment is made out on that 
basis, the taxes of the party have been transferred and there 
seems to be no way by which he may be re-transferred until 
the next annual meeting. 

Cannot be Transferred to a S^con i Party. — In case a renter, "who 
has his children and taxes transferred to an adjoining district 
under section 4a, subdivision 5, removes from the district, and 
another renter occupies the residence vacated by the former, 
the second renter would have free school privileges only in the 
district of his residence. 

Eiange of She- — If a transfer was made before a change of 
was ordered by the annual meeting, when the reasons for 
ting such transfer were modified by such change of site, 
i a transfer would be illegal. </seg>

            <seg id="p123">
OFFICIAL DECISIONS. 

533 

Director Cannot Reject Transferred Pupils. — I he law makes no 
provision for the director of an adjoining district to reject 
pupils who are transferred under the provisions of section 4a, 
subdivision 5. 

For School Privileges only. — Persons transferred under Sec. 4a, 
subdivision 5 are still legal residents of the district of their residence. 
In that district they vote on school matters, including 
the question of school district bonds. They are not answerable 
for any bonds in the district to which they have been 
transferred. 

Measuring Distance- — The distances spoken of in section 4a, 
subdivision 5, are to be measured by the shortest route possible 
upon section lines or roads open to the public. Section 
lines are not recognized as roads within the meaning of section 
4a until they have been declared open by the county board. 
If the section line is not open to the public, it is not to be 
taken into account in measuring the distance. 

Whenever the public generally is permitted to travel over 
a certain road without objection or hindrance by the owner of 
the land, and the road is used to some extent in that way, such 
a road is a "traveled road open to the public" within the meaning 
of section 4a. 

Railroad bed Does not Transfer. — Where a tract of land upon 
which there is a railroad bed is transferred under the provisions 
of section 4a, subdivision 5, school laws, the taxes accruing 
from such railroad bed do not transfer. 

Renter. — A renter is entitled to the privileges mentioned in 
section 4a, subdivision 5. The county clerk is empowered, and 
it is made his duty, to place the school taxes (except for the 
payment of existing bonds or interest on the same) of the 
said parents or guardians and of the real estate on which they 
reside, not exceeding a quarter section of land, for the year 
next ensuing in the said adjoining district instead of the district 
of their residence. Note that it is all the' taxes of said 
parents or guardians including the taxes of the real estate on 
which said parents or guardians reside, notwithstanding the 
fact that they may be living on land which does not belong to 
them. The footnote to section 4a, page 37, School Laws of 
Nebraska for 1901, says: "Where the person making application 
for transfer resides on land which does not belong to him </seg>

            <seg id="p124">
534 


(rented) the tax on such land should not be transferred. " This 
is an error which crept into the present laws in the last publication, 
but it was the intent of the legislature at &gt;ts last session 
to give the law the force stated above. This department is 
sustained in this interpretation of the law by the attorneygeneral. 


¦evocation. — The county superintendent would have au•ity 
to revoke a transfer to a nearer school under section 4a, 
livision 5, if upon investigation he tinds the conditions do 
comply with the law. If it is granted upon misrepresen)n, 
it is his duty to revoke the transfer. 

Eatures to Petition. — In case a partv who desires to be transunder 
section 4a, subdivision 5, cannot secure signatures 
petition, there seems to be no way in which the transfer 
i made. 

VOTERS 

Alien. — See Alien. 

Amount of Taxable Property Necessary. — Any person who has 
resided in the district forty days and is twenty-one years old, 
and who owns personal property that was assessed in the district 
in his or her own name at the last annual assessment, is 
entitled to vote at any district meeting. The law places no 
limit as to the amount of taxable property necessary to entitle 
the holder to vote. The chairman of the meeting has no right 
to demand the production of tax receipts by persons offering 
to vote. 

Bond Election. — All persons "who are qualified to vote in a 
school district meeting are entitled to vote upon the proposition 
to issue bonds of the district whenever such question is 
properly submitted. 

Dower Interest. — The ownership of real property, which confers 
the right to vote at a district meeting, must be an actual and 
present ownership such as would entitle the voter to the use 
and control of the property in question. A prospective or contingent 
right, like that of dower or curtesy, would not constitute 
such ownership as this statute requires. Important 
recent decisions of our Supreme court declare the right of 
dower to be a "charge or incumbrance" upon the property, </seg>

            <seg id="p125">
535 

OFFICIAL DECISIONS. 

would not entitle the holder of such a right to be considered as 
a voter any more than would the holding of a mortgage confer 
such a right upon the mortgagee. Therefore, a wife who has 
no children of school age and owns no real property in her 
own name and no personal property assessed in her name at 
the last annual assessment, would not become a legal voter by 
virtue of her husband's ownership of such property, although 
she possesses the requisite qualifications of age and residence ; 
nor would'the husband become a voter simply by virtue of his 
wife's ownership of such property. 

Homesteader- — The courts have repeatedly held that a homesteader 
is a "freeholder" within the meaning of that term as 
used elsewhere in the statutes. This clearly implies ownership 
of the land such as would entitle him to vote at an annual meeting 
under the statutory provision embraced in the words "who 
owns real property in the distr : ct. " 

A young lady twenty-one years of age who holds a homestead 
is a voter at the annual meeting. 

Vhe homesteader votes in the district of his homestead, and 
in the district in which he way be temporarily working. 

Moderator. — See Moderator. 

Penalty for Illegal Voting. — "Any person who shall vote in 
any school district in this state in which he has not legally 
resided ten days, or such length of time as required by law, 
next preceding the election, or into which he shall have come 
for temporary purposes merely, shall, on conviction thereof, 
be fined in any sum not less than twenty-five dollars nor more 
than one hundred dollars, or be imprisoned in the jail of the 
proper county not "more than six months." Section 6846, 
Criminal Code, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1901. 

Estdent of Unorganized Territory. — A person living on unnized 
territory has no vote at school meetings in any 
ict by reason of having property in said district. Resie 
is one of the qualifications necessary to be a voter. 

iemporary Absence. — A Jperson having all the necessary 
lifications to vote at an annual school district meeting may 
be debarred from voting from the fact that he was not in 
district the prescribed number of days just preceding the 
tion, when it was known that he was out of the district 
porarily and that bis permanent home is in the district. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Transferred Persons. — A transfer in accordance with section 
4a, subdivision 5 of the School Laws, is for school purposes 
only. A person whose children and taxes have been transferred 
to an adjoining district for school purposes does not 
thereby become a legal voter of such adjoining district. Such 
a person elected as a member of the school board in a district 
to which he has been transferred would not be a legal officer 
in that district. 

Who are Legal Voters? — Every person, male or female, who has 
resided in the district forty days and is twenty-one years old, 
and who owns real property or personal property that was 
assessed in the district in his or her name at the last annual 
assessment, or who has children of school age residing in the 
district, shall be entitled to vote at any district mooting or 
school election held in any district, village or city. 

Women Vote at Primaries —Section 4, subdivision 2, chapter 79, 
Compiled Statutes, confers upon women having the necessary 
qualifications the right to vote at any school district meeting 
or school election held in any district, village or city. This 
statute also confers upon women possessing such qualifications 
the right to vote at primaries held in cities for the nomination 
of members of boards of education. 

WARRANTS 

Draw Interest. — All warrants or orders issued by the proper 
authorities of any school district shall draw interest from and 
after the date of their presentation for payment, at the rate of 
seven per cent per annum. 

Kuplicate for Lost Warrants. — See section 22, subdivision 11, 
ool Laws. 

Notice to Holder of District's Ability to Pay.— If there is no 
money on hand with which to pay warrants when presented, 
the warrants shall be registered in the order of their presentation, 
and as soon as there are funds in the hands of the district 
treasurer it becomes his duty to notify the holder of the registered 
warrants and to pay them in the order of their registration, 
regardless of when the tax was levied. 

Outlaw. — It has been held by the supreme court of Nebraska 
that the statute of limitations runs for or against school dis 
tricts the same as for or against individuals. 22 Neb. 205. </seg>

Paymmt. — See section 15, subdivision 11, School Laws. 

Payment by Consolidated Districts. — Where school districts, 
having registered warrants outstanding, consolidate into one 
district, said warrants should be paid in the order of their registration, 
as shown by the date of the endorsement thereon, 
without regard to which of the original districts issued the 
warrants. 

Penalty for Postponing Payment — See section 21, subdivision 
11, School Laws. 

Substituting B jnds for, IllegaL— It has been held by the Supreme 
Court of Nebraska that the act contained in sections 27-31 
of subdivision 15 of the School Laws does not empower a 
school board to issue its bonds and deliver them to parties in 
compromise or to take the place of an indebtedness evidenced 
by school district warrants or orders. 45 Neb. 13. 

I^hat Constitutes a Fund Against Which Warrants May be 
awn. — School districts have no powers except those conferred 
statute or necessarily implied therefrom. Their ability to 
y debts is restricted by laws authorizing them to levy taxes, 
thin fixed limits only, and by the funds arising from such 
r ies, from fines and from other lawful sources. For the 
rrent expenses of running their schools they cannot incur 
lebtedness greater in amount than their revenue from all 
irces, and where a contract for such expenses provides for 
yment of a sum in excess thereof it is, to that extent, void, 
does not follow, however, that taxes must actually be paid 
o the treasury before they can be made a basis for incurring 
bts. The Supreme court has recently said : ' ' Taxes levied 
the annual school meeting held just prior to the commenceint 
of the school year constitute a fund against which warats 
may be drawn." Zimmerman v. Mate, 88 N. W. 919. </seg>

Jentlemen : It gives me pleasure to submit my third bien- 

nial report as inspector of accredited high schools. During 
the past year the university recorder had charge of all blanks 
and records of the accredited schools, which enabled me to 
give practically my entire time to school visitation. During 
the year I visited 80 of the 104 accredited schools and 38 of the 
smaller high schools. A full day was spent in each of the 
accredited schools except where train connections were unfavorable, 
andf rom two hours to one-half day in each of the 
smaller school^ 

A few years ago the main purpose of a visit was to determine 
whether the university could safely matriculate graduates of 
the high school without examination. Now the chief purpose 
of a visit is to render assistance that will improve school conditions. 
The following outline indicates the points taken up 
as far as possible with each school visited : 

I Matters of Discipline. 
(1) In room. 
(2) In halls. 
(3) On play ground. 

(4) Questions of discipline settled by whom. 
(5) Tardiness, absence, whispering, etc.

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

The schools hav made marked progress during the past five 
years, yet it is not difficult to observe occasional weak places. 
The weakest work is in the smaller schools. We have no right 
to expect as much of the small school as of the larger one. 
Salaries must always be lower and the work less attractive to 
teachers. Quality must at best be sacrificed slightly for auantity 
to meet the reasonable demand of parents that courses be 
arranged to retain their children in the home school as long as 
possible. We have a right, however, to expect reasonably 
thorough and efficient work. While the work may be less 
technical in each subject than in the more thoroughly equipped 
school, it should no-ie the less give that general knowledge 
which would enable the student to enter higher classes in 
other schools and continue each subject iu a creditable manner. 

There is a most pernicious practice among the smaller 
schools of making a new course of study every time a new 
principal is elected. All the value there is in a definite course 
of study is lost where the course is changed annually to coincide 
with the ideas of principals. The top-heavy course is also 
a characteristic of a cla»s of smaller schools, including a few 
on the accredited list. It is believed that the tendency to 
change courses every year or so has been greatly lessened during 
the last two years, as a result of the criticisms made by 
this office and the state department of public instruction. 

These evils do not exist to such an extent among the larger 
schools. There is a sentiment among the more experienced 
school men against continually tampering with courses of 
study. The new man must feel doubly justified before he will 
insist on the adoption of an entirely new course until he has 
become acquainted with conditions. He realizes that he is 
likely to be severely criticised by the university, the state department 
and by other school men unless it is generally known 
that the changes are absolutely necessary. After his first year 
no one finds fault with his changing wherever necessary. 
As a rule changes are made gradually and more judiciously in 
these schools than in the smaller ones. As a result we have 
in Nebraska not only good, carefully arranged courses of study 
but a uniformity that can be found in no other state. There 
is as much uniformity as is desirable. We have a leading 
general course which is practically the same in all the schools. </seg>

            <seg id="p131">

REPORT OF INSPECTOR OF HIGH SCHOOLS. 

Local conditions sometimes make slight changes necessary 
and desirable. The university and state department have 
aided in bringing about this condition, but the school men 
themselves are responsible for the uniformity in courses of 
study. They have come together in the various associations 
and have discussed thoroughly all questions relating to courses, 
and the present state standard courses represent the combined 
judgment of the school men resulting from these discussions 
rather than the opinions and suggestions of the university 
and the state department. The larger schools should be more 
cautious about adding years to the high school course and to 
the grades. They should be careful not to increase the number 
of courses so as to decrease the time of recitation and overload 
and over-work the teachers as is done by top'-heavy 
courses in the small schools. 

Efew of the larger schools have made the mistake of having 
) courses of study than their teaching force justifies. A 
have adopted the elective system, offering more subjects 
are well taught. 

As a result of the agitation which is quite general for more 
thorough work in the common school subjects, several schools 
have recently added a year to the work of the grammar grades. 
A few already had nine or ten years below the high school. 
Some schools devote all or a part of the first year of the high 
school to a review of the grammar grade subjects. It is a 
question whether adding years will meet the difficulty. In case 
the pupils are not sufficiently mature at thirteen for a thorough 
mastery of the common school branches — and it is not 
likely that they are, — it would be a waste of time to spend an 
additional year on this work. Why not take up high school 
subjects as soon as the pupil's knowledge of the common 
branches enables him to do the high school work creditably, 
and somewhere near the end of the high school course, when he 
has reached a greater degree of maturity, give a short intensive 
study of a few of the most essential common branches? 

I 'he variety of ways, however, in which schools attempt to 
re this problem offers an opportunity of making a practical 
; by actually comparing results in a number of schools. 
s office has already begun the test by conducting oral and 
tten examinations in such a way that fairly just compari- </seg>

sons may be made. The results are not likely to b« conclusive 
but they will at least throw sume light on this question. 

E other investigation is also in progress which should give 
tble results. The following list of questions has been sent 
few business men in every town where there is an acted 
school. 

K(l) What is your opinion as to the effectiveness of our 
Ac schools as at present organized? 

K(2) To what extent should the schools including the high 
ol prepare boys and girls for earning a liring and are the 
ols in your judgment meeting this demand in a satisfacmanner? 


K(3) What is the high school not doing that it should do 
what is it doing that it should not do? 

twers to these questions are coming in every day and in 
weeks the schools will be given the benefit of the critiand 
suggestions of value contained in them. 

I may be interesting to note that outside of Lincoln and 
iha there were 1126 graduates of accredited high schools 
year. The following shows the number of these pursuing 
different branches of study : Algebra 1126, Botany 1120, 
lish 1126, Chemistry 917, Plane Geometry 1124, Solid 
metry 959, German 436, American History (advanced) 615, 
ieral History 1119, Latin, 1st 'year, 1006, Caesar 955, 
sro 808, Vergil 251, Physics 1114, Trigonometry 156, Zojy 
82, Astronomy 93, Civics 1054, Geology 40, Physical 
igraphy 980, Political Economy 157, Physiology 570. '^^r 

There are 278 teachers in high schools outside of Omaha and 
Lincoln ; 207 of these are college graduates, 126 being graduates 
of the University. Many of the remaining 71 have had 
a normal school course and one or two years in college. Some 
of these are exceptionally strong high school teachers. Boards 
of education usually demand a college education on the part 
of high school teachers and accept less only on the most conclusive 
proof of marked success. 

Efew high schools have introduced manual training and 
mercial courses. I have endorsed the idea, not only as a 
as of retaining young people in school, but because I be"- 

te that some form of manual training is an essential part 
an education, and that a commercial course may ;be so ar- </seg>

ranged as to be a most excellent mental stimulant and a great 
intellectual benefit. 

There has been gain in library and laboratory equipment of 
accredited schools. There are approximately 35,000 volumes 
in the libraries of these schools, an average library of 350 
volumes. The approximate value of chemical apparatus is 
$10,000, an average of about $100; apparatus for physics 15,-000, 
an average of $150; apparatus for other sciences $9,000. 
There are about 300 compound microscopes or an average of 
about 3 to a school. 

I 'he educational spirit of our teachers has never been higher 
n at the present time as evidenced by the large attendance 
all teachers' associations, whether local, county, state or 
ional. With conditions as they are, an encouraging public 
ool sentiment among the people, fairly good school builds 
and material equipment, efficient teachers, perfect harny 
between the university and the schools, and a healthful 
rit of cooperation among school men and college men genlly, 
there is no reason why the high schools of Nebraska 
y not reach a higher standard of excellence than is possiin 
most other states. 

In conclusion permitjne to thank the State Department for 
ir uniform courtesies and for the interest they have taken 
this department of work. 

Very truly, 

J. W. Crabtree, </seg>

SUGGESTED COURSES FOR HIGH SCHOOLS 

The university assumes no authority whatever to prescribe 
courses of study for any school. The following programs are 
simply of the nature of suggestions, more or less worthy of study. 
Each may perhaps have special adaptation for some locality. 
Generally the subjects that best fit the individual for life are the 
subjects that best prepare him for the next step in his education. 
In all education there is an important sequential relation. Foundation 
studies should be such as to inspire the individual to go 
further and not to be a disadvantage to him should he wish to 
go on. Any subject is practical that stimulates the individual to 
a broader life and a more sympathetic touch with human interests. 
It is desirable that each superintendent or principal In 
charge of a high school study its needs and resources, framing, 
with the hints below and all other available aid, the beet course 
of study which the circumstances admit. Any approach to uniformity 
which thus emerges will be most advantageous, stimulating 
the backward schools, checking the over ambitious and 
helping to secure a sound basis for all. 

ONE- YEAR COURSE 

FOB SCHOOLS HAVING THREE TEACHERS

Where the common school subjects are thoroughly completed in 
the eighth grade it may be well to omit the "reviews" in the 
ninth grade and extend civics, Including Nebraska's civil government 
and history, over the entire year.

This is recommended as a good general course for the high 
schools of the state. Where the subject is not specified the s. uool 
may select from the optional lists or add any other important 
branch. In schools where a modern language such as German 
can be properly taught it should be begun in the second semester 
of grade XI and continue through grade XII. 

BREADTH AND SYMMETRY IS COURSES 

The university and the state department urge upon all principals 
and superintendents the importance of maintaining breadth 
and symmetry as well as thoroness in their high school curricula. 
Courses of any length which omit important lines of 
study, such as languages other than English, mathematics, history 
and science, are not to be encouraged. 

ADDITIONAL COURSES 

Ehe largest schools are advised to follow the standard fourrs 
course through the tenth grade. If they wish additional 
rses, slight changes may be made in grades XI and XII. 

Classical Course. — Special attention is called to the importance 
of a classical course. Wherever it is possible for a school to offer 
Greek It may be given in grades XI and XII. School authorities 
should be careful not to misunderstand or misapply the arguments 
sometimes put forward against the study of ancient 
tongues. Those urging these arguments usually mean only that 
duly organized and ably taught courses in modern languages are 
of equal worth, year for year, with study in the classics. They 
do not mean to urge the neglect of Greek or Latin. There is 
probably not an educator of mark in the world who would not 
regard the general ignorance of Greek thruout a community or a 
state as a profound misfortune. 

Scientific Course. — The general course above is a satisfactory </seg>

fdern language may be substituted for all or part of the Latin

Preparatory to Engineering. — A course preparing especially for 
the engineering groups at the university should have trigonometry 
in grade XII. The language may be either ancient or 
modern. </seg>

EXPLANATION OF CREDIT POINTS 

A "credit point" means the work of five recitations per waak 
of not less than forty minutes each during one semester of at 
east eighteen weeks. For full admission to the university It 
points are required. Conditional admission is permitted on a 
minimum of twenty credit points. In special cases, upon the 
written recommendation of a superintendent or a principal, canidates 
are admitted with leas than the required number of 
points. In order to obtain admission wiuiout conditions each 
candidate's credits must equal 28 points or a total of 140 recitaion 
or credit hours. Adding to these his four years of univerity 
work the student will at graduation from the university 
have credit on the records of the university for 63 credit points, 
ix., 28 entrance points plus 25 university points. 

Under the general heading "syllabus of subjects" are brief suggestions 
for points in accredited subjects. Real equivalents for

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Graduates of accredited schools and all others expecting to 
enter the university should bear in mind that by recent action of 
the regents registration, to be made without a special fee, mast 
occur within the six days set apart for that purpose unless there 
are good and sufficient reasons for late registration. 

DUTIES OF THE UNIVERSITY HIGH SCHOOL INSPECTOR 

The inspector has general supervision of all that pertains to 
the growth and efficiency of the accredited high schools, the 
plans of administration and the reports of these schools to the 
university. He visits each school at least once each year for the 
purpose of learning its condition and making helpful suggestions 
to the superintendent, teachers and board of education 
relative to instruction, organization or equipment. He also 
Cces to the university detailed reports of all high schools 
ted. 

far as practicable he visits the grammar grades connected 
:th the accredited schools and counsels with superintendents 
relative to grade work. 

Applications for inspection should be sent to the inspector; 
also communications in regard to courses of study, instruction, 
credits or other matters touching the relation of the university 
to the accredited schools. 

GENERAL SUGGZSTIONS 

NECESSARY LIMITATIONS OF COURSES 

Ambitious principals and school boards naturally desire their 
high schools to win the highest possible number of credits. Tho 
commendable In itself, this desire has produced unfortunate results. 
It is not unusual to find a school having from four to 
seven teachers attempting to carry as many years of high school 
work as are carried by the largest schools.. They not only attempt 
more work than can be done well but more than the 
district can afford. This withdraws attention and financial support 
from the lower grades, and the schools as a whole are seriously 
weakened. No high school can be permanently strong 
unless supported by efficient work in the lower grades. It is. 
necessary, therefore, not only to require schools to attain a 
certain standard of work but also to discourage them, from under' 
taking too much. </seg>

A SINGLE COURSE ADVISBD 

Except In the larger cities it Is a mistake to offer a varlatr •* 
high school courses. Additional courses increase the onmbtr of 
recitations, unnecessarily reduce the size of cla—m. diminish Uto 
time the teacher can give to each class, and prevent tae stoat 
thoro and efficient work. Variety of courses may be deatoaMa, 
bat thoro and skilful teaching is far more important. Wlxn 
students' tastes and talents require this, one atudy may occasionally 
be substituted for another, even in small scaooie. Mm 
a rule, however, the board should adopt a single. eareraSy sa» 
Cited course and let the undivided energy of teachers and etants 
be given to the pursuit of it. 

UNITING CLASSta 

In connection with the' preceding, note carefully thi 

¦ 

immaterial which of two subjects comes Orst In the c 

classes are many and small, arrange the course so 'hat hot* 

grades can take one of the two subjects together the Sr 

and have no class in the other subject. The next year I 

these grades take the other subject. In this way each stadaat 

Ejoth of these branches during his course. For example. »ap» 
civics and history to be taught only In alternate yean. UM 
•lasses taking them together. In 1902 both grades, ninth 

and tenth, take civics, reciting in one class, and there to ao class 
in history that year. The next year the ninth grade beeoatss th« 
tenth. This class takes history with the new ninth grade, beta 

reciting together, and there is no class In civics this year. 
In the same manner botany and physics can be made to alter 

Ponly one of these being taught at any oae time. Physic* 
chemistry can be taught In the same way in tae last two 
years of the three-years course. Much time is required for areparing 
experiments In these sciences and for properly arrangta* 
the work for any class taught with enthusiasm and success. Tfce 
plan here suggested enables the teacher to concentrate effort 
upon a small number of subjects. It has been thoroly tested In 

a number of high schools and found to work admirably. 
This suggestion is not Intended for the largest high srhoois: 

yet there are few schools in the state which may not make sosae 

application of it. 

The union of classes may render proper otter useful TWiitlaai 

from the courses outlined in this manual. 

THE SENIOR COMMON BRANCHES 

A full four-years high school course gives thirty-two credits. 
As only twenty-eight credits are necessary to fulfil the entrmaee </seg>

            <seg id="p148">
558 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

points in other than preparatory subjects. It is suggested that 
at least two of these points be taken in the senior year in an 
Intensive study of the essential common branches. This work is 
essential: (1) to fix fundamental principles In the minds of 
those who may receive no further schooling; (2) to give a connected 
view of the entire field of each of these subjects, (3) to 
give a foundation for further study; and (4) better to prepare 
those who may teach in country schools. 

This work should mean much more than an ordinary review. 
It should be a careful study of the fundamental principles of 
each subject Arithmetic and grammar should be included. In 
case American history and physiology are not in the high school 
coarse, these should receive attention. A term can profitably be 
given to a review of algebra and arithmetic together. Six or 
eight weeks may be given to grammar. 

LIBRARIES 

A good school library is very desirable. The character of the 
books selected is of great importance. When funds are abundant 
It is not difficult to purchase, but with only fifty dollars to begin 
the work, it is not easy to make a judicious selection. For 
those who must make each dollar count a few suggestions may 
not be out of place. 

1. Buy books as a carpenter buys tools — not in sets, not because 
others have them, but each for a specific purpose. 

Distinguish between books for use from the laboratory and 
ference point of view and books for general reading. 

Have some of each sort. The books for reference and formal 
supplementary reading broaden the mental horizon, permit comparison 
of authorities and awaken and stimulate new interest 
n work. The books for general reading should be chosen for 
real interest and distinct literary value and should have no immediate 
connection with studies. 

The reading habit should be formed with the study habit. To 
awaken and fix the reading habit folly half of the library should 
consist of well-chosen books which do not in the least smack 
of the school room. 

S. With only fifty dollars to spend, concentrate on some one 
subject and secure material for first-class work in this limited 
sphere. Fit up a complete shelf for Roman history, civics, American 
history, literature, or some other limited branch or portion 
of a subject. Next year do the same thing for another subject 
and bequeath this policy. Fifty dollars a year for twenty years 
scattered promiscuously, a book here and a book there, will not 
build up a serviceable working library or stimulate instructors to 
use such. Many a library seems to have books in plenty, when 
In reality either there are not enough on any one subject to render 
collateral work practicable, or they are not of the right kind. </seg>

            <seg id="p149">
559 

rdUjrl o(_ rrlJv-'L Jn. A^ \J ALj. 

4. Avoid expensive editions. One hundred volumes may \m 
had from nineteen to forty dollars. It is possible to secure an 
excellent quality of paper, print and binding at twenty-live dollars 
per hundred books. 

Remarks on libraries for the high school apply with equal 
to books for the grades. Each room should have acceaa to 
h, up-to-date library. 

6. A wide acquaintance with juvenile literature is helpful In 
selecting to advantage. There is no use in buying what students 
do not read, and it is criminal to buy books without point or 
literary flavor. Students do not read books that are stupidly or 
ponderously written, but they are quite capable of reading with 
teat and profit much literature that is thought above them. 

7. The librarian of the university is glad at all times to help 
teachers in the selection of books, to send "best book" list* on 
any subject, or to furnish data as to prices and editions. 

TEXT-BOOKS 

The subject of text-books should engage the careful attention 
of superintendents and principals for, next to good teachers, satisfactory 
texts are the most essential elements in securing good 
results from school work. Certain text-books are still in use 
in this state which are by no means suitable for their purpose. 
Work done with these texts is likely not to be recognized for 
preparation in such subjects. 

Not all the publications of any publishing house are equally 
good. It is folly to choose a work simply because it is published 
under certain auspices. It Is equally fallacious to suppose that 
what is satisfactory in one place will be equally so in another. 
Like the length of courses, equipment, and other circumstances, 
so school books must be adapted to particular environments. 

E. has been said with reference to text-books is equally 
ble to laboratory equipment of all kinds. Those who are 
plating the purchase either of books or of laboratory 
ent will do well to put themselves in communication with 
pector, who is always ready to render to schools all the 
ice in his power. 

NATIONAL EDUCATIONAL ASSOCIATION 
RESOLUTIONS 

The following resolutions, adopted by the committee on college 
entrance requirements of the national educational association, 
are printed here for convenient reference, as containing 
useful suggestions and norms for the future development of high 
school programs: </seg>

            <seg id="p150">
560 

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

I. That the principle of election be recognized In the secondary 
schools. 

til. That the requirements for admission to technical schools 
ould be as extended and thoro as the requirements for admis&gt;n 
to college. 

III. That the teachers in the secondary schools should be college 
graduates, or have the equivalent of a college education. 

IV. That we favor a unified six-years high school course of 
study, beginning with the seventh grade. 

V. That in the interpretation of the recommendations of the 
committee, concerning the subjects to be included In the seendary 
school program and the requirements for admission to 
college, for which credit should be given, it is distinctly understood 
that all secondary schools will not offer opportunities for 
lie pursuit of all these subjects, and that the college will select 
only those which they deem wise and 'appropriate. 

VI. (1) That while the committee recognized as suitable for 
recommendation by the colleges for admission several studies 
•numerated in this report, and while it also recognizes the principle 
of large liberty to the students in the secondary schools. 
It does not believe in unlimited election, but especially emphasizes 
the importance of a certain number of constants in all 
secondary schools and all requirements for admission to college. 

U) That the committee recommends that the number of 
credits be recognized in the following proportion, namely: Four 
units in foreign language (no language accepted in less that, 
two units), two units in mathematics, two in English, one in 
history, and one in science. 

VII. That the colleges will aid the secondary schools by allowing 
credit toward a degree for work done in secondary schools, 
beyond the amount required for entrance when equal in amount 
and thoroneBS to work done in the same subjects in the college. 

VIII. That for students who have met a definite requirement 
in any science, and who continue the same subject in college, it 
seems to us desirable that there be provided a suitable sequel 
to the school course in continuation of study; such students 
being in no case placed in the same class with beginners. 

IX. That we approve of encouraging gifted students to complete 
the preparatory course in less time than is required by 
most students. 

X. That in general we recognize in schools the admissibility 
of a second year in advanced work in the same subject instead 
of a second year in a related subject; for example, two years In 
biology, instead of one year in biology and one year in chemistry, 
where local conditions favor such an arrangement. 

XI. That it is desirable that colleges should accept in addition 
to the year of U. S. history and civil government already recom- </seg>

            <seg id="p151">
561 


mended at least one-half a year of Intensive study of some period 
of history, especially of the United States. 

B. That we recommend that any piece of work comprejd 
within the studies included In this report that has cotit 
least one year of hour periods a week in a well-equipped 
dary school, under competent instruction, should be con?d 
worthy to count toward admission to college. 

XIII. That it is desirable that our colleges and universities 
should accept as a unit for admission a year's work in economics, 
including under this head a course in elementary political 
economy, supplemented by adequate instruction In commercial 
geography and industrial history. 

XIV. That we recommend an increase in the school ¦ day in 
secondary schools, to permit a larger amount of study in school 
under supervision. </seg>

HINTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS 

Like the high school programs put down on preceding pages, 
the observations below are simply of the nature of suggestions. 
"he university assumes no right and has no wish to dictate 
methods of teaching. It is, moreover, to be borne in mind that 
o department in the university allows any discrimination to 
&gt;e made against pupils entering upon its work who have been 
rained in ways which the department may deem not exactly the 
best. Power, mentality, the ability to take up and successful! v 
carry forward university work — this rather than acquaintance 
with any particular method, is the chief requirement for 
matriculation. 

Suitable text and reference books for each department are 
recommended on application to the head of the department. 

ALGEBRA. 

(See Mathematics) 

ASTRONOMY 

This subject is too difficult for most high schools. It should 
not be undertaken unless the teacher is prepared to direct students 
in observational work, such as learning the constellations, 
tracing on star-maps the observed paths of the moon and planet-!, 
observing the changes of variable stars like Algol, finding by 
observation the latitude of the place, etc. A definite course of 
observational work should be laid out for the class. 

The course should not be taken until the student is well 
grounded in geometry, and, if possible, in trigonometry. A 
celestial globe or armillary sphere is indispensable, and considerable 
time should be devoted to working problems with it The 
Piversity can assist teachers by furnishing at cost various star 
.ps and other forms and charts for observational work, such 
as are used in the university. 

The school should possess a library of reference books in 
astronomy, and considerable collateral reading should be assigned 
to supplement the text-book used. 

BOTANY 

Time. — One year should be given to botany. It is better to 
begin with the opening of the fall term and continue to the end 
of the school year. Where one credit point is desired the work 
may alternate with some other subject, otherwise it should be 
mfcan aa a. full Studv 
</seg>
            <seg id="p153">
563 


The Laboratory. — Modern botany requires a properly equipped 
laboratory. This must be well lighted, preferably from the north 
¦ky, and should be provided with firm tables, 27 or 28 inches 
high, and needful shelves and cases at the sides of the room. The 
microscopes must be from some good maker, so as to insure good 
results. Bausch &amp; Lomb's "Stand AB," with •/, and I 1 , inch objectives, 
and one or two oculars is a good instrument, and can 
be bought for from $17.00 to 122.00, according to outfit, and 
German instruments of the same grade, made by Leitz, Reichert, 
or Zeiss, may be imported free of duty for a little less. These 
are equally good, and magnify from about 75 to 600 diameters. 

There should be provided with each a set of dissecting instruments. 
Good dissecting sets are made by Bausch tc Lomb and 
Richards ft Company, each containing a scalpel, forceps, scissors, 
needles and pipette, and sold for about $1.00. The usual glass 
slips, cover-glasses, alcohol, reagents, etc., should be freely supplied. 
These need not cost more than $1.00 for each microscope. 

Some work may be done by the class under the direction of 
the intelligent teacher with but one microscope and the other 
appliances, but as soon as possible there should be in every high 
school several microscopes, each with its accessories. There 
should be at least one-fifth as many microscopes as there are students 
in the class. 

Ele laboratory should contain a reference herbarium, in which 
only the species of native plants are preserved, but also good 
imens of those great types which do not grow naturally 
or under cultivation in the region. The university is able to aid 
Its accredited schools to secure such exotic specimens under 
certain conditions. 

The Laboratory Work. — The aim is to give the student a general 
outline of modern botany, Including a fair knowledge of the 
principal types of plants and the modifications they have undergone. 
Where one credit point is desired the work should include 
the first twenty-two exercises In the chapter on histology, a selection 
of approximately one-half of the exercises under each 
class in the chapter on structure and classification, with some of 
the simpler experiments In the chapter on physiology. The practical 
completion of these three chapters gives two credit points. 

In this work the student should gain some knowledge of the 
structure, physiology and classification of plants, and he should 
acquire also some skill in the methods of study of living things. 
He should learn enough of technical descriptive terms to give 
Intelligent descriptions of each plant. At every stage of the 
work the student should be required to make careful drawings 
in his note-book accomDanied by concise descriptions of essential </seg>

            <seg id="p154">
564 


Field Work and Herbarium. — Each student should hare some 
ractice in the collection and preservation of specimens. He 
hould learn the art of herborlzatlon by actual field work and 
hould have enough practice in the drying, mounting and labeling 
f specimens to do the work satisfactorily. Where there 1b little 
r no systematically arranged laboratory work, each student 
hould prepare, as a result of his field work, a herbarium of 
at least one hundred species, mounted on standard herbarium 
heets (11% by 16% inches), and properly labeled. Where the 
tudent performs the laboratory work indicated above, it is sufcient 
to prepare thirty-five specimens. The specimens should 
consist of representatives of each of the larger groups of the 
egetable kingdom. 

I The Botanical Library. — Each accredited school should have 
carefully selected library of botanical books, to which students 
ay have access under proper restrictions. 

CHEMISTRY 

It is recommended that the work in chemistry consist of three 
periods of recitation, together with three periods of laboratory 
work per week in the first semester, and of two periods of red* 
tation, together with two periods of laboratory work per week 
in the second semester, or of five periods of recitation and laboratory 
work for one semester. 

It is not yet advisable, except in two or three of the larger 
high schools, to require or to encourage the carrying on of work 
equivalent to two credit points. Teachers are especially advised 
to base laboratory work upon a good text-book. They should 
five special attention to laboratory work, with the object of 
enabling the student to see and establish a proper connection between 
the theoretical part of the work and the facts upon which 
they are based. 

Laboratory instruction in chemistry may be begun and exceltit 
results reached at a comparatively small expense provided 
e teacher is prepared to do such work. The most important 
factor is the teacher. A teacher not trained in science cannot be 
expected to do good work even with unlimited funds. 

A well lighted room fifteen by twenty feet in area serves as a 
laboratory for from ten to fifteen students. The necessary furnishing 
is inexpensive. A table five by fifteen feet surface area 
and three and a half feet high, placed in the center of the room, 
affords working space for ten students. Water can be supplied 
from a barrel tank placed on a corner bracket. A case for 
chemicals and apparatus and a similar one for a reference library 
may occupy the opposite ends of the room. The total cost of furnishing 
for laboratory work In chemistry need not exceed twenty- </seg>

            <seg id="p155">
565 


Apparatus and Chemicals. — It is not possible to give a detailed 
statement of the amount and cost of material necessary to 
carry out the chemical work mentioned above without first knowing 
the number of students to be Instructed and the other conditions 
affecting the school. The cost of appraratus and chemicals 
to carry out, for a class of ten students, the required work for 
entrance to course 1 at the university need not exceed eighty-live 

Chemical Library. — It is important that each accredited school 
should have a good, well selected and moderate sized chemical 
library. Students should have access to the books and be encouraged 
to consult them. 

CIVICS 

Ker. — The subject matter should embrace national, state 
al government. 

(a) In general the origin, terms, and interpretation of the constitution 
of the United States should be fairly well mastered in 
broad outlines. The actual workings of the government should be 
given careful attention, and parties — their machinery as conventions, 
platforms, etc. — studied. 

EThe same general statements may be made in regard to the 
of state government. However, here the work should be 
more concrete and developed more from its actual workings. 

E inventions should be visited, the tax assessor should be interwed, 
the county treasurer shouiu be asked in regard to state 
es, etc. The student should come into personal contact as far 
as possible with the various departments of the state government, 
legislative, executive and judicial. Especial attention should be 
given to the provision the state makes for the poor, the unfortunate 
and criminals. 

EThe local government should be studied in detail, beginwith 
the school district and supplement with town, township 
ounty government as far as time and opportunity permit. 

Eod. — A text-book may be placed in the hands of the class, 
aught not to be slavishly followed. In each case some 
I or source work should be required. A number of reference 
books are essential Written examinations should be held 
frequently and carefully prepared special papers demanded as 
Often as once per month. Each student should keep a note-book. 

At least two-fifths of the time should be given to local and state 
government, and at least half of this time should be given to 
source work, either In visiting conventions, courts, etc, and describing 
their workings; or in delving over records statutes, etc. </seg>

ENGLISH 

First Yeab 

I. Technical English. Grammar study; capitalization; punctuation; 
abbreviations; forms of composition (heading, margin, 
indention of paragraphs, folding and indorsement) ; marks tor 
correction of essays; review of ordinary letter forms; etymology 
as occasion arises; orthography and orthoepy incidentally; tense 
formation. 

II. Constructive English. Description; studies in individual 
and class visualization and characterization; visualization of 
places and interiors; mood studies. 

As an example of individual visualization, ask the student to 
visualize some friend or prominent character in town; as an 
example of class visualization, he may describe briefly, by the use 
of class characteristics, a policeman and a doctor. Many exercises 
of a similar nature will suggest themselves to the teacher. 

In connection with the visualization of interiors, the student 
may be asked to write several themes in which the visualization 
of the room will suggest the character of the occupant These 
exercises should not be given until the student has written effective 
descriptions of several rooms. 

As occasion arises, the work in technical English should be 
done in connection with the constructive work. In all written 
work, consider natural and easy expression of chief importance. 
It is also advised that every written exercise be carefully corrected 
by the teacher, and then returned to the student 

!1 1 1 . Interpretative English. More independent studies in poetic 
d emotional words; the study of "effects" of kind and degree; 
idy of "types"; prose, poetic and emotional phrases; a study of 
e borrowed element in figurative phrases; a more extended 
idy of the elements; selections for reading at home (each stunt 
will select from a furnished list and report as directed). 

I The following points should be carefully studied in connection 
th all the books assigned: (a) the author's meaning; (6) the 
ntral thought or purpose; (c) is the interest of the book mainly 
the characters or in the incidents? 

I Explain the various classes of poetic and emotional words and 
ive the student bring examples of each class. Then begin 
jangeline, emphasizing the study of words. 

For the study of the elements, selected poems from Tennyson, 
such as fhe Lotus Eaters, The Passing of Arthur and Sir Galahad 
may be used very effectively in the study of figures, phrase*, 
and words.

should now be incidental, it should by no means be neglected. A 
list of common errors in English is here given for the use of both 
teacher and student in the revision of exercises; misplaced modifiers; 
lack of concord (subject and .verb, adjective and noun, pronoun 
and antecedent, subject and complement, principal and 
Blinate verb); mistakes of case; mistakes of mood; misuse 
11 and will; adjective or adverb; conjunctions and preposireference 
of pronouns; unrelated participles; double negawrong 
verb forms; improprieties and barbarisms. 

II. Constructive English. Conversation that characterizes; 
conversation that shows mood; visualization and characterization 
of a crowd; associational themes; (describe a place in such a 
manner that a stranger would wish to see it. Describe a place 
or a room in such a manner that the associational feelings are 
sad. Many exercises of a similar nature may be assigned) ; char 
acter thru mood, character sketches, selecting as subjects the 
various characters found in Elaine; presenting systematically 
the fundamental principles of good composition, the main stress 
being laid upon numerous short themes and occasional longer 
ones. Paragraph themes in descriptions of persons, places, and 
objects within the experience or observation of the student may 
be continued. Point of view, selection and arrangement of details, 
vividness and accuracy should receive attention. 

III. Interpretative English. Tales of a Traveler. The Vision 
of 8ir Launfal, Twice Told Tales, Elaine, and other Idylls constitute 
representative selections for study. These books or their 
equivalents may be used. Study Elaine, emphasizing the work 
on effects. Written preparations on the part of the student 
should be required. Excellent results may be obtained by reading 
Elaine and several of the other Idylls, omitting as deemed 
advisable the first selections mentioned. Examples of the mode 
of association may be found in The Tales of a Traveler. This 
book furnishes also some material for the study of the story. 
The mode of mystery may receive attention here. 

I&gt; author's meaning, the central thought or purpose, and the 
ion and order of details, should be studied in connection 
all books assigned. Selections for reading at home should 
signed by the teacher. 

Third Year 

I. Technical English. The directions for work In the second 
year should here be followed. Attention should also be given to 
polite correspondence and to forms for official and other business.

themes in which such prose statements as "it Is winter" are expressed 
in a feeling way); negative characterization; (the student 
should introduce first character hints which give the reader 
a mistaken impression. Hints which establish the true character 
should then follow) ; short original stories; enlarge upon 
and complete the study of fundamental principles begun in the 
preceding grades. 

Narrative descriptive themes, plot, character, and mood. One 
element should be considered at a time and many short exercises 
be prepared and discussed. A theme of some length may be undertaken 
near the close of the year. These themes should be 
carefully criticised and revised in the light of all previous work. 

The note books in the study of literature should be regarded 
as part of the composition work, and time should be allowed for 
their careful preparation. 

III. Interpretative English. The following selections contain 
material suitable for the third year: Browning, Selected Poems; 
Maclaren, Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush; Chaplin, EH, The Village 
Convict. If time permits, one of Tennyson's Idylls or its 
equivalent may be read. It is suggested that the selections be 
studied in the order mentioned. 

The stories of Eli and The Village Convict furnish excellent 
material for a study of visualization, character and mood. They 
may also form a basis for the study of story construction. 

It is assumed that topics suggested before are kept in mind, 
and adapted to the particular selection of prose or verse in hand. 
The setting, the structure, the elements used, the plot, and the 
central thought suggest topics in addition to those already mentioned. 
Selections for home reading should be given out as 
before. 

Fourth Year 

I. Technical English. Intensive work in grammar. Six or 
eight weeks should be given to this. 

II. Constructive English. Exposition (occasional themes 
should be written outside of class. Personal consultation and 
class criticism should constitute important features not only of 
this particular topic, but also of all the work in English) ; argument 
(nature and purpose; kinds; order; climax); actual practice 
in debate; constructive work continued. 

III. Interpretative English. The minor poems of Milton, 
Paradise Lost, I and II, Silas Marner and Macbeth, or their 
equivalents are recommended as suitable books for the work In 
this grade. 

A note-book should be used by the student and written work 
handed in at each recitation. 

Silas Marner furnishes material for the study of the novel. 

If time permit, the minor poems of Milton, and "Paradise Lost" 
I and II, may be taken up for additional study. </seg>

Those high schools that do not continue the work beyond the 
third year may omit some of the selections mentioned in the 
first, second, and third years, and select for the last year's work 
Macbeth or other desired topics from the work outlined for the 
fourth year.

GEOLOGY 

I Geology is the application of all the natural sciences in the 
Oder landing of the earth. Accordingly it exercises many faclties, 
but abwre all develops the power of observation. Since 
things geological surround and become a part of the daily experience 
of every man, a little training in geology is a desirable 
part of every one's early training. Whether it be rocks, soils, or 
crops nourished by them, the rain, or any of the many associated 
conditions, — it is all geological, and every one, no matter what 
his walk in life Is to be, will be the better for a little knowledge 
of the commoner and simpler laws governing suoh matters. He 
will at least be able to account rationally for ordinary phenomena. 

Geology must necessarily be taught in an elementary way in the 
secondary schools, but it should not be omitted entirely from the 
course of study. The best work which the teacher of geology can 
do is to train the students to notice such universal geological 
work as the action of the wind, rain, frost, stream, tide, etc. 
Such work demands no tools or apparatus, entails little loss of 
time, and involves no expense. Send the students into the field, 
for it is the best laboratory. In making short excursions either 
alone or accompanied by an instructor, each student should 
carry a stout knife, garden trowel, or light pick to dig with, and 
some sort of hammer, preferably a geological hammer. Old newspapers 
are suitable for wrapping small specimens which are to 
be taken home. The specimens should be labeled, at least with 
the place, date, collector, and name of the specimen when learned, 
and notes should be written out respecting the work done. Students 
apparently enjoy making columnar sections and plotting on 
paper the soil, subsoil, and rocks as far as it is exposed. All that 
Is needed ordinarily is a start. 

Irder to encourage and promote an interest in the study of 
al geography and elementary geology, the university furupon 
application, sets of duplicate specimens to such acid 
schools as have suitable cases for them. These sets, to 
occasional additions are made, are educational in nature, 
Ling of minerals, rocks, fossils, etc., and are part of the 
cms by the Hon. Charles H. Morrill. </seg>

FRENCH 

Schools preparing in French should offer for the first year 
thoro instruction in pronunciation, the elements of grammar 
(i. e., the common Inflections, the irregular verbs included), and 
simple reading; and for the second year, syntax and modern as 
well as classical reading. The chief aim in view should be a 
good pronunciation, and the ability to read with accuracy (baaed 
on familiarity with the forms and main syntactical rules of the 
language) ordinary modern and classical French. The following 
plan of study is recommended, but equivalents may of course be 
offered : 

Fibst Yeab 

A knowledge of the principles of pronunciation and of grammar, 
using any short methodical grammar; and about five hundred 
pages of reading, using van Daell's French Reader, Verne's 
Le Tour du Monde, Thlers' Expedition de Bonaparte en Egypte, 
HalSvy's L'Abb6 Constantin, or other text books of equivalent 
standard. 

Second Yeab 

Continuation of the first year's work, including syntax and 
reading of modern and classical literature, as suggested under 
courses 2, 4, university calendar. 

GERMAN 

The minimum preparation which fits the student to carry successfully 
the second year's "work at the university is as followB: 

The first semester and half of the second semester should be 
devoted to a systematic study of formal grammar. Any good 
grammar answers this need. The chief topics for drill are: pronunciation; 
the inflectional system of nouns; pronoun-;; adjectives; 
the prepositions; the principal parts of strong verbs; the 
conjugation of modal auxiliaries, of strong and weak verbs; the 
order of words in the normal, the inverted, the transposed constructions; 
derivatives; and about seventy-five per cent of the 
vocabulary of the grammar used. It may be best under some 
circumstances to commence easy readings once or twice a week 
as early as the third or fourth month of study; but the essentials 
of the grammar should be regarded as the work of the first, and 
about half of the second, semester. 

During the latter half of the second semester, and during the 
third semester, the study of formal grammar need not occupy 
much time, but the grammer itself should not be neglected. In 
the course of every reading lesson there is ample opportunity to </seg>

            <seg id="p161">

HIGH SCHOOL MANUAL. 

be strengthened in grammar— in verbs, principal parts; order of 
words, etc. While it is not at all desirable to turn a text simply 
into material illustrative of grammatical points, it is desirable 
nd necessary, in order to prevent guessing and hit-or-miss tranaations, 
to know the why's and the wherefore's of the sentence. 
n other words, it is necessary to know the grammatical relaion 
of the various parts of the sentence. Good idiomatic Engish 
should always be insisted upon. In no other way can the 
difference in the sentence structure of the two languages be 
brought out clearly. Occasionally there should be easy German 
composition, either in the form of original sentences or variations 
of those found in the texts read. 

The vocabulary is an important factor in the acquisition of a 
foreign language. Students should retain, apart from the context 
n which a word occurs, at least seventy-five per cent of the vocabulary 
(German-English, not English-German) found in the text. 
The other twenty-five per cent of words are perhaps not worth 
the trouble to make them a permanent part of the student's 
mental resources. The more uncommon words or expressions 
have accomplished their purpose in serving temporarily to interpret 
the narrative in the hands of the student. As he continues 
his study of German, the percentage of words retained naturally 
increases. 

Reading 

a. Selections from Stern's Oeachichten von Rhein, or Andersen's 
Bilderbuch ohne Bilder. and Storm's Immensee. 

b. Zschokke's Der Zcrbrochene Krug, or his Das Wirtshaus zu 
Cransac. or Frommell's Eingeschneit. 

If the high school desires to fit its graduates for the third year 

of the university courses in German, the work as outlined below, 
or its equivalent, should be carried thru the fourth, fifth and 
sixih semesters. The texts are arranged approximately in the 

order in which they should be read. 

a. Sfille Wasser, 62 pages and vocabulary; or Carmen Sylva's 
Aus Meinem Konigreich, 54 pages and vocabulary. 

b. Baumbach's Sommermarchen, 55 pages and vocabulary: or 
Wildenbruch's Der Letzte, 60 pages. 

c. Tales from Hauff, 100 pages; or Charlotte Niese's Aus danischer 
Zeit, 82 pages. 

d. Roseggre's Waldheimat, 84 pages; or Moser's Romeo und Julia 
auf dem Dotfe, 105 pages. 

e. Baumbach's Frau Holde, 95 pages; or Moser's Kopnickerstrasse.

GREEK 

The following course of study is recommended for schools that 
are able to give one, two, or three years to the study of Greek. 
The course is based upon five recitation periods weekly thruout 
the school year. 

Fibst Tear 

erst Semester. — Elementary lessons; inflection of nouns; con- 
Uon of regular verbs; mastery of a vocabulary of 400 or 500 
Is; reading of easy selections. 

Second Semester. — Elementary lessons finished; conjugation of 
irregular verbs; Xenophon's Anabasis, fifteen to twenty-five 
pages, or an equivalent amount of other easy prose narrative; 
daily practice in reading aloud and in writing Greek. 

I Special attention should be given during the first year to the 
mn and verb forms and the more elementary principles of 
ntax. 

Second Year 

First Semester. — Xenophon's Anabasis, Books I and II. Thoro 
review of noun and verb forms: studies in syntax; principles of 
word formation. Daily practice in reading aloud and in writing 
Greek. 

Second Semester.— Xenophon's Anabasis (continued), Books 
II and IV, or other Attic prose, sixty to seventy-five pages; systematic 
study of the grammar; practice in reading aloud and in 
ranslating at sight. Greek prose composition, based upon Books 
and II of the Anabasis, or the completion of twenty-five to 
thirty lessons of some standard Greek composition manual. 

Third Yeab 

First Semester. — Homer The Iliad, Books I, II, III (omitting 
Book II, 494 — end). Special attention should be given to epic 
forms and constructions; the dactylic hexameter carefully 
studied; constant drill in scansion. 

Second Semester. — Homer, 1,800 to 2,000 lines which may be 
¦elected from the Iliad or the Odyssey. A systematic study of the 
epic dialect and syntax. (Constant practice in reading the dactylic 
hexameter with intelligent expression. 

A thoro and methodical study of Greek grammar is necessary 
as a basis for accurate and intelligent reading. There should be 
systematic instruction in Greek prose composition during the 
first and second years. Constant practice in reading aloud is 
strongly recommended, since this aids greatly in the treatment 
Of Greek as a living language. Practice in the reading of an- </seg>

prepared passages (sight translation) is recommended during tne 
Becond and third years. This enables the teacher to discern the 
difficulties which the student may have in translating a new sentence, 
and gives the student readiness and confidence in the language. 
Rapid reading should be judiciously combined wich exact 
translation and with constant practice in writing Greek. 

Students who may not have been able to secure Greek in the 
high school can begin the study of the language at the university. 
Those who have had even a minimum amount can continue the 
study from any point they may have reached in the high school. 
In either case full college credit Is given for elementary Greek 
carried at the university, if the student has the necessary number 
of entrance credits in other subjects. 

HISTORY— AMERICAN 

Subject Matter. — The work in American history should be 
done in the eleventh and twelfth grades. The period covered 
should !&gt;e from 1600 to 1865. Very little time should be given to 
the period of exploration and discovery; it is doubtful if much 
gain accrues from time given to the period since 1865. Both of 
» epochs should be treated in a general way, and only as in¦tory 
to and complementary of the main part of the work, 
ackbone of the history work should be the political his- 
This should be supplemented by studies in social, religious 
and industrial life. The diplomacy of the country should be 
considered, but comparatively little attention should be paid to 
the details of battles. Institutions are of primary importance, 
and their growth and development should be traced with the 
greatebt care. 

Equipment. — A reference library of not less than one hundred 
volumes should be available, and at least one-tenth should be 
source books. Note books must be kept, and detached or loose 
sheets are preferred to ordinary blank books. 

I [-hod. — Without determining what the method shall be, it 
be said negatively that It must be more than a mere textmemory 
study. At least one-fifth of the time must be given 
urce work. Note-books must be kept. Much written work 
d be demanded. Some attention should be paid to the mean 
f "source," "secondary" material, etc. Carefully written pa 
should be prepared, and an attempt made to have the stu 
investigate some little topic for himself. Constant practice 
alysis is found valuable. 

Teachers. — The history teacher should be as much a specialist 
as the teacher of language, mathematics or science. It is impossible 
for one who has not made a careful study of the subject to 
be a competent teacher, hence when this condition is not ful- </seg>

H I STORY— EUROPEAN 

The first year of work In history should be given to European 
history, and preferably to Greek and Roman history, one semester 
being devoted to each. In schools where this Is impossible, the 
year may be devoted to a general survey of European history. 

Material and Methods. — Where the sources are taught the 
schools are expected to provide the student with a book of sources. 
The recitation should consist of criticism and comparison of answers, 
the students being required to prove all they say by cita 
tlons from the text All new points brought out in the class 
hould be taken down by the student In his note-book. After the 
tudy of a topic is complete, the student should be required to go 
carefully over his answers and class room notes and make an outine 
concerning all the conclusions in topical order. These outines 
should then be put on the board and criticised. The last step 
Is to write a narrative based on the outline, portions of which 
hould be read and criticised in the class. For each topic the 
method is the same — answers, discussion, outline and narrative, 
londensed outlines and oral reviews bind the topics together. 
Constant use should be made of historical wall maps and photoraphs 
or pictures. A number of historical maps in colors should 
te constructed during the year. 

At the end of the year each student should know (1) how to 
make an outline; (2) what a source is and how to use it; and 
(3) how to read a chapter in a narrative history and give the substance 
of it 

In case a general survey of European history is given, it is 
Impossible to work over all the material in Sheldon, and it is 
better to make the studies upon critical periods, connecting these 
studies by one narrative. 

Additional work In European history, after the first year of 
required study, may be done In English, mediaeval or modern

only two of the Catilines be read, and that the defense of Archias 
be taken last. An equivalent of one oration may be substituted 
from Cicero's letters. 

Fourth Year 

Vergil's Aeneid. Six books. The Eclogues may be substituted 
for 6ne. An equivalent of two books may be read from Ovid. 
Book VI should not be omitted. A thoro drill in Prosody, case 
constructions and poetic idioms. The student should acquire the 
ability to read metrically hexameters at sight. 

P Roman method of pronunciation should be used. Great

The purpose of the prose composition is to give the student a 
prompt and ready knowledge of forms and constructions. It 
should be interspersed thruout the reading of Caesar and Cicero. 
The quantity of the long vowels should be marked in all composition 
exercises. 

MATHEMATICS 

Arithmetic, algebra, geometry, trigonometry should be taught 
as one connected organized whole, — the science of mathematics. 
Therefore algebra and geometry should be begun in arithmetic, 
and applications to arithmetic should be constantly made in the 
study of geometry and algebra and further on in the study of 
trigonometry. Furthermore, the use of tables, usually deferred 
until trigonometry is taken up, should be started in arithmetic 
and made a feature of the high school work thruout the four 

Not only should this connection between the various branches 
of mathematics be emphasized, but also the applications of mathematics 
in other lines of study and in daily life should be kept 
constantly before the student. 

The characteristic of mathematics is exactness. Therefore accuracy 
in all work must be insisted upon. Careful writing out 
of problems and solutions, of theorems and demonstrations, constant 
checking of computations and demonstrations, constant 
questionings as to the reasons of things, are essential. Along 
with this drill in accuracy there should be constant incentive to 
the student thinking for himself. Learning of the book's proofs 
should be only a means to the end, "learning to prove." This 
reliance on the book and teacher should lead to reliance on power 
to demonstration combined with habits of testing all statements,

Below is pugge-ted a three-years course in algebra and geometry, 
this being the time usually alloted to those subjects. It is 
better to spread the work over five years, starting in the eighth 
grade, and correspondingly diminishing the amount given in any 
one year. Perhaps this may be possible in some schools. It is a 
great help if the high school course can at least have been preceded 
by drawing and exercises in inventional geometry- 

Ficst Yeab 

About one-third of plane geometry. It should be begun slowly 
and with exercises in demonstration at the very start. 

The algebra should embrace (a) exercises in passing from ordinary 
to algebra language and back; (6) equations of the first deree 
in one unknown and problems leading -to them; (c) use of 
ormulae i working rules) in calculations, (d) The four rnl.s 
or integral expressions; (e) factorization, if) The four rule3 
or fractions, (g) L. C. M. and H. C. F. with geometric illustraions.

generalized universal arithmetic. Geometric illustration has been

&gt;e introduced in connection with almost every process of algebra. 

Seco.xd Yeab 

balance of plane geometry, with applications to mensura»n, 
derivation or formulae, surveying, and graphic computation. 

The algebra should embrace: (a) plotting of equations of the 
flrst degree in two unknowns; (b) solution of simultaneous systems 
of the first degree; (c) solution of quadratic equations in 
one unknown; (d) plotting of two equations in two unku 
which are quadratic in one of them; (e) solution cf the system 
a quadratic and a linear equation; (f) problems, as practical as 
may be, all the time leading to the above sorts of equations; 
(g) testing of all work. 

Third Yeab 

Solid geometry, spending considerable time on the first book 
concerning intersections of planes, also on the last book concerning 
the geometry of the sphere. Applications to perspectivg 
mensuration, geography, astronomy and navigation should be a 
feature of the instruction. 

t Three-fourths of the student's time should be given to the exerses 
with especial emphasis upon those illustrating algebra or 
volving the use of algebra. In order to get clear ideas It is 
«essary for most students to construct space models. 

The algebra should embrace: (a) the theory of radicals and 
equations involving them; (6) the theory of exponents and logarithms; 
(c) at least weekly practice in the use of tables; (d) the </seg>

solution of simultaneous quadratics and problems leading to 
them; (e) the graphic solution of quadratics by circles and lines; 
if) a review of fractions and equations under tne name of ratios 
and proportions, comparing with the geometric treatment; (jr) 
the progressions, noting that numbers in arithmetical progression 
are logarithms of those in geometrical; (h) Pascal's triangle 
and the binominal-theorem for positive integers; (t) testing of all 
work, especially computations with tables. 

Ihools not prepared to give as thoro a course as here outlined 
omit the third year's algebra, since that is now given at tne 
ersity, confining thejr attention to solid geometry, with such 
ications and illustrations of the algebra learned in the first 
years as may be possible. 

The larger schools may offer a half-year course in plane trigonometry. 
The student can well be introduced to this before taking 
up solid geometry and then made to apply it in the solid 
giometry. It gives an excellent illustration of the usefulness of 
both algebra and geometry and, if accuracy under tests is insisted 
upon, a valuable drill in computation. Four-place tables, separate 
from the text and with conveniences for interpolation, should be 
in each student's hands. 

Phe computations should be based upon the student's own 
¦ements, if possible. Not only should the texts used by the 
i be of scientific value and preferably each student owning 
ts, but also a library of reference books accessible to the 

PHYSICS 

!ie laboratory course should consist of at least forty experits 
of the list recommended by the committee of the Nebraska 
hers of physical science. Each student should perform these 
riments individually. As far as possible the custom of hav 
a group of students perform a single experiment should be 
ded in order tha.. each one may rely on his own observations 
resources in executing the experiment. The metric system 
lid be used in all measurements and calculations. 

Blents who have satisfactorily completed the course, according 
above outline, receive two credit points, as preparation to the 
rity. 

Schools properly equipped for class-room demonstrations and 
the laboratory work are able to complete the work in one year. 
The time should be equally divided between the class-room and 
the laboratory. Three periods each, per week, for the year should 
be sufficient for the completion of the required work. When only 
one-half of the time is available, this should be devoted to the 
completion of the first half of the ccurse, rather than attempting 
to go over the entire subject matter in a necessarily superficial 
and unsatisfactory manner. </seg>

Class-boom ai»d the Laboratory. — The ciass-room should be a 
well-lighted room, with south exposure if possible. This should 
be prodded with a large lecture table containing drawers for 
supplies and storage of the smaller accessories used In the lecture 
experiment It should also be supplied with water and a 
¦ink, which may be transformed Into a pneumatic trough. Connections 
for gas should be available. Curtains for darkening the 
room should be provided and means for reflecting sunlight into 
the room to the lecture table. When possible electric connections 
should be secured. 

Spectrum charts and portraits of noted scientific men are 
stiongly recommended as much more inspiring and instructive 
than bare walls. 

The laboratory should be large and well ventilated and adjoining 
the class-room. A number of heavy tables of suitable size 
end height should be provided for the different experiments. A 
sink and a sufficient water supply is essential. When a water 
system is not available a two- or three-barrel tank may be used, 
and located near the class-room, so that connections to the lectu.-e 
table can be made. A case for holding chemicals Is necessary. 
A part of the experiments, such as in sound and light, may be performed 
in the class-room. There should be a bench and tools 
supplied for constructive work. 

A large, well-filled case of reference books should be conveniently 
near for the students' use. One or two of the more general 
scientific periodicals are recommended for the reading table. 

ArrARATUs. — In many experiments, simple apparatus is quite 
as efficient as the more elaborate and expensive instruments. If 
unds are limited, apparatus of the simpler kind should be seured 
rather than a few expensive pieces. Among the first things 
o supply are generators and blast lamps for working glass, etc.. 
glass tubing, different kinds of wire, cork borers, files, soldering 
rons, clamps, test tubes, flasks, etc., meter sticks, micrometer 
screws, etc.; a suitable balance, a clock with seconds pendulum, 
etc. 

PHYSICAL, GEOGRAPHY 

tAny good text-book In physical geography serves as a guide, 
it it should not be slavishly followed. No two situations afford 
e same physical conditions. The study of the air currents, 
therefore, of the storms, streams and their work, rocks, fossils, 
and general configuration of the earth must always be modified 
and adapted to each particlular case. Follow the order of topics 
in the text-books, but introduce each topic by investigating local 
conditions. The newer texts dealing more particularly with 
physiography are especially recommended for high schools. It 
is recommended that physical geography be generally placed in </seg>

the first year of the high school and that at least one semester 
be devoted to the subject. 

PHYSIOLOGY 

Eh school course in physiology can not be regarded as acunless 
it embraces a considerable amount of laboratory 
And since a knowledge of structure most precede an 
w nt appreciation of function, there must be included dissections, 
made, if possible, by the students themselves. Every 
scholar should have at least the opportunity of studying and 
sketching all preparations, since little can be derived from a mere 
demonstration by the instructor. 

For the study of the finer anatomy of the body a microscope 
is necessary, which may be that used for the Mologica 
work. In many cases It is desirable to use fresh material — 
blood secured by pricking ihe finger, connective tissue from the 
market, and nerve fibers obtained by chloroforming a small animal 
and examining the nerve at cnce before post mortem changes 
occur. But each school should possess in addition a series of 
typical mounted slides to illustrate structures which can not thus 
be studied. Such a eeries may be procured thru the university 
at a cost of thirty cents each, or a set of twenty-five for $6.00. 
Further Information can be secured by addressing the department 
of zoology. This series may be selected from the following list 
of slides: (1) frog's blood, (2) section of decalcified bone, (3) 
sections of developing bone and other tissue, (4) teased striated 
muscle, (5) cross-section of striated muscle, (6) cross and longitudinal 
sections of non-striated muscle, (7) cross-section of a 
nerve, (8) section of skin, (9) section of a hair, (10) crosssection 
of artery and vein, (11) cross-section of trachea, (12) 
section of lung, (13) section of tongue, (14) section of salivary 
glands, (16) section of stomach wall, (16) cross-section of small

Uons can be illustrated may be carried out by the students upon 
themselves and by means of various pieces of home-made apparatus 
which suggest themselves to the mind ot the thoughtful 
teacher. Most of the more recent text-books of physiology contain 
laboratory directions which furnish a basis for such work. 
Vivisection in public schools is not only quite unnecessary, but 
Tery undesirable. 

Suggestions as to the purchase of books of reference are given 
on application to the inspector. The kind of physiological work 
done in the grammar grades is not accepted as high school work 
for entrance credit. 

POLITICAL. ECONOMY 

A very small school should not include political economy In 
Its course of study. Schools proposing to teach political economy 
will do well to consult this department at the university or 
elsewhere. The subject should be taught by one who has given 
considerable attention to political economy in some college or 
university. Any good elementary text will do. 

ZOOU)GY 

In most cases but one semester's work is advised, altho schools 
with well-equipped laboratories may profitably spend a year on 
the subject. A very satisfactory plan Involves the study of 
botany and zoology, alternately thruout the week during an 
entire year. The inspector should be consulted with regard to 
class and laboratory texts to insure the selection of suitable 
works. 

No work is accepted for credit which does not include a proper 
amount of laboratory work. On the average, at least two class 
periods should be spent in the laboratory, each of these being according 
to general regulation of double length. 

LFor zoology the same laboratory equipment may be employed 
for botany. The school should possess a small, carefully selected 
collection illustrating the great groups of animal life, 
especially those which are not represented in this region. This 
department gladly advises regarding the purcnase of such specimens 
and apparatus. 

The regular laboratory work should cover the study of a 
limited number or carefully selected types, and this study should 
E accompanied by notes and drawings in all cases. The number 
forms studied should not exceed fifteen in one semester and 
eferably eight to ten. 

No course should be planned without devoting some time to 
excursion and study in the laboratory of nature. Such work 
must be laid out very definitely to prevent its becoming desul- </seg>

No life certificate or normal diploma whatever is valid in

acting State Superintendent. 

Iefore endorsing professional certificates or life diplomas

jable success of the applicant; otherwise, the provision of 
law requiring such endorsement would be a meaningless

SUGGESTIONS TO CANDIDATES 

Ee following brief statements relative to the scope and 
*cter of the examinations in the different subjects and 
preparation required are submitted by the committee. 
r will be found suggestive to those who expect to take the 
examinations. 

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS 

No particular text-books will be followed in any subject. 
Any good, modern treatment of the subject will meet the reauirements. 
The tests of scholarship will aim, however, to 
follow ihe most approved recent educational thought. 

The aim will be to test the applicant's power and his knowledge 
of principles. It is a mistake in preparing for an examination 
to crowd the memory with facts and names which 
are retained only until the ordeal of examination has been </seg>

PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATES. 

While the examiners expect answers as full and elaborate 
as the time allows, it does not by any means follow that the 
value of the answer is commensurate with its length. A 
liberal discount will be made for long padded paragraphs, 
the whole thought content of which might be condensed 
into a few words. An examination is intended to test the 
candidate's ability to seize upon and present clearly the essential 
points of the topic or discussion assigned. 

Kie neatness of manuscript, knowledge of English^ grammar 
of English composition as shown by papers in all subjects 
be considered in grading papers 

It ia intended to make the tests searching and thorough, 
although not long nor exhaustive. We believe the ambitious 
teachers of the state will not be satisfied with examinations 
requiring only superficial preparation. We believe they desire 
with us to maintain a high standard of scholarship for 
professional teachers in Nebraska. 

The following special suggestions are added relative to each 
of the several subjects : 

ENGLISH LITERATURE 

I^he candidate should be prepared to write a brief review of 
ae book, essay or poem, of a standard character, which 
may have recently read. 

Iuniliar knowledge of the chief works of writers representthe 
best types of the periods in which they lived should be 
iessed by the candidate. Among English men of letters 
following names stand out prominently: Chaucer, 
ncer, Milton, Shakespeare, Burns, Burke, Tennyson, 
wning, Macaulay and Froude; among Americans, Franklin, 
nning, Bancroft, Prescott, Bryant, Longfellow, Webster, 
'ell and Fiske. The student will not go far astray if he 
:es the works of the above writers the backbone of his 
'ary efforts. 

t critical study of a few such masterpieces as Cymbaline, 
Jet, Paradise Lost, In Memoriam, The Cathedral, etc., 
titutes the best literary preparation. Power to discern 
appreciate literary merit is more to be desired than boundreading 
without such power. </seg>

STATE SUPERINTENDENT'S REPORT. 

Pe to this form of preparation Sherman's Analytics 
nded. For more specific but less comprehensive 
Sherman's "What is Shakespeare?" is excellent, 
ae's History of English Literature is the most excomplete 
treatise on the growth and development 
tject. Among the many brief manuals, Noble's 
American Literature and Shaw's New History o'f 
nd English Literature are worthy of recommenda- 

The forty-third chapter of Genesis, the twenty-third and 
149th Psalms, and the thirteenth chapter of Corinthians are 
masterpieces of literary beauty. They are types of the rich 
literary treasures stored away within the pages of the Scriptures. 
Search and ye shall find. 

GENERAL HISTORY 

Eie student should have a comprehensive grasp, not only 
le facts, but also of the philosophy of history. The folng 
points will assist in preparing for this subject: 

1. Historical causes and effects; sequence of events; the 
growth and decay of institutions ; the development of law and 
government; the effect of Ancient and Mediaeval civilization 
upon Modern. 

2. The development and crystallization of ideas in principles 
of government, in law and in religion. 

3. An intimate acquaintance with the epoch-making events 
of history. 

4. The pursuits and occupations of the people of the different 
nations, their ideals and ambitions. 

The student should read several reliable narrative texts, 
supplementing as freely as possible with sources: Myers 
(Ginn &amp; Co.), Fisher (American Book Co.), Sheldon, source 
(D. C. Heath &amp; Co.) 

RHETORIC 

A thorough knowledge of the elements of English grammar 
and composition should precede the study of formal rhetoric. 
In determining the candidate's credits in rhetoric, grammatical 
as well as rhetorical tests will be applied.

argument and verse, should be possessed by each candidate 
for a teacher's life certificate. 

Entence structure, punctuation, paragraphing, together 
classification of figures of speech, literary analysis and 
sion will constitute the basis of examination. 

The manuscript of the candidate will likewise be considered 
in making up the credits in this subject. 

Eie following texts are recommended as standard: Car peni 
Elements of Rhetoric and Composition (The Macmillan 
; Kellogg's Rhetoric (Maynard, Merrill &amp; Co. ); Genung's 
toric (Ginn A Co.). 

PHYSICAL GEOGRAPHY 

Iead modern texts, such as Davis, Gilbert &amp; Brigham, Tarr,

rnal of Geography ; if convenient, the National Geograph- 
Magazine; and that part of the State Course of Study 
ring on Geography. * 

J^The candidate should know something of the physiographic 
agencies now acting and their resulting land forms. Study 
the physiography of the United States, noting the origin of 
the different features and their control over human habitation. 
Also, carefully study the physiography of Nebraska and the 
adjacent states. Do sufficient field work to obtain clear ideas 
of weathering, erosion, transportation, deposit, etc. Study 
as many topographic features as possible. Use the U. S. Geological 
Survey Topographic maps. Become familiar with the 
important topics treated in the texts. 

CHEMISTRY 

In the science of chemistry it is important that the candidate 
have laboratory training or experience. A reading knowledge 
alone cannot be deemed sufficient for the person who expects 
Success either in the examination or in teaching this 
branch. 

§ clear understanding must be had of the properties, disution, 
uses, sources, and affinities of all the important elects; 
the reactions which take place in well-known chemical 
jesses; the computation of the proportions of particular
