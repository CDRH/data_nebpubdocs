            <seg id="p003">OFFICE OF STATE LIBRARIAN. Lincoln, December 20, 1916. To the Honorable John H. Morehead, Governor of Nebraska As required by law I herewith submit my report as librarian of the Nebraska state library for the biennium ending December 1, 1916. An examination of the report shows that on Decem - ber 1. 1914, the library had on its shelves 69,608 regular - ly accessioned volumes and that during the last biennium there has been added 3,383 volumes by purchase and exchange, making a total of 72,991 volumes now con - tained in the library. Unbound volumes, pamphlets and an accumulation of thousands of volumes of Nebraska (supreme court reports, session laws, house and senate journals and departmental reports are not included in the above figures. During the bierinuun volumes 96, 97, 98 and 99 of the Nebrnnka supreme court reports have been published. Of those reports 865 have been distributed free or exchanged for like material from sister states, and 1.256 sold at $2.00 per volume. AVe have also sold 798 volumes of reports published prior to this biennium, and 906 volumes of session laws. The proceeds of all such sales, amounting to $4,995, have been paid to the state .treasurer and placed to the credit of the library fund for the purchase of books. The legislature of 1915 appropriated out of this fund the sum of $7,000 for the purchase of books for this biennium with the under - standing that there should also be paid out of the same some outstanding accounts incurred in the vears 1913 - 14, but after the lejrislatnre had adjourned, the state auditor ruled that the old accounts could not be paid </seg>
            <seg id="p004">4 REPORT OF THE out of the new appropriation, and I am asking Iliat the coming legislature appropriate the sum of $:&gt;8.").r&gt;3 to pay such accounts. , The sum of $T&gt;00 which was appropriated by the last legislature for bookcases and shelving lias l&gt;een expended in the building of five new cases on top of the wooden stacks in the west end of the main library room. These new cases have given us "&gt;60 additional feet of shelf room, and are of such style and con - struction that they can l&gt;e used when a new building is provided. During the past two years, however, the new books coming into the library required nearly 800 feet of shelf space. Tt is imperative that we have more shelf room and T am asking the legislature to appropriate at least $750 for that purpose. The most superficial examination of the library will disclose the necessity for additional room and conveniences and for its protection. Two years ago in my report to your Excellency, I said : "I would not be performing my duty as custodian of Nebraska's priceless library if T failed to direct your attention to its shameful neglect by those whose busi - ness it is to provide it with suitable quarters and pro - tect it from destruction by fire. In 1904, 1906, 1908, 1910 and 1912, your Excellency's predecessors, recog - nizing the deplorable and dangerous conditions that existed, brought the matter to the attention of the legislatures and urged prompt action. * * * And during these years we have seen the libraries of Towa, Mis - souri. Wisconsin and New York devastated bv fire! "This is the situation. Nebraska's splendid li - brary, worth approximately half a million dollars, the achievement of fifty years of well directed effort, is crowded and cramped in poorly lighted, ]&gt;oorly ventilat - ed fpjarters in a crumbling, tottering building, every day exposed to the danger of destruction by fin 1 and </seg>
            <seg id="p005">STATE LIBRARIAN, 1915-1916 5 absolutely nothing l&gt;eing done for it by those who are responsible for its preservation and safe keeping. "By the big book concerns of the country it is estimated that the value of our library is increasing at the rate of $'20,000 every year by reason of the ■enhancing price of out-of-print books which are now on our shelves. "It would seem that ordinary business judgment would demand that this valuable property be cared for." Rich, prosperous, progressive Nebraska cannot afford to stand still and wait for the crumbling walls of its capitol building to return to dust or for its valuable state records and property to be destroyed by fire. The levy of one mill on each dollar of valua - tion throughout the state will raise $500,000 a year. The levy of three-fourths of a mill for one year would provide a modern, up-to-date fire-proof building for the use of the state library, supreme court and attorney general, and a tax-payer having projwrty worth $5,000 would be obliged to pav the sum of 75 cents. It is to l»e hoped that the legislature of 1917 will rise to the occasion and provide for a new capitol building, but, in any event, the state library should be properly taken care of. Attached to this report is a statement of the condition of the librarv and supreme court funds, a detailed statement of the receipt and disposition of supreme court reports, and an appendix showing the additions to the state library, alphabetically arranged. Very respectfully, State Librarian. H. 0. LINDSAY, </seg>
