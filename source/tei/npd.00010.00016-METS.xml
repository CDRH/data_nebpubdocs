ALFALFA EXPERIENCES 

Daring the winter of 1902 a list of between 600 and 70O 
successful alfalfa raisers in this state was collected, and to «acb 
was sent a report blank calling for a definite statement regarding 1 
a number of the processes he employed in obtaining his stand of 
alfalfa, and also regarding his subsequent care of the crop. 
More than five hundred satisfactory replies were received, representing 
eighty counties in the state. A study of this large number 
of reports from successful alfalfa raisers gives some valuable 
information respecting alfalfa culture. 

Eere were 988 stands reported upon upland, and 273 upon 
m land. Even in the western portion of the state th« 
ut of alfalfa on the upland is shown to be considerable, and </seg>

            <seg id="p002">
that region. In the eastern part of the state somewhat heavier 
yields appear to be obtained from bottom land, but loss from 
winterkilling or other cause is greater. Twenty-three reports 
¦tate that upland is more satisfactory than bottom land. 
These come principally from the eastern portion of the state or 
the irrigated land of the western portion. 

An astonishing feature of the replies is the large amount of 
alfalfa that they show to be growing on- land with a clay subsoil. 
Sandy clay, clay loam, clay and lime, etc., were not counted as 
clay. In spite of this limitation, 245 clay or gumbo subsoils are 
reported. A clay or even a gumbo subsoil does not appear to 
be a barrier to successful alfalfa culture. 

The seed bed was prepared by plowing and further working in 
373 cases, and by disking or cultivating in 75. Among the 
latter is one method that appears to be popular and satisfactory. 
This consists in thoroughly disking corn land after all trash has 
been removed from the field. In the western part of the state 
there are a number of good stands of alfalfa obtained by breaking 
prairie sod, disking it, and harrowing in the seed; also by 
disking the unbroken sod, and harrowing in the seed. The 
latter commends itself as an easy way of supplementing the 
native grasses in pastures. The tendency to dispense with plowing 
on unirrigated land increases with the distance westward from 
the Missouri. 

A study of the dates of sowing alfalfa seed in the spring shows 
a range from early March to late June, although where advice 
was volunteered it was practically unanimous in favor of early 
sowing. There were only eight reports of summer or fall sowing, 
of which one was sown in July, four in August, and three 
in September. 

In 108 cases a nurse crop was used, while in 393 cases the 
al alfa seed was sown without that of any other crop. The use 
of the nurse crop was largely confined to extreme eastern 
Nebraska and the irrigated land of the west. Many persons who </seg>

            <seg id="p003">
been recommended to use a light seeding of small grain, sown 
earlier or with the alfalfa, to prevent damage by severe winds. 
When sown in this way the nurse crop is mown when eight or 
ten inches high, to prevent it smothering the alfalfa. 

E55 cases the seed was pat in with a drill, and in 447 case* 
i sown broadcast. This is at least an indication that if a 
is not available a satisfactory stand can be obtained by 
casting and harrowing in, provided the other conditions are 

There were 138 reports of less than twenty pounds of seed per 
acre being used, and 336 reports of twenty pounds or more being 
sown. The evidence seems to be in favor of the use of at least 
twenty pounds of seed per acre. 

Ef the persons replying to the inquiries, 221 have stands of 
fa that yield more than four tons of cured hay per acre each 
m, while 157 do not get as much as four tons of hay per 

Of persons having practiced disking alfalfa in the spring or at 
other times, 138 report that beneficial results have been obtained, 
while seven report that disking has been ineffective or injurious. 
By disking alfalfa is meant going over it in the spring with a 
disk harrow before growth starts, or during summer immediately 
after cutting for hay. It is customary to set the disks at a slight 
angle. This cuts the crown root and stirs the soil. Some of the 
correspondents prefer harrowing to disking. Where positive 
objection was made to disking, it was based on the claim that it 
caused the crowns to become diseased. The great bulk of Tthe 
evidence was, however, in favor of disking. 

tif the persons who have manured alfalfa, either by plowing 
tie manure immediately before seeding or by spreading it on 
field after a stand had been obtained, 110 obtained beneficial 
Its, and 13 found it to be ineffective or injurious. Objec-8 
are based on the claim that plowing in manure causes the 
to dry out, but objections to spreading manure on alfalfa are 
er indefinite in their nature, except that on low land it makes </seg>

            <seg id="p004">
who advocate its nse specify that the manure should be rotted 
and fine. One man suggests harrowing after spreading, to fine 
it. The reports of beneficial results from plowing under manure 
come largely from the eastern portion of the state, but the use of 
fine manure applied as a top dressing has proven beneficial in all
