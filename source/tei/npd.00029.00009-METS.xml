The annual meeting of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture was called to order by I. W. Haws. First V ice-President at 2:15 P.M. Vice- President Haws: Gentlemen, please come to order, and please take seats in front. I suppose the most of you are aware that our Presi - dent, Mr. Hendershot, is absent, having moved from our state. There - fore, it becomes my duty as First Vice-President to preside at this meet- ing. • First on the program, I have the pleasure, and a very great pleasure, of introducing to you a gentleman whom you all well know, who will make an address of welcome to the delegates of this convention, our Honorable Governor, Governor Aldrich. (Applause.) Rnor Aldrich: Mr. Chairman and gentlemen: I Just barely did in time to do this, and I was notified as I started *o come un - it I was to make a very important address on this occasion: so you may know that what I say has been carefully conned and thought over! I want to say in the beginning that this organization, this associa - tion of men, who, I understand, are responsible for the fairs we have had in Lincoln, Nebraska, known as the State Fairs, are to be congratu - lated on giving to the people of this state absolutely the best agricultural exhibit that ever has been assembled in the United States. (Applause.) There is no question about that. (Renewed applause.) Being an intimate personal friend of your Secretary, I have hod the opportunity from time to time of visiting with him to ascertain the busi - ness methods and the manner in which this big institution has come to grow, and how it is handled, and concerning a whole lot of the dq - tails; and I want to say that I personally know that this institution Is handled on a cold-blooded business basis. (Applause.) I have had the opportunity of going to several other fairs of our sister states. When I. was engaged in raising some road horses, I went to the state fair of Minnesota, of Wisconsin, of Iowa, of Kansas, and of Missouri. There was but one fair in all those fairs I attended that in point of equipment was equal— possibly two fairs that were equal-to ' </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 the fair of the State or Nebraska; and those are the fairs at Minnesota and the state of Iowa. In many particulars the Nebraska fair excels any of those, and it is equal to the fairs of those two states in their very best particulars. They had a grandstand at Minnesota when' I was there that would seat three or four times as many people as the grandstand here at th&lt;&gt; Lincoln state fair, but it was not a grandstand that would accommodate very much more than our present structure. When I was in the legislature, in the senate of 1907, I made a strenu - ous fight to get an appropriation for a grandstand, from a business stand - point. I think that the best Investment probably in point of improve - ment out there from the standpoint of making returns, is a grandstand. We have thousands and thousands of people there every afternoon that want to Bee the races and would be willing to give from 25 cents up, fi thousands more than do would go in there if they had the room doao. But we are to be congratulated that we have a grandstand such as we have, because nowhere is there a grandstand that so much of n grandstand for the money as we have on our state fair grounds (ap - plause), and there ha? been displayed excellent judgment, it occurs to mi, in that respect Pit to say this, too, that from the standpoint of agricultural ex - at is, with respect to the things that spring directly from the r a better exhibit here in Lincoln than I had ever seen in any other states where I have been. (Applause.) So, this is but a mere mention along- the line of encouragement in those several departments in which we are practically together. If the same business methods, and the same practical sense, and the same economy, and same devotion* to succesF are exhibited in the next five years that have been shown in the last five years, without question the Nebraska Bute Pair will be without a peer anywhere in this entire Union. (Applause.) I am mighty glad to be able to see so many prominent, representative men, and business men, connected with this association present here to - day, to further devise and plan for continued improvement, and therefore a magnificent and continued success. And I am glad I met you here this afternoon. (Applause.) Secretary Mellor: I am sure we are all delighted to have the Gover - nor with us. It has always been a mystery to me why David City couldn't keep good men when they had them. Of course, it is all the better for the state of Nebraska that we have a governor who is fearless and able to see to the administering of the laws and to the necessities of our people; and I think we all feel satisfied that we have the right man in the right place. (Applause.) Vlce-President Haws: The next on the program will be the reading of the call by the Secretary. Secretary Mellor (reading) </seg>

The Secretary called the roll, and announced that there was quorum present. Vice-President Haws: As I stated a few minutes ago, your Presi- dent Is absent, and he has sent to us his message. With your kind atten- tion, our Secretary will read the message sent from him. Secretary Mellor read the President's message, as follows: THE PRESIDENT'S MESSAGE TO THE NEBRASKA 8TATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. la reviewing the work of the past year, I find much to commend and but little to criticise. The officers have given much time and thought in the planning and construction of your new grandstand that is a monu- ment of economy and a credit to the state. Our 1911 fair, as a whole, was the best in our history. I will not at- tempt to give here the figures of the receipts or expenses, as our most worthy Secretary will give a full detailed account of all our doings from ■rat to last These figures are most gratifying to the management, and I treat will be to you. Your Secretary and Chairman of the Board of Managers deserve especial credit and praise for their untiring labors in the construction of our new amphitheatre. It was planned and constructed under them. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AURICULTI'KK 11 I also wish to thank our worthy General Superintendent, William Foster, for the good management in the erection of this new building. To Charles Scully, we owe much. If there ever was a man, "Johnny on the spot" it is "Scully." He is very much awake and sees things to do. and does them. P could truthfully say the same thing regarding the majority of our ntendents. The work in all the departments was well done, — extra good service being done. First — In my judgment, we have grown beyond our capacity to care for the exhibits, and I recommend you pass resolutions requesting the next legislature to make an appropriation of fifty thousand ($50,000) dollars for permanent improvements, to be used twenty-live thousand ($26,000) dollars each year, as the Board of Managers deem wise. Second — I also suggest the report of the Secretary be published In the Nebraska Farmer and the Twentieth Century Fanner in full. I be - lieve we would get our work before the people in this way. Third — I further suggest that the Superintendent of Sanitation have charge of all places furnishing meals or lunches, also to have the gar - bage haulers under his control; that he be furnished office room with a phone, and that he have an assistant; to personally inspect each conces - sion at least twice each day, and to report to the Superintendent any place not kept in proper shape. I further recommend that a small fee be charged each concessioner per can for emptying garbage, say ten (10) cents each can, and these can be emptied at all times of day, when the Superintendent is notified that they are full. Any one throwing slops or garbage of any kind on the grounds should be fined one ($1) dollar for each offense. This to be made a part of their contract. Also enforce the order to keep the prices for meals and lunches dis - played at a conspicuous place, that all may observe the prices. Fourth — I recommend cement crossings be placed to connect all main buildings with sidewalks. Fifth — Police Regulations — I recommend that the Chief of Polio* or - ganize his force in three (3) squads, with a captain for each squad; one squad to patrol the outside fences, with a number and station for each patrolman. Another squad should have charge of the race course, ampitbeatre, cattle, hogs, sheep, and speed barns. The third squad to look after the middle section and conco— loa grounds. I further suggest that the Chief act as police judge, with power to release or refer all prisoners to the city police judge; that all men em- Ked In this service be under fifty (50) years' of age; also that the •eraen be uniformed with regulation uniforms, from the Chief down. Sixth — That the watchmen report to and be under the Superintendent </seg>
            <seg id="p012">of the Department using them; to be sworn in for police duty provided with "star," but not uniformed, nor should they be on the police pay-roll. Respectfully submitted. O. P. HENDERSHOT, President, Nebraska State Board of Agriculture. Vice- President Hawes: Gentlemen, yon have heard the message. What will you do with it? Mr. Rudge: I move that the President's message be spread upon the records, and that the recommendations be referred to the incoming Board of Managers Motion seconded. Vice-President Haws: You have heard the motion that the message be spread upon the records, and that the recommendations b« referred to the incoming Bofcrd of Managers. Are you ready for the question? "Question." Those in favor of the motion will signify by saying Aye. M Ajre." Those opposed. No. The Ayes have it It has been suggested by our Secretary that, in order to expedite matters, we now proceed to nominations of the various members, so that the copy can be given into the hands of the printers and the ballots may be secured. If there are no objections, we will proceed along those Secretary Mellor: Before the nominations are made, I have a resig - nation that I desire to read (reading the resignation of President Hen dershot). RESIGNATION OF O. P. HENDERSHOT AS PRESIDENT OF THE NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE. Meridian, Idaho, January 8, 1912. To the Officers and Members of the Nebraska State Boapd of Agriculture Gentlemen It is with no light feeling of regret that I tender to you ay resignation aa your President, also as a member of your honorable or - ganisation: but, owing to my removal from Nebraska, perhaps perma - nently, it is incumbent upon me to give way for another. I wish to thank each member of the Nebraska State Board of Agri - culture for the honors conferred on me from time to time. I now look back with much pride at the splendid work done for the state of Nebraska through the State Board of Agriculture. No state ic the Union has done so much, without state aid being liberally bestowed. And to each of you belongs the glory in proportion to the efforts you have made to make the Nebraska State Fair one of the very best fairs In America, which it admittedly is. There are some things we have lost sight of in building up our ex - hibits, which I will call attention to in my annual message to you. While I have left Nebraska and adopted Idaho as my new home 1 love the people of Nebraska and I love the boys of the Nebraska State </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Eof Agriculture. You have always treated me royally. I know I lade mistakes, perhaps many unnecessarily, but with them all you lade no complaint, but pushed me right on to the highest office your gift. For this and all other kindnesses I thank you. Phad made my plane to be with you. and to personally say to each ;r how much I regretted to be separated from you in the good work, er, my physical condition is such that I dare not undertake the While my health has been much improved, I am not so well for the past two weeks, being troubled with acute neuritis in my arm and leg. Wishing each of you a prosperous New Year, and continuous sno com with the Nebraska State Fair, I am, Very cordially yours. O. P. HENDER8HOT, It is my wish that this resignation be accepted at once, and a new member elected in my place. Secretary Mellor: I move, Mr. Chairman, that the resignation be ac - cepted. Motion seconded. Vice-President Haws: You have heard the reading of the resignation, and it has been moved and seconded that it be accepted. Axe there any remarks? If not, those in favor of the motion wiill manifest by saying Aye. "Aye." Contrary, No. The Ayes have it; it is so ordered. Mr. Hervey: Mr. Chairman, my term of office on the State Board of Agriculture expires at this time. I wish to announce here that I will not be a candidate for re-elecUon. I made this known among a number of our people in Douglas county a year ago; and later, at the annual meeting of the agricultural society, I reannounced or made pub.lic the announce - ment that I would not be a candidate. I do this for several reasons. One particular reason is that I hav? served in this capacity for live years, — longer than I should have been here, and possibly longer than my services were as valuable as they should have been, or as valuable as those of men whom we can select from Douglas county to take my place. These gentlemen have been very courteous to me at the time, saying that they would not present them - selves a» candidates at all until I was through with the office. I now announce that I am through with the office and I wish to ex - tend a hearty response to the treatment that I have received from the members of trfte State Board of Agriculture, not only the elected members, but the delegates who have been here from year to year. Eira not withdrawing my interest and influence from the State Pair m the county fairs of the State of Nebraska. I expect to continue irk in a different capacity in the promotion of State Fair interests, hope to be of as much value or of more value to the State Fair, to ate Board of Agriculture, and to the county fairs when I am out of relation with them. I thank you, gentlemen. ■Rudge: I would like to add a few words with respect to Mr. Her - ,t is to say, that I have worked elbow to elbow with Mr. Hervey </seg>
            <seg id="p014">14 for the last ten or twelve years, and am in a position to say that we are losing one of the most valuable men we ever have had on the State Board of Agriculture; a man who has always had good Judgment about matters, and who waa not afraid to express himself In a Board meeting. It is with much regret that he has concluded that he wants to retire from the State Board, and it is much to my regret that he retires; because he has been one of the best workers, I think, we have ever had on the State Board of Agriculture. Mr. Taylor: The resignation of Mr. Hendershot, I think, should be spread at large on the minutes of this meeting; and I move you that the resignation be spread at large on the minutes of the meeting. K Secretary Mellor: It will be. Mr. Taylor: It will be? Very well. Vice-President Haws: The next in order will be the nominations. We will proceed in the regular order as we have heretofore, taking up the districts. It will be well to distribute some of these premium lists. I believe we have got Just a little bit ahead of the game. I think it would be well for the Committee on Credentials to make their report as regards who is eligible to vote in this meeting. We will now have the report of the Committee on Credentials. Mr. Toungers: Mr. President, the Committee on Credentials are ready to report (reading) REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON CREDENTIALS. To the Officers and Members of the State Board of Agriculture: We, your Committee on Credentials, beg leave to make the following report.

I want to say to you that it is not because you and I have disagreed, or on account of any mistreatment that yon may have tendered to me, that I am asking that I be relieved from further work on the State Board; but simply because there are other lines of work in which I have become deeply interested that I believe demand my attention; and for the further reason that I believe that I will pre - sent to you the name of a man whom you know to be an exceptionally good worker and fair man, who can outgeneral me by 100 per cent And there is one other reason that I asked to be relieved, or do not ask to be reeiected, and that is that the work that I had in view, the </seg>
            <seg id="p018">work that I had on hand, when I was put back upon the Board the sec - ond time, Is practically completed, so far as my ability to see the need along that line is concerned. So that I can drop my lines without any detriment to the State in that regard, and with the happy hops in view that you will be only benefited by electing the man that I am going to ask you to give the place. The man I am going to ask you to elect from the sixth district has proven by long years of work in connection with our county fair that he is the best fair worker that Custer county has ever had. He has served a number of years as secretary of our association, and when we want work well and thoroughly done along any lines, we ask this gentleman to do It.

Vice-President Haws: Mr. Leftwich has been placed in nomina- tion. Mr. Rudge: I wish to place in nomination Mr. Banning, of the first district. Vice-President Haws: Mr. Banning is placed in nomination from the first district. kMr. Rudge: In the fourth district there is one to elect there on t term, one year term, and there has been no discussion made on , I think— to take the place of Mr. Hendershot. Vice-President Haws: Well, no, we will attend to that. Mr. Rudge: I think there ought to be some ruling on that, as to its being the short term in the fourth district A Member: I move you that the names on the ticket be declared. There's three to elect; we will have to elect regularly in that district. t President Haws: Well, do you call up this now? ember: There's three to elect, but one for short term.

            <seg id="p019">A Member: There's three to vote for. Mr. McLeod: I would think this is out of order, because Mr. Dlckman is surely nominated to succeed himself, and Mr. Youngers is nominated to succeed himself. That would leave Mr. Danielson to succeed Mr. Hendershot, who has resigned. I think it was entirely out of order. I would make that point, anyway. They are nominated to succeed them- Secretary Mellor: No, they are not. Eir. McLeod: Otherwise, that would leave Dickman and Youngers nated to succeed themselves, — placed in nomination to succeed selves. That would fix it. Vice- President Haws: Do I hear a second to the motion? A Member: I will second the motion. Vice-president Haws: I hardly think that la the proper way to proceed. However, I am not voting. tMr. Rudge: I was going to ask, how can we nominate Mr. Daniel if It was the understanding he was to be nominated for the short i, or to be nominated for the long term. A Member: It is the short term. EMr. Rudge: I think if he got a majority and no one questions the ination, it would be proper. Mr. McArdle: Mr. Danielson is to serve out the short term of Mr. Hendershot. Mr. Howe: I would ask to have the Secretary place opposite the names of the persons the number that each district Is entitled to, so we would know. t Secretary Mellor: Persons are shown in the premium list as to e from each district Mr. Howe: It Is easy to see marked out there. You can mark right opposite. Vice- President Haws: He wants t6 know how many there are to vote for from each district. A Member: The number he is entitled to. Pi-President Haws: The first district has three. There is a mo- Fore the house, gentlemen. It has been moved and seconded . Youngers and Mr. Dickman be elected for the full term, two Are you ready for the question? "Question." A Member: I don't understand that is the motion: Mr. Youngers and the two will be elected same as any others, and the third one will be elected for the short term, and on the ballot they will show just which is the short term. Vice-President Haws: Exactly. Your point is well taken. But there Is a motion before the house. I want to dispose of the motion. kA Member: Suppose, now, that there is a nomination. Suppose of these two men it is suggested to have nominated for reelection Id not be reelected; then, where are we? </seg>

Vice-President Haws: I would like to have— in fact, I will request that the gentleman who made that motion withdraw it. Will you do so, Mac? That would save quite a speech. Mr. McLeod: Tes. Mr. Rudge: It Is understood that Mr. Danielson is elected for the short term, if elected. Mr. McLeod: Tour request places my motion out of order. I with - draw the motion. Mr. Rudge: That is the understanding all right? That settles it Vice-President Haws: The practice is entirely immaterial. Are there any other nominations? Mr. Hervey: I understand that there is a possibility of a contest in case of the nomination of E. Z. Russell, who, I understand, claims that he has not removed his residence from Washington county, and some claim that he has. Mr. Russell has been a very valuable man to the State Board of Agriculture, almost as much so as any man that has been associated with it. He is an excellent fair man; he has learned the fair business from the bottom up as an exhibitor; and I would not like to see Mr. Russell turned out, unless he has invalidated himself by re - moval from Washington county. Then, of course, I wouid not endorse it. But I will nominate Mr. Russell from the second district until we know more definitely that he is not eligible. Vice-President Haws: Mr. Russell has been placed in nomination. rMr. Rudge: I heard that in conversation with Mr. Russell some two iree weeks ago he claimed his residence at that time in Washinp county, and had gone up there, he said, and voted this fall. H&lt;&gt; came down here, he moved down here, and he has not given up his home, whether he was going to stay here permanently or not; and I do not know whether he is going to be with us here at this time. But he went back and voted. I suppose that would hold his residence in that county. Mr. Turner: I am simply a temporary member of this organisation by reason of being the -president of the fair association in Custer county for the year 1912; but I am interested in this State Board of Agricul - ture; and, as our section is losing a valuable member of the Board in the person of Mr. Ream, I naturally am very much interested in having his successor in our section of the country who I know will be as valuable as Mr. Ream has ever been to this Board; and I would like to add my word to what Mr. Ream said to me in regard to Mr. Purcell. You will Ke no mistake if you elect Mr. E. R. Purcell as one of the members i the sixth district Vice-President Haws: Are there any other nominations? A Member: Upon request, I nominate Mr. E. Buckingham </seg>

Secretary Mellor: That is your district. Vice- President Haws: Are there any further nominations? If not, we will declare the nominations closed. Mr. Jeffords: In the first district, I have not been accustomed to attending meetings; in fact, this is the first meeting of the State Board of Agriculture at which I have ever been present; but in Johnson county, in the first district we have a new county organisation there, a county fair organization. We are working down there to try to advance the interests of agricultural associations. We ought to have one there, if it isn't too late to get on another member, somebody from that section of the state who takes an interest in agriculture and will do what he can to advance the interests of the State Fair, the county fair, and all. I notice you have on there one or two members coming from coun - ties who don't even maintain county fair organizations. If it is not too late, I desire to place in nomination David Smith, from Johnson connty, who has been active in the advancement of agricultural pursuits all of his life. Vice- President Haws: Mr. Smith has been placed in nomination. We don't want to close them too hurriedly; but we want to close them when you get through. If there are any other nominations you wish to make, speak up. If not, we will close them. The nominations aro closed. Mr. Howe: I would like to call the gentlemen's attention to the first district; there's two there from Richardson county; I don't think we ought to do that — vote for two in one county; and I take pleasure in seconding' the nomination of David Smith from Johnson county. Vice- President Haws: I will state, Mr. Howe, that it is Impossible to elect two from one county; it can not be done, under our rules. Mr. Howe: I did not know how that was. Vice-President Haws: The statute provides there's only two coun - ties in the state— (interrupted). Mr. Howe: Suppose it should happen, what would we do about it? E Vice-President Haws: Well, they would not be eligible; because statute provides that but one member can come from a county ex- Lancaster and Douglas, — those two. LMr. Howe: I think the Richardson county people should get to - er and decide on which one to have. Vice-President Haws: That is a very good suggestion. Mr. Leonard: I think, in case it should happen that both these parties that are placed in nomination from one county, when the vote is cast, if it should appear that both are elected, there would have to be another election, just in regard to these two parties, and one or the other of the two, then, be elected. I think we had a case of that kind </seg>
            <seg id="p022">once before, since I have been on the State Board of Agriculture, when the vote didn't show. Vice- President Haws: I think you are right about that; I think we had a case two or three years ago. Mr. Leonard: Yes, sir; I think we did CMr. Rudge: I think we took a second vote on one district. That is nditlon I think we can meet when we get to it. Mr. Leonard: It is absolutely contrary to law to have two parties elected from Richardson county. They are allowed only one member on the State Board of Agriculture. But it is not contrary to law or to usage that there be two candidates from that county. Vice-President Haws: Nothing to hinder it. Having finished the nominations, the next thing in order will be the report of our worthy Secretary SECRETARY'8 REPORT.

THE STATE FAIR I Twelve years have now elapsed since "the State Fair was returned Its present location, and this period of time marks the extreme nds of unbroken continued usefulness that each Individual member </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture has given this cause, with the exception of Mr. Charles Mann of Chadron. ■ receipts of the 1SW0 State Fair, being the first held on the ground after our return from Omaha, were $28,680.47. The of the 1911 State Fair were $95,327.86. The receipts from con - of the Fair of twelve years ago were $2,183.79, while that of last year were $15,810.73. The receipts of the first six year? beinp )20.0H. 13. and the last $63,924.35. The number of -ash admissions of the 1900 fair were 33,599; of last year 122,567. The number of grand - stand, bleacher and quarter-stretch tickets sold in 1900 amounted to $2,013.75; in 1911 $13,610.46. In 1900 for speed entries was received $1,2*9.40; last year $4,046.75, and that after decreasing the entry fee on stake races two per cent, and allowing runners to start without payment of any entry fee whatever. In 1900 we paid out as premiums for speed $2,775.35. and at the last fair $9,382.00. We paid in premiums at the fair of 1911 a sum about equal to total receipts of 1900. The total receipts during this twelve-year period is the sum of $674,736.44, of which the first hair— or six years — contributed $222, - 035.66, and the last six years $451,981.79, or an increase during the past six years of one hundred and three per cent. The population of Nebraska in 1900 was 1,050.000 people, while in 1911 it was 1.200,000. We are prone to dwell on financial accomplishment in measuring success and failure. This is true in relation to the State Fair as to other matters. In drawing comparisons it might be M convincing to measure the success of our Fair by the increased excellency of our numerous exhibits. S Through this period of twelve years Nebraska has enjoyed a series good crops, with the possible exception of this last year, and prices have had a continuous upward tendency. Should good crops and prices continue in the future, there can be but increased returns from com - ing expositions, as added facilities bring new opportunities for ex - pansion. The day before the assassin's bullet found fatal lodgment in th? body of President McKinley, in his speech at Buffalo, he said: "Fairs and expositions are the timepieces which mark the progress of na - tions. They record the world's advancement. They stimulate the energy, enterprise, and intellect of people, and quicken human genius. They go into the home; they broaden and brighten the daily life of the people; they open mighty storehouses of information to the stu - dent. Every fair or exposition, great or small, has helped to some onward step. Comparison of ideas is always educational, and as such instructs the brain and hand of man." Fairs and expositions are one of the more modern methods of edu - cation. The history of the Dark Ages contains no mention of such gatherings. Have you ever heard of a great fair or exposition having been held in China or Russia? Let us draw your attention to the states of this country in which </seg>
            <seg id="p025">25 E fairs are held and you wilt observe that they are in the forefront r nation's advancement in all lines tending toward greatness and macy. Bwish to reiterate that our State Fair is one of the valuable edu - institutions for Nebraska. Many people fail to realize this it is customary to think of education as contemporaneous with xi. On account of this custom legislatures very seldom think isary to do anything for the relief or benefit of our adult popu - but are easily influenced by something for the benefit of chil - r even animals. I To view separately the various finished products at the Fair would ail an endless amount of travel and expense. At such an as— only can be seen the best the State produces in so short a period time at a minimum expense. It is one point at which our progres - e population gather annually to secure advanced ideals of perfec - n in animals, new labor-saving machinery, and observe the great entiona of the age. tNot only is the State Fair valuable on account of exhibits, but as an annual reunion. To brush elbows with an old friend from her part of the State, to clasp the hand of friendship denied for a on, to share his joys and sorrows, is an effective education for the an mind and provides a season of contentment, happiness, and fu - retrospection which fully repays all the denials and expenses inci- It is no longer an extra strenuous matter to attend a Nebraska State Fair. Prior to 1908, with the exception of possibly a thousand scattered seats, tired patrons had to sit on the ground for rest. Since then 5,000 free seats in the auditorium, and 2,500 in the stock judging pavilion have been provided, and at the race track fully 3,000 more have been added this last year, so that at the present, time we have more than a total of 16,000 seats, thereby providing a possible rest for one quarter of the number of people on the grounds on days of the largest attendance. The landing of our patrons in the center, and the compactness of the grounds is another commendable feature for the comfort of the visitor. The small appropriation of $15,000 by the last legislature for re - pairs on the grandstand prohibited a following of the policy heretofore adopted, of building only permanent structures, as the demand for addi - tional grandstand accommodations made it necessary to immediately increase the seating capacity. Therefore, the steel supports for the roof, to which may be added a permanent reinforced concrete seating, was the best we could do with the funds at our command. During the past year we have been indulging in a dream of the fu - ture arrangement, and have evolved a plan of location for principal buildings which, if adopted and adhered to, will make our grounds ideal for convenience. This plan contemplates the future purchase of the land west to Fourteenth street, the filling of the old bed of the Antelope </seg>
            <seg id="p026">within our present west fence, and the erection and arrangement of the following buildings: An educational building just within the south gate entrance large enough for public schools, normals, colleges, and university exhibits; a two-story exhibit and dining-room building to cover the entire length of the block occupied by the present temporary horse barns; the present automobile building to be converted into a ladies' textile and art building; and agricultural end horticultural hall on the site of the present traction engine exhibit; and right across Furnas avenue a machinery hall 400 x 760 with two lines of railroad switch tracks running into and through two of the aisles of the build - ing, to the north of which and east of the race track a theater building capable of running two good vaudeville shows downstairs, and two of moving pictures upstairs, thereby giving our patrons a chance to see the best in these particular lines, and making it possible to completely eliminate the present style of so-called shows now so common on fair grounds. Extend bleachers 120 feet on the east and 200 feet on the west of the present grandstand; complete the stock judging coliseum; buiM a dairy barn immediately south of the cattle barn, a sheep barn between that and the north side of Morton avenue, on the south side of which, west of Mellor avenue, build the model bog pavilion and pens. Just across the avenue on the east and south of Morton avenue the horse barns. From the horse barns to the east on up the hill across the end of the railway tracks to and extending south along Dunham avenue to" the Fisheries building, a two-story building for offices and concessions, with dining rooms upstairs. Then build covered walks connecting all these buildings clear around the grounds, and the mat - ter of housing the Fair and protection to our patrons from the elements is solved. In case this dream is realized our present temporary shacks throughout the center of the grounds can be razed, and space now occu - pied by them parked so that it may be a beauty and a joy forever. The permanency of our grounds is now practically assured, and we realize that some plan must be adopted and adhered to in order to build with a specific object in view, otherwise every new board of managers will advocate different views. The preparation of tho ground for machinery hall, together with the fill of the old Antelope creek bed will practically furnish all the ground we can ever hope to utilize, as to fill other low adjoining lands would entail heavy expense. Therefore, by adopting a judicious plan with commodious buildings con - veniently located around the edges as suggested will give all future managers an object to accomplish. We think the camping ground en - closed during the past year should be permanent, and an effort made to make this a growing feature with each succeeding Fair. We wish to congratulate the railroads on the splendid facilities extended in the handling of people and exhibits, and to assure them that their extra efforts is a matter of appreciation by the members of the Nebraska Board of Agriculture. We do not fully realize the im - portance of the good service of the Burlington shuttle train, and the </seg>
            <seg id="p027">27 Lincoln Traction Company, until we have visited other large fairs and draw a comparison of the ease with which the 60,000 people on Wed - nesday were handled at our Fair. It is remarkable that a crowd of this magnitude could get to and away from our grounds with the noticeable ease and so little loss of time. Physical discomfort is one of the great drawbacks to attendance, and as we reduce this to a minimum the great - er will be the returns. One of the reasons for the ease of handling crowds on our grounds is somewhat due to the policy of the continuous program from early morning to the closing of the opera performance, beginning after the fireworks in the evening, thereby naturally dis - tributing the desires of the people as to the time they wish to start for their lodging place. Each succeeding year seems to add to the difficulty of securing re - duced fares on the railroads. It is now practically impossible to obtain specific knowledge after strenuous effort, until less than two weeks be - fore the Fair opens, and then only are they granted for the five days on which the Fair is open for inspection. These facts deprive our ex - hibitors from securing special rates, and give very little opportunity for advertising. We in Nebraska are especially favored by the return of exhibit cattle free. This does not obtain in Iowa or Minnesota. Kan - sas has the free return of breeding horses which we do not enjoy. Some yean ago, prior to the days of the Railway Commission, and the two - cent fare, it was customary for our railroads to grant all kinds of fav - ors to the State Fair — run seed special trains, exhibit trains, farmer in - stitute trains, hog trains, etc., to preach the gospel of good farming, advanced methods and object lesson education. The Fair is now the only opportunity left to them to participate in this line of work, and we hope the day is not far distant when they will willingly grant such usual concessions for the drawing together of the people at a great edu - cational state fair, as in justice it demands. I We are glad to note that each succeeding season more school chil - l visit the State Fair. This we attribute to our splendid rational exhibit f.ml that school boards are gradually coming to ize that more actual education can be secured during that particu - week at the Fair than in school, combined with a desire of the par - to escape the seclusion of the farm at a time when the opportunity practical education with wholesome attractions and amusements, best the world affords, can be the more easily seen. The time shortly arrive when great numbers of farmers will realize the im - ance of bringing the entire family for a week of camp life on the ' grounds. The necessity for great attractions, the best and most modern the world affords, was fully exemplified at our 1911 Fair. This plan should be followed at all succeeding fairs. Probably the next invention will be a modern ocean steamship sailing through the air, and we must have it the first year that it is a success. The Nebraska State Fair is now classed as the peer of all the great fairs of the country, and we, whose </seg>
            <seg id="p028">province it is to cater to Nebraska people, the best on earth, owe it to then to provide them with the best attractions money can buy. In speaking of our 1911 exhibits and exhibitors we can only reiter - ate all the good things heretofore spoken of them. No state is more favored by expert exhibitors and excellent displays, and the efforts of this board in carefully looking after their interests by being at their posts of duty, where they can easily be found, is deeply appreciated oy them. It is a matter of common talk at other surrounding fairs to hear that the methods pursued here seem to be held as the ideal to others. For this condition the officers and superintendents in charge of the various departments are to be congratulated. It is to us one of the most satisfactory evidences that each of you are making an honest, earnest endeavor to have the Nebraska State Pair not only the peer of others, but the ideal. For the year 1912 we urged that each superintendent make an ex - tra effort to nave his department in such a condition that our patrons will again recognise added excellency in the 1912 exhibit. Pine of the improvements of the year 1911 will be noticeable for ie to come — the building of the grandstand' and the fill on which i; a dyke around the west side of the grounds for a distance of 3,000 feet, with half the distance an average fill of six feet; the cutting off of the point of the hill east of Agricultural Hall and filling the draw east of the race track; adding nearly five hundred feet of storm sewer; a cement floor in the old stock pavilion; erecting a build - ing at the traction and railway entrance; the installation of nine cash registering turnstiles; building of 3,300 feet of steel post wire fence along the west side of the grounds; and the erection of gasoline arc lights around the entire race track, are what might be termed as perma - nent improvements. t Owing to the fact that incomplete permanent records were kept of lflc tickets, it is Impossible to give a detailed statement of attend - i at the grandstand, bleachers, and quarter-stretch where (13,610.45 was taken in during the week, and also exhibitors, concessionaires, old soldiers, and children admitted free, were as follows: — r rw .

            <seg id="p036">36 VETERINARY DEPARTMENT E landers — Prom Jan. 11 to July 7, twenty-six horses and two mules killed by this department. These were destroyed without any in - ty. On July 7 an appropriation for indemnifying owners of glan - dered horses became available. From July 7 to January 11, 1912, we killed 59 hones and 9 moles, for which we paid $5,451.43. The distri - bution of these cases by counties is as follows: Antelope 1 Cherry 7 Lancaster X Blaine 1 Colfaz 1 Nance X Boone 6 Custer X Phelps X Boyd 1 Dakota S Richardson X Brown 13 Dawson 10 Rock 1 Buffalo 3 Dodge .4 Sherman 4 Burt S Douglas 4 Scottsbluff 7 Caw 1 Hall 1 8ioux 1 Cedar 4 Holt 1 Thureton •. . . • This shows that during the first six months when we did not pay for glandered horses we killed 28 and for the last six months when we did pay for glandered horses we killed 68, making a total of 96 for the year. We now have about 15 suspicious cases under quarantine. Tuberculosis — We have not had any systematic testing for tubercu - losis during the past year except at the South Omaha Stock Yards. The t«wtlng for interstate shipments has not been what could be desired. A few days ago I called a special meeting of the Nebraska veterinarians, at which ninety were present, for the purpose of discussing the interstate work. Rules for systematic work were adopted. I will send you a copy of the same as soon as we receive the same from the printer. Anthrax — An outbreak occurred west of Omaha on three farms, along the Papio river, in which six cattle and two horses died, and two men be - came infected, but recovered. About 700 cattle and horses were vaccin - ated at once, and the disease was promptly checked. I Hog Cholera. — This work is done mostly under the management of Experiment Station at Lincoln, Nebraska, and a great amount of serum is used with good success, except in a few cases where there seems to be mixed infection. The southeastern part of this state has had the worst siege of hog cholera for yean. Blackleg — This disease is being gradually stamped out through vac - cination.

            <seg id="p037">37 Infectious Anemia— This disease is still prevalent to a certain extent in the northeastern part of this state. The Department of Animal Path - ology of the Nebraska Experiment Station is still carrying on experi - ments with this disease. r&gt;cabiet in Cattle — This infectious disease is gradually being eradlcat- Last fall the cattle were in line condition and they have stood the severe weather so far without much loss. A few outbreaks occurred in the non-quarantine area. We aim to look after these cases as soon as they are reported. We have employed a man for the last two month* es - pecially for the purpose of looking after these cases. Scabies in Sheep — Several local outbreaks have occurred in different parts of the State. These cases are generally looked after by the B. A. I. men of South Omaha. IUIcerative Ano-Vulvitis in Cattle — We have had only a few outbreaks this disease during the past year. In one herd forty out of sixty were acted; some very extensively, but all recovered. A New Disease of- Horses — Last fall a great number of horse owners from several counties in the western part of the State reported to this office that they had a new disease affecting hundreds of horses in their community. The descriptions of the disease in all of these reports were identical; swelling of the breast with formation of large abscesses, which later would rupture and discharge a considerable amount of thick, white creamy pus. These abscesses would sometimes form on other parts of the body. This affection was found quite prevalent in horses all over the western part of this state. Some investigation is now being made by the Department of Animal Pathology of the Nebraska Experiment Sta- </seg>

The board organized with H. Imith, professor of animal husbandry as president, Dr. A. Bostrom, ity state veterinarian, as vice-president, and W. R. Mellor, Secretary he State Board of Agriculture, as secretary. This action necessi - i increased duties in our office. All animals in the State at the time this act went into effect having such hereditary, infectious, contagious, or transmissible diseases as urethal gleet, melanosis, periodic ophthalmia (moon blindness), laryn - geal hemiplegia (roaring or whistling), or serious defect in conforma - tion, are not allowed a license by the board. The law also requires that all unsoundness found on any stallion or jack be indicated on a diagram placed on the licenses issued by the board. To date, about fifty-one animals have been found affected with one or more of the above named Hma» sun or defects.

A fee of five dollars is charged for every certificate, and three dollar*. for a renewal of certificate, and one dollar for transfer of ownership. It Is the option of the Board to double the inspection fees. The fees thus collected are used for the running expenses of the office, to pay the in - spectors, the publishing of a year book, etc. Any person, corporation, or firm who violates any of the provi - sions of this act is guilty of a misdemeanor and punishable by a fine of not less than ISO, or he may be imprisoned in the county jail not to ex - ceed thirty days, or both such fine and imprisonment in the discretion of the court. Fifteen stallion inspectors have been selected by the Stallion Regis - tration Board, and stallion owners in practically every town and village In the State have been notified of the coming of these inspectors. At the present time the State has been covered once. All the itineraries are worked out in the main office, and the inspector is directed to run ac - cording to a regular schedule. The stallion owners in and about every town are notified of the time and place of inspection on a certain day and directed to have their horses in town ready for inspection upon the arrival of the inspector. The horses are examined and an affidavit stating the defects, if any, of each animal is made out and sent to this office, where they are recorded and licenses are issued for those that come within the scope of the law. To date, 4,494 stallions and jacks have been inspected. Of this number M pure-breds and 25 grades have been refused licenses. There are still a great many uninspected stallions and jacks in the state, but every effort is being made to locate these before the next trip of the inspectors. fome impatience has been expressed for the reason that stallion rs have not received back their pedigrees and licenses as quickly as expected, but when the great number to be examined, the issuance of original and three copies of the certiflcate to each, the entry of a com - plete record on our books, and the fact that only three months have pasrd since the work of the office began, it is easily apparent that it will take more time to properly record than to inspect an animal.

W. B. BANNING, WM. POSTER, Auditing Committee. Vice-President Haws: You have heard the report of the Auditing Committee. What will you do with it? Mr. Herrey: I move that it be accepted and placed on file, and the committee discharged. Motion seconded. Vice- President Haws: It has been moved and seconded that the re- port of the Auditing Committee be accepted and placed on file, and that the committee be discharged. Are you ready for the question? Those in favor of the motion will manifest by saying Aye. "Aye." Those op- posed. No. The Ayes have it, and it is so ordered. We will now have the report of the Revision Committee. Mr. Rudge is chairman of that Secretary Mel lor: The Commercial Club desires to know Immedi- ately how many plates we want at the banquet tonight I wish you gen- tlemen would all stand that expect to go down with us to tne Commercial Club at 6:00 o'clock, and participate in the supper there, instead of going somewhere else. All stand, please, that expect to do that Members: Too bet well all stand! </seg>
            <seg id="p105">I Secretary Mellor (counting members) : Thank you. There are about If any: of you want extra tickets, 1 have some tickets here that Mr. th left with me. The price is 50 cents each. tMr. Hervey: I wish to say in connection with what Secretary Mellor lounced that this banquet will commence promptly at 6:00 o'clock, will assemble at 5:00 o'clock at the LJndell Hotel. Bach member of i Association, that is, each society that has paid its membership, is itled to two tickets. Others who wish tickets can get them by apply - to Mr. Mellor or to Secretary Smith. I think, If you would thoroughly understand the purpose of this or - ganisation, and the work that will be done before this meeting, and the experiences that will be given there, and the exchange of ideas in regard to the management of county fairs, that you will all feel that it is worth while to be present. Even if your societies are not authorized to pay the $4 membership fee, if you will take the opportunity offered and com* and be present to hear the discussions. Mr. Rudge: Do you know what the tickets are, Mr. Hervey? Do you know what the price of the tickets is? Mr. Hervey: Fifty cents. Mr. Rudge: Now, gentlemen, I am ready with the report of the Com - mittee on Revision of the Premium Lists and Rules. The dates in the front part of the book have all been changed to cor - respond with the proper dates of this year, and it will not be necessary to go through those dates. If you have a premium list with you, I wish you would turn to page 19. At the bottom of page 19, it is recommended that we cut out the last section there, and recommend that the Board of Managers be requested to increase the salaries of superintendents snftV ciently to meet the former $2 per day allowance for rooms. LI think, on matters of that kind, that we had better adopt them as go along, so that we won't have to go back to them. The part we cut out there is the last words, where it says, "Bach superintendent living outside of Lincoln to be allowed %i per day for hotel expenses from time reporting unless rooms are furnished." That section we cut out But we recommend to the Board of Managers and requeat to increase the salaries of the superintendents sufficiently to meet the former $2 a day allowance. I move you the adoption of the recommendations. Motion seconded. Mr. Rudge: Are there any remarks? May I proceed, Mr. Chairman? Pardon me? Vice-President Haws: Go ahead. UMr. Rudge: All those in favor of the motion signify by saying Aye. e." Opposed, No. It is adopted. The next important change is on page 23. There we E.t the Second Vice-President, by virtue of his office, shall be a member the Board of Managers. The rule is now that the First Vice-President, virtue of his office, is a member of the Board of Managers; and jour </seg>
            <seg id="p106">committee recommend that the Second Vice-President also be a member of the Board of Managers. A Member: I move that the recommendations be adopted. Motion seconded, Vice-President Haws: You have heard the motion, that the recom - mendation of the committee be accepted. Those in favor of the motion manifest by saying Aye. "Aye." Contrary, No. The Ayes have it. It is Mr. Rudge: There is no other material change there, except that in one or two places we changed a little the phraseology to have it read a little smoother. And when we come down to the ticket system, I think we recommend something there. Mr. Johnson: May I interrupt Mr. Rudge a minute? I think Mr. Mellor has made a mistake in the number of members to be elected. Vice-President Haws: Mr. Johnson, we have discovered that, and we are digging into it now. tMr. Rudge: I think the only change in the ticket system would be A concession coupon tickets be sold instead of reading "Season Ticket." bas been "Season Coupon," but put In the word "Coupon." Also, in the last line on page 27, where it reads, "One or two horses and (private) carriage and driver," we changed that to read, "One or two ■er«n (one or two-horse carriage), and carriage aud driver, or auto and driver." Autos are coming into common use. There is no other change till we get to the bottom of page 28. We recommend to insert in the line after "Cattle stalls, double, $2," the words "Nurse cows," another line in there, "$1." We had last year fifty nurse cows, and there was some complaint, I believe, because it was not in our premium list; so we Insert in there, "Nurse cows, $1.00." If there is no objection to any of these minor little changes, we will pass them without putting them to a vote; but, if there is any objection, or if anybody would like to have any information, I wish he would speak. The only thing in the next two or three pages is the change of the dates on there; and there was no change made In the premium lists on Class A; no particular change made on Class B, except that we recom - mend on all of the classes that all championships be awarded ribbons instead of cash. With the exception of Class D sheep, they are the same rate of the Shorthorn Live Stock Association, who contribute money for premiums. I would say that that has been inserted, — the cash premiums for Grand Champions and Champions in the Shorthorn class, I believe, bo as to meet the requirements of the Shorthorn Breeders' Association, who, I understand, contribute $1,050 increase of our premiums; and, in order for them to give the $1,050, they made out a premium list, which they ask us to follow, and they require us to give a certain amount of money; we would have over $1,050. And for that reason, it has been put in the Shorthorn class. For that reason, all the premiums on Short - horns are greater than they are in any other class. ISO we recommend that, if possible, that class. Instead of being put the Championship, be put in the Class Premiums. </seg>
            <seg id="p107">I A Member: Wouldn't it be a good idea to bo state, somewhere In the t page of Class B, there, that this money Is taken out of the cham - 8 and placed in the individual class; so that the exhibitors may know you haven't taken their money away from there? KMr. Rudge: We have put it in under the requirements of the Short - i Association. A Member: Yes, sir; they are not necessarily resident breeders? Mr. Rudge: They don't offer the money. I guess they do give mo— y on white faced Herefords: yes, they do on Herefords. A Member: How about Holsteins? KMr. Rudge: Holsteins? I think that is required by this; but where not required that we do business that way, put that money in the i premiums, and not put it in the champions. Give the champion a on. KA Member: It might be the average exhibitor who would get our lium list formerly would think we took that money out from the apions, and not realiie that we put it into the individual classes; not ng noticed the increase in the individual classes. Rudge: I want that recommendation, that we can get all the ey that was used formerly for this, If we are in a position to do that A Member: How is that, Mr. Rudge? I Mr. Rudge: I want that recommendation that the money that was lerly used in champions and grand champions is now placed in the i premiums. tMr. Graff: What is the use of doing this, if this is done only at 'the est of the Shorthorn Breeders, — the champions' money being taken and placed in the individual class premiums? I don't see the neces - of that I Mr. Rudge: Other exhibitors come here and say, "Why don't you e us champion money, when you give it to the Shorthorns?" We have explain to them why we have to give this to the Shorthorns, In order make up the amount big enough to get the $1,050. A Member: It isn't exhibited at the request of the Shorthorn Breed- Mr. Rudge: They sent us a premium list, they presented a bill last year, and got them to furnish money on the grand champions. We also recommend that we add on page 49 another class, "For grade steers other than Shorthorns." We did not have that last year, and It was quite a disappointment to a good many of our breeders; and we therefore recommend that we add another class in there, "For grade steers other than Shorthorns." If there is no objection, wa will pass on from that. On page 50 we recommend that we add a class for Guernseys. We have quite a-number of breeders of Guernseys in this State, and we have had a request from one breeder asking us to put in Guernseys, and he asked us also to put in the Brown Swiss. We have not recommended the Brown Swiss, but we recommend that we put in a class for Guernsey*. </seg>
            <seg id="p108">(there is any objection to that, we would like to hear it If not, we will on to the next. In the Swine Department we have not made any changes. In the Sheep Department we have not made any changes. tin the Poultry Department we did not do anything with that, for the ion we had not any recommendations from the superintendent, and left that, if there was any change to be made in that, to come before Incoming Board of Managers. On Class F, Farm Products, we have added about four or five extra premiums there; one of them for winter barley, another for winter oats, another for black hulled barley; and in a number of cases where it reads "Small yellow dent corn," we have Inserted the words "Early Variety," — "Early Variety Small Yellow Dent Corn." That has been added some five or six places. And a few corrections as submitted there by the su - perintendent; for instance, there Is another one here added, "In varieties of;" there is another one, I think, on onions; onion seeds, I think, has been added. And sheaf and winter oats, premium has been offered for them. These premiums amount to $4.50 on each item we have added. I think there are about five or six of them we hare added to the farm prod - uct Class F, such as sheafs of alfalfa showing the seed heads. On page 80 we recommend that we put in there a number for county collective exhibits from the eastern districts. For instance, we stopped at 1643, and then we add 1644, so as to give the county collective exhibits an entry blank, and supposed to 1111 in the entry blank with the number; that number will be found In the entry book: 1644 for the eastern col - lection of counties, 1646 for the central, and 1646 for the western. On page 81, this is an Important matter. We recommend that we cut out the second paragraph on that page, which reads, "The minimum score card for each county exhibit in each district shall be 60 per cent of the highest score made in said district" We recommend that we cut that out altogether. And then we changed the next paragraph to read as follows: Cut oat the 60 per cent, and start oil: "$2,350 shall be divided equally among exhibits;" then cut out the balance of that line clear down to "pro rated," and then it should read this way: "$2,350 shall be divided equally among exhibits, pro rated according to the number of points scored." The reason we make this change is that some of ine counties come in here, and, according to the ruling that has been made in the past, they have not scored high enough to get in the winnings, and they did not receive any of the moneys, and in a number of cases the Board has given than a small consolation price to assist them; but, in cutting out this minimum phrase, section, or paragraph there, that would leave it that all counties would get something, according to their score. Mr. Keedle: Doesn't that go a little back to the old system? Secretary Mellor: Just exactly. Keedle: If the "dry goods box" fellows that come down here up a small exhibit on the wall there, and they get a score on it they </seg>
            <seg id="p109">would get some money out of It. The fellows that come down here and work all summer, and get up a good display and a creditable show for the State of Nebraska and the State Board, of course they would score a card, we know. Those fellows would get enough; we would get noth - ing. In other words. Just take it oS and give it to them, at our expense, who are out here to put up a display, — the way I look at It. The point is this: You go to work with 50 feet of space; you get a score on that; that is true; you will get more scores than you would on a small exhibit, and consequently we would get more money out of it. But it brings that man in on that $2,350, that small man who would have been cut out if he did not keep to a certain minimum, or a certain point. And the way I look at it is, that it is cutting out a good man who has built up this Associa - tion on the agricultural products, and made a good showing. It is taking money from him that he should have. It looks to me, as an exhibitor here for many years in that line, under the old system that didn't suit. I thought that was the best system that we ever had. It makes these men come up, and makes them work and come up to the standard, by making a minimum. I don't care whether it is 60 per cent or 50; I believe we should have a limit; that we should show, that we should score, a certain pro rata, before we would get any money. Mr. Ream: I suppose the old members of the Board are breeders themselves out of our own State, in which I have been more interested than any other, and I am pleased with the work of the revision on this proposition, with one exception. My friend has raised, if I understand him correctly, a pretty good proposition there, — that is, a reasonable ojv position to that plan. I know what you people want, and that is, you want every county in this State, if possible, represented with an exhibit there that is creditable. I think, if you will remember carefully, you will agree with me that you have had some county exhibits in your exhibit occasionally that were not a credit either to the county or to your State Fair. That is a point I believe you should avoid. I believe you should be very careful there, and, if possible, adopt some plan by which every exhibitor shall receive due compensation for his efforts, according to his merits, if there is any merit. I like that plan, If you will carry it out, if you will fix some kind of provision by which you can cut out entirely the fellow who does not have a creditable exhibit I have no suggestion to offer. I want to call your attention to this, for I believe it is an important feature. You want to bring these exhibits up to the highest possible standard of excellence, and have none of them derogatory to your Fair. Mr. James: I believe that the gentleman doesn't understand the case The way I understand this question, it is Impossible fof a new exhibitor, a new county, to come in and compete against these old counties that have been in line for a number of years; and, under the old system. It is impossible for them to come in and get enough money; and it is outside of the matter to get in any new counties. Under this system which! the chairman just read, that gives a man cnly just what he is entitled to. If he brings down a wheelbarrow full of stuff, he does not get enough money. </seg>
            <seg id="p110">110 Ker this system, to pay his railroad fare. And the (act Is, it encour - i every exhibitor, and every new exhibitor, to get in the game and know at the time that he does this that he is going to get paid for it equal and Just and right The only suggestion I would make would be in case there are 25 or 30 counties, that possibly the premiums in that department ought to be raised. If you have 25 or 30 counties, under this system, and divide up equally and with all of them, it doesn't pay them out Mr. Leonard: Your committee and also all of your past Boards of Managers have worked and tried to thresh that thing out and give them all a fair show. They have raised the question here in all these exhibits that are not called creditable; but you have never heard an objection raised in any other exhibit than this county collective exhibit, in regard to an exhibit that was not creditable. If a man comes here with his cat - tle, he probably will have to compete with Pete Ross, from Ohio, one of the greatest show men there is on earth in cattle; and, if he brings an animal here that is not really a creditable exhibit, there is no question we are going to put him out The reason for that is because there is enough opposition in the department that the first four or live of the best exhibits get the money, and the ones that are not creditable do not get it Those are the reasons these figures can be raised in this department thpt we are speaking of. and not in the stock department. A few years ago, you remember when we divided this into districts, we did that for the pur - pose of giving the western counties a chance to win something, and up to the present time we have required them to score to 60 per cent or be out of the money. And there has not been a year, I believe. — at least, there has not been a year since I have had anything to do with this or knew anything about it, but that we have given them consolation money, to those counties that did not get within 60 per cent. While it is true my friend Keedle here may come down and not take home quite as much money with the same exhibit as Be has had heretofore, a man from Scotts - bluff or some of those counties away in the west could take home a whole lot more; but the expense is just as much more as he will take home less money. It is just like this: If Mr. Keedle comes with a carload of stuff, be will take home a carload of money. If the other fellow comee with a wheelbarrow full of stuff, he will take home only a wheeiDarrow fuU. And, if he come* with a bucketful, he can't get over a bucketful of money. I do not see anything at all just in this to these eastern counties, or to the central counties. There is another point that &gt;ou have raised, that a man may go out in these western lands, where probably there isn't over 20 per cent of their land that is in cultivation. If those energetic fellows that come from those counties attempt to make a county exhibit down here, they have to ride miles where my friend Keedle and my friends here in this eastern 'district would have to ride only rods, to get their exhibit together; and. when they pay their railroad fare down here, they And for the amount they bring down they have paid about $8 each way, which makes $16; and the rest of us close to Lincoln that bring- these </seg>
            <seg id="p111">exhibits, or bring their four men, have paid about $4 on an average for each one; until, when this man pays his expenses, and the western man pays his expenses, it is as nearly equalized as we can bee any way out to do it. I hope that at least for one year, these eastern iellows that have been taking a carload of money home, will allow the western men to try this plan once. Secretary Mellor: Thai is just the reason I do not think that it is a good plan. We used to try this plan in this State years ago, before we started in under this present arrangement, and in that way we found that the western fellow was getting probably $25, and the eastern man getting about $175 or $275, no matter how good the exhibit. There is a certain line of demarkation that runs through this State that does not allow the growing of as good an exhibit in some parts cf the State as it does in others. We drew the lines in three different, distinct places through the State: one we called the Eastern, where the conditions were as near alike as we could get them; one we called the Central, where the conditions were as near alike as we could get them; and the other was the Western. The Western Division of this district runs to land that is from four to five thousand feet in altitude, and it is absolutely impossible to grow the same crops, or as many varieties of crops, on land of that altitude as it is on land of a thousand or 1,200 feet altitude down in this eastern end of the State-. If you go back to that old merit system, that is, so many points for each one, you are doiug an injustice to this western land; you are not giving them what there is due to them; they can't possibly win what is due to them; they can't come in here and win it. If you will notice, the first winner in the Eastern Department was right close to 1,300 points this last year; the winner in the Central De - partment was 800 and something; and the winner in the Western De - partment was 500 and something. Those were all exhibitors, I think, in those departments. If Mr. Peck had been down here in this eastern end of the State, he might have been touching the 1,300 mark. If he had been down in this central part of the State, he would have had 800 and some - thing. But, under this proposed change you are eliminating the oppor - tunity for these western men to get a part of their money that is right - fully due them, coming here at three cr four times the expense that the eastern men do; and, under this plan that is proposed, making it abso - lutely impossible for them to come down here and get anywhere near their money. He spoke about cattle. I want to say this: you can raise cattle as well in the western part of the State as you can in the eastern part; you can feed them up there just as well. That is not the same condition, for the raising of crops is an entirely different proposition from raising cattle. Mr. Ollis: I understand that the proposition recommended by the committee here provides for the doing away of these districts that we have? A Member: To have a changed condition Secretary Mellor: That is what I understood; that was my opinion. </seg>
            <seg id="p112">Members: O, no! O, no! Secretary Mellor: I have been talking with that understanding; that was my opinion; that is what I heard of it LMr. Keedle: Tou don't understand. The district is the same, but keeping it on the points. Mr. Leonard: I thought when Mr. Mellor was talking he did not aadsrstand this proposition. Perhaps there's others that don't, and I will make an effort to explain the proposition as we have framed it. We leave these districts Just the same as they are, and the same as they have been since the Bute was districted. If we have $2,350 to divide among 23 counties, that would be a little bit over $100 to each county. That would be divided. There might be ten counties in the Eastern section — or eight, I believe it would be; and a certain number in the Central; and a certain number in the Western district; and this money will be divided, so much to each county, and those counties that are in the East - ern district will be pro rated according to their points. The money that hnkin to the Central district will be pro rated according to their points; and the money that belongs to the Western district will be pro rated ac - cording to their points. For example, suppose the Western district, which would have just 23 exhibits, would have only three counties accepted; there would be only $300 divided among them. If the Eastern district should have ten counties, there would be a thousand dollars divided among them. If the Central district should have ten counties, there would be a thousand to divide. Mr. McArdle: I would like to understand this, Mt. Leonard, a little more thoroughly. You are proposing to divide this money in regard to the three divisions? Are you going to divide the State equally in three part,? Mr. Leonard: No, sir Mr. McArdle: You are going to Just pro rate it? Mr. Leonard: No, sir: not quite — Mr. McArdle: We divide it up. Now, if there are 20 counties mak - ing an exhibit, there will be 20 shares in this money. For instance, sup - pose the Central district is out entirely. In the west, say, you have 25 or SO counties, with, a combined score of 2,000. In the east you have three counties, because there aren't many counties in the eastern division; with each county over a thousand, they would have 3,000 or 4,000. Then, you give to the counties in the west, because there are 20 counties there, 10/13 of the money, and to the six counties in the east 3/ 13 of the money, when it runs twice as much to score? Is that your theory? Mr. Leonard: Yes. However (interrupted) — Mr. McArdle: I think that is a very fine thing! That is not a good way to make a fair down here, gentlemen. With all due respect to the wast and all other divisions of the State, I think you should look to the interests of the parties that you are depending upon year in and year out to make your show in the agricultural hall, and I believe that you </seg>
            <seg id="p113">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 113 should help the west out; but I do not think you have stated that right. Mr. Leonard, nor the committee. ID-. Rudge: Let me ask one question: Last year we had 19 coun - ties; we had $2,350; we had 8 counties from the Eastern district; we had 7 counties from the Central district; and 4 from the Western district. Don't you think the proper way would be to give 8/19 of that money to the first district; 7/19 to the second district; and 4/19 to the third dis- trict? »Mr. McArdle: I do. You are speaking now of tie condition last . But from year to year; possibly, next year? We hare the condi - nezt year confronting us; not the condition here last year. Mr. Rudge: It is a question whether it has been divided before. Secretary Mellor: I think it has been twice divided before. I Mr. Ream: I think the only mistake that the committee made, prac ly, in their recommendations, was in not making some provision fo division of the lump sum of money among the districts. I under d that you are just doing all you can do in the way of counsel here, gave an. outline of it; and, unless you do this in some manner here will throw it on your Board of Managers) at the time the division is e made. This is the time to make it Mr. Hall: The State Board of Agriculture, I take it, is a board of education, and we are educating the producer in the way of breeding and in the way of producing; and on this particular point we are educating the exhibitor to gather up and make a display. On the point of educa - tion it seems that there should be some standard set of passing and rat - ing, the same as we have in our University today. Every boy or gill that is in our University must pass a standard of examination before he can advance; or it wou.ld be necessary for him to come back and do that work over again, just the same as many boys have had to go back and do it over again. And it seems to me that this matter of education that you are carrying on here is only in line with all other matters of educa - tion, and that there should be some standard by which we should pus muster. It may be that the 60 per cent standard, or a higher one, at least, is a little too high; it may be that that needs altering; but I think, at least, that we should have some percentage in there, and not cut it ill out. I believe, when a man makes his exhibit and he can't come up to muster, he ought to be sent back home, to try again another year, the same as he does in the University. A man enters once, but he is sent back to try another year. There is one thing that we have a little bit to contend with all over the State in regard to these exhibits; at leaat, I am sure we do in Franklin county. It is the matter like this: when the men first start out to make these exhibits, perhaps at first no one is much interested in them; but if we introduce them and encourage them, they finally reach the point of what you may say is success, different from plenty of others who want to jump in and take our money, and they are not educated in the work. Are you going to let somebody jump in and take that away from the man who is educating and who is advertising • </seg>
            <seg id="p114">the county? I bold that the exhibitor at the State Pair, especially when you give full points of merit, is a great advertiser. He educates the county; and, when a man reaches this point of excellency in these ex - hibits, I believe that the county does well to retain him; so that the county may be advertised as well as the State may be advertised. I be - lieve it is right and fair to leave some standard by which to rate these men, Instead of making the standard so much, and let every man (inter - rupted)— A Member: There would be the difference in standards, whether you charge them by percentage or by pro rating. You would have to fix a standard, or have a score, whether you have it by the score or by the percentage. Mr. Hall: I think this Society should fix the standard of scoring by saying that the man who would win one point is entitled to one dollar; and the man who would win two points is entitled to two dollars; and so on up. Would you come out the same as in the University? No. Tou would have a better rate, wouldn't you? Isn't this the same kind of prop- A Member: How do you leave the standard here? — as I understand it, by the score in place of per cent? t Secretary Mellor: I wish to add, for the information of the gentle - , that the rule heretofore has been "the minimum score card for each ity exhibit in each district shall be 60 per cent of the highest score made in said district." Sixty per cent of $2,350. That is, taking $300 — $100 in 50, 30, and 20, in each of the three districts; so, it would be $100 in the district; that is $300 additional, making $2,650 offered. Sixty per cent of $2,350 being divided equally among exhibits scoring above the minimum, "and the balance of said money will be pro rated according to the total number of points above the fninimum." I can tell you how that operates. Last, year, he said, we had 8 exhibitors from the Eastern dis - trict. They scored, we will say, 1,200 points, the highest; that is the best score; and 60 per cent of the 1,200 would be 720 points. All the ex - hibits in the district scoring 720 points would participate equally there. Then, 7 in the Central; that would be charged 800 points, we will say; that would make it necessary to have 480 points in order to participate. And 4 in the Western; that would be, say, 500; that would make it neces - sary to have 300 points scored in the Western. Now. suppose, on these 19 counties scored in these three districts, that would be $1,410. Sixty per cent of $2,350 is $1,410 that would have been divided on the points that these 19 have to make for their minimum; and then for each point that each of these societies have above their minimum, they get Another pro rata of the other money that is left of the $2,350. We thought that was an equal way of doing this business. We think it is yet, for that matter. Because you have something that gives every man exhibiting a fair chance. It may be an injustice to have the figure just 60 per cent of the maximum. It might be that a change would be beneficial; say, 40 per cent Whenever you get below that, in my opinion, It would be too </seg>
            <seg id="p115">low. One real estate firm brought an exhibit down there from a western county; they were not real exhibitors. Just had some party come here to bring a show down, and he advertises their county, which is commend - able and all right; but, if they are contesting for any of this money, the rules are laid down and they must meet the requirements. I think that rule we have is a splendid one; 60 per cent of the maximum seems not too high. That percentage was set for the reason, or with the idea, that we would have better exhibits, and to induce men to work a little harder to make a better exhibit; and I think it has had that influence; because, absolutely. Nebraska has the beet agricultural exhibit in the United States, every year. Mr. Rudge: And we don't want to cripple it. Secretary Mellor: That is right; we don't want to cripple it. We want to keep it there. If you are going to lower the maximum or mini - mum from 60 to 50 or 40 per cent, we are going to crippie it sure; that's all. If you are going to throw the bars down entirely, and let a fellow come down here with a little wagonload of products, and make an ex - hibit with a wheelbarrow load, and still give him the money, I don't think there is any necessity for it. It is the good exhibitors, or the men that are aspiring to be good exhibitors, that we want to cater to. Mr, Keedle: My friend here states he thinks a man Is worthy of his hire. I agree with him there. I recollect I came down a greenhorn — and I ain't much better now as an exhibitor — years ago, and we came down at our own expense; and I went back $50 out of pocket; and never got a dollar down here, but had a good experience. For four or five years more I exhibited, and didn't get one dollar out of the Fail* Association. We went home; but we learned a point. Why should we old exhibitors be cut out now we have learned the point? Why should we be cut out and some other "two-row greenhorn" come in? Let him pay for his ex - perience, the same as I have been paying for mine. That is the way I view it. (Laughter.) I don't believe it is a fair proposition whatever. I honestly believe that, if you adopt that proposition, you will have the agricultural hall practically empty. If you send 25 men out to get it, you will have it empty practically. That is my honest belief. But you will have to send, your men out, and pay them, from the Board of Directors, out of your treasury, to induce men to go out and get the goods to put in there. Mr. James: Under that standard we are not taking the rights away from the extra county, and so forth; that is up to the counties themselves alone. If they see fit to pick out an old timer and put in a new county, that is a business we are not providing for in any way, shape, or form. What I still think is this: it ia needed and necessary to give the new counties, the new exhibitors, some chance to come in and compete in this agricultural show; and it is impossible for the new men to get liu I want competitors myself, and I recollect my brother Keedle did. I came two or three years to the county exhibit, and I used to show, and I didn't get anything, and went home, and went harder after it; but everybody </seg>
            <seg id="p116">tnot that way. I think there ought to be something done for the new unties, the new exhibitors; but it Is Impossible for the new exhibitor to go down there in the beginning and break in the show and get the CO per cent, when competition is strong In counties, as it has been shown. It la impossible. We have too much here; it wouldn't have changed any money particularly, at all. this last year, under this system, — very little. It might have taken a few dollars from the eastern man and given It to the western man, something like that; it doesn't amount to but very little. And, if we do not adopt this just as it is, I would recommend that the minimum be cut down to 25 or 30 per cent, in order to give the new man an honest, sincere chance, and give him full respect for the efforts he has made. Mr. Rudge: I wish to say that the idea of the committee's recom - mending this was that last year the western district had four counties that came down here to compete. One of those counties outstripped the other three, so that the other three counties did not come in on the money at all; and I believe they had a pretty good sized exhibit I remember seeing the exhibit I was not competent to tell how near they scored on it In the western district we have Brown, Chase, Scott sbluff and Morrill counties. Brown county scored 579.9 points. There was not another county that got 50 per cent of their score. The next In points. Chase county, got 288.4, just one point and a half or 1.6 of scoring 50 per cent. The next, Scottsbluff, got 236, and Morrill got 203. Those perhaps were new exhibitors, and it was new country out there; and our idea was to help those new fellows that are coming down here and trying to make a show ; and they come down here and don't win any money. They go back and a few of them will return, but a good many of them won't come back. We have always tried, I think, to cater largely to young exhibitors and to the man who brings only one animal here; and I think we ought to cater now to- the man who brings only one pumpkin ; but still, we want these large exhibitors. I don't know but that Mr. Keedle is right in one way there ; that is, that we should" either adopt this plan, or else cut down that minimum from 60 to 50 or 40. I think the division of the money could be left this aext year the way It was last year,— the way Mr. Mellor outlined it By dividing it the other way, the way spoken of a little time ago would make quite a difference in some counties, — $40 or $50 apiece difference. For instance, there were 19 counties last year. By giving 8/19, I think, to this Eastern district and 7/19 of the money to the second, and 4/19 to the third, the Western district, it would make some little difference there, if we let in the man that had the small score. I think that every exhibit we had last year was to some extent a creditable exhibit, and I believe they all made an effort to bring as good an exhibit as they could from the rwoarcea they had to bring from. I believe the men from Scottsbluff and Dawes and Morrill and Nuckolls and Johnson counties (Johnson county didn't get in) were entitled to something; and the Board did provide, as </seg>
            <seg id="p117">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AORICl'LTCRE 117 Mr. Keedle: In order to get this before the bouse, I move you that we cut the minimum down to 40. Mr. James: I move to amend the motion by cutting it down to S5. Mr. Rudge: Too low! Mr. Youngers: Mr. Chairman, we have certainly had a very credit - able exhibit under our old system, andj I believe we ought to continue that, and that the State Board of Agriculture appropriate $200 for conso - lation for all worthy exhibits, and settle this whole controversy. That would be my judgment And then they could all come in that were worthy, and let the judges say which were worthy; and in that way give them something out of the extra $200. B Roberts: And how much would you give them? Youngers: That is for the State Board to decide. A Member: It might be only one of these would get the $200. LMr. Hall: I would ask one question: Is this Society endeavoring to e the grade of their show, to raise the standard of their exhibit; or are they endeavoring to lower it? Just as sure as you lower this rats, you are going to lower the standard of your show and of your exhibit*. If you leave it where it is or if you raise it, either one, you are going to raise it; for the reason that, leaving it where it is, the men who are mak - ing tha exhibit are becoming better educated, and they are giving them - selves to making better exhibits. Or. if you raise the standard — either one will raise it. And I believe the purpose of this Society Is to raise the standard of the show, under the system, rather than to lower it. Mr. Roberts: The conditions remain the same as they are. The State Is divided, as they say, into three sections? Vice- President Haws: Tes, sir. Mr. Roberts: I think it would be a good idea, and that has been done, I think, when I was superintendent at home, to take this Into con - sideration: The conditions are different in the northern part of the county from what they are in the southern part. Some years ago. — last year, a man in the southern part of the county could come in on the ex - hibit, and the man in the northern part of the county couldn't come within 30 per cent of his exhibit, on account of the conditions of the weather. I think, if the per cent were lowered to 25 or 30 per cent, it would suit the people. And another thing: I understand, in the western part of the county they have no market for agriculture or such like, and, if we got it and we had to go out of the county and throughout the county and gather lip any exhibits that belong in the western part, you wouldn't have this trouble. Mr. Youngers: You wouldn't have much of a show, Mr. Chairman. Mr. CMlis: I have been listening to this discussion with considerable interest, and I believe that the men that have been talking have been in earnest in what they say. I am in favor of the amendment made by Mr. James, that you cut down this per cent to 25 per cent Mr. Rudge: Too low. </seg>
            <seg id="p118">MX PROCEEDINGS NEBRAHKA STATE HOARD OF AUKICI I.TIRK Mr. Ollis: Mr. Mellor said to you that we have the best agricultural exhibit in the United States. 1 believe that is true I think we are all proud of that, when you come to think of it; but still I do not know really whether we ought to be proud of our agricultural exhibit or not. We have been holding the Fair here many years, and we have, I believe, ninety counties in this State, and with all the effort you put forth we have nine - teen counties who made an exhibit here last year. Does that show the strength of this State agriculturally? There is something wrong about it, or we would have most of the ninety counties making an exhibit here; and I think we ought to do something to induce those weaker counties to come into our exhibit here. The conditions are very much different in different counties in this State. It may not be that the conditions are all the same, or so different as it is supposed, but you will find counties in different parts of the State where it is a pretty hard matter for them, to get up a good, creditable exhibit, with the score high; but there is not a county In this State but what can get an exhibit here that would help out our show; and there is not a county in this State but what would be glad to do it, if they thought they would get the right kind of encourage - ment. I think they would come — perhaps not all next year; they would gradually come in. If you lower this per cent to 25 per cent, I believe those exhibits scoring less than 25 per cent would get out, and then the board won't permit the introduction of any exhibits that are not worthy of being taken care of in any manner, shape, or form. I would be willing to raise the amount of money made up for these exhibits a reasonable amount. A Member: 40 per cent? Mr. Ollis: I think 25 per cent is high enough; because you want to encourage these fellows. Mr. Keedle says he came down here four or five years before he got any money. The big mistake in these things is, you will find Individuals in some of these counties that might fafl to have an inducement, go on and put up an exhibit, coming in here at their own expense. It wouldn't be questioned that they might fail to do it, but they do want to do it. I believe you ought to encourage these weaker counties and to be able to say that we have not only the best agricultural exhibit in this country, but that we have the largest percentage of the number of counties showing that exhibit in the United States. Vice-PreBident Haws: It seems to me we are going to have a regu - lar scrap; and so, in order to get the thing in shape, I think we better get a motion before the house, and let you debate on it. I want to get it be - fore the house. Mr. Keedle: I accept his amendment. Vice-President Haws: You accept it? Mr. Keedle: I do. Vice-President Haws: He accepts 25 per cent? Is that the under standing? Mr. Keedle: Yes: that is his amendment I accept the amendment. </seg>
            <seg id="p119">Mr. Rudge: Gentlemen, it's too low, in my opinion; but you have my ideas along this line, and I think 40 will be right. Mr. McLeod: What I wished to say was this: that I think that the men that made that exhibit last year earned every copper cent they got, and more. Every year I have been in the State, and I have seen your ex - hibit, I felt that the men bringing it earned more money than! they got. If I understand it rightly, there are nineteen counties; if they come in next year, and that motion should prevail, and it brings in some more counties, I understand that you are lowering the premium, and each of your nineteen counties is getting less money. Rather than to give each of those counties less money, I would, as Mr. Ollls said, increase the pre - mium in some way, giving them more money, and Mr. Youngers has stated in what manner to do that. I do not know. But I do not believe we paid them as much money as we should. Let us not decrease the character of that exhibit in the least Let us keep that exhibit up to the present stand - ard, and form some method of encouraging the new exhibits without low - ering what we have. For that reason, I do not think the motion should prevail in this form, by lowering it to 25 per cent. I believe, gentlemen, that would be a mistake. But form some way of increasing the premium, or something, to encourage the new districts. Mr. Taylgr: I wish to make a substitute motion to all of them: that we make it 40 per cent Mr. McArdle: Second the motion. Secretary Mellor: Leave it where it is — 60. LMr. McLeod: I rise to a point of order. They have made an amend - t to what? The committee has reported; they have made recom - mendations; the subject, it seems to me, before the house is, "Are you going to accept the recommendations of the committee?" There is no subject germane to the committee's motion, or the committee's recom - mendations, and it is out of order. I think you have got to act upon the committee's recommendations: "Are you going to accept them, or are you going to vote them down?" You can not amend them by some defi - nite amendment. Therefore, I rise to a point of order. Vice-President Haws: The point of order is well taken. The Chair will say that you will have to first dispose of the committee's report Then you can make any amendments that you please. Mr. McLeod: I make the motion that the committee's report be not concurred in. Secretary Mellor: Second the motion. Vice-President Haws: Motion has been made that the report of the revision committee pertaining to these county collective premiums' be not concurred in. Are you ready for the question? "Question." Those in favor of the motion will manifest by saying Aye. "Aye." Those opposed. No. "No." The Ayes have it (Laughter.) Gentlemen, if you have any remarks to make, get busy. Mr. James: With the consent of my second, I will withdraw my mo - tion, and make it 30, instead of 25. </seg>
            <seg id="p120">120 Secretary Mellor: No: you leave it 80. (Motion seconded.) Secretary Mellor: Leave Jt 60 t Vice- President Haws: Gentlemen, it has been moved and seconded we reduce the minimum to 30 per cent. Are you ready for the ques - tion? Mr. McLeod: I believe that that was a serious mistake. It Is doubt - ful If that will ever give us our exhibit I believe It is an injustice to the other counties. I believe It should be 30 to 50 per cent, at least; 40 per cent is low enough. And I believe the motion in that shape should not be made, and I will amend it by making it — Secretary Mellor: Just as it is. Mr. McLeod: Fifty per cent. Secretary Mellor: Just as it Is. Mr. McLeod: I will amend the motion to 50 per cent. That is important concession. Mr. Ream: The principal part of the contention for the western put of the State would be this: that the counties lying along the North Platte river will have such an advantage In the dry part of the seasons over other sections of the State, in the way of making an exhibit here, that fifty per cent would not be a fair proportion for it. Mr. James: I move, as a substitute, that we reduce it to 25 per cent. If I can get a second, I believe we will carry it in that way. (Laughter.) BMr. Rudge: Now, gentlemen, I would not do anything in the world hurt that Agricultural Hall exhibit. I want to say we have bragged more on that exhibit than any other exhibit we have on the State Fair grounds. (Cries of "right," and applause.) And I do not want to do anything to in any way reduce the standard of that exhibit, and I like to hear from such men as Mr. Keedle and the men who got up this ex - hibit, and hear what they iave to say about it. But I think that we make a mistake if we reduce that below 50 per cent; that will reduce our standard. I am willing that the Board shall give a little consolation price, as they have, and I think they can be taken care of (applause) as Mr. Youngers has stated; but I would not be in favor of naming any amount, because you may have only one county that comes down below that 50 per cent standard, and you would not care to give that one county $200 and somebody else here $100. That score is enough at 51 per cent. So I think they can be handled In a satisfactory way by the Board. But I do not believe you ought to reduce it below 50 per cent We don't want to cut that exhibit down. We don't want to make it any less attractive; because we have got the best agricultural exhibit of any state in the country, out of the Union. I have been to four or five of the state fairs, and they cant hold a candle to ours. Secretary Mellor: Why not leave that where it is? Mr. Rudge: It has been a little high. Take it in the Western dis - trict: Four counties came in last year from the Western district. There was only one county that got any, and the other three counties did not even get 60 per cent of it. But I think they will do better in another year. </seg>
            <seg id="p121">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 121 I do not believe we ought to reduce it too low, because it will hurt the standard of our exhibit; and if 50 per cent will not bring men who bring in these county collective exhibits, I am in favor of it. Secretary Mellor: I don't wish to inflict myself upon you much, in the face of such argument, in furnishing testimony on the excellence of the Nebraska agricultural show; and now, if you are going to do anything to make that show poorer, I would feel sorry for it Absolutely, I think that 60 per cent is all right myself. The Board gave $90 to one county, $&lt;0 to another, $50 to another, and $40 to another, that did not get in on this money; and we are glad to give it. There isn't a man here that begrudges that money to these men. and these men are paid, practically, for all they brought here. There was not a man that was worrying, go - ing around the country for six months trying to get a fellow to raise an exhibit, and trying for two or three weeks to get it moved here. When they came in, we paid them a few dollars. We got this exhibit; they got this small money. I think our Board did justice to them. I believe it is • mistake. The minute you put this below 60 per cent, you arc doing something to lower the grade of our exhibit; and I hope you won't do it Mr. Keedle: Now, we should take into consideration a little the con - ditions of last year, and the reason these western counties were cut out so badly. The drouth had a tendency. Probably, this coming season wil be better; while we don't know, prospects are better. They may show up a pretty good score another year, and we should not take last year as a criterion to judge for this year, and the chances are in the west that they will come down here, under their irrigation system, and skin us all out, and we will be holding the sack. And I tell you, boys, that you might just as well quit if you cut her right down as much as that. I am a fighter, and I'm going into it, and I will have just as many friends when 1 get through, as far as I am concerned, as when I got started. But, aa Mr. James says, it will be impossible for new men tot get in. I have thought of that, but, of course, as long as I can keep ir the front rank, it's human nature to stick the money in my pocket, and the boys are with me. We wouldn't want to get our rate too high; but now, as the ques lion comes up, I say tisn't too high, in the sense in which it is too high according to the money appropriated, that we set aside. If the Boarc would appropriate $3,000, and then cut her down to about 30 per cent, think we could heal all this matter up, and start in possibly, and every body be satisfied. Mr. Ollis: We have discussed this matter here at length now, and I thought I had understood the motion right in the discussion, and that the question ought to be settled. I therefore want to make a substitute motion. As I understand it, the recommendation that the committee made has been voted down by the Society? Vice-President Haws: Yes. Mr. Ollis: So that that leaves the premium list stand as it was last year. I move that the board of managers be instructed to appropriate a </seg>
            <seg id="p122">sum of money at Fair time sufficient to pay a reasonable premium on any other worthy exhibits. (Motion seconded.) Vice-President Hawe: Mr. James, would you like to say something? §Mr. James: I would. The trouble with that is this fact.— that does encourage a new exhibitor whatever; he does not know that lie is go - to get anything, or what he is going to get. There is something wrong. And, if he does come to make a creditable exhibit and falls down, of course, under the motion, it wouldn't take care of him. On the other hand, if he hasn't got an exhibit, there isn't a great deal that might in - duce him to get up an exhibit. I do not understand that we are lowering the class of exhibits a particle in the way that we propose lowering it down, — the new exhibit. For example, we had last year in the Eastern district, Johnson county down there, a good county. We had a good man behind our superintendent of exhibits brought up here, Mr. Mike Murphy, perhaps a number of you know him, and he has plenty of money, and he spared no time, money, or anything to get up a county exhibit, new ex - hibit; and he came up here to the State Fair and made a showing. All of you that saw It will say it was a good, creditable showing. It was a nice show to look at. But he did not have sufficient points, so that he was cut out in the Eastern district entirely. He had a good, creditable show, and any of you that saw it will say that yourself. 1 do not see that we are lowering the class of the exhibits a particle. If we could have nil the counties in the State cut down the exhibits each one equal and right, it would be a great deal better than to have fifteen or twenty counties, as we have now, and you never will get that until you have some different •yst.ni. Mr. Youngers: In reference to Mr. James's statement, that these parties won't know that they are going to get anything, I wish to Bay that it is inserted in our premium lists that the Board of Managers will pay a certain per cent after due notice, — not a certain per cent, but whatever it was worth, according to the report of the judges. They would all know that they were going to get something if they got a worthy exhibit, and not going to be left in that matter. Mr. James: We have to give them that, because we inserted that in the premium list so that every man can see that. I move you — (Inter - rupted) Mr. Taylor: I believe that we are just principally fighting air, and by and by it will become "hot air" if we are not careful. (Laughter.) I think this proposition you have been threshing over here in the question presented, the standard that you are to raise these exhibits to, doesn't amount to very much, after all, whether you lower it or raise it. I re - member the time, gentlemen, when my county was able to make an ex - hibit or agricultural products year after year at this State Fair, that usu - ally stood at the top; but the exhibitor has left us; he moved away, and went to Canada. They have never had an exhibitor since. I want to say to you that, unless you have got the men first in your county that are willing to gather those exhibits, I don't care where vuir percentage is </seg>
            <seg id="p123">put, you won't have any exhibits from that county. (Applause.) (Cries of "Question, Question.") Vice-President Haws: Gentlemen, this has certainly been a "good run." My friend Keedle says he is a fighter. I mean to Bay he isn't the only fighter here! They are all fighters!! The question resolves itself upon the substitute motion of Mr. Ollis: that you maintain the 60 per cent as provided in our premium list at this time, and that the Board of Managers have the power to appropriate such an amount as they may deem wise or just to cover the expense of these people that are outside of the 60 per cent, to reimburse them, if they have that power. As many as are in favor of that motion, say Aye. "Aye." Those opposed. "No." I guess that's right — the Ayes have it. You have got right back where you started from! Secretary Mellor: I move that the Treasurer be authorised to pay each delegate to this meeting %6, his hotel bill, and his railroad fare. Motion seconded. Vice-President Haws: It has been moved and seconded that the Treasurer be instructed to pay each delegate here present six dollars and his hotel expenses and his railroad fare. Mr. Rudge: I think it ought to be amended: "Men who were called in here on committees that were here yesterday." Secretary Mellor: The Board of Managers have charge of that. Vice-Preeident Haws: "' has been customary for them to get $3 more, because they work a day longer. We will accept the amendment so it goes through. Those in favor of the motion, say Aye. "Aye." Those opposed, No. Nobody. The Ayes have it. Mr. Rudge: One or two items on this premium list, and then we will be through. On Domestic, I think that is all we had to offer on that. On Domestic Products, on page 89, there were four more premiums offered than what i.s given there; they amount to $3 apiece. We recommend that these four be put in; and also recommend one loaf of bread, instead of two. If there is no objection, we will consider that it is adopted. (No objection.) On page 94, Bees and Honey, there was a recommendation from a bee man there, which we did not get until late this morning; and that, we recommend, be referred to the incoming Board. It seems they have asked for another premium there for a professional exhibitor, ao that they can have a show. That was referred, I think, to the incoming Board of Man - agers. Mr. James: There is one important matter there that you omitted, and that is, you will notice there that we recommend that all grains in half a bushel are reduced to pecks, instead of bushels. Mr. Rudge: All grains In half bushel reduced to one peck. I guess you are all glad for that. Mr. Hervey: If you will look at your watches, it is getting nearly time for us to gather at the hotel. If there is much more we had better — </seg>

President Hervey: Gentlemen, will you please come to order? We are here tonight for the purpose of discussing Oounty Fairs and County Fair Management We nnd we heretofore have obtained a great deal of information by an interchange of ideas and thoughts in regard to the management of our county fairs in Nebraska. We are not alone on this proposition. We find that other states are being organized, and all for the same purpose. The county fair proposition is the basis of oar agri - cultural industry to a great extent, and the question is, Can we better our system of organization by an Interchange of ideas ? and we very certainly think that we can; because we can't visit three or four or five county fairs around over the State without finding some variation. There is quite a variation in your premium lists and your rules and regulations govern - ing your county fairs and the general methods of handling and operating the county fairs. I will introduce Mr. Cheney, of Frontier county, as toastmaster for the evening, who will take charge of the meeting. (Ap- I Toast master Cheney: Gentlemen, we have come to the second sec - of our program for tonight. Regarding the first section of it, the en - ainment that you have all had, you need no particular instruction, : I can see, judging by the manner in which you have taken care of fine repast which we have had. We now come to the part on which need mutual help. The first toast on the program is "County control ounty fairs," which will be responded to by C. H. Jeffords, of Broken Mr. Jeffords: Mr. Toastmaster and Gentlemen: I understood from the Secretary of our organization that the gentlemen on this program were supposed to only introduce these subjects and open them for dis - cussion, and consequently I made simply an outline of my remarks. I might enlarge on it a little without notes, and, if there are any reporters here, they will use their best judgment in eliminating what they ought to eliminate and saving that which is worth saving. I In "breaking the ice" and getting us all to feel a little more comfort - i I might tell a story regarding what happened up in our country long s ago In the early times. Seeing so many old timers of the State ered here put me in mind of it, and also I was reminded of it by a id. In the early times we used to haul cedar over the country fre - itly. There was once in a while a pocket that contained a rich find sdar, and we looked on it as the gold seeker looks on a pocket of gold he finds in the mountains. We had an old friend, a neighbor there, wasn't very good in making these findings, and another neighbor that extremely good; he found more things than he could appropriate lelf. So he was telling the old gentleman one day where he could find b cedar, and he drew a diagram of the road, the trail that he should </seg>
            <seg id="p126">follow, up past a certain point and around the canyon, and on up, and he drew it in the sand, fo that he could not mistake; but, finally, he got up to the head of this canyon near where the pocket was, and then he says, "You go up the hill, and over there," and pointed, and swung his finger around in the air, to illustrate how the old man should go to find the pocket The old man. was gone two or three days, and he came back, and had not found the pocket. Well, with surprise he says, "How did that come? Didn't I make it plain? Didn't I indicate that trail plainly to you?" "O yes," he says. "I was able to follow it easily as long as you kept on the ground, but. when you went up in the air, I couldn't follow it." (Laughter.) kMy talk tonight may be a parallel to this man's description. You be able to follow me while I am on the ground, but, if you can't fol - me when I go into the air, it won't be your fault, but will be mine. COUNTY CONTROL, OF COUNTY FAIRS. Eis admitted by all that the primary object of county fairs Is to im - fa/ming and stockraising, and thus better the condition of ; he gen - lblic. Now. In order to outline this subject and get it in shape for discus - sion, It is necessary to take up. first, the present management and conse - quent condition of our county fairs. Pfar, they have been organixed and kept alive by a comparatively imber of public -spirited citizens, associated together for that pur - id usually aided by a certain amount of public money, which the board is authorized to donate for this purpose. We have been very iurky in the fact that we havp always had a county board that was disposed to grant us all the public money that the law authorizes, and consequently it has helped us. I understand a great many counties are not so favored, and my advice to representatives from that county here is to get busy and see that you have a county board that will give you the public support that the law allows. LThe association has absolute control of the fair, and it is up to the ibers to make it a success or a failure. Now, in these strenuous times of peace and prosperity success Is spelled with just five letters, m-o-n-e-y. Therefore, the management is compelled to so conduct their fair that It will bring in the necessary need - tul. with the result that for every dollar expended at the fair for the im - provement of farming and stockraising, six dollars are spent for other things. I think you will find that my statement is approximately correct, that, for every dollar that we expend in premiums for exhibitions of live stock and for exhibitions of farm products, it costs us about six dollars in other expenses and fdV other things. Overdrawn, you say? Look over the county fair reports whi&lt; h you will find In the 1911 report of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture. </seg>
            <seg id="p127">Are the county fair managers to blame for this condition? Not at all, for, as a rule they are up-to-date, progressive fellows who wish with all their hearts to advance the interests of the rural community, but they have to have the money to run the show, and so they cater to the taste of all the public, with the result that the fair grounds usually look more like an amusement park than a farmers' exhibit. The advocates of county control do not blame the fair managers for this condition, for they realize that the few men who are actually behind the fair as now managed .can not afford to take any chances on having the fair a financial failure; so they must conduct it on purely business principles as viewed from a strictly private business point of view. They maintain that the fair is beneficial mainly to the general pub - lic, and that it is against our principles of government to have a public institution owned and operated by a private corporation; that the present condition of affairs is the result of private ownership of a public utility; that as a matter of justice and equity the public ought to manage the fair, take the receipts, and pay the bills. That public control of the fairs would arouse the same civic pride that is now shown in our public high - ways, and the public schools of the country. That the county could take over the property of the association for fair purposes and administer the business of the association through its county clerk and board of super - visors. The supervisors with the county clerk could take the place of the present board of directors, and each and every member of the fair board then would be a direct representative of the people and responsible to the people for their acts. Each commissioner or supervisor would represent his particular dis - trict in the management of the fair, and it would cease to be a narrow, local, private affair, and would become a powerful educational institu - tion, supported by the people, patronized by the people, and conducted in the interest of the people. It would also enable all of the counties of the State to hold fairs, whereas now fewer than half of them make an effort to hold one. I thank you gentlemen for your kind attention while I hare been speaking, and I hope that I have opened up this subject and given you something to think about. It has its advantages and its disadvantages. There is never a question raised that has not two sides. This is not any idea of mine; I do not know who originated it. I do not know who first advanced the idea that as the county fair was practically a public institution it should be controlled and owned, for that matter, by the public, and operated by the public. It is a great, good thing. I see where it can be made vastly more interesting than it Is at present, and made more useful than it is at present. I also see where it might possibly be the absolute death of a county fair in a county. It would seem to be. Just as I mentioned in this paper, up to the citizens of the county, as to whether they have civic pride enough to administer this for the benefit of the public as they would do the highways and schools; or whether they would not think it was worth while, and would be too </seg>
            <seg id="p128">narrow to take it and use It as they would have a possibility of using it. I thank you for your attention. (Applause.) Toastmaster Cheney: Gentlemen, this subject is now open to dis - cussion. We think the better plan would be to discuss each subject as we so along. Now, we would be glad to hear from any of you who have ideas either for or against the question of county control of county fair. (Calls for Mr. Ollls.) Mr. Ollis: I don't know as I have anything to say with regard to this matter. It is a question, at least, I have not thought very much about, until the matter was brought up here tonight. I know there have been some advocates of county control or county ownership of county fairs. Personally, I first thought, without very deep consideration of the mat - ter, I did not beileve it would be a success. I can see very easily how it might happen that, while the board of county commissioners or su - pervisors, as the case might be, may be very able men, and men that have the best interests of the county at heart, and anything that would affect the best interests of the county, be perhaps splendid, good men, there might possibly yet be a man on the board that did not have any Interest or did not care very much for fains of any kind. We had a meeting at the Farm this forenoon in regard to horses, and Mr. Prank Howard, in making his talk there from a horse breeder's standpoint, said that the horseman had to be born; that there had to be born in the man a knack or love for the business, of some sort, or he would never make a success out of it It may be the same way with fair men. There's many a man in this State, or in many counties of this State, that would make a splendid, good fair man. There's a lot of men today that would make splendid, good members of our Board of Agri - culture. I would bo glad to see all members of that Board. Still, at the same time, in the very same communities these men come from, are good business men, splendid, honest men, good citizens in every way, that would make very poor fair men; and it just occurs to me that the plan might possibly not work. As I said before, I have not given the matter very much thought. Toastrnaster Cheney: Is there any one else that will venture to dis - cdss this subject? Calls for Mr. Leonard Mr. Leonard: I haven't anything to say Toastmaster Cheney: Very well, gentlemen. We will pass to the next subject, "What system or plan of organization would you suggest to secure the strongest support of the citizens of the county in fair promo - tion?" Mr. H. V. Riesen, of Beatrice, will respond to this. Mr. Riesen: When I received the Secretary's call to discuss the sub - ject I felt like declining. I think there are so many others here who are much more able to talk about organizing county fairs than I am, that I fear what I have to say and what I tell you will be something like what the gentleman in my immediate neighborhood said here a little while ago. It was about a young man who had been sent out to make a speech </seg>
            <seg id="p129">129 - KI1KASKA STATE BOARD OF AOKICII.T1 KK 13b somewhere, and after the speech was over, some one asked, "Well, did he make a good speech?" "Yes," was the reply, "pretty good speech; hut he didn't tell us anything we didn't know already." So I am afraid that will be the case with me. I will do the best I can. (Reading) When the Secretary of this Association advised me that the subject stated had been assigned to me for this occasion, I intended to decline the call, knowing there would be many others here who could handle the subject very much better; but, on second thought, I consid - ered there was a great deal to be gained by the discussion of this sub - ject which I hope will follow after the regular part of the program has been finished; and, as the fair association in my own county has un - dergone a complete change during the past year and will have to revise its constitution and by-laws, rules, and regulations, in the near future, there is a somewhat selfish motive in my accepting the invitation to ex - press my views on the organization of societies for the holding and pro - moting of county fairs. Since in the fall of 1910 I had a very interesting talk with Mr. O. W. Hervey, about fair organization, I have given this matter considerable thought, and have made inquiries to learn how other societies were organ - ized and maintained. There are probably three plans on which fair societies in this State are organized, and all practically based on the same principles and foun - dation. There are the societies with continuous membership; the socie - ties with an annual membership, and societies organized on the principles of a stock company. Let us consider first the stock company organizations. These, in my opinion, face the danger of personal profit and gain desired by Its mem - bers, who naturally would consider their contributions as an investment. It is also a fact that, unless a restriction is in force that no person can hold more than one share of stock, a few members may get control of the affairs of the society and run them for a personal gain, rather 'than for the improvement of agricultural and domestic industries. As an illustra - tion, allow me to give you some of the history of the Gage county society before its present members got control of it. rThe society was organized by a number of the best citizens of Gage ity. A fair was held every two years, but the premiums offered were paid regularly, as the county failed to pay the contribution which to give at that time was optional with the county commissioners. This nat - urally discouraged the exhibitors, and the two or three succeeding fair* were run more as a carnival and race meeting than an agricultural ex - position, although very good exhibits were made in the live stock depart - ments, especially in the class for horses. Later, after the laws of the State had been changed making county aid compulsory in counties of 30,000 or more inhabitants, and, in order to bold its claim, the management requested some of the present mem - bers of the society, who controlled the only suitable grounds near Beat - rice, to take charge of the fair for its old members. That year the » * </seg>
            <seg id="p130">V&gt;miums and accounts were all paid, and two years later the entire issue stock was offered to the new management and bought by them, and a sufficient number of season memberships were sold to comply with the law, while really the society was controlled by only five or six men. Fairs were held annually after this, but with considerable of the old opposition remaining; the support and attendance were not sufficient to meet the heavy expenses; the financial results were far from satis - factory, and the necessary funds to pay the accounts of the fair were provided by two of its members. After carrying this burden for several years, it was concluded that the members should return to the treasury all but one share of their stock. This was sold to new members, and, after sufficient stock had been sold to pay all debts, a new board of managers was elected, and the fair of 1911 planned and carried out with a success of which I will tell you later. We credit the result to the fact that a large number of men were interested in this fair, where before only five or six had its suc - cess at heart. This shows the danger to an organization with only a few stockholders and ten or fifteen season members whose interest usually ends when they have received their season tickets. The next plan, the organizations with memberships which must be renewed annually is undoubtedly all right, if there is no trouble in get - ting the renewals. As I understand it, these organizations practically and legally end with the year, and, according to the law, at least as I interpret it, any other bunch of men may form for the same purpose. This, of course, is largely a matter of local feeling. With such an or - ganization in Gage county, we would have at least two if not more-ag - gregations in different parts of the county who would want to hold a county fair and claim precedence, if the old membership had not pub - lished their intention to continue early. Here I would like to bring up the question of ownership in any prop - erty which may have been acquired ; and further, what about the financial responsibility with only an annual membership? Would a new member - ship be willing to accept the obligations of the outgoing organization in case a shortage had occurred? The third plan of organization is the one with a continuous mem - bership, and this appears to me the one which, according to the wording of the subject, I would suggest as the system and plan to secure the sup - port of the citizens of the county. In organizing with continuous membership, make the fee $25, or less if considered best, issue a certificate of membership, with the under - standing that any cash on hand after all accounts and premiums have been paid shall remain in the treasury. There should be a large mem - bership in this case, and it should be spread out all over the county and be taken from all classes and occupations. The amount dictated by law to be raised annually could be paid by additional memberships or selling season tickets. I want to refer once more to the Gage county association. While we </seg>
            <seg id="p131">are still a stock company, we really work out our plans on the continuous membership idea. We pay no dividends ; the money remains in the treas - ury. We have fifty-seven members, each of whom paid $25 for his mem - bership, only one share being allowed to a person. The result was that fifty-seven members, merchants, bankers, mechanics and farmers, put their shoulders to the wheel last fall, and boosted for the Gage county fair. When the fair was over, we owned $900 worth of buildings, all paid for, and had $350 cash on hand. We published the financial results in a printed report, giving itemized accounts of the receipts and ex - penditures. These reports were mailed to each stockholder, and, where before the people talked of graft and personal profits, we are now praised. I believe a mistake 1b made where the board of managers of a fair consists of too many members. Five members, together with the four officers — all told, nine — are a good number and easily gotten together; and. if honest and progressive men are chosen, the public will have the necessary confidence. I believe such an organization will secure the strongest support of the citizens of the county. I would also suggest full and wide publicity of all the affairs of the organization. A full report of the finances, not only to the members, but published in the daily and weekly papers of the county, where all can read it, is always a matter of credit, and shows honest intentions. Where the publican "can be shown," accusations will soon fall flat. Do not fail to mail full financial reports to your county supervisors; they are entitled to them, especially in counties where aid is received. While you are preparing for the fair, keep the public posted as to the plans under consideration. More people than you may think are inter - ested, and often good suggestions come from outsiders. In conclusion, I would like to sound a warning: Keep the county fair out or politics, and keep the management in the hands of business men and farmers not connected with politics. (Applause.) Toastmaster Cheney: We certainly ought to have a discussion on this interesting paper that we have just heard. You have heard the plan that they presented in Gage county. Doubtless we can be profited. We can hear with profit from others as to how they plan in their counties. tMr Lawson: There doesn't seem to be any one very much interested le subject. It was well handled. I want to endorse most emphatically publicity part. There is a point, that is overlooked among our county i too much for the success of them. You will get people more in - terested when they know what you are going to do, and the suggestions offered come from a corner unexpected, and are valuable, and, when it comes to the finances, they are anxious to know what has. been done. I tt to ask Mr. Riesen how long after the fair is over they give this ■ral publicity to the county? Mr. Ripsen: In this case, on the day after all the accounts had been paid, — all accounts and premiums had been paid. Mr. Lawson: You haven't any fixed time for that? </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 Mr. Riesen: No; no fixed time. Mr. Lawson: That is too late after the fair is over with, to have publicity. Mr. Riesen: O, well, just after or before the annual meeting in Mr. Lawson: O, yes; that is what you need, Wilson: I don't know that I have very much to say, except to eu - e one thing that Mr. Riesen brought out there, and that is the abso - necessity of paying all premiums in full — absolute necessity. Another thing; publicity perhaps is a good thing, but there is one thing more, it seems to me, that is even more important than that, and that might go back to the first paper here, in regard to the conduct of the fair. A county fair, or a state fair, for that matter, is an educational in - stitution, and can never be a money-making proposition. It therefore de - mands that it be put in the hands of its friends, and its friends must be men who are sufficiently interested to give their time freely and work hard. They must put their hearts into it; if they don't, they will never make a success. If the people who are called upon to patronize the fair understand that these men are giving their time and doing the work, and that they are putting nothing into their pockets, I want to tell you you will get sup- I recognize the fact that all boards of supervisors are not as wise as they should be. Sometimes we have to commence educating there. We have a good many of them. I can remember back one time in our history when we went before our board of supervisors in our county. One man— I don't know but that he was chairman at the time; I rather think he was — said that he would like to see that ground plowed up and sowed into wheat. But I want to say to you gentlemen, we have a chair - man of our board today who don't believe anything of the kind. We don't have to go before the board now to get an appropriation. They look after the matter for us; they are interested; they understand that the work which we are doing is for the benefit of the county, and they are with us upon that proposition; and, when you can get that kind of a spirit worked up among your people, you are going to get support for your fair. For the exhibitors, you must pay your premiums in full, and as he said in regard to your management, I believe that he is right; it should not be too much. In Fillmore county they have an executive board con - sisting of president and six directors. The annual meeting puts every - thing into their hands, under certain restrictions of the general laws, but they allow them to go ahead. They do everything that is necessary to be done to make the fair a success; anfl we have been very successful. (Applause.) Mr. Titus Davis: Pawnee county has been organized according to this plan of Mr. Riesen's for over thirty years. We have forty acres of ground. We have a 100-foot pavilion, 8 square, making 300 feet around. Our exhibit is all made inside of this pavilion, except poultry and </seg>
            <seg id="p133">stock of all kinds, — that is outside. The county has been paying the premiums. It's an awful thing when you can't pay your premiums. We have 300 stockholders, $10 per share; $3,000 were put in the fair over thirty years ago. We own our own grounds. We have one of the nicest parks in the country. We rent it every year to the Chautauqua people, getting $250 or $230 or $240 out of it, and it helps us along nicely. We have never failed to get county aid. We had county aid even Ks when we didn't have a county fair; they would aid us, anyhow, blew away one time, and had a new floral hall to build, and we built den we couldn't have a fair that year. As to the money, we have a rule. Mr. Riesen has a copy of the con - stitution. I can read it to you. It states this: we are limited; we can - not go in debt over ten per cent of the stock; we can't go in debt over $300, — that is it. If we run behind over $300, we had to pro rate our premiums; and that is cnanged; we have a rule for changing that, that gives us a right to do that. Other than that, if you don't, the only thing I see, in paying the premiums in full, you are liable to get in debt, if you have a rainy week, so deep that you can't get out right away. Mr. Jeffords: But then, I would inquire if you might pay them the next year? Mr. Riesen: Paying premiums is the first in such matters. The county money is not touched until the premiums are paid. Sometimes, we have a few dollars left; sometimes it takes it all. I would say this, that we are not as lucky as the gentleman there from Pawnee, as our county supervisor we have to pull at and insist upon our appropriation. That is the aid given us by the law of the state. We have considerable opposition from the southern part of our county. Some years ago, before this management took hold of our fair, a fair was held in Wymore. For some personal reason, it was moved down there; and the agreement and arrangements which were made by the citizens of Wymore were such that they had to personally pay that shortage. There was a considerable shortage, and the citizens had to pay it. The county refused the aid absolutely, because there were some features connected with the fair which allowed them to refuse it, and the citizens of Wymore had to pay for that fair. Well, then, that management practically was at an end and came to us; and, after certain agreements, they gave us the finances to handle; we took the fair, and later on we sold the stock. Mr. Wilson saya the premiums always are paid from the county money before anything else is touched. We have been very fortunate; we have always paid our ac - counts. When we have not had the money we have gone and borrowed it from the banks, and, as I said before, it pays us to handle it. We are not so fortunate in owning the grounds. We have an eight - year lease on the grounds. We have erected a building last year, as I said, costing us $624, for exhibition purposes; have erected additional hog sheds, hog pens, etc., because, when the money comes in, we find it is double what It has been in previous years. We bought a little office </seg>
            <seg id="p134">building for the secretary, with not over practically an indebtedness of $600 a year ago. We today own buildings and cash to the amount of $1,250. (Applause.) Mr. Wilson: I notice the word "members" and the word "stock - holders" are used. I would like to distinguish between the words "stock - holder" and "member." We don't have any stockholders with us; they are members, and their memberships die with the members, — non-trans - ferable. They pay their money to be a good fellow. The grounds which we own, which the association owns, they own because it is an associa - tion for an agricultural purpose, and, when it ceases to be used for that, it goes to the county. There are no stockholders with us. It is only right, then, that, when we haven't the money to pay the premiums, we should borrow. A year ago we gave our note to the local bank there for $1,135 to put us straight. This year it ia all wiped out. We do sometimes have hard years; sometimes we have good years. When we have a hard year, we simply tide things over. When we have a good year, they make good for us; but we do not put any rule limiting the amount of the indebtedness which we could incur, because we are not going to incur one cent more than is possible. The only thing that puts us in debt is because we have a bad year. We paid everything; paid it absolutely in full. But we aren't going to the bank to borrow — and then lose good money. (Applause.) Mr. Hervey: I would like to endorse the quality of the paper read by Mr. Riesen. There isn't any question in my mind about the fact that the organization of the county fair has a great deal to do with the success of the fair, and that we need one of the organizations, as Mr. Riesen has outlined here, in the State of Nebraska, in regard to the way to get our people together in a community, to hold a county fair. I attended Mr. Riesen's fair in 1910, and I found the embarrassing condition that those people were working under down there. They had a good fair; the fair was not objectionable; but, on inquiry, I found that the boys that were operating the fair were about three besides Mr. Riesen, and they were not so comfortable. They had a pretty good fair. They were at the bottom of the whole proposition; and it was costing them a good deal more than they were getting out of it. Yet there was a prejudice over the county that this fair organization was making a big lot • money out of the people. He was wanting some suggestion in regard how they could be relieved, and I suggested an organization, stock - holders' organization; and I told him that my idea was, in order to make a good fair, you must interest the people of the county; not only a little bunch of people around Beatrice, or around Lincoln, or around some other county seat town, but you must get the men scattered all over the country. If you can get a stock company organized, and only one share of stock to a member, and get a man away out here, that fellow will in - terest ten more men in the county fair, if he is a good representative member; that is the kind of man to get on, to commence with. Enter and scatter them all over your county, by which means you get the inter- </seg>
            <seg id="p135">est and influence of the citizens of the county, and they all join together, without any exception at all, for a fair deal. fis an imaginary idea that gets into the minds of the people that ir five or half a doxen men are operating a fair to the interest of own pockets. The very same condition existed up here in Sioux -a great big fair. It finally resulted in just a few men handling that big fair; and they were scared half the time for fear there would be bad weather and they would lose eight or ten thousand dollars. Those conditions exist all over the country. There certainly must be some basis of a proposition for the organisa - tion of a fair; there is some proposition that is better than the others. If we can arrive at what that proposition is for organization, we have ac - complished a big thing. It would be a great deal better if the fairs could be held by counties on the same basis, and if we had a uniform premium list, and if we had uniform rules and regulations. That is part of the work of this State Fair Managers' Association, to bring about a condition of uniformity, a condition of interest and sympathy, with all these county fairs. We want the same s'cinch," and, if your fair will succeed and relieve yourselves of prejudice from among the people, under your system of organization, why will not ours? (Applause.) Toastmaster Cheney: Is there any one else who wishes to speak? If not, we will take up the next topic, "How can we interest the boys and girls in the county fair?" which will be responded to by William Lone - gran, of. Florence, Douglas county. Mr. Lonegran: I am afraid I can't do this subject justice, but I will This subject presents many difficulties. The county fair was primarily organized for the betterment of agri - culture, consolidation of common interests, competition or rivalry in ex - hibition, which leads, or should lead to general improvement. Our boys and girls will be the agriculturists of the next generation; therefore, our subject is an important one. The "back to the land" movement and the high cost of living have been factors in making temporary agriculturists of some of our city boys and girls. The Young Men's Christian Association of Omaha interested 1.000 boys in the "school garden" contest during 1911. Six hundred of these gardens were visited by the director and were in excellent condition, until the severe heat and lack of moisture stopped their growth. About 150 of these boys exhibited their products, and made a very creditable show - ing. The prizes offered were cash premiums, %1 each, 6 classes, 10 premiums in each class. We consider this arrangement better than the average county fair plan; more individual premiums are offered, and always in cash. County fairs as a rule pay large premiums in the senior classes; but the boys' and girls' departments do not receive enough at - tention. </seg>
            <seg id="p136">Another suggestion is the age limit in classification; boys from six - teen to twenty might enter in an acre contest, or other classes arranged for young men; boys younger, in classes suitable for their age. A girl of six years should not be expected to compete with a young lady of eighteen in garment making or fancy work. tOne of the strongest features of our county fair is the poultry and stock departments. Here boys and girls alike shine. Here, too, the alums should be increased in number, and should be in money, as no r premium has the same value to the average boy or girl. tA suggestion in general for the improvement of the county fair is : that a man be selected by the State University to visit and instruct possible exhibitors; he could work in conjunction with the county srintendent of schools. As to the value of University training; two young men and one young woman, students of the School of Agriculture, selected the prize-winning products at a local produce show. The young men spent considerable time explaining the why and wherefore to visitors at the show. This was educational alike to the promoters of the show, the exhibitors, and all visitors. (Applause.) Mr. Jackson: I think there is not enough money paid, either by the counties or by the State, to interest the people in the right way; and I xpect to see the time that this State will be paying, in the agricultural epartment alone, $10,000 as premium money. I believe it. In Douglas county we use what time we need and all the money we get, which is be - ween three and four thousand dollars — four thousand, each yjear, and ere are a great many exhibitors in this building that have seen our air, and have seen what the Douglas county committee can do at the tate Fair, and what has done it, to a great extent, is by paying. You can't get anybody to work without paying. ti expect to see the time, and it won't be long, — I think within the next or three years, when the State Board will realize that, to hold the i that they have already got in the way of an agricultural exhibit, will have to pay more. I thank you. (Applause.) Mr. Kocher: In the matter of how to interest the school children in agricultural products and fairs, I would say this, that the fair and agri - cultural association is an educational problem, and there should be a head to It that Bhould govern the entire population of the State in regard to the matter; and I would like to see this head be the State University or the Agricultural Schools and the State Board of Agriculture, and organize every single school district into a district fair association, and have agri - culture taught in the schools. Let them hold the district fairs, and have the domestic science included; hold the little distriot fair; award some premiums there. Then, for the county, a county fair; either a county farm, that could be established by the county board and paid for, 160 acres or so, make it self-sustaining; or call it a county agricultural farm; put it under the management of the superintendent* of the State Board of Agriculture of the State Fair, so there would be a head to it; and each </seg>
            <seg id="p137">137 year meet there for a fair and exhibit of the product of that county; and from the county, or from there, take it to the State Fair, bo that it would be a continuation of the education from one end to the other. If you get the children interested in the home, the parents will help, and they can teach them and help them, and raise the stuff to take to the fair, and they would be just as much interested as the children them - selves; and in that manner there would be a chain from one end to the other; and I believe it would help the educational part, and help improve the fair. Mr. McLeod: I want to state a failure, in answer to that question. I made up my mind that I would try in our county to work in connection with the State Board with our children in our county. You know what your State Board is doing there. They give $50 at first for the best acre of corn. I took it up in our county, and told a man, I says, "They will give $25 for the best acre in this county, and let them compete in the State." He says, "Let me in on that." I went to some of the best men there, and made quite a little effort to interest the children along that line. We went at it; we tried to get the children of the county inter - ested; and we found one child in Stan ton county that was willing to go into that contest; and we dropped it. It was a failure. I want to ask this gentleman how to make it a success? He says, "you interest the chil - dren. You get them started." I want him to tell how to do it I want to know how it Is over there. He says, "Go ahead and do it." I will try to follow instructions if they are good. I Mr. Grinnell: I did nothing that you can't do in your own county, tells of a failure in his county. I will tell of a success up in Sarpy lty. The way this success was brought about was in the high school. Professor E. A. Hildebrand took hold and helped with the boys. The way he did it he got the seed from the State Board of Agriculture, and then sowed it next, went out with those boys in the spring, and told them how to raise this corn; and in the fall, the first year of the National Corn Exposition at Omaha, I had a Sarpy county exhibit up there of those boys' corn, and they made the senior exhibit look like fifteen cents beside theirs. They came down to the State Fair, and they competed every year, and have been winning ever since. This man seems to get success out of it by going right out with those boys, taking them out of the school rooms, and they aim to take an acre of ground and work it, and watch it the whole season through. And he does the same thing with the girls. And those boys and girls can be helped on with their corn. And some of the boys are down here with corn that went before the state as an agricul - tural state product. P!r. McLeod: You remain standing, please. I will ask you a question: he furnish the ground for them? Where does be take them to? Mr. Grinnell : The boys furnish this, mostly. He goes out and he takes the boys there; — for instance, one of these boys that has an acre which is in his charge is a land owner as his father is who lives in the town, and he has an acre out in the country that he runs. He took this boy out and </seg>
            <seg id="p138">IK rmOCBEDIN&lt;M NEBRASKA KTATK HOAIin OK AllRinXTl'RE had bis father give him one acre of ground to farm for himself; and the boy did it; and he did that with the other boys. In that way, it arouses more interest, it seems; and they are going to have that one acre all to themselves, you know, and use it to grow and to till and to make new improvements. tMr. HcLeod: You said "they." Do you mean "they" or "he"? You n the one with the one acre, or were there several interested in the acre? Who furnished that one acre? Mr. Orinnell: Each boy has an acre on his father's farm. Mr. McLeod: Are you going to have those all in one place, or do you have them scattered over the county? Mr. Grinnell: Scattered over the county. I Mr. McLeod: Then, they have to travel here and there, and all around county? Mr. Grinnell: Now, this particular exhibit came from one precinct, you may call it; and that was the territory included in the high school at - tendance around Gretna, Nebraska; not the whole county in general It was just the boys that you would look for surrounding any town, in the high school; took different boys and put them out on his farm. And, if a boy's father did not have a farm, he saw to it in some way that he did get an acre of ground to tend. And then he had cooking contests and sewing contests, I believe, between the girls. tMr. Odell: Another question while you are on your feet, Mr. Grinnell, se: This particular interest that began at Gretna, I think about five s ago, as I remember, has that spread to any extent, or not, beyond y county, outside of the immediate locality where it began? Mr. Grinnell: Well, yes; it has. At our farmers' institute that was held ten miles from this town, at our county seat, Papillion, I am the secretary of that organization. This year the farmers' institute offered a premium. They didn't give the premium — the county; and it seems those boys had carried on these experiments, and came on and got the premiums, and they captured them every year. So this year we offered an individual premium. I want to tell you that was the most attractive part of our county corn show and institute; and one of the boys from another part of the county won second; one of the Gretna boyB won first; and one of the boys at Chalco, Nebraska, won also. And this man went and helped in that. I told him how to work it up there. He went out and went around to the farmers, and then he took the fanners' sons, and he told the sons how to raise the crops. Then he went around to each farmer, and he got their statistics, got their corn crops they raised on the acre; and, when he came down to his corn show, the boys were in the lead at the top, and the fathers were following; those boys were teaching their fathers how to do it. One man at Gretna, Nebraska, through the influence of this son of his, has spent $3,000 in stock, hogs, and so forth, brought about by this boy's carrying on these experiments and showing his father what can be done, that he would not do otherwise if he hadn't </seg>
            <seg id="p139">t those experiments brought about by the man's teaching the boy, and arrying them on, and so on. ftfr. Jackson: This is a question the Fair managers ought to be In - ited in. But you can't do it all at once. Mr. Grinnell said he had OM that was willing to compete for these prizes. If he went on and let boy compete for a prize, and let him win any money, it might be pos - sible the next year he would have ten or twelve of them.' In Douglas county we do not have any trouble in getting the children to the fair, nor in getting them interested. Our opening day is what they call Children's Day, and we have, I will venture to say, 95 per cent of the school children there at the fair on that day. We offer $50 for precinct agricultural display, divided into three premiums; and we offer $30 for school district display, divided into three premiums; and our school work is agricultural display, — I mean to say, school district agriculture; and we have school work there; we have had enough there this year to halX fill this room. If we as fair managers are not interesting the young people, we are not doing the best with our county fairs. We this year took in the scoring; we offered $20 for the best score in hogs. We had a man there that gave us a lecture that was particularly interesting. We had about twenty that competed for these prizes, and I will venture to say that we have fifty of them next year. And we are going to take in the scoring of horses, too. There are two reasons why we ought to get young folks interested In this fair. One is, I think that they are the best advertising medium we have; there is no question about that. The week before our fair we get a ticket into every child's hands in the county; and they come on the first day, and they come every other day there, and they come in frequently on the first day; and they go and tell their parents. And I tell you, if you will give prizes, and stick to it — don't give up — for one thing it goes quite a little way to get this thing started. There's no trouble in getting the young folks interested in fairs; and, if you are not doing it, you are not getting the best out of your fair. Mr. Ream: My friend in the corner came close to hitting the right, chord when he touched upon the question of education in the school, and told you what the teachers did. You will find that there is a tremendous demand all over this State for agricultural education, especially that and domestic science in the rural schools as well as in the town schools. When you get agricultural education in the rural schools, so that the children know something about agriculture, understand something about the principles of agriculture, and know a little something about how Nature does her wonderful work, then they will know something about what constitutes a good exhibit, and what constitute* individuality in anything that grows out of the ground in the way of an agricultural ex - hibit. When they know something about that proposition, they will be - come interested in it, and it will be a great deal easier for you to get an exhibit in the county fair. </seg>
            <seg id="p140">EToaslmaster Cheney: We will now take up the next topic, "Should county (airs adopt a uniform system of entry blanks and classiflca - i in the premium list?" responded to by L. C. Lawson, of Clarke, Ne- Mr. La* son Mr. Toastmaster and Gentlemen: I realize that I have MM friends at my back, and I feel quite brave. (Laughter, and shouts of "Sure.") The question assigned me is one that I am not as familiar with at 1 should be to present it to this body at this time. I have been so interested in Nebraska Farmers' Congress and Rural Life Commission the past Bix months, that there has not been much else in my head, and I am liable to switch off one way or the other, and I will go in that route that my friend Jeffords spoke of — straight up; but I'll leave a mark and a hole in the wind as I leave. (Laughter.) "Should the county fairs adopt a uniform system of entry blanks and classifications in the premium list?" Yes, sir; they should. (A voice: "Settled!") There is no question about that there; there is no discus - sion; and at this late hour I hope there won't be any,— because I will decide it. (Laughter.) But then, what you do want in this County Fair Managers' Association is a uniformity of premium lists, management, classification, so that our judges and guests may go from one fair to another and profit by what they see, and adopt a uniform system. There is a large amount of money sent all over the United States for this work, that ought to be left in the State of Nebraska; and it can be done very easily by this association, if you proceeded to adopt a uniform system, and have it printed at home. I don't think there's anything further, only that, if you people can't work it out, apply to the Nebraska Farmer's Con - gress (laughter) or Rural Life Commission; we'll fix it for you. (Great laughter.) A Member: We will work it out. (A voice: "Second the motion.") Toastmaster Cheney: I rather guess that you think that question is settled. With these remarks on the subject, perhaps we would better pass to the next. I regret to announce that Mr. Gustafson, who was to have been here, is unable to, on account of a recent death in his family. We have the subject of "Booster Trips," that was discussed, you will remember, some last year, to the advantage of quite a number of us, I am sure. Will some (MM respond to the subject? Mr. Johnson: Mr. Haws is a good man for that. (Calls for Mr Haws.) Toastmaster Cheney: Yes; Haws tried it again. Mr. Haws: Gentlemen, I believe there is a conspiracy here some - where. I am wholly unprepared to say anything along these lines any more than my personal experience. I would answer the question by saying, "Yes; we tried it again," and with great deal better success than the first time. I am a firm believer in booster trips. I think it is the best advertiser any fair association can turn out. We went into it on. a larger scale this </seg>
            <seg id="p141">Ethan we did last year. We took with us a full band of eighteen i. We had a quartet of singers, and had plenty of whistles and horns to blow, and the boys to blow them. I want to tell you, when we got Into the different towns, we opened up; they knew we were there. (Laughter.) We also had our advertising brigade along with us. We not only entertained the people upon the streets of those towns, but we filled the town advertising the show; put up all the bills we could as we went along. We made three or four trips this year, costing in the neigh - borhood of $380, more or less, I think; and we considered it one of our very best advertisers. And, judging from what I have learned from other people that have tried similar things, they all agree with us that it is worth the money to spend. In some places they get the automobile donated. It Isn't a very ex - pensive proposition if you go at it right. It cost us nothing; all we had to pay for was our bands, and so forth. In some of the towns you have to pay some compensation for the automobiles. But I will say this; no matter what it costs you, it is worth the money, gentlemen. I thank you for your attention. (Applause.) Toastmaster Cheney: Any one else that had any new experience on that line? The next topic is "Aeroplanes at the County Fair." I regret very much that the speaker, W. F. Holcomb, of Clay Center, has also had Ei in his family or immediate relatives, and is unable to be here . Will some one respond to this subject? Those of you who have know what the result is from experience. Mr. Jackson: Mr. Toastmaster and gentlemen: I think I would hardly be any criterion to go by. They stole a kind of a march on our county in the way of flying machines. We employed about all the free attrac - tions that we thought we could afford, for they begin to get them around pretty thick at your fairs. We decided we would run in this aeroplane on them, and not say a word about it, until Thursday, and have it fly Fri - day. We realized we couldn't afford to pay the price that we would have to pay for the whole week, so we hired him for two flights on Friday for $700. We did not let the patrons of the fair know anything about it until Thursday, and we had the machine on the grounds; and then we boosted it all we could, over the 'phone, and in every way possible, to fly there on Friday. Well, I think it paid us all right He was to give us two flight* for $700. On Friday the wind was a little high and he didn't go up until late in the evening. So, on account of the rainy weather the first part of the fair, we decided to hold the fair over Saturday. And he was a nice fellow, all right. He could have gone up again Friday night. He went up once; he got turned around, and went right up again; and he was a good fellow, and he says, "No; I will not go off, if you are going to hold your fair; I will lie up here, and go up again tomorrow." Of course, he did that, all right; and so we think it paid us all right. But I mean that there were some around the county that thought it was a put-up job. Well, we are not in favor of it— or we aren't in the habit </seg>
            <seg id="p142">of doing anything of that kind; in fact, we always try to give them more tfcan we advertise, and have right along. We did not get all the patrons out on Saturday that we expected ; but it paid us well. This year, I think that those that got their machines up made a fair success of the aero - planes. I donbt whether they will be much of a drawing card next year. Mr. Jeffords: I think I can throw in a word here that might be of some use, if any of you contemplate getting an aeroplane. We had a little experience last fall In our county of Custer. The management advertised an aeroplane flight, and they did it in good faith. The man came sev - eral days before the fair, and he tried his machine around over the fair grounds, but he never got off the ground before the fair convened, and he didn't get off the ground during the fair; and it came near breaking our back. They thought it was a fake. They thought it was an ostrich trot. (Laughter.) A Member: I'm afraid they don't understand that Mr. Jeffords: I'll tell you so you can appreciate it. A few years ago the fair management advertised that there would be a trotting os - trich as an attraction. I was in the country at the time. The fact of the business is that there were some twenty years I absolutely stood from under the fair business. In the early organization of our fair asso - ciation, some thirty years ago, my fair enthusiasm was like Mark Twain's conscience; you probably read of it; he said that when he started out in life he started out with a conscience thirty-six feet high, and big in proportion, and he would match it against the world; but it began to droop and droop and droop, and he finally lost it altogether. That was the way with my enthusiasm; I had lost it all. I was out on the farm doing the beet I could to provide for the frau and kids. When I read the advertisement or the ostrich trot, it tickled my funny spot, and I accepted it as a fake; I didn't suppose anybody else would do anything else, but, as a matter of fact, they took it in earnest. We had a tremendous turnout there at that fair, and they all expected to see the ostrich trot! (Laugh - ter.) A Member: Did he trot? Mr. Jeffords: He did not trot. And we came to our fair last fall, and the aeroplane did not fly. You could hear it on all sides; they thought we were trotting out an ostrich. (Laughter.) Well, tlien, to set an aeroplane, of course, the fair management was up against it. Th«y had advertised this in good faith, and declared that the man that owned the aeroplane thought that it would be too windy, or one thing or another; but he could not give a good, legitimate excut&gt;e for not flying, bectuse be hadn't the nerve to fly; that was the only reason, 1 think. I thought we had a man there that would have bluffed, if he had been a man of nerve, and turned it loose; but he didn't. So we had to mak-i good, — or the man - agement did. I hadn't anything to do with the fair a rear ago but the management was good. I think that they had a successful fair financi - ally; but they had to squander 1750 to get a man to come there with an aeroplane that would fly and that would fly the machine. </seg>
            <seg id="p143">But you can understand that it was not satisfactory to the whole country, because there were a sreat number of people there came to that fair especially to see the aeroplane fly. As one man expressed it. an old gentleman whom I have known for thirty years, said, "I came to this country with oxen, and I have seen every mode oi locomotion; I waa going afoot and with ox team, have seen everything except the flying ma - chine," he says, "and I came down especially to this fair tj see that fly - ing machine." He lived twenty-five or thirty miles away from the fair grounds, and I do not know whether he got there to see him fly ; that was a little late, — three or four weeks later; it was quite short, of course; everybody was invited to come, and that there would be an aeroplane flight, and there was. I forgot his name; do you remember his name? (A voice: "Walsh.") Yes; and he could fly. BThe thing I wanted to say to you was this: if you arrange an aero - e flight and advertise it, you should be very careful to arrange with liable aeronaut who will do the business. If you don't, it will do you eat deal more harm that good. Mr. Purcell: I want to add a word to what Mr. Jeffords has said, that would probably be of interest here, in regard to the perplexity that our fair organization was up against with regard to this aeroplane plan. As he told you, the first one was a failure, and the management then got busy and contracted with a New York company and arranged for Dixon That was very widely advertised, was to take place two or three or four weeks after the fair. Before the time arrived (you will recall the fact) Dixon was killed last fall. That is the "bird man" who went over the Rockies, and, before his time to fly at Broken Bow arrived, he was killed. Then the second choice was Ely, and, strange as it may seem, the day was postponed, and, before Ely's time came to fly in Broken Bow, he was killed. We had the contract with Walsh, and there were a great many rumors afloat that Walsh would surely be killed before the time arrived; but he made good. Whilst I am on my feet I want to add another word, if it may be permitted, that it seems that the attraction — the strong attraction, — is one of the very important features of a county fair, and I tell you you can't get that too strong. If the fair board on that is a little over cautious (I know it has been so; that has been the case in our part of the State) I will say the experience with our fair has been that the amount of money we put into attractions, provided the attractions are properly advertised, has been the best money getter that we have had for the fair. We have made more money out of good, heavy expenditures for attractions than we have made out of the fair in other years. tMr. Mann: I think the disappointment in machines not flying in the ?r altitude is probably from the low altitude. Our experience at our this year is that we had a machine, the Curtiss, and we arrange with man that we pay him $500 a day, and he would make two flights a day three days; and with our high altitude there and our short grass, of •se, when he fell, our grass would not have saved him. (Laughter). </seg>
            <seg id="p144">But he made successful flights. I was down here at our State Fair when the machines flew here, and it was good; and this Curtiss machine up at our place flew on Thursday morning and on Thursday afternoon, and on Friday and on Friday afternoon — No; It was Wednesday. He was to give us two flights a day, and we would pay him $1,500. It was a big draw - ing card. During the time he was flying, I called on Mr. Leonard, who was there and saw it. We had the troops there, volunteer, the cavalry, and they were out on our quarter-stretch, going through the musical drill, and those troopers' horses were trained to the band, and the flying ma - chine over the top of them, and those troops right on our quarter-stretch before our amphitheater; it was a good sight. And the result was that our county fair there to which, of course, we had chartered trains, and it is only a little county fair, took in $5,900. (A voice: "Gee!") Our fly - ing machine paid us. Now, at this state fair in Wyoming they had a flying machine there, and with their altitude, it was kind of damp, and so forth and so on, the flying machine was not a good success there. With any attraction at a fair we want to be very careful in advertis - ing it that we get a machine like the Curtiss machine, or the Wright ma - chine; they are the best companies that I know of; and that Curtiss ma - chine gave us splendid flights. Didn't it, Hr. Leonard? Mr. Leonard: Tes, sir; I think it did; yes, sir Mr. Mann: Tes, it did; he kept flying backwards and forwards. Mr. Leonard: As good as we had anywhere. Pr. Mann: Tes; I was proud of it. Of course, it attracted and our fair a success. And on our cavalry horses we paid out prem - right there on the quarter-stretch. After the race went oft, there was a secretary; I signed the warrants and handed them over to the treasurer, and their money was paid right there. The reason we did that is this; because those men that were there — with Indians the same way — they take it and turn around and spend the money and have a good time. (Laughter, and renewed laughter.) Another thing I want to say while I am on my feet; we are taking our boys and girls on our premium list; the boys and girls have prem - iums offered to them, as well as the men's premium list. Of course, our boys have been educated In agriculture, and have been having agricul - ture, and becoming interested in the fair. In our school districts up there, we are used to kind of short courses, you see; we are hav - ing agriculture taught in our district schools. Our annual board meeting last Saturday appropriated so much to the new superintendent, so that she shall work at it in the schools in our district. And then our high school in Chadron, with Professor Wilson, I think his name is, has the handling of so much money. So that it goes through our fair asso - ciation, to get them Interested in taking hold of this work and taking it ■p. And that is the only way that we know of up there of getting this This year, just before our fair, a boy came to me and said, "Say, </seg>
            <seg id="p145">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AOKICULTTJRB Mi I've got some corn and pumpkins and squash I'm going to bring to the fair." I aaid, "Well, all right; you send it down, and let it go down to the State Fair." They came down here to the state fair, and that boy's squash took a premium here. I We have got our school exhibit in our building here. There was a ; girl (I think she is five years old) took a premium on that school bit; and three years ago we did not have any school exhibit for es county here. I was talking to Professor Wilson : I says, "Wilson, t's the matter we don't have an exhibit down at our State Fair, oar ol exhibit?" He took it up. We have had exhibits here ever since . They go back to our fair, and we pay the premium on the school bit there. I We ought to let the people know that we are trying to educate our i to take hold and exhibit, and, when they do take a premium, we the premium. And there is one thing in our county fairs, there is one g in our state fairs, — we are having agriculture, and our premiums paid on our agriculture; and at our county fairs we have agriculture we must not lose the agriculture, for we are still after agriculture. I We are having so many fairs now that It must be laid on our board of agers not to get other attractions so that the bulk of the money goes or flying machines or other attractions. It must be held into line, people must have confidence in it; it is just agriculture and agricul - 1 interests that we are working for, and on that education. I thank gentlemen. (Applause.) tMr. Hungerford: I hope I am not intruding; I am merely a guest of Mr. Mann's. Mr. Mann wanted me to come up and hear his ch. (Mr. Mann: "Now!") I heard it, and I am a little bit jealous, e at Crawford; Crawford, we claim, is the site of northwest Nebraska. Mann lives at Chadron. That is the county seat where we go down to &gt;usiness occasionally, when we have to. But we do' not have any ity fairs at Crawford; but we had a sort of a small blow-out, conslajt - of four days, and, if you came through one of them, you would say was enough. (Laughter). There's something doing all the time. tFive years ago, when I came to Crawford, I used to be in the news - ■ work, but I reformed. (Laughter.) I have had to renew a part le duties and come in as a member of the executive committee, and thrust the advertising end onto me. Well, I advertised all right; in the advertising, instead of saying, "One thousand guns at sunrise,' all that, I went on and said, "Get up early and at sunrise you wtl Buch and such flying machine doing the figure eight," and a cut was e of "Lovers' Leap;" those are two rocks on either Bide of Craw kWell, I didn't mean anything by it (laughter), further than just a ) take-off on the old time honored stunt of "One thousand guns at ise." But people thought we were going to have a flying machine. t was five years ago. But I tell you, it came back on me last sum- 10 </seg>

And we gave it out that we were going to have it; and we ad the money in the bank; the man had been there and closed with as; and it was just as fair as anything could be; and I meant it to be air. I was still doing the advertising stunt; and I meant it to be fair ith people at that time. Of course, I heralded it over the country, even Ivertised it In the big eastern dailies here of Lincoln and Omaha and ioux City, that Crawford was to have a flying machine, and they had etter come up and see it; and we did get some people to come up here rom the Omaha yards and the Sioux City yards, and came along all ri*ht I got a little bit nervous along a few days ahead of the fair. I told ie committee when they would meet with me, "I wish to the Lord that machine was on the ground." So they would say, "What's the matter ungerfordT What are you worrying for? That will be all right It will be here, you bet you." I said, "Well, honestly, I'll feel better when it ■ here. And I might just state here why I am up here making this speech to you, is that you all look good to me, and I don't want to see you get n any trouble, and I am just here to advise you to never advertise a ying machine, unless you are sure you are going to have it; because I came pretty near getting hung. (Laughter.) Well, juet the day before our blow-out was going to happen, the secre - tary and the rest of the bunch came upstairs and handed me a telegram. I read it; it said: "President Hungerford of the Quarter-Centennial As - sociation: Our train was wrecked in St. Louis. Impossible to nil the date." Well, I jumped about ten feet high. I felt all the time that there was something wrong. I commenced writing telegrams to every flying machine firm I had ever known of all over the country. The boys stood there and said, "What are you going to do?" I told them I had three or four days yet, and sat down, and braced up again to fill the date. When they saw it was going too far, they told me the telegram was a fake. Well, I felt better. After It was over in there, I told them, "By George, that may e true." And the next day it did come true; an honest telegram came they couldn't come. And everybody thought it was one of "Hunger - 's fakes." But we just telegraphed all over the country trying to get a flying machine. I tried, I think, every flying machine In existence the next day or so; and we couldn't get one; and I want to tell you that every one of that committee felt as though be was going to be hung. I k While the fair was a financial success, it was not a success, because committee felt as though they had advertised something and didn't ver the goods. </seg>
            <seg id="p147">PIf you are going to have a flying machine, advertise it, and advertise well; but don't advertise It If you are not going to have it; because It is dangerous. I believe I have learned something here tonight. I tell yon that in Crawford, when I get back and we again meet, or get back every year, we call a mass meeting four or five weeks before the July, and elect a committee; just substitute a newly elected committee, although I have served on it for five years; but I say we would not fall down, al - though we get together there to get up the county show in four or five weeks; but, if we had time, as you gentlemen have, and knew that we were to keep those officers, so that they could prepare ahead, it would make lots of difference. We would have time to get things together; and I believe that I am going to try to get our people to elect officers for two or three years, anyway, ahead; and we're going to show Chadron a few tricks. Speaking of receipts, though, we get together up there on this four or five weeks notice, and the lightest fair in four or five years has had $4,700 expenditure. Last year we spent $4,772; and we paid off a note, which I have hanging on my office wall now, with eighteen signatures of our business men, making up that $2,800, that had been running for about four or five years, which was to run eight years, — $2,800 and interest. We paid off the balance on that of $1,600 — $1,680, besides some money on our park, and putting up a show that cost us $4,772. And this thing was paid on four or five weeks' notice, and then not having a flying machine, too. But Chadron wouldn't turn out at all. People all hollered that it was a fake, you know; and they wouldn't any of them come up. I don't be - lieve even Mr. Mann came up there at all. I don't believe he showed up at all. But we ran it all right; and I merely say to you to be mighty careful — because you might get hung. I got out of it, but you may not. Thank you. (Laughter.) Toastmaster Cheney: Gentlemen, the next subject to be responded to is "County fairs in western Nebraska"; and we have with us tonight an old pioneer from the short grass country, who will respond to this toast, — W. Z. Taylor, of Culbertson, Hitchcock county. Mr. Taylor: Mr. Toastmaster and Gentlemen: It is getting late and I will not detain you more than a few minutes. I have found by in - quiry that our secretary placed me on the program for this subject "County fairs in western Nebraska." I asked him why he did that with - out consulting me, and he said, "Oh, I thought you were in California." (Laughter.) But he said I might talk two or three minutes, and so I believe that is just about what I will do. My friend at the right says it's about time to go to the show, and we are going, too. I haven't had very much encouragement to get up and speak; you can see that. I made a few notes along, but I haven't made any preparation for this talk. The first gentleman that spoke referred to management by the people, the management of the fairs by the people. I don't know that there is any particular difference between the fairs in western Ne- </seg>
            <seg id="p148">148 PROCEEDINGS N Ell K ASK A 8TATE BOAKD OK AUKICl LT1 KK braska 'and those you have in the eastern part, as far as that is con - cerned, — probably some; but I want to say it is all right for the people to manage the fairs; it is all right for the people to handle everything. I believe in that to a great extent, but I want to tell you that the success of a fair depends on the activity of the managers, or, rather, the manager, who is usually the secretary, not only of our county fairs, but our State Pairs. I was secretary of our county fair for about twenty years. I spent last fall on the Pacific Coast, and during my absence the managers ap - pointed a secretary to take my place, and they told me they had the best fair they have had in twenty years. (Laughter.) I wanted to know what the secret was; they didn't tell me just out, but they intimated that they had an active man for secretary. I believe that Is the great secret; get an active man for secretary. The management changed our old plans somewhat. When I am re - ferring to our fair at home I refer to other fairs in western Nebraska that I know of; but, when I speak of "our fair," I mean the Hitchcock county fair; but that includes other places. The management concluded they would adopt the plan laid down by the Dundy county fair in the ex - treme southwest corner of the State. I couldn't approve of that plan very well, but they did, and it seemed to be a success. Dundy holds the best fair of any county in southwestern Nebraska; it has been known for years to do that. They throw the bars down and let everything in. Talk about the Midways. (Laughter.) The State Fair, don't you know, wouldn't be a shadow! (Laughter.) So our managers did not stop that. It brought a lot of money into the treasury; but it look a lot of money out of the county, out of the pockets of the fair patrons; and I wouldn't like that very well; but, as Barnum says that the American people like to be humbugged, I believe they do, because nearly every one of them went away satisfied and thinks he got the worth of his money. The greatest problem with us in the western part is to make both ends meet financially. If we were to depend entirely upon the gate re - ceipts and the concessions to pay our premiums, we would hardly make it. We ship thousands of tons of beets from our section of the country to the Grand Island factory. The Grand Island factory offers 100 pounds o r sugar for the best carload of beets; 100 pounds for the best exhibits of beets at the fair; 50 pounds for the second best; and 25 for the third best, and so on. That settles that class. A certain manufacturer of fruit jars is selling fruit Jars, and offers a few cases of their fruit jars as premiums for canned fruit, and for jellies, and along that line. That settles that class. «A certain manufacturer of stock food offers a few cases of stock food be given for premiums. They get advertising for all this. We adver - tise it in our premium list, and advertise it at the fair. They furnish this stock food, we will say, and that will settle the premiums for the chicken show. The flour merchant offers flour for the best bread made from their </seg>
            <seg id="p149">flour, the best cake, and so on ; and that settles that part of it The Woman's Club takes care of the women's department. I want to say here, if you want to make a success of your fair, get the women interested in it; because, when a woman says a thing has got to go, it has got to go. (Laughter.) Now, that is my experience. (A Voice: "You're right.") (Another voice: "You're evidently a married man!") EMr Taylor: My mother was married; she was a woman. Then, at close of the fair we have some money to pay for our horse races, our k shows, and the other little matters that have been omitted; and particularly we put apart some money for the baseball. No country fair is complete without baseball every day. That is the case out west. Now, we get up against it sometimes, I should say, about the finance part; but we have managed always to pay out every dollar in premiums. We have no outstanding claims; nor do we discount; we don't do pro-rating; we pay it in full. If we don't do it, we do like Artemus Ward says, '"Live within your means, if you have to borrow money to do it" (Laughter.) And that is the way we have had to do a good many times, — borrow money to do it; but we make it up some way the next year. Oentlemen, I thank you. (Laughter.) Toastmaster Cheney: Are there any gentlemen here from the west end that will respond in the discussion of this? Well, gentlemen, I would like to say just a word, because I came from that section of the country. Our country has thirty acres close to the town for our county fair. We secured it by means of public-spirited citi - zens years ago. This year we celebrated our fifth anniversary as a fair organization. We followed the plan that Mr. Mann has suggested as to the races, of paying them every day right after the races. They didn't always turn out the money, however, as he indicated, that they made at his fair. As soon as the fair is over, the names of the winners are published in the weekly paper; it is a good advertisement, or we have found it so, and, as soon as possible after the fair is over, in fact, as soon as the doorkeeper counts the money that is coming to us, every dollar that is due for premiums is written up in warrants and mailed to the winners. In addition to that, we advertise in the papers that, if there is anything wrong with the amount which they have received in their warrants, call on the secretary, and have it made right. rthe time we hold our annual meeting, which is on the first Satur- December, we make an itemized statement of every dollar that out, whom it is paid to, what it is paid for, and when it was paid; and also an itemized statement of every dollar that was received, whom it was received from, and what it was received for. That is presented in full for the purpose of letting them all know where the money came from, and where the money went to. Immediately after the annual meeting and before that is published, this entire matter is referred to the auditing committee; the matter is checked over, and their report showing that the books and accounts are </seg>
            <seg id="p150">correct, is attached to the report of the treasurer and secretary, and pub - lished the following week. We use this method because we believe it gives the best results in disarming suspicion and securing united effort towards the fair for the following year. We believe that you can't afford not to pay the premiums in full, or to pay them promptly; and, as my brother has said here, if you haven't enough money to pay it, borrow it. It is the best advertise - ment we find that we can give to our county fair. (Applause.) Now, for the next subject, I am sorry to say, the speaker is not here. "How to handle fair works rapidly and cheaply." The gentleman from Minnesota who was to have responded to this is detained, because their meeting happens to conflict with ours. They are having their meeting there this week, and it is impossible for him to be here; and I do not know whether there is any one here who would be willing to take the matter up, or not. If there is, I am sure we would be very glad to hear from him. If not, gentlemen, I believe that ends this part of the pro - gram. "How to handle fair works rapidly and cheaply," — gentlemen, if (here is anything that interests the secretary in saving his work, it is certainly that subject. There are men that I have been talking with tonight who have been telling about keeping their clerks up until two or three o'clock in the morning, and getting their books ready for morning; and I have seen another man right here that said he had his ready inside of an hour, -and he would have his clerks work it. How is it with you? Are your books ready promptly? What system do you use? A Member: Where is the fellow? Toastmaster Cheney: Sitting right there, — Mr. Wilson Mr. Hervey: I am responsible for having this subject. I selected the subject, and selected the man, and had his acceptance to come here. He is an expert in handling fair blanks, entry cards, and entry system, and he would have been a very valuable man, without doubt in my mind, if we had had him here, but he is not here, and, therefore, we turn this matter over to Mr. Wilson, or any others, who wish to discuss it. kMr. Wilson: Mr. Toast master and Gentlemen: I am interested in subject because I am secretary of our fair, and, while I have worked a system, I am not sure that it is the best. I know It is much better i what we have had heretofore. As Mr. Taylor says, the secretary's office is perhaps one of the most important. I realize that it isn't the whole works or anything of that kind; but when the fair is over and you are closing up, if your secretary's office has not gone right, there is going to be some trouble somewhere, and one of the difficulties is to have that work not only right but done e'xpeditiously. We have a mighty good lot of fellows down there. The secre - tary doean't do all the work. To show you just how much interest they take in it; of our people, the chairman of our board of supervisors is with us here tonight; he is interested in this proposition. Three of our board of directors are here. One of them leaves his work and goes out </seg>
            <seg id="p151">Pi works with the fair boosters from the time he is elected until the year closed. Another one came down and spent a week at the fair. One of them looks after the good roads question, and he works. Another sold out his business so as to have time as president to run the county fair. (Laughter.) Well, that makes easy matters for the secretary; that makes eas matters; but they don't run the secretary's office, you understand. Th question is how to run the office to save just as much work as possible, want to tell you that the reason I am secretary is because I don't work any more than I can help. They do the work as far as possible; and have tried to eliminate all the work that there was in the office, and I hav gotten rid ol«et least a half and I don't know but two-thirds of it, in som ways. Just to start in the matter, I take our premium list: I have a few of them in my pocket (distributing some to the members). I didn't expect to talk on this but I want to show you what we do when compared with others. If any of you care to look over them, they are here. We will pass them. The first thing I want to direct your attention to in this work is this; If you will just turn to the premium list appearing there, and no - tice; take page 15, for instance, practically every item calls for inspec - tion, and that is all numbered here, and they are numbered consecutively with this exception; wherever a class ends, that ends the consecutive numbering, until the next class begins with the even hundred. For iiv stance, the horses, 101 is the first number there; the two right hand fig - ures are the numbers of the premium in the list; the left hand, the figure in the hundred column, or if it extends to thousands, is the class number. There is a reason for that, but I want you to notice the class 1 is 101t and so on, until that class is ended. When we come to the cattle class, we start with the number 200, Ml, 203, 204. When we finish with the cattle, we go to the classes of hogs £d sheep; we start with class 3, — 301, 302, and so on. We run through r classes that way. In addition to that, you will find in the back part of the book, I think in the most of them, at least, if not all, they have a blank sheet pasted in upon which exhibitors will make applications for entries. We insist that that entry shall be filled. That is for the protection of the office. You who have never used it, and those who have, will recollect that always some one will come back saying to the secretary, "You made a mistake." Sometimes the secretaries may make a mistake; but I want to say this, that, since I have used that, I have failed to find the first mistake that the secretary's' office has made in using the entry card. The mistake has always been by the exhibitors' not making the proper notation upon his entry blank. These blanks are brought in and filed. The clerks sitting at a table back away from them make the entries In the entry book from that blank, checking them off as they make them. When that has been done, when the entries have all been made, and the cards made out, that application blank is filed in alphabetical order, which also brings them </seg>
            <seg id="p152">In numerical order, Recording to the exhibitor's number; so that all we have to do is to go to our file and get them. It takes only at moment whenever we wish to refer to it. Now, we will leave the premium list for a moment, and go to the secretary's entry books. One of the troubles we have had, those of us who have used the old-fashioned entry book, is that they are a hard proposition to handle; they are such that only one clerk can work at them at a time; and, when you get your entries made, then you must check them by a clerk's book, and spend a few hours in making them up, before you can put them into the hands of your superintendents. We have eliminated that by using a loose-leaf system of entry blank. When I get my leaves which make one blank I have made two or three more temporary books; and I divide these classes up so that I have all the three or four books there to show the horses, cattle, hogs, and sheep classes through the books, and one clerk can be using that, and another one can be using another one, if it is necessary. The index is a separate proposition entirely. They all belong to one book, only one of them in use, but they use them separately, so that we can take them up and handle them expedltiously. Our pages that we have been using are the double leaf; they fold together just the same does (Indicating), and we slip a carbon sheet in between them, I we make our entries upon it. With this loose-leaf system we put it in the typewriter, and it is run off in typewriting. And I don't know how it is with most of yon, but sometimes writing is hard to read when it gets cold, but of course a person would help us out on that, but, by using the typewriter, if one is reasonably correct in his spelling, he would have a pretty fair print before him to read. It expedites the work of making up your books and getting your notations, and by using the carbon sheets. Just as soon as your last entry has been placed in your entry book, you are ready, then, to take the book apart, and you take out the original of the leaf. You take the horse department first, and put that in one book. Then we have a heavy board folder that when opened Is just wide enough to carry that leaf open, but it folds up bo that It is about six inches wide, and it can be slipped in the pocket. We lay those up there, and slip a rubber band around it, and pass those out to the superintendents; they make their returns and bring them back, and the clerks are ready to go to making up. Now, in addition to that, we make a statement of awards, and we make that in duplicate; it shows the name and the number of the ex - hibitor; we show every premium that he has received, whether it is first or second premium, with the amount and the footing at the bottom. We issue that to them, along with a warrant which is issued, and upon a duplicate which I keep I enter the number of the warrant. That is bo that they know what their awards are; and, if there is any kind of a mis - take, they bring it back, and we look it up. Now, in the matter of keeping things going on the premiums, we </seg>
            <seg id="p153">1'ltlic l:i:i)lN(JS NKIJKASKA STATK IIOAltl) UF AOKICLLTIKK 153 have our premiums. This is the second premium card. We have got a number ot them here, it any of you would like to look at them. (Showing cards.) Onu ot the difficulties we find in the premium business (in fact, all ot this work) is lo fix responsibility upon some one person. This pre - mium card, the present torui, 1 got out (or this reason: I found that every year some one was coming in and saying, "Here, 1 found this pre - mium card an my goods, and you haven't awarded me any premium for it." Well, how are you going to get around it? Premium cards will get misplaced. And I first started by requiring the superintendents to write their names upon them; that was my first year; that fixed the responsi - bility upon the superintendents, of a few. But then they came back and some one says, "Here, there was one that was changed in some depart - ment." So 1 went further, and 1 required the exhibitor's name to be placed on; also the premium list number. Now, it doesn't make any differ - ence where it is taken, then; that shows where it is placed; and if there are any mistakes, it is up to the superintendent to show why there was a mistake. The secretary has to draw his returns by his book. If the books and these cards do not correspond, then the superintendent is noti - fied, and we endeavor to straighten the matters out. 1 want to say to you that, while some of this looks as though it makes additional work, we have found that it expedites work. 1 was unfortunate enough to get hurt this year, just before the fair opened, and yet a boy less than seventeen years of age with two girls — three girls, carried on the office work a few days ago, in the history of our fair; all warrants were drawn and ready for signature before the fair closed. Before that, it had always been Saturday or Monday afterwards before the regular premiums were ready. It was money-saving, it was labor-saving, and it was satisfaction to our patrons. Now, that has been our experience. I don't know that we have the best system, but it is the best that I have been able to find. 1 would like to hear from some of the rest here upon their experience. Mr. Jackson: What do you do when you come to add? For instance: r embroidery department includes twenty-five minor things added to list, that you haven't got numbered, and not worked out? Mr. Wilson: We don't add them. Mr. Jackson: You can't add on different work, then? Mr. Wilson: Our aim is to so construct our premium list — I want to say to you I may be wrong on this, but I know one of the first things we have to get up is to get a premium list that will, as far as possible, cover the things that we can reach; and we are going to pay those premiums, and there is no use offering a'lot of premiums that you can't reach. Mr. Jackson wants to know regarding the embroidery department how are you going to reach the 100 minor things or the thousand minor things that we don't have listed. There is a general premium by which these things can be listed. Here are a dozen ladies come in with some embroidery; the fact that one makes a doily, and another makes some- </seg>
            <seg id="p154">thing else, is no reason why they cannot compete; let your general pre - mium cover the proposition. LMr. Jackson: One for the doily, and the other for the embroidery? you must get everything, and number everything? kMr. Wilson: I don't care whether it is a doily or a tablecloth; if it's roidery, it is embroidery; and, if it's a napkin, they do it with us; have got to educate them to it. * -» I want to tell you it's the education. Let me say to you this: The r*t proposition in making good citizenship when your boys and girls are growing up is that they recognize that there is parental authority, and that they live with you and not you with them. The first proposition hen the boy and girl go to school is to recognize that they go there as upils, and that there is authority back of it. The first proposition when an exhibitor goes to exhibit at a fair is to recognize the fact that these county fairs can not offer premiums at the State Fair does and cover the etail of every department; but they must reach things by their general iremiums, and they must come within the rule laid down. If you do not o that, 1 want to tell you you will have heartburnings and trouble, or ou will have bankruptcy before you. That is the way it strikes me. I Mr. Hervey: What is the objection to using discretionary premiums those who haven't named in your premium list? Mr. Wilson: You can do that. Mr. Hervey: Make that discretionary, if it can be provided within reasonable limits, and decide which is proper. Mr. Wilson: Yes. we do that. tMr. Hervey: Lay the proposition first before your board of managers, I they are at liberty to approve or not the discretionary premiums, as y wish. Mr. Wilson: Yes; we have it discretionary; but they were held down s closely as possible; because you will find this, — the more money you give, the more they are going to take. I remember one year we had a reat long list of apples, premiums — good premiums; we didn't have the ntire list of the horticultural world, but we had a good long list; and here were parties brought in, they made the entries under those; they have a list they made a lot of things where we hadn't listed, and there are many that way. You will notice the fact that we were offering a retnium five times as much as any one of the individual premiums for the best twenty plates of apples of any variety or varieties, and did not make an entry for it, and yet they had .a dozen discretionary entries there f apples. They would just as well learn to learn the rules. I want to tell you, the first proposition, in fact, is to learn to apply the money by rule. You can't get too much rule. I think, in running these county fairs, if we get too much system, we lose the spirit of the fair thought; but we have to draw the line somewhere; that is my idea. We can make that dis - cretionary premium just as high as we want to, as long as our profits </seg>
            <seg id="p155">making it go smoothly and handling it easily and rapidly because these discretionary premiums go in same as any other, and we handle them along the same line. Mr. Hervey: In the matter of horticulture, in the matter of an ex - hibit of apples, for instance, you may have a dozen different varieties of apples that are not named, or that you are not able to name, and- you don't want to throw those out. If the man makes a fine exhibit of ap - ples, and you don't know the name of it, and you haven't the name on your premium list, that should be recognized in the discretionary. Mr. Wilson: We do that, in any department. Mr. Hervey: The same in the textile department, there's good work coming up all the time; the ladies present new work. Mr. Wilson: We do that. Mr. Hervey: It is not known that in the premium list of last year or the year before last, there is a lot of valuable stuff, much more valuable than a lot of your old stuff that is in there, which we recognized. That is the way to handle every matter of that kind. Mr. Wilson: Just a minute on that: We might differ in this re - spect thus far; when we get ready to make up a premium list, I get in communication with our superintendent, and the ladies' department have a lady superintendent, and I ask them to find out from the ladies who are interested in those things what they would like to have recognized in that list. We revise these premiums, and in that way we make a good deal of that. I tell them, "Here, our means are limited; we can't offer premiums for everything that may be brought out, but go to them and find out what is new, what you want cut out of the old list, and what you want to put into the new list," and in this way we would reach a good deal of that. And yet, as the discretionary proposition, while we discourage it as much as possible, we do have discretionary premiums, of course, and, if they are worthy, they get a premium. That, however, is a matter for the superintendents and the judges to simply recommend, and that comes before the board for approval or rejection. Mr. Jeffords: What is the expense of your office? Mr. Wilson: The expense of the office? You mean for clerk hire? Mr. Jeffords: And your salary, and so on? Mr. Wilson: The fair association paid the secretary $50 a year; and we paid $2 a day for the necessary clerk hire. Mr Purcell: I have been interested in Mr Wilson's talk because I am very much interested in this line of fair work I inaugurated practi - cally the same thing with some minor changes in the Custer county fair quite a number of years ago; it worked very successfully, but not entirely along his line. I found this to be true: the secretary has a vast amount of work to do, a vast amount of overseeing to do. I divide the work into three departments, — the work of taking entries, into three department*. One embraces the live stock of various kinds; I think they had machin - ery with it. Another embraced the agricultural exhibits with farm prod- </seg>
            <seg id="p156">ucu, and one or two other close departments with it The other embraced all the features of the ladies' work. I put one clerk in charge of each department, for this reason: that the clerk in advance of the fair would make up the entry book, and make up the judges' book, and by the time the first day of the fair came, she was thoroughly familiar with the work. For instance, I would put a girl. a young lady, in charge of the ladies' department, and, for instance, school work; and a man in charge of the farm products; and another man, a young man, in charge of the stock. The result was that they were familiar with those departments and would take those entries so that we would get time for the judging books to go into the hands of the superintendent, and from him into the hands of the judges; they were all made up ready for the work. I never did any of that work myself, for the reason that the secre - tary has all he can do to look after the racing books, the taking in of the entry fees, and the looking after of concessions. Right along this line of doing this work quickly and cheaply I had the racing list bo arranged that, as soon as they would come from the race track, the races would be made up, and the premiums or prizes prorated, and warrants can be drawn at once. And when the fair closed every exhibit book of every kind would be complete without any confusion; and it is a very easy matter for the secretary to do this, and, honestly, it is one of the greatest features of fair work if it can be done rightly, and if these records can be kept up in shape. The main trouble usually comes in the discretionary part that was just referred to. They will bring in several articles, all pretty near the same thing; that occurs in the sewing work of various kinds, the ladies' department, as' they call it, with us. In most all of the years of the fair they paid the same premium, the board of directors paid the same pre - mium, on this discretionary department; and we find that it is really a benefit to the fair. If some one, especially if they live out in the coun - try, bring a few exhibits to our fair, and they don't get a premium, they may get a card of some kind down there, and, if they don't get a little warrant of some kind, they go away dissatisfied, and they talk about it; and there are few years we fail to pay a 25 or 50-cent premium, or such an amount as will be in accordance with the value of the exhibit. We find that it is really a great benefit to the fair, and one of the best adver - tisements that we can put out for the coming year. I think this is really a very important work for every agricultural society; and, if the secretaries, if the managers of the fairs, would see that that work was done rightly and accurately, I think it would be a great thing for that fair. I thank you. (Applause.) Mr. Riesen: For the benefit of these gentlemen here, I would say that this loose-leaf system that Mr. Wilson spoke of has been in use in our country for two years, and it can be had, as the System Company of Cincinnati furnishes these books, and you can divide them into as </seg>
            <seg id="p157">many books as you want to, three or four or five. If you want to have a premium list, for a small money consideration they write out your entry books, place the premium list into the entry books, and, as Mr. Wilson explained, the second leaf is the leaf that goes into the committee books for the judges. The System Company, of Cincinnati, will furnish these books, all you want, and as many divisions as you call for. Mr. Wilson: I got my supplies from the Office Supplies Company, I think, of Rochester, New York; I am not sure; I suppose it is about the same thing. In regard to what this gentleman from Broken Bow was saying about his clerks, this system, if he has got a reasonably* bright boy or girl from 16 to 17 years of age, that can not in 25 minutes master the intricacies of this, I wouldn't have him in the office; and, if they are employed on the premium list, if they can't learn to do all the work in fifteen min - utes, all the work of making entries from beginning to end and handling these books, I don't want them in the office. Mr. Purcell: I would like to say in answer to that that very much of it they can do. There is work they can not do. You will find in a great per cent of the exhibitors who come to your fair that they are not familiar with the premium list, — the exhibitors are not; they do not un - derstand how to make out this entry; and the more instructions you can give them, the better satisfied you will send them away. That is the reason that we put certain people in charge of certain departments, to give them a little assistance, and, where it is necessary, to tell them how to make out the blanks. Of course, they have to make out those blanks themselves, but, if you can give them a little assistance in that, it sends them away very much more satisfied. Mr. Wilson: I don't let the clerks do that. Under the plan, if they come for anything there, I give it to them myself, and let them go to work. I explain that. Mr. Purcell: There is a difference in the men doing the work. Mr. Jeffords: Make it out with the competent men. Mr. Wilson: No: I mean the president is there. I speak of the state proposition, when he was state secretary, and when he returns the book down there, they draw the warrants right away. If the American Trot - ting Association ever wake up long enough to get some new ideas into their heads, they will probably urge a loose-leaf system of keeping their books, and they will cut their work In that respect in two. We will have - just half as much work. There isn't any reason why the speed books of the American Trotting Association certainly cannot be sent out in loose - leaf form, so that, when the books are made up, by placing a carbon sheet in, they can both be made at the same time. There isn't any reason why any clerk in making the record of horse races can not make it in dupli - cate at the same time, and have it complete just as soon as he has fin - ished. He can have everything made up for you for reports, charges, ex - penses. </seg>
            <seg id="p158">all these people who are competent that no doubt would make it much lighter on the secretary. But for some years I have looked back on that work, and I tell you a fellow has got to have it to a system all the same when be does it. Mr. Wilson: You bet he does Mr. Hervey: Mr. Toastmaster and Gentlemen: It seems that the program is finished; and I thank our worthy toastmaster for the assist - ance that he has been to me in conducting this meeting tonight We have some business features here, the report ot the president, the report of the secretary-treasurer, and the election of officers. I am the only fellow with a message I intended to impose on you; but I am not going to do it. I will just state very briefly some of the things that we have been doing during the past year. We have sent out a number of typewritten letters; these letters were mailed out to the presidents and secretaries of agricultural societies, the county commissioners, superintendents ot schools, and so forth; wherever we thought that we could get something out that would be of advantage in advertising the state association of fair managers. We have sent a great many letters of inquiry besides those, and there was a period in the very dry season in the summer that we were getting letters stating, "We will not be able to hold a fair, owing to the fact that we have nothing to exhibit; and we are going to call a meeting and declare our fair off." Well, I made speeches, and we sent out a circular letter, insisting that they should not abandon their fair be - cause they couldn't grow some farm produce, that they had stock to ex - hibit, and they had social features, that were connected with a county fair, that they should maintain, and for different reasons, in order to keep and carry out the county fair, and in the fall hold their fair, at any rate. We received letters from some saying that they had taken the advice as to holding a fair. There were not as many fairs held this last year as usual; and it was owing to the fact that in some neighborhoods they felt as though they didn't have anything to hold a fair for, and were discouraged; but the falling off was not nearly as great as we had an - ticipated at one time. We kept sending out those letters of encourage - ment, and tried to keep the fair spirit where it ought to be; and our secretary has mailed out, prepared his latest history of fairs and dates, and mailed to the advertising agencies, free advertising agencies. They are glad to get this kind of stuff to advertise, and that has been pub - lished in a number of agricultural papers. The agricultural papers want this — want the names of the fair, and the date, and so on; that is all shown upon the program. There is quite a lot of other stuff here I might give you, but it is growing late, and we are asked to be at another place in a little while, aa soon as this meeting is over. There is a special request that an in - vitation be extended here to every person present to come up to the Governor's mansion. It doesn't make any difference if you don't get there </seg>
            <seg id="p159">until one o'clock. We are going to let this go for the president's report r, we will hear the report of the Secretary-treasurer. Mr. Smith, secretary-treasurer, read the following report: BORT OF THE SECRETARY-TREASURER OF THE NEBRA8KA ASSOCIATION OF FAIR MANAGERS, For the Year from January 18, 1911, to January 16, 1912 Receipts: January 18, 1911, balance on hand $ 53 95 Received since from 22 societies, $4 each 88 00 Received from sale of banquet tickets 17 50 Total receipts 156 46 Expenditure*: Paid for printing $ 18 26 Paid for postage 14 95 Paid for mailing circular letters 3 00 Expense of 1912 banquet 49 60 Total expenditures I 86 00 Balance on hand I 69 65 The report of the president has covered the work we have endeavored The minutes of the 1911 meeting were not priuted in pamphlet form because of their length, but they are to be found in the printed report of the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture. 1 would suggest, how- ever, that I believe it would be best to print the minutes separately and distribute them among all fair association officers, that they may see what is being done at our annual meetings. Respectfully submitted. WM. H. SMiTH, Secretary-Treasurer. Mr. Smith: I would say that the minutes of the meeting a year ago you find beginning with page 164 of the Annual Report of the Secretary of the State Board of Agriculture. For some reason, the report of the Secretary-Treasurer last year was omitted. It simply says the Secretary- Treasurer's report was read by Mr. Smith, but the report was not pub- lished. I don't know whether it was an oversight, or what it was; but I have a copy of it here, and I might simply add that it shows dues col- lected $86 and expenditures (52.55, I believe it is. </seg>
            <seg id="p160">1 would also call your attention to the fact that three years ago we held our first meeting here, and I believe there were about 40 or 50 per - sona, were there not? It was a sort of a supplemental affair to the State Board of Agriculture. A year ago we held our second annual meeting, and there were about 60 plates at the banquet. This year we figured that there was going to be about the same number, and requested the Com - mercial Club to prepare for 60 guests; but tonight, when they assembled, we had 80 present. So you Bee we have gradually grown in attendance each succeeding year, and we have about doubled in point of attendance since the first meeting was held three years ago. eould also state that I have now served as Secretary-Treasurer for : three years. This is purely an honorary position, for which I am grateful to you gentlemen. But I think that it is time that the e passed around, and if any of you gentlemen have somebody else to suggest for the place, you will not offend me in the least, and I will be glad to surrender the place to any one whom you may select, when it becomes the proper order of business. I thank you. President Hervey: We have the auditing committee's report. Mr. Smith: The auditing committee's report was attached to the sec retary's report.

Now, I would like to hear nominations for president and secretary. Mr. Haws: Mr. Chairman, It affords me much pleasure to place or to in - troduce in nomination a gentleman who is well known and has had a great deal of experience along this line of fair work, and a man that I know is willing to spend as much of his time for nothing as any man in the State of Nebraska; and that is the Honorable Mr. Lawson here. President Hervey: Mr. Lawson has been placed in nomination. Any other nominations? This is for president. Are there any other nominations? Mr. Lawson: There will have to be, Mr. President The Rural Life Commission and the Farmers' Congress tat j all my undivided time, and I can't give it. (Laughter.) President Hervey: His work was done very nicely. Mr. Lawson: I would like to please Mr. Haws very much; but he has promised me to be one of its board of managers this coming year, and now he wants to uuload me; and I won't stand for It. (Laughter.)

            <seg id="p163">KDIXUS NEBRASKA 8TATH HOARD OF AGRICULTURE 183 PMr. Rudge: We have not bad our committee together yet on these mmendations suggested by Mr. Ollis; but I was talking with two of i on that separately, and one of .them is of the opinion that we ought nt out saddle horses. Lot 11, on page 39; and the other man, I think, too, was of the opinion we ought to cut out both of them. The entries, two of those, are all the entries we have had the last year, and were ex - clusively horses from Lincoln, and they were horses that were brought down there to show on the forenoon that they were shown. They were not on exhibition during the week there. They would not bring them down there and put them on exhibition during the week, whether it would pay well or not. But they wanted to drive them down there and show them on the forenoon that we showed those two lots. I think there were only two double teams of drivers last year, at this last fair; and I don't know how many single drivers. Do you know how many single drivers we had? A Member: No. sir; I didn't have charge of that department. Mr. Ollis: I think there were two single drivers. Mr. Rudge: Do you know how many saddle horses we had? I think some of those drivers that were double showed in single, didn't they, Mr. Ollis? Mr. Ollis: Yes, sir. Vice- President Haws: Didn't some of them show saddle horses, as well? Mr. Ollis: I am not sure about that. I think, two years ago, there were two saddle horses shown, and I think only one last year; — I guess it was two. I know, a year ago last fall, in the showing of this class, they showed down in front of the grandstand: and I am sure that there weren't over ten people in sight besides the judges and those that had to show. And last fall there were just a few; so they didn't get the sup - port aside from what was shown. There were no exhibits on that occa - sion. You never know where these horses are at. Mr. Rudge: We would like to recommend that we cut out Lot 8, driving horses, and Lot 11, saddle horses; and we offer that as a motion that we cut out Lot 8 and Lot 11. Mr. Ollis: I move that the recommendation be adopted. Motion seconded. Vice-President Haws: You have heard the motion to cut out Lot 8 and Lot 11. which are driving horses and saddle horses. Are you ready for the question? "Question." Those in favor of the motion will signify by saying Aye. "Aye." Opposed, No. The Ayes have it. It is so ordered. Mr. Rudge: I think that is all. Secretary Mellor: Whenever we get our stock coliseum finished, we will have to put in those lots again, and put them in good and strong, so as to draw people from the outside, and give us a horse show. But, under the conditions that exist at the present time, we can't very well have a horse show in the pavilion until completed. There ia another thing I would like to ask the Revision Committee </seg>
            <seg id="p164">164 NG8 NKHKASKA 8TATK BOARD OK AGRICULTURE to consider: that is, here under the collective exhibits the wording was added; — I can't give the exact wording, but it was added in some way, that the Board of Managers are permitted to pay additional premiums if the exhibits are worth it; that is. when they fall below the minimum number in their respective divisions. I would think that it would be for the best interests of the exhibit to say that in no case shall the amount paid exceed one-half of the amount won by the lowest competitor. That completes this: something of that kind should be incorporated, I think. Because, if you don't, a lot of fellows will come here with exhibits and say, "O, we will get some - thing, anyhow." If you cut that down, and none of those fellows can get more than one-half that the lowest man that gets any could have. I think it will have a strong influence to make a good exhibit. I offer it as an amendment. I will get It worked up so that it will express that idea. Mr. McArdle: Supposing the low man has 400 points; suppose 400 points were the minimum, and the low man had 400 points; and the next man below the minimum had 398 or 399 points, — three points difference. Would it be fair to give that man one-half, with three points difference? Secretary Mellon Yes, sir. Mr. McArdle: Think so? Secretary Mellor: Yes, sir: he ought to get inside the 60 per cent, Mr. McArdle: I would think it would be better to leave it to the judgment of the judges and managers. Secretary Mellor: It is all printed right in the list. Mr. McArdle: All right, then Secretary Mellor: It should be printed in the premium list, and the money awarded by the Board of Managers if they deem it worthy. Mr. Rudge: Not to exceed half the lowest Secretary Mellor: It is in the list of premiums received by those race— aful in competition. V ice-President Haws: You offer that as an amendment? Secretary Mellor: Yes, sir. A Member: I second the motion. Vice-President Haws: Gentlemen, you have heard the motion. Any remarks? Those in favor of the motion manifest by saying Aye. "Aye." Those opposed, No. The Ayes have it. It is so ordered. Is there anything else on the premium list? re have with us a gentleman who represents some photographer in y. He has a proposition that he wants to put up to you. You will to him. The Photographer: This is a good thing; you would like to have a photograph made of your entire body here, similar to this (exhibiting photograph.) This is a circular picture that we take, and can take it any sice and any length. If you would like to have one made, we can make it either now or at the close of your session at noon. If we make it now. this morning, we could have the proof of the photograph ready, so that </seg>
            <seg id="p165">you could see It at the close of your session today at noon; and. If you care for a copy, we would be glad to furnish it to you. The price of it would be one dollar. You are not obligated in any way to take it, unless you care to, after you see the print. We could make it now; it would re - quire perhaps a minute of your time after you get outdoors. We couldn't make it in the house. We would not detain you longer in getting out and back, I would say, than five or ten minutes at the most. We could make it now, and have the picture ready so that you could see the print at the close of your morning session. If you just would get together now, you have the time, and you could see it before you adjourn. Vice-President Haws: Gentlemen, you have heard the proposition. What will you do with it? It's up to you gentlemen to say whether you Ct this picture, or do not The chair will entertain a motion, if you t to make one. The Photographer: It doesn't in any way obligate you to take the picture. Vice-President Haws: The gentleman says you needn't buy a pic - ture unless you want to. If there is no motion, we will pass the question. ■ Johnson: I move you those who wish to be in the picture have immediately after the session, if they wish to. Motion seconded. E ice- President Haws: It has been moved and seconded that those ng the picture taken may meet immediately after this meeting, desiring to have pictures taken stand up, please. bThe Photographer: How would it be to have an appointment made eet at the close of this meeting? E Wee-President Haws: I don't think they want a picture taken. We some pictures taken last fall on the fair grounds. (Laughter.) We never "been able to discover what was the matter with the lens. (Laughter.) There was something the matter. A Member: The lens caused it. Vice-President Haws: I think that matter is cleared up. (Laugh - ter.) The picture business of the State Board of Agriculture is a kind of a joke. Perhaps you were not conversant with that proposition? Photographer: Let's try one at the close of the meeting. We would like to have all of you at the close of the meeting. Secretary Mellor: I wish to state to you that I had a 'phone call from Mr. C. H. Gustafson, a member of the Board, in which he said it was impossible for him to attend this meeting, and he regretted the fact very much; but there had been a death in the family yesterday morning, and he had stayed home on that account. Therefore, I would ask that Mr. Gustafson be excused. Motion seconded. Vice-President Haws: You have heard the motion that Mr. Gustaf - son be excused.

Mr. McLeod: If there is nothing more in regard to the premium list, I have another matter I would like to bring up. Vice-President Haws: Wait a minute: you want to make a motion? Mr. Rudge: I make a motion that this report of the Premium I.i.-t Committee be received and adopted, and the Committee discharge -.1. Mo - tion seconded.

Those in favor of the motion manifest by saying 1 Aye. "Aye." Those opposed, No. The Ayes have it. It is bo ordered. Mr. McLeod: I just wish to state that the people out west in Ne - braska have become quite progressive, and the Farmers' Grain and Live Stock Association, the Nebraska Farmers' Congress, ani the Nebraska County Life Congress, held meetings the other day in Omaha and adopted certain resolutions. They would like to have those resolutions endorsed by the various organizations of the State, if possible. Those resolutions are being presented to you here; you can see them. It is not necessary to take up your time to read them; the headings of the resolutions being "speculative investments," "parcels post," "the rural school," "the high school, " and "the University." I think every one of you is interested in the schools of this laud, and, that being the case, I will move that this body endorse these resolutions. Vice-President Haws: Let me say: I would like to have the resolu - tions read in full; I think every member ought to know exactly. Some ry have noticed the same question. For myself. I am not familiar wi.u although I have a copy. L Secretary Mellor: There may be some of these things you wouldn't t to endorse. We haven't time to discuss these questions. "Blue sky," we are all in favor of that. We would like to cut out all these "Blue Sky" deals; no doubt about that. There's a whole lot of things that need careful consideration, if we want to take up the time to present and give them the consideration that should be given. Mr. McLeod: I don't think that we care to spend a great deal of time. That is my reason for just making the motion, allowing the parties here to look at it, and, on making that motion, if it receives a second, it can be brought to a vote after a while, without discussion. Would that be satisfactory? A roice: "Sure. Secretary Mellor: That is not doing the fair thing to the State Board of Agriculture, or the Farmers' Life Commission, tither. If you are go - ing to give that your support, you want to give it to them; and, if you are not, you don't want to do it. It is a question of policy, which is the best thing to do, especially as to some of these things that are advocated. Mr. McLeod: As to the "blue sky" we are all opposed to it. As to education In the rural school, we are in favor of it. I think we are in </seg>
            <seg id="p167">favor of high school education. And we are also in favor of doing all the good we can to the University and State Farm, — every one of us. As to the parcels post there might be a difference of opinion; but, as a farmer, I am in favor of the parcels post, and I can't see where the parcels post Isn't right, — while it may be a question in the State of Ne - braska. For the rest, I can't see why we shouldn't endorse the whole thing. It would not take long. But I do not want to take time to discuss it, and I do not wish to do anything in regard to it which would delay our busi - ness. Secretary Mellor: I think the parcels post is a question of "deep water." We have absolutely two lines of demarkation on parcels post. I know there is quite a pronounced opinion of those that don't believe in parcels poet; and I do not like to have that discussed here, to tome up here, as a fight may be made against it. Every merchant in the country is against it. Mr. McLeod: The farmers are for it. Secretary Mellor: That is true: Do we want to get into a scrap here over a political issue? Mr. McLeod: Personally, I would be willing to cut out the parcels post. If there is any serious objection, we do not want to get into a dis - cussion. I haven't any present intention at this time of getting into a scrap over this matter. Mr. Lawson: In connection here, it is true that no class of people has taken this parcels post matter under more consideration than your farmers, as a rule; and, as it has been suggested to cut that out, it is right and proper that it should be eliminated; but, as a matter of fact, your Farmers' Congress and your Rural Life Commission have been bo hind, and are, and will stay, behind the State Board or Agriculture. The various state organizations of breeders and producers are behind this movement. It was threshed out for three or four days in Omaha, and given general discussion, and they were considered a very conservative set of resolutions, and were endorsed by the best of our representatives, along the lines at improved conditions of agriculture; and your Rural Life Commission and your Farmers' Congress want to get some assist - ance from the State Board of 4 Agriculture, because they have been affil - iated in getting matters of vital importance to the State Board. The State Board is considered by farmers the leading association in the State. We are making this request, and don't care to take up your time or discuss it any further. They saw fit to have these resolutions printed, and we want everybody to read them. It has been published in the daily papers. It is approved by Chancellor Avery and the better educators of the state universities. This is the time to look into it. Mr. Banning: These resolutions here you are speaking of covet quite a territory of ground, and there will be sides to this, pro and con, as to the disposition of the parcels post, and it is a big question; and it is a question that is the least thoroughly understood of any question before </seg>
            <seg id="p168">the public today. And I for one am opposed to taking up this matter and going into it, because it is going to bring up a lot of discussion on ail branches of this question. I see nothing else in here but what looks to me all right. Vice-President Haws: Did you move? — is there a motion to adopt this? Secretary Mellor: Yes. »Mr. Banning: I move as an amendment to that that we endorse all rest of the resolutions there except parcels post. Motion seconded. Mr. McLeod: I am willing to accept that amendment as far as I am personally concerned, with the consent of my second. Mr. Graff: Mr. Chairman and Gentlemen: I am opposed to this mo - tion in cutting out this parcels post proposition. We as a State Board •Agriculture ought to, at a meeting like this, have and show the cour - ; of our convictions. There is no doubt that there is more or less con - versy over this proposition of the parcels post; but I want to say to you gentlemen that this country is going to adopt it; it's coming. I do not think we ought to be afraid to go on record in this body in favor of a proposition that is antagonistic to a certain business element of this BUte. I think that perhaps by the business men it is as poorly understood as by the farmer, if not much more so. I believe that this body of meu constituting the State Board of Agriculture ought to have the courage of its conviction, and go upon record, and not cut out something that would be antagonistic to the retailers of this State. The retail business associations do not ask us — they do not consult us in anything that might be antagonistic to us in their resolutions and propositions and the things that come up in their bodies at their meetings that they decide upon. I for one am in favor of going upon record on this proposition, and I would be very sorry indeed to see this particular feature cut out of that by us. A Member: Cut it all out, then, and not get Into it Another Member: That is what I say. We have plenty of business of our own. Mr. Banning: I move you as a substitute amendment to the motion that this motion be laid on the table. Motion seconded. Vice-President Haws: It has been moved and seconded as a sub - stitute motion that this question be laid upon the table. Are there any remarks? "Question." Those in favor of the motion will signify by saying Aye. "Aye." Contrary, No. "No." The ayes have it. A Member: Three of us said "No." Vice- President Haws: Three of you said "No." Yes, I heard that. What is your further pleasure? Mr. Smith: In Custer county we have fairs held every year. I am president of the fair in Calloway. We have a couple of men from Broken </seg>
            <seg id="p169">169 Bow. I came down to you to see "where we are at," and to Bee if the county fair is entitled to some aid from the State. And I was sent down here, and I want to find "where we are at," whether we are entitled to anything, or whether legislation in the near future would be anything along that line, and would help these district fairs. Custer county is quite a large county. We started in before the hard times, had several fairs, and they were dropped five years ago. The last five years they put up good exhibits there every year — paid our premiums. I think I am safe in saying that the condition of live stock breeding has Improved 50 per cent the last five years, mostly over the county fair exhibits we got every fall. We had a poor showing to start with, but it has been improving right along. Mr. Purcell and others have been over there, and know what they are doing. We will have our secretary answer r question for you; ha is more familiar with the law upon that ques- This thing Is a law proposition, as I understand it. Secretary Mellor: My understanding is that the State Board of Agriculture recognizes one county fair in the county. That has been the custom heretofore. I am not clear as to its being a statutory provision or not. A Member: It is. Secretary Mellor: I think it is. Mr. Smith: We do not claim to be a county: we are a district. ■ Secretary Mellor: That is the only organization we are authorized recognize. A Member: There is only one county fair in a county. Another Member: Can't be but one. Secretary Mellor: We are not in a position to recognize anything outside of what the statute gives us the privilege of doing. tMr. Purcell: I do not think there is any question but that the retary's attitude or ruling on that is correct. I think this was done, and I talked with Mr. Smith in regard to it at the time of their fair; and that is what was the matter, that the county aid was divided in some way. I told him that I would be very glad to cooperate along that line and help in that matter. I think that is a question, possibly, of either the Board of Supervisors of the county, or else of the county fair manage - ment itself, and I rather think that that matter can be brought about satisfactorily to both parties, to both fairs, and a division of this money arranged for. The amount of money that the Custer county fair gets is quite heavy. I don't recall just what it was this year, something like $800, and I think that can be taken care of very nicely, and I think, In justice, it should be done. Mr. Roberts: This same question for the last twenty years has been coming up every few years where there are two organizations claiming to be two county fairs organized in the same county; and the statute is very plain in regard to that. We have no right at all to make any suggestions or any rulings in regard to the division of the money. That would be entirely a matter with the 'county commissioners of the </seg>
            <seg id="p170">county in which these associations are organized; and, under the pro - visions of the law, that is only available to the county association that is recognized by the State Board of Agriculture, and that is the associa - tion that has the prior right by date of organization. And they can hold that organization until they cease for two years consecutively in holding a fair In the county. That is the only way that that association could get the advantage of the first organized association in the county. As long as that association holds a fair, If consecutively they cease for two years, then you can step in and make your plea with your county commissioners and get your appropriation. 1 would say to these gentle - men who came here, we have got a place in Nebraska for these Nebraska farmers — the Nebraska Fair Managers' Association — who can come in there on an equality with any other county fair in the State. (Mr. Cheney: I do not want it to be understood that we are trying do anything against the Broken Bow fair, because they put up a good r; they know I am in favor of everything about it. I believe we ought to be laborers together. Broken Bow fair can help us considerably, and we can held them. There's room enough for more fairs than we have Kesent. These fairs are one of the best things that can happen in ■rn Nebraska. Mr. Rudge: No doubt that the State Board of Agriculture would like to be able to help any fair, whether county or private. The only way I can see for the Broken Bow situation is for you fellows to get together and divide your county. You have got lots of land, — a fine, magnificent county, all right. Get together amongst yourselves. Vice-President Haws: Is there any other business? If not, the next thing in order will be the election of officers. Mr. Rudge: I move that the President appoint two tellers, Mr. Keedle: The Credential Committee was not discharged y ester- Mr. Rudge: "That's right Vice-President Haws: That is right. We will now hear the final report of the Committee on Credentials. KMr. Youngers: There has been but one addition yesterday, and . Gusutfson sent that in this morning. If you want it read, we will read it. I don't suppose it is necessary; but there is only one addition, and that was added this morning; and here's your credentials, the list of them and list of delegates. (See list at opening of meeting.) A Member: I move that we accept the report of the committee, and that the committee be discharged. Vice-President Haws: It has been moved and seconded that the report of the Committee on Credentials be accepted, and the commit - tee discharged. Are you ready for the question? "Question." Those in favor of the motion will signify by saying Aye. "Aye." Those op - posed, No. The Ayes have it. It is so ordered. Now, Mr. Rudge, we will entertain your motion. Mr. Kudge: I move that the President appoint two tellers. </seg>
            <seg id="p171">Motion seconded. Vice-President Haws: It has been moved and seconded that the chair appoint two tellers. Those in favor of the motion manifest by saying Aye. "Aye." Opposed, No. The Ayes have it. The chair will appoint Mr. Wilson, of Geneva, and Mr. Jackson, from Nuckolls county. Secretary Mellor: Here are the ballots. We will pass them around. Vice-President Haws: When you get ready to vote the Secretary will call the roll, and as your names are called, you will rise and de - posit the ballot in the hat. Those having two votes, the names will be called twice; but you will put only one ballot at a time in the hat. Those that , have two votes will have a chance to vote again. If you are all ready now, we will commence. There are some members here that have a right to vote twice. We are going to call the names, and you will deposit one ballot in the hat; after which we will call the names of those that are entitled to a second vote. Do you understand? And then you will deposit the second vote. That comes about by some of the members of the State Board being presidents of county agricultural societies. You understand that, of course? s Mr. Howe: On what ground do you base it that some men have two votes? I don't understand. Vice-President Haws: I just stated that some of the members of the State Board, which consists of so many members, are also presi - dents of county organizations. Don't you see? Mr. Howe: Yes Vice-President Haws: And they have a vote as a member of the State Board and a vote as president. Mr. Howe: Why should they have two votes? Vice-president Haws: The law gives it to them. Mr. Howe: Two votes. Yes. Well, that is simply your authority? Vice-President Haws: Well, hardly. Mr. Rudge: They have one vote, and then the vote as president of an agricultural society. Mr. Howe: I don't believe in any man having more than one vote; I don't care who he is. Mr. Rudge: One vote he represents the county, — one vote as presi - dent of the agricultural society; the other vote because he is a member of the State Board of Agriculture. A Member: In other words, he votes in two organizations. Mr. Rudge: There are only about three or four in the house. Mr. Howe: That may be; but I'm getting right back to the peo- ple. Vice-President Haws: Well, he is a representative of the people, sent here to represent us — two organizations — thRt is all the difference. Mr Howe* I don't think so </seg>
            <seg id="p172">r Vice-Pregldent Haws: Well, it is Just a difference of opinion; that ail. Mr. Howe: Difference of opinion. I don't believe the president of a society, because he is a member of the State Board of Agriculture, should have two votes over any other man; that is my opinion about it. I believe in getting back to the people on the direct primary plan, in any of our elections. Nobody has a right to two ballots. We have a direct primary plan here, I see, and in our regular elections nobody sets two of them; he goes in and votes one, no matter who he is. I think that is the way it ought to be here, to be fair. Mr. Hervey: This trouble Mr. Howe is laboring under is seemingly the appearance of a man's having two votes, or representing another person here. Of course, the president of an agricultural society has his vote; and if he happens to be a member of the State Board of Agriculture, he votes for his county president, and he votes for his membership as a member of the State Board of Agriculture. The only way we could change that would be back at home, where the agricul - tural society, delegates that voted two, must go and get another fellow and send him here. I think that would be a pretty good plan; and we would have a bigger crowd. A Member: You bet you, if they want two votes, let them send two men. P;e-President Haws: Are you all ready now to vote? Member: You bet Vice- President Haws: The Secretary will please call the roll The Secretary called the roll. Mr. Cheney: I think Mr. Caley has two votes. Vice- President Haws: I was going to ask the question, if you had all voted. Mr. Caley is a member of the Board. Secretary Mel lor: He has not sent us his credentials is the rea- A Member: They are here. Secretary Mellon Where are they? Member: Mr. Caley handed me them. Secretary Mellor: And they are not in the list; that's the trouble. Vice- President Haws: Did you vote, Mr. Caley? Mr. Caley: Yes; I voted twice. Vice- President Haws: Is there anybody else who has not voted? A Member: No stuffing the ballot box! Vice-President Haws: No — we're all republicans! Secretary Mellor: Sounds well from a democratic chairman! Vice-President Haws: While they are counting the balloU, have you anything? Mr. Hall: I move that the Secretary writes the names of those candidates upon the blackboard, and as the tellers call off the names, pot them up on the board, so that we **•» all see them. Divide the * board into two divisions. </seg>
            <seg id="p173">Vice-Pregident Haws: I don't think it will take a motion; Mr. Mellor will do that Secretary Mellor: I would rather have it on a piece of paper (or record. I would as soon do it, if you wait until I write them; got to get a piece of chalk to do it. Mr. Rudge: It is suggested to get the cash to pay your expenses and railroad fare. If you will come up here, and not too many at a time, we will try to take care of you. (The result of the vote was announced.) Mr. McArdle: In the vote in the second there were two vote* in Douglas where it is impossible to have more than one, — one vote for Grau, and one vote for a gentlemen from South Omaha. Secretary Mellor: We didn't notice it. Mr. McArdie: Can't vote for two men in second district. Mr. Wilson: Vote for two; it's too late. Secretary Mellor: It is a question whether two of them might tie, or two of them be elected; those two would have to be voted over again; that's all; it Is a lawful ballot. Secretary Mellor: In the first district, the majority of votea was secured by Foster, Banning, and Arnold. In the second district, majority of votes was secured by Taylor. In the third" district, majority of votes was secured by R. M Wolcott and Joseph Roberts. In the fourth district, by George F. Dickman, Danielson, and Young erg. In the fifth district, by James E. Ryan. In the sixth district, by Charles Mann, E. R. Purcell, W. R. Mel - lor, and J. T. Leftwich. Twenty-five votes for Sass, which lacks one of being a majority. Vice- President Haws: You will have to take another ballot that. Secretary Mellor: Take another ballot for the second district. Vice- President Haws: It becomes necessary to take another ballot for the second district. There is one elected. You have to decide be - tween the highest two candidates. Secretary Mellor: Mr. Taylor is elected, so you don't have to vote for Taylor; but you have to vote for one of the others. Mr. Youngers: Hasn't Douglas county now got in this election all that they are entitled to? Secretary Mellor: Yes; that eliminates Grau. Mr. Rudge: That eliminates Grau and eliminates Buckingham. Secretary: Yes; it is between Sass and Russell now. The result of first vote was as follows. For membership on State Board of Agriculture, at election, January 17. 1912. </seg>

(Calls for Mr. Haws.) Chairman Roberts: Mr. I. W. Haws, gentlemen, your next presi - dent. I have the pleasure of introducing. (Applause.) Mr. Haws (taking the chair, and responding): I certainly appre - ciate the favor you have conferred upon me. I am sorry to say I am no speech-maker; I wish I were. And I am not much of a story teller: I wish I were a good story teller. But I presume I can illustrate about how I feel by telling a story. I am placed in about the same position as the two negro preachers were. Two negro preachers got together one day, and were discussing how they would prepare their sermons for Sunday. One preacher said, "I select my text on Monday, and on Tuesday and Wednesday I lay it out in three sections. I follow one section en the Thursday; I follow one section on the Friday; and one on the Saturday; and on Sunday I give it to them." Brother Smith BayB to Brother Jones: "I don't think you're following out the right policy; you lay yourself open to the influence of the devil too much. You let yourself go on, and that gives the devil the whole week to work on you." He says, "I tell you. Brother Smith, how I select my sermon. I walk up into the pulpit on Sunday morning; I open the Book; the first verse my eyes strike upon, that am my text for my sermon. The devil don't know what I am going to say, because I don't know myself what I am going to say." (Laughter.) I think that illustrates my position — I don't know what I am going to say. Gentlemen, I want to say to you that ever since I have been connected with the State Board of Agriculture, it has been a pleasure, and as years have gone on and on. it had still been a greater pleasure. I have endeavored all these years to do the best I can, taking my posi - tion that was given me and saying nothing; and I am doing that now, — saying nothing. (Laughter.) </seg>
            <seg id="p176">El will be my endeavor in the future to so conduct myself and to manage the affairs of the State Board of Agriculture, for I realise man cannot do it all, in such a way that I will not betray the trust lave imposed upon me today. I thank you, gentlemen. (Applause.) The next in order will be the nominations for First Vice-President. Mr. McLeod: In behalf of the third district, I would like to present the name of Mr. Joseph Roberts, for First Vice-President. Seconded. L President Haws: Mr. Roberts is nominated.

(Ap - plause.) (Call for Mr. Roberts.) Mr. Roberts is called for. Mr. Roberts: Gentlemen, I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this honor. That is all I have to say. President Haws: You ought to see the negro preacher, too. (Laugh - tar.) I wouldn't say that, but I know, Joe! Mr. Roberts: I might add, if I had a copy of the minutes of the proceedings of the meeting that Mr. Haws was president of last night, I could tell a story. (Laughter.)

I do want to say, gentlemen, I certainly appreciate the honor you have bestowed upon me, and I do feel that it is an honor. I think, and I know I can say without any fear of contradiction by any member here, or any member absent, for that matter, that I never have asked for any position on the Board of any kind. Since I have been a member of the State Board of Agriculture, I have tried to do what I could in my weak way for the best interests of the Board; and I have been honored by the Board and I certainly do appreciate it. Gentlemen, I want to thank you, every one of you, for your faith and confidence. (Applause.) President Haws: The next is the election of a Secretary. Mr. Youngers: Mr. President. I desire to place in nomination the present incumbent, whom we all know, a man who stands high in the counsels of any land and of the state, being called for to go to the Chicago Fair Association, representing the United States. Mr. Mellor is the peer of any of them, and I desire to place him in nomination for Secretary. (Applause.) President Haws: I second the nomination — I want to get in here somewhere. Mr. Cheney: I move that the rules be suspended and Mr. Mellor be declared the unanimous choice, and that the President cast the rote therefor.

If you had been at Chicago i us you would have seen Mr. Youngers' efforts in drawing up the letti! (Laughter.) You would understand why he feels so good about Chicago! Gentlemen, really I do appreciate the honor you hare bestowed upon me; and I have endeavored to do my duty, in my weak way, as I saw it; and, of course, I have made mistakes, just as all the rest of us make mistakes. I have endeavored to give you my best services; and I hope that as long as you are satisfied, I really should be satisfied with the posi- tion. I do not know that I care to make any speech to you, because I already "talked my head off" yesterday; so I will thank you for the honor, and be seated. (Applause.) President Haws: The next will be the election of our Treasurer. Nominations? ■ </seg>

Mr. McArdle is the story teller of the crowd! (More laughter.) He wears the belt this morning. I thank you gentlemen for the honor. I will try and do my duty as I see it. (Applause.) Mr. Rudge: We have a gentleman here with us this morning whom I have asked to rome in and say a few words to us, a gentleman whom I think you all know, and it is unnecessary for me to introduce him. I will ask Dean Burnett if he will say a few words to us this morning. Dean Burnett: Gentlemen, I am very much pleased indeed to meet you and to have you out here with us at the Farm, and I should be happy to have you spend as much time as you can with us in looking over the institution and in attending these other meetings after your meeting has adjourned. I am very glad to see you here, because we all appreciate that you men who are scattered all over the State, coming from every county of the State and representing agricultural interests, are the men who must be depended on to push forward the agricultural movement in this State. This morning the Governor addressed one of our meetings here, and one of the points which the Governor especially made was the fact that organization was necessary in order that any industry should make prog - ress in these days: and, while be did not go exactly along that line, it occurred to me that the agricultural industry is the great industry of this State, and that we are too much inclined to look upon organized business as the big business. We think that the railroads represent big business, because they are organized; and we think that the steel industry repre - sents big business, because it is organized; and any line of business that is organized we look upon as big business. Did it ever occur to you that the agricultural industry is by far the largest business, and represents the largest' capital, and makes the larg - est part of the value, of any industry in this State, or in the United States? The steel industry does not compare with it; the railroads do Dot compare with it, when you take into consideration the amount of </seg>
            <seg id="p179">capital invested, and the number of people who are affected. In these days it seems that no industry will receive the consideration which it ought to receive, unless the men who are interested in that industry can get together and make their wants known and make their interests ap - parent; because the interests that loom large in the country are always those that are put forward in a strong and forceful and organized way; and until agriculture is able to do that, it will never get the same con - sideration that other organized industries will get and are getting at the present time. II know of no organization which is able to represent all sections of country and to represent the leading interests of your counties like organization. There is no agricultural society which is organized in the counties of the state, except yours. I suppose there are a few eptions, but in nearly every county you are organized. You have machinery with which to put forward any movement which appears ou to be important and necessary to the welfare of the people. I Now, frequently, we look upon the agricultural industry as one which 8 to be pushed only along the line of improvement in production. act. agricultural experiments, speaking of the agricultural college, : really not yet given attention to any other phase of the subject. r look after, or try to bring out and introduce, better methods of uction; but they have not the machinery, and they have not the or - tation, to look after those other phases of the industries which are irtant to the people. I In discussing the matter this morning before the swine breeders, the rnor said that, if you as swine breeders will organize in such a way you will bring your interests and your needs forcibly before the ile who legislate in this State, they will receive proper considera- So I think the same advice can be applied to the Board of Agricul - ln this State, and I know that they have in some considerable meas - already accomplished that result. It seems to me that there is no more important thing in this State than impressing upon its people the possibilities of development along agricultural lines, and that the State Agricultural Society has not yet re - ceived anywhere near the consideration Vhich it deserves along these I You go to other states, to Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota, I guess even to sas, and see what sort of facilities they have built up in order to ex - t the products of their states; and I believe that every one of the es mentioned (I am not sure about Kansas), can offer better facilities displaying the products of the state. Kit is of manifest importance to this State, and I am glad that we be able to develop fully the products of this State in a way that convince them that Nebraska is the best state in the United States; I believe we are perfectly competent to do that. All it needs is nixation and the money to build a good plant, and then the continued </seg>
            <seg id="p180">work of the men who are interested in the development of this State, to bring about that result I hare looked over to some extent the states in the far West, — not ranch, only a little, and the thing that impressed me above anything else was the fact that it was organization that was putting those states ahead. Take it in these states of the northwest; look at their land; it doesn't compare with Nebraska's land; look at the varied products which they are able to raise; this is no more than Nebraska does. Isn't It a fact that the products which they are able to raise, or those which they place the most emphasis upon, are better specialized products, which it takes a good deal of skill to raise successfully? The average man can not be successful in those things. I grant you that we need in this State to develop these specialized lines of industry, for the average man is always going to make his money out of ordinary methods of farming done in the very best way. The corn, wheat, alfalfa, and the live stock that are grown on the land, are standards methods, are the standard crops, and we must develop them, and we must put them before the people in a way which will prove to them that we have the opportunities to develop agriculture here to very high degree. One thing I have noticed in connection with Nebraska that I think probably is applicable to most other states: that is, that the people of our State are especially prone or liable to spend the profits of the land in some other state or in some other industry, in some wildcat scheme that ia not worth ten cents on the dollar. You know what it would mean to the State of Nebraska If we were to give her the hundred millions of dollars a year which are probably spent in investents in other states. Keep it in this State, and you could pay the dividends on the invest - ment. If that is expended outside of the State and sent west, I will grant you that there are other states that have opportunities; but I think that this &lt;noney is largely dragged out of the State because it is put up to those people in very alluring terms. One of the things I think ought to be done is to have such a law in this State as they have in Kansas, preventing any man from trying to sell stock in this State when he could not represent a good business proposition, something that business men who are experienced in busi - ness would guarantee and Bay that it is not a wild-cat scheme. But, out - side of that — outside of that, the inducement for the investment of money is largely through organization that shows the advantage of that invest - ment; and I believe the State can spend money in no wiser way, and prove, not only to the people of the State who are here, but to the peo - ple who are looking for better conditions in other states, that it is the best farming country that is known anywhere in the United States, and I except no state, no matter where it is, and no specialized industries, no matter what they are. There are some that we can not develop as some other state* can develop them, but we can improve all this land infinitely more than it has been Improved. Then we can look after It so that the </seg>
            <seg id="p181">lawi which are enacted in this State relative to big business shall be fair as between the fanner and the man who carries on these highly or - ganised lines of business. When we have done that, Nebraska will grow as it has never grown before. (Great applause.) Secretary Hellor: Mr. President, I desire to present the following resolution: Whereas, For a number of years close relations have existed be - tween the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture and Professor H. R. Smith, and Whereas, Professor H. R. Smith's services to the Nebraska State Fair have been of such value that he is recognized by this Board as one of the active forces in the material upbuilding of the Nebraska State Fair and the breeding industry of the State, and Whereas, On good authority we are advised that Professor Smith has severed his connection with the Nebraska University and accepted employment in another state, therefore be it Resolved, That the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture deeply re - gret the departure of Professor Smith from Nebraska; that we consider him the peer of any man in the United States in his profession, and rea - lize the Irreparable loss to Nebraska in his departure. We bid him God speed in his future efforts to carry the gospel of good breeding to the farmers of his adopted state and the United States. I move its adoption. Motion seconded. President Haws: Gentlemen, you have heard the reading of the resolution. Those that are in favor of the motion will manifest by saying Aye. "Aye." Those opposed, No. The Ayes have It It Is so ordered. Is there any other business to come before this meeting? I realise that there is one thing more, and all I can say is that I would like to have you ail on the Board; but I can't possibly do it I shall now an - nounce the Board of Managers, subject to your approval: Chairman of the Board, Charles Rudge; and members, Joseph Roberts, J. A. Ollis, Peter Toungers, and John McArdle. Mr. Ream: Is there anything before the house at present? President Haws: It is customary (there should be a motion pnt) to accept the President's recommendations for the Board of Managers, I Mr. Keedie: I move you that we accept and thank you — or approve your recommendations for Board of Managers. Mr. Cheney: I second the motion. President Haws: It has been moved and seconded that the appoint - ment of the Board of Managers be approved. Those in favor of the mo - tion will signify by saying Aye. "Aye." Those opposed, No. The Ayes have it. I will announce here that this Board of Managers will meet at the Capitol building, at the Secretary's office, at 4 o'clock this afternoon. Now Mr. Ream. </seg>
            <seg id="p182">Mr. Ream: I do not wish to offer any criticism on the action taken by your Board this morning in relation to the suggestion presented to you, but, after listening to Dean Burnett, I feel more inclined to ask you to lUten to the reading of the first resolution that was presented to you this morning by your Secretary and after the reading I shall ask your consideration of the same. Secretary Mellor (reading): "Whereas: A Urge proportion of the investment propositions now offered to the public are of speculative and doubtful character, absorbing vast amounts of money belonging to unin - formed and innocent Investors, to the serious detriment of every legiti - mate form of business and Industry, and "Whereas, A considerable proportion of these doubtful enterprises are speculative land-selling schemes which can not be reasonably expect - ed to yield profitable returns upon their fictitious capitalization, which is reflected in corresponding increase in the prices of agricultural lands in sections where permanent agriculture has passed beyond the experimental stage, such speculation and consequent rise in prices imposing an added and unnecessary burden both upon the producer and consumer, and in - creasing the difficulty of securing a home, therefore, be it "Resolved, That this Congress sets the seal of its disapproval em - phatically upon all forms of speculation of this character, and particu - larly upon such as are based upon speculation in lands which tend to absorb the earnings of Nebraska farmers and reduce our agricultural population; and be it further 8 "Resolved, That the legislative committee of this body be instructed co-operate with the director of conservation of the State of Nebraska In preparing a bill for introduction at the next session of the legislature providing for registration by authorized officers of state of all investment concerns seeking to do business in Nebraska, and the examination of the business standing and reliability of such concerns and the invest - ments they offer, where such investigation may be required." Mr. President, I move the adoption of the resolution. Motion seconded President Haws: You have heard the resolution, gentlemen. I will give you a chance for remarks on that. Has anybody anything to say? (CalU for Question.) Those in favor of the motion will manifest by saying "Aye." Aye. Those opposed. No. The Ayes have it. So or - dered. Is there any other business? Mr. Ream: There was one other resolution there that it appeared to me this State Board of Agriculture would surely endorse, and that is the proposition of agricultural education in the rural schools. With your permission, I shall ask that the Secretary read that resolution,' in order that you may consider it. t Secretary Mellor: I will state that the State Board of Agriculture the originator of agricultural education in the rural schools. Possibly did not know, but that is the fact. Mr. Ream: I remember certain features of that, and I am glad the </seg>
            <seg id="p183">Secretary has called my attention to it; but I would like it very much, so this Board would go upon record regarding it. Not particularly this special resolution; I don't care anything about the form of the resolution; but particularly upon the proposition of the need and demand for agri - cultural education. President Haws: Do you request that that be read? LHr. Ream: I would like to have it read and if you do not like this i I surely think you should have one. President Haws: The Secretary will read. Secretary Mellor (reading): "We favor the teaching of higher grade* in rural schools, where demanded, until such time as we may secure con - solidation of -rural schools, the consolidated schools to be established In the country, and, where possible, to have a high school department, offer - ing vocational training, particularly in agriculture, farm mechanics, and domestic science. "We disapprove of any scheme of state aid for high schools in cities and towns under the guise of advancing the interests of agriculture through the teaching of agricultural subjects, unless the same advantage* are offered to the rural community in encouragement of consolidation, which will tend to give to the farmer's child equal advantages with the child of the city, and teach the children of the farms in the terms and amid the surroundings, of the life which they are expected to live." Mr. Ream: Mr. Chairman, in support of the motion I intend to make I desire to say this: That the county superintendents of schools that met in this city yesterday adopted that resolution as a whole, and, on the general proposition of agricultural education I move that this body adopt that resolution as read. Motion seconded. President Haws: It has been moved and seconded that the resolu - tion just read be adopted. Those in favor of the motion manifest by say - ing Aye. "Aye." Contrary, No. The Ayes have it. What is your further pleasure? Mr Rudge: Mr. Chairman, I desire to read the following resolution: RVhereas, With deep regret we learn of the continued serious illness n John B. Dinsmore, who for a number of years was a 'pillar' of ebraska State Board of Agriculture, giving to it of the best years life in the advancement of the cause of agriculture, in company with such illustrious assistants as Robert W. Pumas, J. Sterling Mor - ton, and many others whose names are inseparably connected with the progressive agricultural history of Nebraska; therefore, be it "Resolved, That the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, in annual meeting assembled, hereby express to John B. Dinsmore our sincere sympathy in his illness, and trust that he may speedily recover; thereby being permitted to again take up the customary duties of everyday life and the full enjoyment of home relations." I move the adoption of this resolution, and also that It be ordered spread upon our records, and a copy thereof sent to Mr. Dinsmore. Secretary Mellor: I second the motion. </seg>

Opposed, No. Car - ried. It is unanimously adopted, and so ordered. A motion will be in order to adjourn Mr. Toungers: I move we adjourn Motion seconded. President Haws: It has been moved and seconded that we adjourn. Those in favor of that, say Aye. "Aye." Opposed, No. Motion car - ried. At 11:40 A. M , Wednesday, January 17, 1912, the meeting adjourned Wednesday evening, January 17, 1912 At University Temple, Mr. Will B. Otwell, of Carlinville, Illinois, spoke upon the subject "The Story of My Farmer Boys." Mr. Otwell: Mr. Chairman and Friends: I have never been in your city before, but I am going home and tell Mrs. Otwell that you have the in rural schools, where demanded, until such time as we may secure con - blackest dirt and the whitest people I have ever seen in my life, — outside of Illinois. (Laughter and applause.) I have been wondering on the way over here, eight hundred miles, why your management should have sent away over into Illinois to get me to come over here and tell you my troubles; and I think, when I am done, you will be wondering the same identical thing. But there came into my mind at once how a number of years ago my state endeavored to interest men to organize the first Farmers' Institute ever held in our part of the state, — ever held in our great big county. I remember, Mr. Chairman, they elected the Honorable Senator David Gore, president, and elected me secretary. Mr. Gore couldn't make one or two of the fellows work, so he told me to go to work and get up the biggest crowd of farmers ever gotten together in central Illinois. I knew something about advertising, and went to work and wrote column after column for the thirteen different county papers in my county. We got up a beautiful program. I remember we had such a man as a cattle expert from Bloomlngton, Illinois, to talk about oattle and horses. We had a big crowd, and talked about fat cattle. We had Mrs. Nora Dunlap to talk about domestic science to the women. We got up the best program I ever saw of music and recitation's. We had the finest singen in town of any town I have ever seen. We had musicale, ad - dresses, music, instrumental and vocal. Printed them on great, big pro - grama; and hung them on quarter-sheet bills in every identical show window in my county. And then we sent out the programs, taking postage; and urged the fanners to come out and attend to their own business; — something that lota of people besides farmers haven't yet learned to do. And then I told the Janitor of that old McLean county courthouse to get the doors open early that morning to accommodate a great crowd of farmers that would be surging around those doors for admittance. You may have heard of </seg>
            <seg id="p185">that Urge McLean county courthouse in Illinois? You can smile, if you want. Last year we paid off the last dollar we owed of a million and a half dollars on that great, beautiful building, and if we hadn't had one of the biggest counties in the world, and the richest, we could not have done it. I told the janitor to get those big iron doors open early in the morn - ing to accommodate that crowd of farmers that would be surging around those doors for admittance; and so, men, if I ever told the truth in my life, when the president called the meeting to order at 11 o'clock that morning, there were present the president and secretary and the chap - lain; and that is every blessed soul that was there! (Laughter.) And the chaplain got up and offered a very fine prayer for the officers of the institution. Bless his heart! And he tapped me on the shoulder after - wards and said, "Personally, I am very confident that the officers will do everything in their power, when they know how to do it." The next thing, we decided to fool the farmers. Farmers can be fooled a little easier than anybody else in the world. And so I went down to the printing office, and I got three thousand pretty pink envelopes, kind of little wedding envelopes, and sent all the envelopes with letters on 'the 13th day of November, putting a two-cent stamp on each one, sealed them up, to arouse curiosity, not having as beautiful program as the year before; and then I mailed them out to three thousand repre - sentative farmers in my county, and invited them, urged them, begged them to come out to their own meeting that should take place on the 19th of November in our town— with just about the same result as the year before. I assure you, Mr. Chairman, there were not to exceed thir - teen farmers at any session of our institute for those two or three weeks. The president resigned in disgust, and they elected me to that honorable position. II determined at once to make a great personal effort to do what I (1, and see what you think, as to whether we can bring it about; and Id the officers in plain English. I will give you a little exhibition of raised products, and then you are your own judge as to whether any I has come from it, or not." I sent into Indiana, Iowa, and Illinois, and procured twelve varieties of seed corn, pretty good corn, I believe; and went into the Farmers' National Session, one Saturday afternoon, twelve farmers that knew how to grow corn before I was born, told them what my plan was, asked them to pick out the very best variety adapted to that soil and climate. We worked four hours, and finally picked out a little regular variety; and I went over to a town in Indiana, and asked an elevator man there about giving it to us, and I would like for him to furnish it to me as cheap as he could. He sold it to me at the ridiculously low price of $3.75 a bushel. I got the boys up $500 in premiums. It had been advertised in all the papers in my county that every boy who would send me bis name and postoffice address, I would send him a package of corn, all I could send through the mails for one cent of postage, — about 100 kernels of loose corn. </seg>
            <seg id="p186">Five hundred boys in my county sent for the corn, and began scrap - ping for these prizes. What did I have? Instead of having men to advertise my meeting the coming fall, I had five hundred boys, — fine, clean, little farmer emissaries, sitting around on the rail fence, earnestly talking about the Farmers' Institute that was going to take place do*.. at Carlinville. The country correspondent took it up, told about when Tommy Jones got his corn, where be had, planted It, how he had culti - vated it and fertilized it; and finally Tommy Jones had gathered his prize corn, and put it up in the smoke house to dry, and next week or next month, as the case might be, he was going to take it away down to the county seat, to the big Farmers' institute that was going to take place there. 1 did not invite a single, solitary farmer to come to tbe institute that year. I told them they could politely stay at home for all I cared. 1 had done everything for them that I could to get them out. I turned my attention to the boys, "and you old fellows just politely go to grass." (Laughter.) Well, I wasn't very much encouraged, and when the time came for the institute to take place, I went to Jacksonville to get A. H. Stevenson, now of Ames, Iowa, to make "a speech. You know, your counties all lose them once In a while, and states like Nebraska and Iowa gobble them up. You have one in Iowa, and one in Washington, and Steven - son at Ames. Iowa. I believed Mr. Stevenson to be a rather good judge of corn, and as some poor little farmer boy mignt be there with ten ears of corn, I did not want him disappointed. So he would be there two weeks or ten days, and had to be on hand to judge the corn. I told the janitor he could just get the doors of that court house open at any old time In the morning that pleased him. I didn't care for the men; they might look in at the windows. And, as I remember, I sauntered down to the courthouse real late that morning, rather indit - ferent, talking about something else, and hardly thinking about the farm - ers' institute; until we came within sight of those stone steps, the outer part of the building. I should say, as large as this entire building, the stone steps that go up to the front doors. And, when we got within sight of those stone steps, they were literally honeycombed; the farmer boys had tbeir corn in tea boxes, in soap boxes, old gunny sacks tied up with binder twine, or shoe strings, — any old way so they could get the corn to the institute; and, when I called the meeting to order at 11 o'clock that morning, there were five hundred representative farmers in the hall. I knew I had solved the problem. And when the h oys were bring- Ing in their corn — you see how you learn men pretty well; "father thinks that is a little short or close;" others thought it was a litne too poor to feed to the cattle; a good many thought my boys were green, and 1 could get enough men around there; others thought the corn a little too boggy; and, by the time I got through, I had learned my lesson. About onethird of the boys thought that in our soil and climate we could grow </seg>
            <seg id="p187">ten bushels more of white corn than we could of yellow. So, when the institute was over, I spent thirty days in traveling over three counties looking for the kind of corn that I thought best and we ought to get a start on. I finally found a variety of pure-bred white corn, just as near the regular standard price as I could find it, about ten inches in length, about seven inches through the circumference at the center, great, fine, symmetrical on both ends, filled very large at both ends, with a long, deep, pure white grain, with a white cap, good 100 bushel corn; because we were looking down the state for the best product of corn in the business for five hundred boys; and told them that every boy who wanted to get in the contest this year must send his name and five cents, and I explained what the nickel was for. Because, let me say: When you deal with boys you have to be pretty careful. I tell you. You can fool an old man, and patch it up with him. When you fool a boy, you have fooled him for keeps. I told them I was going to send them three times as much corn this year, and the postage would be three cents. A large tin, like they manufactured in St. Louis, at wholesale costs about a cent. That included the extra labor of the boys who bandied it, taking care of the corn for us, at about a cent and a quarter; and I was only to donate the corn. Eighteen hundred boys in the county sent for the corn, and began working for this prize, and worked for the largest exhibit of corn ever seen at a county display in the history of the world. We had lots of trouble. It isn't all fun, by any means. I remember I ot a letter from a boy, in which he says: "My Dear Friend, You need ot expect me at the farmers' institute again this fall. Because why?" e says, "Father and his confounded mules got in. and ate ap every stalk my corn." And another boy wrote and said: "The crows got my corn, nd blackbirds got my corn. " Well, bless their hearts. 1 provided for he mule boys and the crow boys and the blackbird boys, and the next mail took them a package of corn, and they were to be counted. And ben the institute took place — I will not stop to tell you what happened lat long, dry summer, we did not have a very good corn crop in out ounty — but, when the institute took place, I would like you to go down nd see the 1,800 exhibits of ten ears each, as it amounted to. We hung the corn all over the walls. We piled it up in piles as big as corn cribs. We had a man who I think finally became county judge f this county at that time, and who since was called to the government ervice at Washington, to be on hand to judge the corn. And I remember hat last day of the institute was "Boy Day;" and I told the farmers and heir women folks they could politely stay outside the building until the boys were seated. fThey came to that institute from all over our country. They came with nts. They filled every available space in the town. They brought their nches into the court room and stayed there and ate them, for fear they mldn't get in in the afternoon again. And I remember the last after - ton when the boys were seated, and young Zachary was talking to them, stopped him, I said, "Zach, how many boys do you think you are talk- </seg>
            <seg id="p188">!■( to tnis afternoon?" He said, "I should think, Otwell, there must be seventeen or eighteen hundred boys down there. And then, another thing," he says, "I have never been so inspired in my life as I am this afternoon." And 1 want to tell you people down here in Nebraska that the fellow that can't make a speech here before seventeen or eighteen hundred farmer boys has really never attempted to make a speech. We have pretty good premiums for the boys. I remember we had on the platform a fifty-dollar steel windmill. We had three-wheel riding plows, and steel bottom walking plow, three horse, and two horse, and one horse, and corn shellen, and stalk cutters. My friend at an Illinois town do - nated me a box of 100 bars of washing soap. I knew that Mrs. Otwell's boys would want that soap. If you have any boys that long (indicating) running around your house, they need that same kind of thing every day of their lives. David Miller, in the bank, called me into his office one day and handed me a check for $100, and told me to divide it any way 1 pleased. And so I went down to the national bank, and told Mr. Hodlick, "I want one hun - dred crisp, new one dollar bills that have never been used." You know, teachers, I think, sometimes, that the boy who gets to going down the line about one hundred from the first is as much to be encouraged as the bright boy that always stands at the head of his class. And so I divi led it into one hundred one-dollar bills, after these boys had taken their dif - ferent premiums home. Their machinery they took in two-horse wagons, and when they finished, the sheep and pigs and calves made a long, fine expanse of crates all over the courthouse yard. Because they are the boys who are coming on. The former business men of the old generation were asleep and better take care of the stock at home, where they belong. After they had hauled it home, I then divided the one hundred dollar bills, and sent them out to the hundred boys, with this little note: "My Dear Friend: I am sending you the dollar bill you earned at the last fann - erm' institute. I congratulate you on your nerve and energy this long, dry summer. Hoping you will be with us again next fall, and that you will grow up a good farmer and a good man, I am, Yours very sincerely. P. S. — Please let me know if you get the dollar bill; otherwise, I might think it has been lost in the mail." And, say, you ought to see the hundred letters 1 got from those hun - dred boys! You drop into my office some Saturday afternoon (we don't have much to do) I would take down and show you a hundred letters that money couldn't buy. I got a letter from a boy, and he says, "My Dear Friend: I received the dollar bill you sent me; for which I thank you. 1 am a little orphan boy, nine years old. I live with my uncle and aunt, who are very kind to me. This is the first dollar I ever owned in my life, and I am going to keep it as long as I live, for a nest egg." And when a boy is as close to me as that, I go right home and file his letu.r away among the things that money can't buy. the other day I was in the middle of making an address at the settlers' meeting, and when I had finished, a little fellow, about that </seg>
            <seg id="p189">long (indicating), crawled up on the platform, and took my arm, and I turned, and he says, "Don't you know, me?" "Of course, I know you! Who are you?" He says, "I am that little nest egg fellow." "Well, bless your heart, I wo.uld have known you among a thousand boys!" And his father told me the other day that, over in his adopted home, behind the sitting room door, or the parlor, hangs the dollar bill as evidence of his long, successful summer's work. *• And then, I mustn't forget to tell you about the boy that won one of those premiums. A firm in Chicago sent a $100 bicycle, and I hung it over the chandelier, up on a piece of copper wire. And there it hung the entire two days as an individual prize that was offered. Of course, every boy knew he would win the bicycle. I got a letter from a boy, one day. and he says: "Dear Friend," he says, "Please send me my machine by first express. I'm just crazy over the $100 bioycle." Why, of course, he knew who would win the bicycle I myself was crazy to find out the boy that would win it. I was sure it would be some boy that always stood at the head of his class, and whose father lived out on a garden where the soil was fourteen feet thick. But, do you know, when I found out the boy that had won the bicycle, he turned out to be a little old orphan boy, living with his grandfather and grandmother, on Brush moun - tain, and he won a prize in that part that you would hardly consider good agricultural country. And, when I went down the last week of the in - stitute and took the boy from the back seat on that day, and stood him on my desk, in his overalls, and introduced him in that ?rowd of twenty - five to thirty farmers, as the champion corn breeder in that county, the governor of New York never received a heartier ovation tn his life, and ho never deserved it any more, either, than that boy did. I Well, now, I used to tell Mrs. Otwell that I wished that the time Kht come when I could sell out and be over in another city, but live in own county. And when the Governor of Illinois called me into his ice, I came up, and he told me he would like me to go to St. Louis to te charge of the corner from our state, and T told him I would, on only e condition and that was, I might take my farmer boys with me. He d me that was the main reason I was selected. So I got the boys up .500 in premiums; wrote the rules and regulations out, and sent them t to 125,000 farmer boys in Illinois. I got into personal correspond - ce with 15.000 of the country school teachers, 8,000 boys. And we got contest, and went and graded the corn for the greatest exhibition of re bred corn ever seen in the history of the world. And, when the mmer was over the fall came, they began sending me their corn to irlinville, to my home town; where we took it out of the boxes and put up on racks. But we went to work first and built Ares all around it d dried it out. And then we wrapped every single ear in a separate ece of paper, boxed them up. and shipped them to St. Louis, where we .packed it, and got the largest and beautifullest exhibit of corn in the &gt;rld, for an exhibition of pare bred seed corn. That corn came to me in every conceivable condition that you couM </seg>
            <seg id="p190">think of. I remember there was one box came; it was rather green corn, rather sappy, that fall; every ear wrapped in yellow paper, then in four or live thicknesses of newspaper, and the box lined, and nailed up, and when it got there you could cook biscuits in it. Hut I say, to the praibe of all the state, nearly all of the corn came in fine condition. And I re - member, at St. Louis, when we began putting little premiums of ten ears each for prizes, prizes awarded for the county 1 that ran away up yonder. I remember the citizens as they caine in there, going by, began looking at the little prize corn. We deftly threw a green ssitin ribbon over each ten ears; and then we began to wonder what in the world it meant Thousands and thousands of them, and we piled ui:, until finally I went into the city, and had beautiful satin banners made thirty feet long, with gold letters, and took them out, and hung them abo\e those two pyramids — one of yellow and one of white corn, grown by the farmer boy of Illinois. And then I had the attention of these millions of people riveted nicely to his growing it. And then, one day, I thought, if I could just take a picture of the boy that grew the corn, and put it on his corn, it would make a pretty nice photograph. When I go home tomorrow, the first thing I will do. I will sit down, and the first thing I will do will be to tell Mrs. Otwell Just how this crown behaved, and how you looked. You know, there is something about an audience the speaker likes to look into your faces, and that is too hard to describe to you. We like to !ook into one another's :aces. And so I just thought, if I could get a photograph of the boy that grew the corn, and get it on his corn, it would look very nice. So I sat down and wrot&lt; a letter to the boys: "We will have to take a photograph of you. I want your name and address." And so the funniest sight you ever saw in your life was those thousands of boys hustling off to th.' photographer to have their pictures taken. They came afterwards, on ponies and horseback, sixteen boys from one county of Illinois, in the old state, without a ntil - road, walked and run barefoot fourteen miles, to have their picture- Finally, they began coming to me at St. Louis in bushel basketful.-. wrapped up In every conceivable way. The city editors began co - down there from St. Louis of the Post-Dispatch and the Republic and the Globe-Democrat, and all the papers, wanting it for a stor&gt;. They helped me open the mail every morning, and they wrote it up, and three thou - sand daily papers had accounts of that display of the boys' corn at St. Louis. Four thousand school teachers in -the rities they were dislri to register their names, and asked about the farmer boy work; 3^ farmer boys of this country registered their names in on. department. kThe United States Government thought so much of it that they seut eclal representative to St. Louis to write it np and publish it in a phlet, and they distributed it over the civilized worli!. And tonight, as I talk to you, a photograph of these boys and I heir work is hanging upon the school walls of Chicago, St. Louis, and New York city. I know this, because I furnished them myself to the superintendents who study • (jucdiioub 10 snow wnai me iamser do) was doing. </seg>
            <seg id="p191">Well, I got so sick and tired of the boy work that I did net know what to do. I had had boy for breakfast, and 'boy for dinner, and boy lor supper. It was boy, boy, boy, until I got so sick and tired of the whole shebang that I wished the whole affair would close up, and was just set - ting a little time to go home and make a call on Mrs. Otwell and the babies once more, and I didn't care what happened, when, do you know, along towards the close of the fair, they brought along the photographs, and. Lord bless you, it made an awful nice sight. I got a telephone message from eastern Illinois, and when I went to the long distance Bell telephone some gentleman said, "Hello! Is thin Otwell, of St. Louis?" I said, "Yes, sir." He says, "You have my boys corn at St. Louis. The boy was that fat little fellow around at the fur - ther end of the hall, and he raised the blue grass from bis acres. I won - dered if you would like to have his photograph put on his corn; and we are coming." I took the Market Street car, and went down into the city to a large wholesale house. There I had an ebony frame put around a cabinet photograph, and then took it over to the ribbon counter, and told the girl the story of the boy, and told her I would be back in about an hour, and I wished she would have it fixed up pretty nice; and. when I came back, she had it beautifully decorated with little strands of blue and white satin ribbons, and four pretty little black and white satin bows, and I wrapped it up. and took it very carefully out, and set it up against Tommy's corn. If there was one, there were two hundred and fifty thousand hard-fisted old farmers who would be nambling down these very aisles, and look at that rard at that coin, and then center their eyes on the one little spot, and stand there a minute or two, and then taka their old bandanas, and go on swinging down the aisle, thinking and wondering what they were doing. I thought the same things a thousand times before, and so I got awful tired of the affair; I wished that they were wanting to stop. But along toward the last, I began to change my tune. I began to think back of the 12.000 teachers, the 120,000 boys, and the days nnd weeks and months of work, and what I thought it might mean in the future. And I remem - ber that the last day of the fair was St. Louis Day, when there would be 225,000 boys and girls on the ground, and every boy and every girl was looking for souvenirs. They had taken the corn off the ears; they had taken the grains of wheat out of the stalks; they had pulled off the heads of timothy.— anything in the world to carry away to remember the fair with. And they would take my souvenir; and I knew what would hap - pen to the photographs of those tall, handsome young farmer boys when the girls from St. Louis came down there. And, say, girls, I want to tell you; you can't do any better than to get your eyes fastened on a tall, first-class fanner boy, and keep them there. So, not trusting those photographs to anybody else, I grabbed up all those bundles of corn, and took them down, and wrapped them up and put in my own grips, and carried them down to my own office at home; where, tonight, as I am </seg>
            <seg id="p192">talking to you, they are on my office walls; and so, men, every wakeful moment of my life. I am conscious of the watchful gaze of those choice boys; and I want to tell you, If there is anything that will keep a man half way sober nowadays, it is to know a thousand different i.oys are watching him all the time. And, not being content that anybody else should have those beautiful satin badges, I wrapped up my premiums myself, and took them down, and rolled them up, and packed in my own K carried them up to my office, where I hung them above the ographs, where they bang tonight, — grown by the farmer boys Cou know, on that ground we builded during those months a founda - upon which we could erect a building more enduring than the I's Fair, or more enduring than even the corn. From three bare - footed boys with old overalls on, our crowd has grown to 40,000 now, and as fine a crowd of boys as ever drove calves down a corn row. We have forty organizations of those different horseback brigades. We have our day in the round-up. When the farmer boys had the last round-up, they met in my town. The last one, they 'ame from four states, from forty counties in Illinos, on horseback, five miles, eight abreast, and they were, I want to say, a fine set of boys about 100 nice boys on top of 100 fine horses, stepping and prancioR down the street. I remember, at the last round-up, we had Ex-President Stevenson, from Bloomington, down there, as our special guest. And I remember I had sent word out to the boys on their horseback, through the lieu - tenants, that when we passed the carriage that contained the Vice-Presf - dent, all their hats must come off. Farmer boys m getting to be pretty polite boys, I want to tell you. And so I remember General Stevenson in his open carriage, with his hat off, and as these millions and millions of boye all swept by, every boy doffed his hat to the gentleman. We spoke for about thirty or forty minutes, and. as he stepped out of the carriage, I saw tears starting out of his eyes. He says, "Otwell, I can't stand this any longer. This is the most Inspiring sight of my life that has come to me anywhere in these past twenty-five years." We have our own pledges. We have got a pretty unique pledge; thirty thousand boys have signed it. The pledge is printed in blue; it Is about that long (indicating), and perforated in the middle. The boy signs both ends of it. He keeps one end. and sends the other end to me; because he wants me to know what he has doDe. And that pledge reads as follows: "For the period of one year I agree to let liquor and tobacco and profanity alone." (Applause.) The reason I put it that way is this: If a boy signs a thing for an indefinite length of time, he will break it, but when he signs it for a year, he will break a hame string before he breaks that pledge. And I do that, for one reason: You can't sign the entire pledge, scratch out the minor parts, and sign the balance of it. Mr. Chairman, you ought to see the funny letters I got from the boys, and they can't sign any pledge,— No, siree! they cast agree to </seg>
            <seg id="p193">t drinking and swearing and smoking and chewing, — I guess not! 1 mber a little fellow wrote and says: "My Dear Friend, I have d all the pledge except about the f wearing; but I can't sign that, lse. when I go oat and milk Old Bess and she puts her foot in the et, I have to say a couple of words." (Laughter.) Bless his heart, ild like to know what the couple of words are: (Renewed laughter.) I suspect you boys know, down there. I got another letter from a boy, and he said: "Dear Friend, I signed the pledge except the part about goiiig in the saloons." You know, the last part of the pledge is: "And I further agree that foi* a period of one year, I will not enter a saloon." Tou know, boys, I think an hon - est, clean boy has no more business in a saloon than he has in a furnace. And so the boy signed his pledge, "I agree, not often, to go into a saloon, for a year." This boy says: "I have signed all the pledge except about going into a saloon. I can't sign that, because papa tends bar, and I have to go In every morning to clean out the rpitloons." I wrote Jimmy a* mice a letter as I knew how to write, and I told him to always mind his father; and I wrote his father a short, nice letter, and asked him if he didn't think it was time Jimmy had a promotion. And if I can take a man's word, I am sure on Christmas Day Jimmy got his promotion. (Applause.) Well, 'taint all fun, by any means. 'Taint all poetry, by any means. I got a letter from a man one day. In which he said: "My Dear Sir: You're a pretty smooth gentlemen. (Laughter.) Got 25,000 boys grow - ing fine corn for you! How I would like to see your corn bins about Christmas! I bet you have got a fine brand of hogs on your farm! (Laughter.) Well, I wrote back, and said: "My Dear Sir: I am glad you'have found out where I come in. I have been looking for a year or two to find that, myself. But I make the rules in this contest; none of my own boys can enter it; no relative of mine can enter it; no employe can enter it; every boy that grows the corn owns it, and I want him to take it back and plant it. I made the rules myself, so if anybody is to blame, I am to blame." O, he wrote me a nice letter, and that was all right You know there's lots of people standing around, grumbling and growling at the other people; never trying to boost any themselves, but trying to pull things down. 1 stood over here the other day by a great, big basket of Irish potatoes, and a little old, dried up woman about that long (illustrating), came nambling by, and hooked her long, jagged nail in one of the potatoes, and says, ''Huh. we boil bigger potatoes every day out home for dinner." I went down among the farmers' exhibits, and a little farmer came nambling down there with two of his boys: "Why, son, we scoop out better corn than this every day for the hogs, don't we?" If he hadn't appeared at. any fanners' institute, going to look at what the other fellow is doing, what was he. doing in there to help things along? A lot of you fellows take a back seat and watch the boys, and blame somebody else for it I remember a boy came out in the schoolhouse to say his first </seg>
            <seg id="p194">speech He came out like this (Illustrating), sot one foot on the other, and got hia feet tangled up, like my sister said I stood when I was to tret married, and I got my legs tangled up; pretty near killed me at once. And, when the minister got done, I didnt know that there waa * minister in the house. So Tommy got up to say his first speech. His brother called him "Tommy"; the big boys called him "Tom." His mother, for fear he might get frightened — of course, he couldn't! — ahe told him, "Why don't you keep looking down to me. Tommy?" Pretty soen he came out, and commenced to cry! Oh, how I do pity the boy that comes out to say his first speech and commences to cry! I dared not go Into that till I was ten years of age. When I got up to make a speech, and I got stuck, and commenced to cry. I cried and bawled, and almost died! I would do anything in this world to get out of speaking. And those nearest farm women In this country I thought the meanest women that ever lived. Every Friday afternoon in the country they will go toddling down to the schoolbouse to hear the boys get up and say their speeches. My own mother every Friday would come nambllng down to the schoolhouse, to be there when I should get up and make a stick of myself. You will bo such a great big stick! And so I made up my mind that this one day I would get up and make a speech Friday afternoon without crying, for one time. I determined to be right next the platform, so that when Mr. Moore called on me, I would run right up on the platform and have my speech over before I had time to cry. He didn't always call on me first, and so when he came out the last time he say* to ring the bell. And I ran out and looked down the hill to see If mother was coming up to the school. She was rather beyond the little bridge, and starting to come up to the schoolhouse. I knew I might get through with it, because she wouldn't have time to get there before I would have my speech done. I went in and sat by the platform, and sure enough, Mr. Moore called on me first. I got up and said a few words, and then I broke down and cried like a calf! Mr. Moore said, Tou may take your seat. That was very well done!" Bless his heart! He knew she was coming! KSo, first, Tommy commenced to cry; pretty soon, he commenced bawl; after a while he commenced to holler. Oh, there's lot of dif - ference between Peter and Paul! His mother says, "Tommy, what's the matter with you? Oh, my! Tommy! What on earth's the matter with you?" He says, "Somebody's stepping on my foot!" (Laughter.) Well, the fool fellow was stepping on his own foot! There's lots of difference. It's easy enough to go off over something, and step on yonr own toes, and blame somebody else for it. (Laughter.) Among the ninety thousand letters that have come to my desk from the farmer boys, the other day there came one over from Road House, Illinois, that read as follows: "My Dear Friend: We are going to organise a baseball team over here among the farmer boys, and we want to call it "Tfce Otwell Farmer Boy Team." providing you will furnish the uniform*." (Laughter.) Well, that sounded all right to me. I told </seg>
            <seg id="p195">the boys that sounded all right So I wrote back and I said, "I will be glad to furnish you your uniforms providing you don't play on Sunday." Looky here, boys — I believe that applies to ninety counties in the state, and a dozen other states, and 1 am going to tell it to you and your boys tonight: that Sunday baseball will do more to put your old town at the bottom of the list than anything I know of! (Applause.) He wrote back and says, "We don't play baseball on Sunday; so that don't fit us." So I settled down and fixed out the list of their duds to send to Chicago to get for them. I remember some kind of a thing consisting of barb wire to protect their faces, and a couple of excellent mattresses to keep their stomachs in order; and then ordered some iron-toed or spiked shoes, so they could hit her 1 to first base all right, and plenty of balls and bats; and had the order just ready to send off, when I got the following letter, which read: "My Dear Friend: I thought I would write you a letter and tell you about my home, — not my home," he says, "but the place I live at. We live in a little shack down at the edge of the mountain, and when it rains the water runs in on my bed and geu the bed clothes all wet; and, when it snows in the winter time, the snow drifts through the roof, and then I wake up in the morning with my nightgown and bed clothes all frozen together. Fourteen years ago, In going over the mountain, I fell and hurt my side, and never since then have I taken a step. I have never been out of bed, Mr. Otwell, except when they carry me like a little baby; and my only support Is my old widowed mother, and for a few weeks in the summer time, by working hard for a week, she can then get as much as 35 to 40 cents; and in all that time I hare never gone to bed a single night without going to bed hungry. But I must not bother you," he says, "with my troubles, when you have got 40,000 other boys to hear from. Hope yon will live to be a good man. God bless you and all your boys. I am, Tour little Friend, Joseph Morfu, Tracy, North Carolina." I sat right down and wrote to the boys over at Road House and said: "Dear Boys: I will not get your uniforms right now for your ball team. I am sending you a letter from Joe. Please call the club together, and read them this letter; and the money that it would take to tog you out I am sending down to Joe to patch his roof. And I will write to Joe and say; 'My Dear Joe; I feel sure we are to blame, but, for fear some of the other boys might not understand it, I am writing to your school teacher; I am writing to your doctor; I am writing to the minister in the neighborhood. Answer if you can tell me the doctor who treats you; and I will either send it through a friend or go myself, to make you comfortable." Well, you men have long since found out, as I have, that when rod want a thing done to suit you, you would better do It yourself. So I too* my grip, and went to Springfield, took a slow train on the B. A O., and came along, and then got onto a fast train for Cincinnati, Ohio, and was noticing the cars for Knoxville, Tennessee, when I stepped across onto another train that Immediately preceded the one. On one </seg>
            <seg id="p196">■ide of tie track the state of Virginia, and on the other side the state of Tennessee. And the last town I arrived at I reached at half put alz Saturday night, with just time enough to engage my guide and driver. We started over the mountains the next morning for North Carolina, to find Joe; and, when I got further, I began to inquire, and nobody In all that country had ever heard of Joe; though, from his letters, I knew that I must travel in a southeasterly direction; and along about half past ten o'clock, when I was sitting at the tavern table, eating sup - per, there came a rap at the front door, and when the lady went to the door, I beard a voice say, "Is Mr. Otwell, of Illinois, here?" And when she came in she says, smiling, "The sheriff of Johnson county wants a Mr. Otwell, from Uinois." (Laughter.) And I thought, bless their souls, you can't escape the sheriffs of North Carolina or Illinois, either. And when I got to the door it brought it back to my mind that I had sent a long distance telephone message to have a furnished rig, and she had come down there to see what kind of luggage I had. so as to know what kind of a rig to furnish the next morning. And, Sunday morning, just as the sun was creeping over the Rain - bow Mountain, with our luggage all strapped in and wired in and roped in, we started over the mountains to find Joe;-— the roughest road I ever traveled in all my life. We hit cobblestones up there on the mountain three thousand feet high and two thousand miles long, and I verily be - lieved I would not be able to get out of there for a solid week. We went around those mountain passes where twenty-four inches to right or left would have meant instant death five hundred feet below. We forded mountain streams eight times, where I verily believed it was going to wash the wheels off the buggy. And in all that country there wasn't a soul that had ever heard of Joe! My guide and driver wanted to turn back; they said "We wouldn't go back over this road after dark for anything in the world." But I said, "No, air; you have been engaged for the job, and you will stay as long aa I stay." And finally, as we went down in North Carolina, on the other side of Rainbow Mountain we came upon a little old shack, with a farmer sitting out on the front porch with his pants rolled up above his knees, and his feet in a great big candy bucket full of spring water, washing his feet, — and 1 tell you, not a bad idea in North Carolina or Nebraska, aa well. And as I went up I said. "Hello, sir. Does Joseph Morfu live around here anywhere?" He says, "Yes, sir; I low 1 , you're on the right road. Don't leave this road." I says, "Hold on! Tour ad - vice is unnecessary! I wouldn't leave this road twenty-four inches for the whole state of North Carolina!" He says, "Just keep on dowu this road west two miles till you come to a wooden gate on the roadside. Just turn in and cross the mountain stream a couple of times, and just keep on going.'' We went down the road I should say twelve miles or more till we came to a wooden gate on the right side of the road, with a young mother standing there, with her babe in her arms the prettiest sight I have ever seen in the state of North Carolina, or Illinois, or Ne- </seg>
            <seg id="p197">ft — Just a little unpopular in some parts of the country. And, as I up, I said, "Good morning. Madam, does Joe live around here any - i?" She says, "Yes, sir; I 'low he lives on down at the turn of the ' I came back and I got in the buggy, and we came across the tain streams, which is dangerous, and just kept on, till we got 3 the mountain streams, and came to just about the biggest syca - trees 1 ever saw in my life. My guide and driver refused to go any further, but I pushed them on, going a little further, till we finally came to a little clearing at the bottom of the mountain. Oh, I should say, half as large as this building, with a little old shack; oh, it would make a decent hogshed for a good litter of Berkshire pigs, or to keep the milk cow in in the winter; It would make a fairly reasonable hen house 'or your chickens in the sum - mer, not in the winter; and, as we drove up, I took off my hat. and said, "Good morning, madam." There was a little, old, dried up woman stand - ing in the open door with a nice clean, neat calico dress on that Sunday morning, looking half scared; and, as I went up, I said, "Good morning madam. Does Joe live around here, anywhere?" She says, "Yes, sir. I 'low Joe's right in here." "Well," I said, "Don't you know me? This is Mr. Otwell." And she said, "I be his mother." And by that time I had pushed past her on to the inside of the little shanty. And there on a little old leather couch that had seen better days, with his face turned toward the rays of the winter sun, lay Joe. And I went in, and I said. "Hello, old man? How do you stack up this morning? Pretty good, are you?" "Pretty good." said Joe." "Well," said I, "a couple of friends and I were out through the mountains- this morning, and we thought we would drop in and see bow you were getting along. And, aa Joe raised up his big bony fingers and took my hands in his, and pulled my face down to his, he says, "Oh, Mr. Otwell, it's mighty nice in you to' come so far to see a poor sick boy like me." He was simply surprised, on that beautiful Sunday morning that I did come to see him. II brought my guide and driver, and introduced them to Joe and hi» ther; because I told them they must take me back. Then, after see - that face on that sheet, pale and white, and being introduced to her, Did them I would excuse them, that I had only twenty minutes to y. I had come nine hundred miles and I wanted to be alone with and his mother; and, when they went out, 1 thought, you know, I uld like to have a talk with just those two. And my boy had fixed an arm chair that we didn't know how to handle, push or wheel it, something; I didn't know how to handle it or work it. tl started out or the little shanty. Joe said to his mother, "I expect Otwell is awful hungry, coming so far this morning. Haven't you got Ue something he can eat?" She says, "No, Joe; I ain't got anything it." He says, "Have you any piece of pork or something to give them ; in the kettle over the fireplace, and boil It?" "No, Joe; ain't a scrap ork in the house." Joe says, "Haven't you got a few grains of corn can grind up, and make a little mush?" "No, Joe; we ate every grain </seg>
            <seg id="p198">for breakfast" And then I thought he had Just gone far enough, and I stepped inside, and said, "Mrs. Morfu, if you want to make my visit short, you can begin getting dinner. I got lunch, and we went together, the guide and the driver; and of course we would get a little supper as we came back. I would like to spend a little time; I have only twenty min- utes to visit with you and Joe." And before coming — I think, two weeks before, Mrs. Otwell had gone to Springfield, and she had got a lot of things and sent on there by prepaid express, so they would be there by the time I got there; and, you know, any woman would know what she got. Of course, she got, the first thing, six or eight wash rags, and five or six different kinds of soap. I would rather, in fact, be sick in bed all my life than to have five or six women always washing my neck and ears when I am feeling bad. I came and saw a bright boy friend sent to the hospital, lying there on his little leather coach, and the women around the room fussing over him. Every one wanted to do something, and one woman says to him, "Oh, you poor, dear boy! can't I do something for you?" "No, ma'am; no, ma'am." "Oh, can't I do anything?" "No, ma'am." "Can't do anything, little boy?" "O. no." "O, I know what I can do." So she got up and got a wash rag. with some nice soap, and went to washing his face all over; and then dried it nice. "Oh," he says, "Thank you, ma'am. Thank you. You're only the seventeenth woman that has washed my face this morning!" Mrs. Otwell got some dresses and shoes and skirts for the mother, and got Joe some dishes; and then I had asked Joe, "of all the things you can think of in the world what would you rather have?" and Joe said he would rather have a little tent than anything in the world. So I couldn't get it up on the road, and saw the box go up; and so we put all the things on the stave; they had no table or bed; and all Joe could say was, "It was mighty nice in you, Mr. Otwell, to come so far to see a poor sick boy Well, I arose to go after the twenty minutes, with a fresh picture of life; but there are things that happen in a sick room that no human tongue can tell; and, as now the two o'clock sun vanished through the magnolia leaves, playing upon Joe's face, I took his long, bony fingers in mine, and kissed the black locks off his forehead, and we had a few words. and I went away. And the next morning, as I stepped into the station to take my train, there came a long distance telephone message, and, when I went to the booth, he says, "This is Mr. Otwell, from Illinois? My name is Joe — Joe Thompson; I am president of the Eastern Tennessee College. Tour mission has been certainly to dangerous parts; and I want you to say to your people in Illinois that you have taught us a great lesson." I told Mr. Thompson, "It is no reflection on your people. I might have gone ten miles either way, and found a boy as worthy and as poor as this one and. If he is one of our crowd, we would go across the American continent for a friend." "Well," he says, "I am glad to hear you were there." "Wall," he told me, "your train leaves at eight o'clock, and at five minutes </seg>
            <seg id="p199">199 before eight sharp there will be three hundred consecrated teachers on their knees praying for your safe return to Illinois." Well, Joe has got a nice house now; plenty In the house; got a deed of it In his own name; plenty to wear; plenty to eat; plenty to read; and plenty of medicine; all paid for; though his doctor writes me he thinks he can never get well.' BGod bless the boys of this country, and keep their hands clean, and r heads clear, and their hearts perfect They will wield an influence no human tongue can tell. (Applause.)

LIN COLN, NEB., APRIL 10, 1912. One of the questions for this Congressional Committee on Agriculture to determine is the advisability "for granting its support to the provisions of House Bill 18005. By some this bill is considered a radical diversion from accustomed methods of agricultural education, but radical diversions are. sometimes productive of much good and are but steps used in the progression of the human race. That to which we were accustomed years ago is now often considered obsolete and not for the best interests of the people. Undoubtedly you will be interested in hearing some of our reasons why we think this bill should receive your favorable consideration and support. The State Fair is recognized as a beneficial Institution in a great number of our states, and as such receives legislative support. Some of the causes for such action are that no single Institution of learning has contributed to such a great extent in accentuating the desire for pedi - greed stock as has the state, district and county fair. Here are seen the beat type of horses, cattle, sheep, and swine, the finished product, for which every farmer is striving to attain. Here are seen the best fowls for farm use, the best products of the soil, the best methods of cultivation, the best arrangement for farm buildings and fields, the best methods of rotation, of crops, the balanced ration for feeding, the various methods for the water supply, the best lighting plant, and many other educational features. Here also are seen all kinds of farm machinery, so that, should a farmer have the purchase of any particular machine in view, by attend - ing any one of our great state fairs, he can see all of the leading makes exhibited side by side, with an expert in charge who exemplifies its par - ticular merits, making it possible for him to make a judicial selection for the uses desired. Some say that such instruction at most of the fairs only lasts five days each year. We will grant that such is the case. The persons who attend are the busy men, the men of affairs, the men who provide the sinews to carry on the affairs of the county, state, and nation, the men who have no time for extended schooling at the experimental stations or schools, but must gather their Information from object lessons. </seg>
            <seg id="p201">the press, and actual experience. The school holding 180 days each year must have about 600 students to equal an attendance of 100,000, and we think that this number is about the average attendance (or all of the state fairs; many of them have several times this number. Therefore as an educational institution it is but Just to compare its efficiency with that of the school with like attendance, and we believe it is superior from the fact that an object lesson is the very best from which permanent instruc - tion can be obtained. An objection raised is that the provisions of the bill are not broad enough, that it should take in fairs owned by municipalities and other quasi-public corporations. Were it possible to make such a proceeding constitutional we would cheerfully say "amen," for we are firm in our be - lief that more solid practical instruction is Imparted for the money ex - pended than by any of the present recognized generally subsidized methods. We also believe that the conditions of this bill are broad enough to permit each state to participate in its benefits. Section 2 of the bill sets forth "That the appropriation herein made shall inure only to the use of those states which now or hereafter shall by statute recognize and make appropriation toward the establishment and support of a state fair or ex - position upon land owned by and under control of the state or a state board created by legislative enactment, and no money shall be paid out under this act to any state failing to comply with the above provisions." Generally, on close examination, we find that states recognizing state fairs are those which have been settled within the lifetime of some of us who are present. We are well aware that every new country makes strenuous effort for quick settlement, and thereby grasps every oppor - tunity for advancement, probably from the idea that publicity pays the community as well as the individual. This may account for the lack of recognition of state fairs by the older settled states, as the evolution of older communities is exceedingly conservative. It may also be consid - ered doubtful if all the states would come In under this act, as many of the large fairs are in the hands of business men who find it a profitable investment for surplus funds. Many such organizations, however, would gladly assist in securing legislative sanction to the provisions of this bill in the hope of broadening the fair's scope of usefulness to their community and state. Sections 2 and 6, as above stated, place the acceptation of its provisions wholly within the hands of the people of each individual state, and are broad enough that all may avail themselves of the opportunity offered. If all accept, it will mean an appropriation o. $4,800,000 spread out over a period of several years. In the past the assistance of Congress has been solicited and by it granted in the holding of great national expositions at some certain point representative of the ideas to be commemorated. Large appropriations for such occasions, lasting but for a season, have been made, generally with popular commendation. However, when It is fully realized that the treat distance to be traveled and the time necessarily taken has made it </seg>
            <seg id="p202">absolutely impossible for the busy man or the poor man to -avail himself of the opportunity offered for visiting these great national fairs, which fact primarily makes such appropriations especially for the benefit of the rich, or well-to-do class of our citizenship, while an appropriation under this bill would not only make it possible to construct a creditable exposi - tion in each state for the housing of an exhibit of the state's resources in a building or buildings such as in many cases can not now be en - joyed, would give the busy man, or the less well-to-do, an opportunity to visit an exposition of merit close at home, neither entailing a great loss of time nor expense. This "not well-to-do" class oftentimes includes many of our most industrious citizens, those upon whom the manual labor of life falls, those who are the bulwark of this great republic, and whose happiness is so easily overlooked. Through the passage of this bill they are the men, now deprived, who will secure an added opportun - ity for information of a valuable character coupled with good wholesome enjoyment. One of the conditions mentioned in Section 5 is "that the Govern - ment of the United States hereby reserves not to exceed twenty per centum of the space within said building so erected for departmental ex - hibits" by giving thirty days' notice. This provision may not be clearly understood. For several years it has been customary throughout the more purely agricultural states to make naval exhibits at the state fair. According to statements made by recruiting officers, the boys from the rural districts are better speciments of manhood, make sturdier soldiers, and are not addicted to cigarettes and other health-undermining vicious habits; therefore, enlistments made from the agricultural states are a paying proposition for the Government, and exhibits made for the purpose of Inducing a sturdy class of recruits is desirable to the Government for future results. Fairs managed by private corporations are oftentimes very success - ful when located adjacent to great centers of population or enjoying spe - cial railroad privileges, such as obtain in Texas, for instance, where a ridiculously low rate is made for a trip to Dallas and return from the extreme parts of this great empire. However, in these days of attempted Ead legislation it is an extremely difficult task to obtain passenger concessions in territory enjoying a less than three-cent per mile Pome of the state fairs already have well equipped grounds, as some » following values of plant will testify.

            <seg id="p271">REPORT OF THE NEBRASKA CONSERVATION AND SOIL SURVEY. By G. E. Condra, The University of Nebraska. rrhe last legislature voted the Conservation and Soil Survey $6,000 he biennium to be used for postage, publication, equipment, and expenses of conventions, laboratory, and field work. During the year several persons rendered assistance in the various lines of investi - gation without salary. Only their expenses were borne by the State. The director attended several national conventions and represented the State therein to the best of his ability. In each place he was called upon to speak for Nebraska, or upon the subject, . Conservation of Busi - ness, in which our State is assuming a leading position. Among the gatherings of this kind were: the National Conservation Congress, the National Association of Conservation Commissioners, the National Irri - gation Congress, the National Rural Life Congress, and the Kansas City Land Show. Ce a number of conventions, institutes, and other gatherings ited in Nebraska during the year. Among these were the various i held by the Nebraska Rural Life Commission, farmers' insti - tutes, teachers' institutes, the Omaha Land Show, the State Associa - tion of Commercial Clubs, the State Meetings of Associated Agriculture, etc. At these a discussion was given on one or more of the following topics: The Resources and Industries of Nebraska, Conservation of Business, Rural Sanitation and Health. Nebraska Conservation Congress. — The congress last year was largely attended, and judging by the results it murt have been a very helpful meeting. By action of the president and executive committee the congress of this year was postponed from spring to fall because of politics. That is, this was done to prevent political entanglements, for it so happened that considerable thought of Nebraskans was direct - ed, in the springtime, to a discussion of progressive and stand-pat poli - cies. Some of the speakers we had secured were known to lean very strongly towards the support of one of these policies and would have held political meetings on the side. It seemed therefore the proper thing to wait awhile with the congress, or until the preliminary lights in poli - tics were decided. Our citizens can then come together with the one dominant idea of discussing development problems that have value in Nebraska. The congress will be held late in the fall or early winter, and should be attended by hundreds of patriotic Nebraskans. Information Bureau. — During the past year hundreds of inquiries were made at the office of the director concerning the State's resources and industries. In several cases it required considerable time to pre - pare reliable reports to these inquiries. It is plainly shown by the in - terest in the State and the information desired from without that there is great need for reliable data in the form of maps, industrial reports, and other state papers. </seg>
            <seg id="p272">Conservation Problems. — A part of the fund voted by the legislature is being used for special studies. Problems connected with the sand - hills are being worked out by Professor Pool, Dr. Walker, Professor Wol - cott, Mr. Carl Modesitt, and several others. Professor Pool, of the botany department, is now in the field. He spent about three months of the past year in beginning specific studies of sand-hill forage, which will require three or four years of time, and may show results of con - siderable economic value to the State when completed. Dr. Walker and others, also of the botany department, are working on the plant life of the Band-hill lakes for the purpose of determing its relations to fish food. They are studying also the legumes in the sand-hill forage. The plant study of the sand-hills by Professor Pool, Dr. Walker, and others is being directed by Professor C. E. Bessey. All the Conservation Survey has to do in this respect is to pay a part of the traveling expenses. Dr. R. H. Wolcott has for several years conducted a survey of the native animal life of Nebraska A considerable part of his investigation has been directed to the fish life in the sand-hill lakes and to game in that region. His studies require also definite investigations in regard to the chemical composition of lake waters. Our only expense in connec - tion with Professor Wolcott's work is for car fare and a part of the field expenses. Professor Wolcott summarizes his work and results as fol- "A considerable part of the summer of 1911 was spent in the north - western part of Nebraska, mostly in Banner county, where the object was to determine the physical conditions controlling the distribution of native plants and animals to serve as an index to the agricultural possi - bilities of these regions. In this investigation the work was shared with Professor Pool. Our investigations went to prove: The conditions outside of the canyons are such as to show that e of the territory is available for agricultural purposes, though suited grazing. Rainfall is not evenly distributed, and soil belts occur throughout on which dry farming may be profitably carried out. In the canyons temperature and moisture conditions are such as to indicate that a considerable amount of fruit-growing could be made profitable "2. So far as animal culture is concerned, numerous opportunities for the development of ponds in which fish culture could be carried on are presented by the drainage ditches, and there has been, up to the present time, no step taken in the direction of realizing such possibilities. It would seem also that in the canyons were numerous places where it would be feasible to establish farms for the rearing of fur-bearing animals for their fur. "Our studies were renewed in Cherry county. The problem of the sand-hill lakes, with particular reference to their availability for the rear - ing of fish, has resolved itself into the investigation of two distinct ques - tions. It seems probable that the percentage of salts in these lakes may directly affect the fish and determine the availability of any given pond for fish culture. Tbie problem has been attacked in the laboratory In </seg>
            <seg id="p273">I'Kih KEDINQS NEBRASKA STATE BOABD OF AORICLLTIRK T7» connection with the investigation work of the departments of chemistry and zoology, but as yet no definite results have been attained. Another feature which undoubtedly is important in determining the availability of these ponds in the culture of fish is the problem of food supply, though it is probable that this in the long run will resolve itself into a question of the degree of alkalinity, since in the lakes which are more strongly alkaline the growth of an abundant aquatic veg'tation is impossible, and in the absence of this the development of a varied and continuous supply of animal food for the fish is out of the question. Much of the time during the past summer was devoted to an investigation of the tempera - ture conditions within the lake, and here the vegetation has a very marked effect, holding the temperature down during the summer and maintaining it at a higher level in the winter, in proportion to the amount of vegetation present. It is hoped that these investigations may be fur - ther supplemented by field work during the summer of 1912, and that on the basis of this, together with the work done in the laboratory and by the department of botany, it may be possible within the next year to make more definite statements than can now be made as to the precise conditions which must be present in any given pond in order to make it profitable to undertake fish culture." Mr. Carl Modesitt has made a special study of the chemical composi - tion of the sand-hill lakes during the past year. He finds potash apparently of economic importance in a few lakes. He will continue his study during the current year. Scenic and Historic, Placet. — Mr. A. E. Sheldon, director of the Nebraska Legislative Reference Bureau, who has an intimate acquaintance with Nebraska, is to report upon the conservation of certain scenic and historic places in the State. This will require a small expense for field work in securing photographs and data. Rural Sanitation and Health. — For several years certain persons con - nected with the University and working with the health bureaus, physi - cians, teachers, and many others, have been interested in a survey of rural sanitation in Nebraska. During the past year a small part of the Conser - vation fund was used for this purpose. Addresses on the subject were made by the director at several agricultural conventions. A discussion on rural sanitation and health is included in this report. Conservation of Business. — Nebraska has assumed a leading place in the agitation for business on the square. The director of this survey advo - cated the application of conservation principles to business two yean before the Blue Sky Law was passed In Kansas, first at a national conser - vation meeting at Washington, D. C, in 1908, then at National Conserva - tion Congresses at Seattle, in 1909, St. Paul In 1910, and Kansas City In 1911. At these places the attention of many states was called to the im - portance of safeguarding business by compelling illegitimate concerns to abandon their promotion. In cooperation with several state organisa - tions a special committee is now framing a law for introduction to the (3) .8 </seg>

A brief discussion of this topic is found elsewhere tn this report. Farm Management. — During the past two years the conservation fund has been drawn upon for use in defraying a part of the field expenses of persons engaged by the United States Department of Agriculture in making a Farm Management Surrey of Nebraska. This work is done in cooperation with the Farm Management Department of the University, and directed by Professor Pugsley. Two counties have been about completed. Soil Surveys. — The State Soil Survey is directed from the University. Its field work is being projected as rapidly as possible consistent with the funds available for its support. During the past year Professors Bengtson, Scarborough, and Lackey were at work in the Big Nemaha, Weeping Water, and Logan valleys. This summer a complete soil survey of Otoe county is to be finished by the joint work of the United States Bureau of Soils and the Nebraska Soil Survey, each paying half of the expenses. State work is to be carried on in several counties. 8tudy of Selected Industries. — The Survey is gathering information on the various leading industries of the State. This can be done at relatively small expense because of the opportunities afforded to reach all par's of the State in connection with other work, and because of the availability of good cameras and other necessary equipment. It will require much time and careful work to make these investigations. The aim will be to secure only reliable facts and to assemble them in a way that will present the truth without misrepresentation. Nebraska has been slow to gather and publish information concerning her resources, industries, and commercial development. The time has come, in the opinion of many citizens, when we should do this work. After the industrial facts have been assembled, let their dissemination or publication be placed in competent and respon - sible hands. Publicity. — There Is a growing demand for state publicity in Nebraska. This demand is held in common with several other states, especially the newer ones. Just what part the Conservation Survey is to assume in this publicity Is not determined. It may only supply data for a department yet to be created. The purpose of such publicity is not fully agreed. The tendency towards unwarranted promotion, such as occurs in some states, should be avoided because such advertisement works a positive injury in the long run. A few advocates of publicity appear to think that the princi - pal object should be to attract people to Nebraska to increase the popula - tion. Others want to advertise the resources and industries at large. We will not discuss the strong and weak points in each of these purposes, but will venture to state that a yet more useful object of publicity would be the advocacy of useful facts within the State. Publicity of this kind wou'J promote development by doing a kind of industrial extension work. Its data would be supplied from the various organizations and departments directly connected with industrial development, experiment station work, and field surveys. This brief resume is followed by special papers on conservation work (4) </seg>
            <seg id="p275">275 KHRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRJCULTURB ff» THE CONSERVATION OF RURAL HEALTH By G. E. Condra.* This paper is a health message for people in the country and small towns. It is based on information gathered by persons who have had opportunity to study rural conditions in Nebraska, visiting thousands of homes in different parts of the State. Among those who have contributed are: State food inspectors, commissioners of public health, city health commissioners, several physicians with country practice, many farmers and rural teachers, and the Dean of the Medical College of the University of Nebraska. As a result of these observations and experience therewith, certain specific things that should prove helpful in improving rural life are herein recited. They are given without bias and should be so considered. The striking thing in the development of public health in the United States, and apparently so in Nebraska, is that the country is not keeping pace with the city. It is evident, also, that the country presumes too much on its healthful conditions, and fails to develop certain advantages which it has over the city. Let it be understood that Nebraskans have better than average health, a fact worthy of praise, but that our pride should not serve to pre - vent the best possible conservation of life. It should not be our purpose, therefore, to lead other states, but to become as healthy as possible, know - ing that human health and life are the State's greatest resources. Let the ideal be the development of the largest possible number of healthy persons capable of rendering efficient service, physically and otherwise, and lit to bear the new generation. Viewed in the light of conservation, bad health is not a resource but the opposite; good health, the normal condition, is always at a premium. Most attention first given to conservation was to the physical resources. fhen to the betterment of strains and breeds of crops and farm animals. This bore fruit in many lessons concerning life which are now known to apply in some measure to the conservation of people. Today more than usual consideration is manifest for the development of public health and ability to work. Health is promoted by many popular and scientific organ - izations. State departments deal directly or indirectly with the conserva - tion of most vital resources, including man. The Federal government is about to establish a department of public health. The new turn in con - servation is in order and timely, for reliable authority places the number of dangerously sick persons in the United States at about 3,000,000 and the annual deaths at about 1,500,000, of which more than 600,000 are by disease nP3rly wholly preventable.

            <seg id="p276">2N PROCEEDINGS XEHKASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICL'LTl RE in such a death rate represents a vast sum. Good authority has placed the national loss from preventable sickness, preventable death, and the necessary care demanded therewith at about two billion dollars a year. It is plainly evident that too many people are sick in the United States, causing such an expense and requiring so much time in the way of care and medical treatment. The way to check a part of this loss of time and life is being found. Students of the subject say that sickness is reduced, the death rate de - creased, and the average length of life prolonged about in proportion as individuals and the public practice the principles of personal hygiene and sanitation. So, it appears that the great need of this time is a more definite and reliable knowledge of the cause and prevention of disease. Cause of Disease. — Only a short time back in history law-giving, relig - ions ceremony, and healing were practiced by one and the same individual. Then practically nothing was known of the cause, and consequently very little of the prevention and treatment of disease. During the past cen - tury, and the past twenty-five years especially, scientists have given much time to the investigation of diseases as produced by natural causes. The microscope made it possible to study the minute forms of life and deter - mine their relations to higher life. Such investigation gave a new con - ception of many diseases, in which the cause is found to be in the lower forms of life, such as bacteria and minute animal parasites, that gain access to the body and feed upon it when and where the conditions are favorable. Not all bacteria are of the disease-producing kind; in fact many of them do a beneficial work, especially in the field of agriculture. Most diseases that spread from person to person are said to be contagious because they are catching. Society finds it necessary to guard against the spread of such by the use of disinfectants, in which the germs are killed, aid by quarantine, in which the sick are isolated for a safe period of time. Though there are many disease-producing organisms, not all of them have been studied in detail. Certain ones are known to cause specific diseases such as cholera, yellow fever, scarlet fever, diphtheria, measles, chicken-pox, whooping-cough, tonsilitis, mumps, syphilis, tuberculosis, etc. Put in a simple way, it may be said that our bodies represent the soil or ground and the germs the seed, which, if it finds a suitable place to grow and multiply In the body, does so, thereby causing a particular kind of disease. following, if done, would assist in reducing the amount of sickness death by contagious diseases: 1. Cleaning up the farmstead and thus destroying filth, the home of specific germs. 2. Preventing the spread of germs from host to host. 3. Increasing the resistance of the body to germ infection through proper attention to diet and elimination. A knowledge of contagious disease is giving rise to public sanitation which is rapidly gaining prominence in the various civilized countries. The United States succeeded with its wars in Cuba and the Philippines, (1) </seg>
            <seg id="p277">277 PROCEKDING8 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AOBICIXTURE H7 and with the Panama Canal chiefly because of sanitation. Yellow fever and malaria especially were stamped out by the use of scientific knowl - edge. No one will deny the wisdom of cleaning up Cuba and the Philip - pines, but why not apply sanitary knowledge of such importance to our own situation in the interior of the United States, especially in the rural districts? It would make the people healthier, and prolong their lives from ten to fifteen years. It is important to know how disease gets into our bodies, or, in other words, how it is transmitted Means of Transmission. — Transmission or spread of disease-producing organisms is mainly through air, water, food, and by insects. The fly and mosquito play a large part in spreading tuberculosis, typhoid, and malaria. In some diseases transmission is mainly by contact of persons; to be more exact, by the contact of parts of their bodies. Some diseases are trans - mitted more in one way than another; consequently they are known as air-borne, water-borne, or food-borne diseases, etc. Knowing this, one should guard against infection from the different sources. It should be more generally understood that a person suffering from a contagious disease, such as tuberculosis, typhoid, or syphilis, may become a menace to society unless the necessary safeguards are observed. He is unclean, and therefore a probable source of danger. t Sanitary Water.— Drinking water of the farmstead should be guarded extreme care, for it may become the leading medium through which ise is carried to the body. Attention is paid to the kind of water supplied to farm animals, for a good quality is necessary to produce health and a rapid growth. Some farmers argue against pond water and polluted stream water for stock. Much of this is well-founded, for It is good busi - ness. Be that as it may, we are sure that farmers should consider the water problem as having great importance as a factor in human health. As a rule, the domestic water supplies of Nebraska are obtained from wells. It is purer than that from streams, lakes, and most other sources. Furthermore, the well water supply of our State is one of the best to be found in any country. Notwithstanding this fact, there is need for im - provement at many places. A considerable number of wells are located on either alkali or hard-water formations whereas near by, and sometimes on the same farm, supplies could be secured of better quality. It is the duty, therefore, of the farmer to seek out the best possible supply of water, getting that which is most ideal from the standpoint of health. The lead - ing thing to guard against in most wells is organic pollution from slops, garbage, barnyards and privies. A better knowledge of the nature and source of well water would serve to show the cause of such pollution. Briefly stated, the rain water, except that which runs off, soaks into the ground and percolates downward to the water table. Below this the sub - soil is completely saturated, and the water moves slowly in the direction of the lower land, where it may come to the surface In the form of seepage or springs. During its percolation and slow underflow in the ground, the water gathers up more or less organic matter, including germs of </seg>
            <seg id="p278">278 XK PSOCKBDINO8 NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRK TI.Tl UK disease. If they are present, and may carry them to the well. The well is an artificial opening in the ground extending down to and below the water table. The more water used therefrom the greater the movement to it by underflow. The following statements are intended to be of use in making well water more sanitary: 1. The privy or cesspool should not be placed too close to the well. The distance can not be definitely given because of differences in the texture and structure of the ground. In many places privies and wells are not more than twenty-five to fifty feet apart. Such situation; should be regarded as positively dangerous unless the well is deep and the subsoil very close textured. The only safe practice is to widely separate the well or sources of water from the place in which is placed the most dangerous of matter, namely, the excreta of the human body. The deeper the well the less the danger from this source, as a rule. 2. Wells should be placed on higher ground than farm buildings, lots, and privies, especially, if possible. This gives surface drainage away from the well and not to it. A better rule than this, since many farm homes are on valley and upland plains, is to locate the well up-valley or up-plain from the house, lots, and privy. In this way the underflow, extending with the general slope of the land, comes to the well before being polluted. To meet this condition, most wells in the State should be west or northwest of the house and outbuildings. This is because the general slope and drainage, both surface and underground, is eastward or southeastward. The water, if polluted while passing under the outbuild - ings and lots, has ample time to purify before reaching the next farmstead on the plain. Often the general unqualified statement is made that wells should be placed on higher ground than the rest of the improvements of the farmstead. Such a rule would not hold good at all points on valley sides, as along the Republican and Niobrara valleys, where such a location would not prove feasible because of a lack of water at some places. 3. Open wells should be cleaned frequently for the purpose of remov - ing any dangerous matter that may have fallen into them or blown into them. Closed wells are safer than open wells. 4. The ground should be graded up around the well to carry the sur - face drainage away from it. Furthermore, the opening should be tightly covered to prevent the intake of excreta from birds, chickens, etc. This will also guard against the entry of mice, rats, frogs, and rabbits, and the unsanitary effects resulting therefrom. 5. In most parts of the State the water is in sand beds called first, second, and third water, etc., and separated by thin clay layers. The first water at places is more alkalied than the second or third water. It is also apt to contain more organic pollution, being on that account less desirable for drinking purposes. It is recommended, therefore, that the second, third, or lower water be used when available. It is positively known from many examinations that too little care is given to the conservation of healthful water supplies. In many instances farmers are using water from wells in which are remains of dead animals. </seg>
            <seg id="p279">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE tit In some cases the hair from these being brought to the surface by pumping or in the bucket is apparently not sufficient evidence to indicate the possi - ble presence of an animal in the well. Chickens and geese on some farms have access to the covering of the well in which the boards lie loosely. Many wells are not graded, thus receiving a portion of the surface drain - age from yards and lots, as the case may be. In a few places this drainage is from manure piles on which have been thrown human excreta, making a dangerous situation. Disease is also spread by careless methods of using drinking water supplied from sanitary sources. Germs of the sick are carried to new hosts by drinking in common from buckets, dippers, cups, etc. Host com - munities have patients suffering from tuberculosis, and the contact of their lips with the cup or other vessel is apt to leave germs thereon. The next person using the cup may receive the germs into his body. A knowl - edge of hygiene and sanitation should be sufficient to cause us to refuse to accept this risk or chance of becoming infected. The "old oaken bucket" from which tramps and all others could drink to their mutual danger has no virtue in the light of knowledge. Neither have sentiment and igno - rance a place in the conservation of health. The criminality of using drinking cups in common is established. Not a few, however, some farmers included, believe these things to be faddish, thus in a small way retarding progress in health development. It is now very generally agreed that all public drinking places should be so installed as not to permit the slobbers of one person to enter the body of another. The use of drinking fountains and individual cups is therefore a sane, sanitary measure, and should be encouraged. This is not so necessary in the home because all members of the family may have good health. It is the part of good judgment, however, to discourage the old practice wherever there is apt to be any danger, as in schools and churches. Individual cups and towels should be used by each sick member of the family. Unsanitary water should not be used until sterilized by boiling or by the use of cal - cium chloride. Drinking from streams in thickly settled communities Is to be dis - couraged, because such water may be polluted from the carcases of dead animals, excreta of farm animals, and the bowel discharge of people. Many examples of sickness and death are known to result from the care - less use of such unprotected water. Furthermore, persons accustomed to a given water supply should be on their guard when traveling through the country and drinking from unsanitary wells. It is the part of wisdom to refrain from drinking such water. In some localities, practically every well is safe, in others most are unsafe. Many examples of typhoid are traceable to unsanitary welte; the same is true of local epidemics. Many intestinal diseases as dysentery, diarrhea, typhoid, etc., are transmitted by water. It is good economy for the country to guard against the spread of water-borne disease because of their bad effects on society. Let it be known that pure water is absolutely indispensable to health, and that the supply should be guarded both as to source and method of use. (6) </seg>
            <seg id="p280">280 the value and importance of good air and ventilation. This has resulted in considerable improvement. Today the theory is known, but much of practical value remains to be emphasized. Our investigations show that certain things should be done to improve the quality of air in Bleeping rooms, especially. The air conditions In the farm homes are unsanitary, a* a rule. Many places are found in which little attention is given to ven - tilation. The only system of ventilation, with few exceptions, is by win - dows and doors, which really is not a system at all. Several homes were visited in which three, four, or more persons sleep in a room with one window for ventilation, and that usually closed. Such a condition is harm - ful to health, for close confinement during the night, and breathing again and again of vitiated air tends to destroy rest, weaken the vitality, and increase the possibility of contagion. It is not difficult to understand why rural people bouse themselves so closely. During the day they are in the open air, and coming to the house, the close quarters and quiet air seem an agreeable contrast to the cold and wind. So the tendency is to overdo the matter. This should not be, for all people need an abundance of good air at all times. It is recommended that the windows be opened to let in fresh air, which is necessary for life. The night air is not harmful, as bo many believe. There is more of superstition and fear in this belief than there is of common sense. Each sleeping room should have two or more windows. It is easy to provide against drafts by use of window boards. Drafts of pure air do little damage to health. • The average temperature in farm homes is too high in winter. Except the presence of a very young child the ideal temperature during this season is about 69 degrees. Too high temperature, with low relative humidity, is directly responsible for some of the catarrhal and other troubles affecting the nasal and throat cavities. In giving healthful air to the farm home, and for that matter to all buildings in which people are gathered, four things should be kept in mind: 1. Ventilation in which an adequate supply of fresh air is supplied for every occupant This means four or five times as much as most people are now getting. 2. Temperature at about the right degree, not being too low, nor too high, especially. It Is to be reduced in summer and not made too high in winter. 3. Humidity as near the normal for a given temperature as possible. Keep a liberal quantity of water evaporating on the stove in winter. 4. The introduction of an abundance of sunshine, the great natural disinfectant. It dries out the room. It may fade a rug, but it will assist in giving the right color to the cheek. Lift the shades, open the shutters, pull back the curtains and let the sunshine in. It is the symbol of life, as darkness is of death. It is observed that not only do too many persons occupy a bedroom according to its size and ventilation, but that in some cases there is </seg>
            <seg id="p281">281 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE SB. extreme carelessness as to the cleanness of bed clothing. Its odor should indicate the need for washing. Agitation in the State for hotel sheets of a given size and free from dirt, as brought about by the traveling public, It a sane safeguard against the transmission of venereal and other diseases, and should meet with the commendation of rural people. Yet a more important movement for country and city alike would be a campaign of education for the specific purpose of improving the cleanness of the other bed clothing as well, some of which does not go to the laundry for weeks, or to the clothesline for air and sunshine, for months. There is no good excuse for bad air in rural homes of our broad coun - try. In the crowded city, however, where one or more families may be forced to occupy a single room, it is less possible to devise the necessary safeguards. The country, through neglect, is deceasing its vitality and leading the city only by a slight margin in its freedom from tuberculosis, which is traceable in considerable part to the quality of air breathed in the home, factory, and public buildings. The death rate from this cause in the country is about 136.6 per 100,000 persons annually; in the city it is about 198.3 per 100,000 annually. An organized campaign for good air in the rural homes, schools, and churches of Nebraska and for sanitary water supplies would soon result in lengthening human life and increasing its efficiency. Sanitary Food. — Much sickness in Nebraska is traceable to a poor quality of food. The State has a food and drug department which guards the quality, weight, and correct naming of foods. This department spends most of its time with inspection at places of manufacture and sale, requir - ing all unsanitary bakeries, dairies, stores, etc., to clean up or quit busi - ness. There is Federal inspection of animals and meats at the large stock-yards and packing houses. It would seem that all would be in full sympathy with State and Federal inspection of foods and drugs, but such is not the case; for frequent complaints and criticisms are heard, usually from persons representing selfish interests. It would further seem that no one would seek private gain at the expense of public health. Perhaps the worst situation of this kind at present is in the sale of habit-producing drugs. It is worth while for rural people to be diligently on their guard against the use of unsanitary foods, whether bought from the town or pro - duced at home. Fruits and vegetables of the farm are usually fresh and clean. The meats may come from local slaughter houses or farm produc - tion without inspection, giving more danger than is usually supposed. On this account, beef and pork should be well cooked to kill tubercular germs in the first named and parasites in the second named. How to keep fresh meat in the country is a problem because ice is not available at many places. As a result, cured and preserved meats are largely used. Eggs, usually fresh, and chickens make up for most of the drawback. In some respects the food supply of the country is more healthful than that of the city. Substantial articles of diet are used and not so many nick-nacks. Cooking is quite well done, but too little thought is given to food values, such as might properly be included in each meal. </seg>
            <seg id="p282">282 Wl PKOOEEDIMJS S .TK BOARD &lt;&gt;F AUKU TLTLRE Eiis respect the men, by their knowledge of balanced feed, show more tical knowledge in stock feeding than the women do for the family. Not enough care is given to the milk supply in the country. The milk is fresh, but too often not clean. Sanitation in this line will develop as: 1. Milk is used from healthy cows only. 2. Cows are given good water, good food, and sanitary stables. 13. The milking is made clean in every respect. Through carelessness lay become polluted with manure and dirt from the cow's udder, the lean hands of milkers, and dirty palls. 4. The milk is given sanitary care. This means clean, covered ves - sels, made so by washing and scalding; handling with clean hands; and cooling in the water tank, cave, or refrigerator free from the odor of decaying foods. Milk is an ideal culture medium for the germs of typhoid, scarlet fever, diphtheria, and diarrhea. I Dish washing is carelessly done in many homes. Not enough suitable p and soda are used to dissolve grease and other matter. Too often dishes and silverware are not scalded to sterilize them, and the wiping lot always done with clean towels, also sterilized. In some homes, the hes and silverware used by one sick with a contagious disease are &gt;wed to be used by some other person at the next meal without rough cleaning. Such carelessness is nearly criminal. Food for an ant should never be chewed by the mother or other person before giving the child. t Drudgery and Overwork.— The tendency among farmers is to decrease er than increase hard work. This has advantages as well as disad - ages. There are few cases of overwork among men. Overwork is t common among boys and girls during the period of adolescence. A ! more concern and thought by parents for this stage of development Id give stronger and healthier men and women, for persons forced to i too hard during adolescence are apt to be weakened thereby and e more susceptible to disease. Rural women sometimes fare badly. In fact, quite a few of them are overworked much of the time, even to the point of drudgery. This does not add to the strength of rural life, for overworked women are not capa - ble of being the best possible mothers. In many cases the mother receives bad care at the time of a child-birth. It would be of great value to the health of our State if it were generally understood that the rural mother should be allowed to rest two, and preferably three weeks at such time before again taking up the regular routine of housework. Furthermore, neighbor women should not be allowed to bother her with useless gossip. tRest, Work, and Play. — These are necessary every day in the life of I people. In fact, the normal person rightly divides his time between work, and play. This is true of both young and old. Farmers believe in work, and rightly so, for by it they obtain the necessities and luxuries of life. Let it be understood, also, that work Is a process in the education and health of every individual. It is </seg>
            <seg id="p283">283 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Ml largely by his own work that the education of an individual la made pos - sible. The opposite of work is leisure, which impoverishes the individual and to that extent decreases the resources of the community. A leisure class is not productive, neither ts it as healthful as a working class. The farmer has full opportunity to work, and therein lfes a part of the secret of his success. Play is necessary for rural people as well as work. It calls them away from the more arduous duties and makes them to be glad each with the other. It offers real fun and recreation, the lubricants of life. It makes people live longer, happier, and healthier. Too much play, on the con - trary, at the expense of work and rest, makes people of little force and not capable of rendering much service to society. The one who plays when it is in order will live longer and do more work than others in the long run. There should be family play and recreation in the home. Systematic rest, especially by the young, gives time for rejuvenation. The necessary sleep, an average of about eight hours a day, should be the lot of most people. Irregular periods of rest, as for example, that caused by too late hours, develops bad health and inefficiency, if carried to extremes. The three great functions above named have about equal importance in the life of an individual, and are either directly or Indirectly of value to the conservation of personal and public health. Too often the individual fails in his ability to rightly and sanely divide his time between rest, work, and play. His habits may lead too much towards development In one line. If so, one who goes to the extreme is regarded as being either lazy, a grind, or a sport. Clothing and Exposure. — This topic has less importance in rural sani - tation in Nebraska than most others. An increasing tendency is being manifested for the use of sanitary clothing, such as will not Impair health. Examples of this kind are too numerous for discussion in this place. The underclothing should be kept scrupulously clean because it is close to the body. A rule of considerable importance might be observed by school children and other members of the family. It is that all wet clothing should be replaced with dry garments as soon as possible* after the person comes Indoors or is permitted to rest. It is generally agreed that wet clothing rarely hurts any one so long as he Is actually moving about. Exposure results mainly from quick changes in weather. If the gov - ernment weather reports had a more general distribution in the homes and schools these changes would be known In time for use, and would be of value in so far as they are correct. Such information might be used more generally to enable the children to suitably prepare for school, and for the use of persons preparing for trips away from home. It is believed that most cases of harmful exposure are due to freaks of weather and to thoughtlessness, rather than to deliberate imposition. An example easy to classify was brought to our notice last winter. It was in the northern part of the State, where a father and his son were in attend - ance at a farmers' institute and corn show. They bought a valuable </seg>
            <seg id="p284">284 »4 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE pigeon to the show. It was the proud possession of the father. Of course. this pigeon, with its beautiful and symmetrically developed leg feathers, won the prize here as it had at other places. The day was stormy; the pigeon was kept indoors and not allowed to grow cold. The boy, whose shoe soles were worn through, exposing his feet to the cold and ground, was caused to drive seven or eight miles through the blizzard to bis home. Happily he did not freeze. The rugged person can and should stand more or less hardship and exposure if necessary. There is a tenedncy, however, to overdo the matter perhaps in both directions — one in overanxiety and the other by MtfMt Sanitary Homes. — Country homes vary greatly in their healthfulness between those that are sanitary and those that are extremely unhealthful The older houses were, with few exceptions, built according to custom and for size, without much concern for the health of the occupants. The newer houses evidence a marked change for the betterment of rural life. The latest advance in this line is an attempt to plan for each agricultural district in the State such types of houses as will most nearly suit the various needs. The houses are to be sanitary or as nearly so as seems practicable. Due regard is given to size and cost, to the number, size, and arrangement of rooms, and to ventilation, heating, illumination, water supply for drinking and bathing, sewage and garbage disposal. The house is properly located in relation to drainage, groves, outbuildings and lou. the object being to provide sunshine, protection against winds and dampness, and to avoid the odors from stable and family sewage. Further - more, the barns, sheds, and lots are grouped in a way that saves time and labor in feeding and in doing other work. It is plain, therefore, that health and labor conditions are coming to receive more thought in planning new homes than do mere art and so-called beauty. The first thing to do in making a new home is to plan it In all its parts. The second is to keep it clean. A clean home, well planned, is an Inviting place. A dirty home with its darkness, dust, odors, and grease-covered cupboards, is not home at all. It needs fumigation, air, sunshine, hot water (boiling), soap, iyid scrubbing. Every house, whether poorly or well planned as to architecture, should be kept clean by daily attention and systematic cleaning. The clean home Is necessary for public health, and rural communities should demand It of the few delinquents, even by law and inspection if necessary. Some houses, so called, are dark, damp, and gloomy. They cause sickness, crime, and death. A real rural house is clean, light, and cheery. It causes health and purposeful life. Garbage is principally waste food, usually in the form of scraps. Included therewith may be trash and ashes, which should be disposed of In separate places. In no case should the garbage be thrown indiscriminately from the kitchen door onto the back yard, there to decay. The better way is to place It in covered cans, the accumulation to be carried to the pigs at regular times. The garbage disposal may include some of the kitchen </seg>
            <seg id="p285">• 285 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATIC BOARD OF 10BICULTUM 2» waters and most of the slops. The pig pen should not be too close to the house for reasons known to all. K Sewage includes wash water, animal manure, sputum, and the bowel urinary discharges of people. Animal manure is a nuisance because of its odors, and in making breeding places for flies. Apparently there is no good reason for storing the manure in piles at stables and barns. Sputum is not usually given much thought in the average house unless it is from an infected person; it is then burned or should be. The habit of chewing and spitting on the part of men and boys does not add to the cleanness of the home. Bowel and urine eliminations are made at chance places about the farmstead, at the barn, in privies, enclosed closets, or In vessels in the house. Such elimination should be at as nearly regular periods from every person as possible. Lack of regard for this simple rule of hygiene, which is better than cathartics, leads to bad disorders. Human excreta should not be allowed to stand uncovered in the house. The safest way to dispose of the fecal matter from an infected person is to either disinfect it with chemicals or burn it. Otherwise its germs may be scat - tered by flies. About ninety per cent of our rural homes have privies or cesspools, and these are nearly all unsanitary. A very good way is to so place cans in the privy that they may be removed and the matter taken therefrom and either disinfected and spread upon the ground, or, if not disinfected, buried in a safe place. Flies must be kept out of the privy for reasons yet to be The excreta of most country privies is freely exposed to flies. The flies move between privies, the dining-room, kitchen, and the bed-room without much hindrance, at places. Such a situation is very dangerous be - cause of the fact that flies deal principally in decaying matter, their feet being adapted for the carrying of such filth, including germs. In this way eliminations from the human body are carried to foods and consequently are eaten therewith. The fly Is exceedingly dangerous in infected districts, where the excreta from tubercular patients, in the form of sputum, and of bowel discharge from typhoid patients, are not burned, treated by chemi - cal disinfectants, or covered. From such places germs by the millions may be carried to the pantry or kitchen unless the food is shielded by cover or screen. The principal thing that assists in checking the spread of disease by flies in Nebraska is a lack of infection. It is evident that flies should be shut out of rural homes. Their presence in large numbers indi - cates filth. The necessary safeguards in the disposal of kitchen waters, slops, garbage, barn-yard manure, privy accumulations, and other decaying matter on the farmstead will check their breeding and thereby decrease the number. Most rural houses are screened to keep out flies and mosqui - toes. Fly-breeding homes lose out in the struggle with only traps and fly - paper. Mosquitoes are a menace in some homes in the State. They cause con - siderable discomfort, but are to be feared mainly as a source of malaria. Science has definitely proved that malaria can not thrive without the </seg>
            <seg id="p286">286 SH PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE mosquito. The easiest way, then, to guard against the spread of this disease Is not by screens alone, but by destroying the breeding place of the mosquito. The following statements are said to be true: 1. "No stagnant water, no mosquitoes." 2. "No mosquitoes, no malaria." rce and rats should be kept out of the house and other farm build- The bubonic plague that gained a foothold In California was spread most part by rats. If there should be an outbreak of this disease in Nebraska it would be difficult to stop. The rat eats much grain and is of no use. It is nearly as filthy as the fly. Home Inspection. — This should be for two purposes, one to note the condition of the home and the other to examine the health of the family. The time Is quite sure to come when persons educated for the work will visit all farm homes at regular periods to consult with the people concern- Ing sanitary conditions. Not only should the home be studied and kept in proper condition, but the members of the family should receive constant health care from some one. The head of the family must assume the responsibility of this inspection. He should be able to note a defect in sight or hearing, and to detect a skin disease or an ailment of the nasal cavity or of the teeth. Over eighty per cent of Nebraska's children of school age are said to be physically defective in some way. These defects hinder home and school work, and if not corrected by medical attention often lead to serious results. No child is at his best when suffering from a defect; neither is the parent. Such ailments affect the disposition of an individual and usually for the worse. A bad tooth may cause a quarrel between parents. Bad teeth in children of third and fourth grade ages may make them miserable and thereby affect the school deportment. Defective vision or a nasal impediment in breathing may retard a" boy or a girl six months or more in school. Good economy and proper regard for health demand that physical defects be treated as soon as they are detected, and that the treatment be done by a reputable physician. Next to the parent and teacher the physi - cian is most concerned in the physical welfare of the family. It does not Kto delay in remedying defects. If, in the opinion of competent medical ce, a patient should be taken to the hospital for an operation, it should one, as a rule. Cily Medicines. — Whereas a few remedies should be kept in the me for use in treating burns, cuts, colds, and the like, it is not wise to indulge too generally in patent medicines. Practically all patent medicines advertised to cure any and every disease, especially those of a serious nature, are apt to have little or no value. They may work positive harm. Such preparations are made to sell rather than to cure. Some patent medicines, however, may be used with safety in the home. They are prepared by reputable persons or companies and for the purpose of treating specific ailments. The habit-producing drugs and medicines should be avoided. Sanitary Schools- — The statements made in connection with the dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p287">cussion of the sanitary home will apply in part to the school. The number of persons here is larger, however, and the possibility of disease-catching is thereby increased for every individual. The school is influenced by the family health. As a rule too little concern is had for school health, as Is shown by a lack of sanitation in lighting, heating, ventilation, the water supply, and furniture. The ideal exposure from which sunlight should be received into • school is the southeast, yet it comes from the west and even from the north in many buildings. As a rule not much thought is given to ventila - tion, with the result that children are rendered inefficient in their studies by bad air. In a few places the pupils drink in common from cups and buckets, but in most places fountains or other sanitary provisions are made. Rarely is the well cleaned or the water standing in it pumped out at the end of vacation before the new term of school begins. The furni - ture of the school is not, as a rule, suited to the size of the pupils, resulting in many abnormal physical developments, such as lateral curvature of the spine, sunken chests, etc. A state department is now making plans for rural schools. School boards should welcome the results of such unselfish work in which, without cost, each district can secure desired data as to sanitary school buildings. It should be evident that miscellaneous spitting is more to be feared in the school than in the home, and that floors need scrubbing as well as sweeping. Also, that sweeping should be done in a way that prevents dust from rising. The best time to sweep and dust is at the close of school each day. Feather dusters scatter dust, and for this reason are less sanitary than cloths. The schoolroom should be disinfected by fumigation after each case of contagious disease, and books used by a pupil with a serious contagious disease should be burned. School Inspection. — This is for the double purpose of detecting the condition of the school and pupils. It gives to the teacher a definite knowledge of the physical condition of her students, which information has great value in school management. It often serves to show why a given pupil may be backward and thus retarded in his work. If the inspection could be done in cooperation with that of the home and with the full support of the parent, it would result in mutual benefit to the home and school. There are only a few places where rural schools are given careful inspection in our State. Many teachers, however, are learning how to give attention to this important cause. The school inspection of pupils is necessarily more complicated than that of persons in the home because of the greater variety of conditions. Several beneficial results have come from school inspection in the towns of Nebraska. For example, a boy twelve years old was found to be backward in his work, and the teacher, in making inquiry for the cause soon learned that he had difficulty in breathing; the chest had become sunken and the body somewhat deformed. Other boys of his age were noticeably stronger than the defective one and could outdo him In all of </seg>
            <seg id="p288">288 M PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE the games and contests The examination showed that the defective boy's breathing was due to adenoids in the nasal cavity. The parents having noticed the ill effects, had done nothing for the boy, but upon the recom - mendation of the teacher took him to a nose specialist who removed the adenoids. Within a year thereafter the boy regained his normal health, increased in size and strength, trounced most of his playmates, and made up his back work in school. Other examples might be cited to show how physical health affects the progress of pupils. Just what form health inspection is to assume in the home and rural school is not known. We only know that it is needed and that from the standpoint of conservation it would pay many times over in the long run. Our present method of habitual neglect is producing criminals on the one •lde and invalids on the other. Such dependents are natural products and very costly to the public. Relations to Town and City Life. — Practically all country people go to town with more or less frequency. Too many of them go there per - manently. The small town especially is an outgrowth of the demands of rural people for trading, church, social life, and vice. The small town in Nebraska is an index to the economic, moral, educational, and health con - dition of its community. The larger places become more specialized in business. They commercialize everything, including recreation and vir - tue. Such places are confronted with more health problems than the country and town, but by greater care, decrease the handicap. Good business in the larger towns and cities demands clean streets, healthful water supplies, and sanitation in the homes and places Qf business. By these and other effective means the death rate is decreased. In some places typhoid has nearly disappeared. Likewise diphtheria, tuberculosis, etc., are noticeably on the decline. LMany young people leave the country for the town. Their health vigor are a distinct gain to urban life. A good many retired farmers with ungrown ohildren go to town permanently. This often results badly especially for the children. Old men from the country do not as a rule know how to live in crowded places. They sit on boxes and counters, and talk much, but say little of value. They vote against town water supplies, sewerage, etc. The children, having no regular duties, drift into habits that would put the town boy to shame. The average farmer should retire on the farm where he can best live. The following suggestions are intended to have importance for rural people while in the town or city: tl. Do not drink water from a well located too close to a source of pol - m. Some small towns have no public water supply, but secure drink - water from many wells badly located. In fact, the house, privy, and are placed on a single lot as a rule. EDo not eat figs, dates, and other fruit exposed to the street. They to be covered more or less with small particle of manure and many that have come from the street and the sputum of the walks. Flies ' currents are carrying such material to fruit stands and stores and </seg>
            <seg id="p289">289 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE M» thereby contaminate the food that is exposed. Apple* are In some cases polished by fruit venders using spit and the sleeve. Lemonade and pop - corn may or may not be clean. 3. Select a sanitary place in which to secure a meal. Let the food be wholesome rather than dainty. A little observation will show that most restaurants are quite clean, yet there are a good many in which the envi - rons at the rear of the buildings are dirty in the extreme. Do not eat in unclean places. It is good economy in the long run to patronize moderate priced places, not the cheapest. 4. Select a hotel with considerable care while remaining in a city, especially so if not acquainted. Most of the high priced places are safe, both aa to sanitation, fire, and morality, but some of the cheaper places, especially those advertising "rooms to rent" are positively bad. Never use a dirty towel. 5 5. Do not become an habitual loafer in town. Many farmers develop e habit and transmit it to their children. It is better economy to go to the town for business or other helpful purpose and to return home soon or early. Purposeless loafing leads to neglect of farm work and usually to the loss of the farm. The town has provided places to hitch teams, but no rest rooms for people. Such a place is very much needed "for the women and girls, for they are now required to walk the streets or stand around in the stores till the men are ready to go home. The ill-effects resulting from this neglect are more marked than Is usually supposed. Let the country people share the expense of a rest-room. Some have suggested that the churches might be thrown open for this purpose. 6. Drunkenness should be avoided. It does not add to the dignity of a rural community. It decreases human resources and degrades a com - munity's health and morals. 7. Avoid immorality while in the city. The results of carelessness in this direction are evident at thousands of places in the country, as shown by persons suffering from some of the worst diseases known to man. Our sui-vey has, through hundreds of sources, been enabled to gather definite data to show the effects of the social evil on country people. The fact Is that the worst contribution from the city to the country is the diseases contracted in this way. Let it be known also that the country should assume its full responsibility in the regulation and control of this great problem, which results, in considerable part, from the demands of rural life. Many persons who have given serious and careful thought to the problem are of the opinion that the present State laws governing the social evil are defective. They claim that the public health is suffering more than it would if the evil were segregated and rigidly controlled. Be that as it may, many practicing physicians report an increase in the social dis - eases. Just what measures will ultimately be taken to rid society of immorality and the bad effects connected therewith is not known. One thing is sure, namely, that the subject must be handled primarily from the standpoint of health and its conservation. The Promotion of Health Through Education. — The length of human </seg>
            <seg id="p290">290 2S0 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA 8TATE BOARD OP AGRICl LTl RK life Is Increased about in proportion as the people are educated to live clean lives physically and otherwise. Where ignorance and superstition are most in evidence there also are contagion, disease, degenerates, and short life. Certain it is that our system of public education has been a great factor in conserving the health of the individual and society. It may be said that public expense for the education of the youth is justified many times over in that it decreases criminality, develops health and morality, and trains for service. No one will question the fact that bad health is a cause of crime. Furthermore, ignorance causes poverty, crime, and sick - ness. Our greatest safeguard, then, will be in the education of the youth for proper living. The following copies from an address by Dr. R. H. Wolcott, Dean or the Medical College of the University of Nebraska, plainly show the impor - tance of education along the lines of health conservation. Therein is also outlined the position our medical college is to assume in preventive medi - cine. Dr. Wolcott says: "It is a matter of congratulation that education today is becoming con - stantly more practical. We are training our boys and girls more and more for the business of living, and living so as to be efficient members of soci - ety. Courses in hygiene and sanitation should be in every school, and the country schools need such work as much as the city schools, or more. K"Not only should the people be taught personal hygiene and be made understand the importance of keeping themselves clean, but they should be taught community hygiene or sanitation, and made to under - stand the necessity of keeping the surroundings of the home and the community clean. Science has taught us not only that disease germs swarm in filth of all kinds, but that Insects which abound about us are the means of transmitting those disease germs to us directly by bites or indirectly by transferring them to food or other objects we put into our mouths or bring in contact with our bodies. Flies breed in filth, carry filth, and disseminate the disease germs in filth. Mosquitoes transmit malaria as well as other diseases. The amount of malaria usually found in a new country is due to a lack of clearing of the land and deficient drainage of surface water. But ponds do not breed most of the mos - quitoes which trouble us in our homes, for in ponds fish and other ani - mals serve to keep down the numbers. On the contrary, they are mostly reared in rainwater barrels, in old casks and cans partly filled with water, in unused wells, and in other places about the house where, free from the attack of enemies, they breed in swarms and develop in a few days after a rain or during rainy weather. Not only is it desirable that there be instruction in the schools in these matters, but it is highly desirable that communities, even farming communities, take means of informing themselves on these subjects. There ought to be meetings of the people addressed by physicians and others who can explain these questions to the community, and In which the conditions may be thoroughly canvassed and measures taken to allevi - ate those which are unfavorable. Particularly should communities every- </seg>

How much better it would be if public opinion could be so educated as to make it possible to prevent the epidemic. The greatest development In the field of medicine today is in the direction of protective medicine. The great research laboratories are everywhere studying the problems of how to prevent disease, rather than how to cure it. The strongest argument in favor of the maintenance of State schools of medicine lies in the fact that in such schools the faculty, paid by the State, must of necessity feel an individual responsibility to the people of the State, and their time outside of their teaching work will be devoted, not to private gain, but to research into the cause and nature of the diseases found within the State, in order that such knowl - edge may be turned to the advantage of its citizens. At the same time the students graduating from such a school should be made to feel that they have a debt to the State which has provided them with the means of securing their professional training, and it can be confidently expected that from such a school will come doctors better trained and more dis - posed to lead in the field of health conservation than those who come from privately endowed institutions. The medical college of the State should also take the lead in the education of the public to understand these matters and to appreciate the value of highly trained medical serv - ice. In common with the medical colleges of other state universities, the medical college of this State is looking forward to widened activities in these directions, and to a larger share in the great work of health con - servation among our people." Strong Ideals, backed by resistless purpose, play an important part in health conservation. They become real forces in boys and girls, who are full of life, wanting to be strong, active, and successful. Such young people are ready to pay the price of success in well-directed effort if they have strong leadership. Let the parents and teachers see the importance of purposeful living on the part of young people and endeavor to guide it to its fullest fruitage. Let the lessons learned in the selection, breeding, and care of farm animals apply in the main in the conservation of people. If the young people are learning bow to grow premium corn, prize winning cattle, and the like, why not also emphasize the ideal boy and girl? In other words, the knowledge employed in growing better crops and health - ier animals, in which so much attention is given to the prevention and eradication of disease, may have even more importance in the develop - ment of people. It should cause young people to be more purposeful and to want to do right things rather than to yield to degrading and unhealth - ful Influences. A spirit of this kind would promote the cause of health if it could be more generally developed in the public schools. Disease Prevention. — Most rural diseases result from causes outlined in this paper. They do not simply happen in mysterious ways outside our control. To a very large extent diseases are due to sinful living in violation of the laws of health. </seg>
            <seg id="p292">The principal way therefore (or farm people to prevent disease is la clean living. When this is done in its fullest measure there can be no contagious diseases. Proper habits of work, eating, and elimination would prevent most other diseases. It would seem, then, that every one would be on his guard, trying to prevent sickness, rather than to expe - rience disease with its uncertain cure. It is to the very great credit of the medical profession that its mem - ban have led in this great movement of prevention. Certainly it means less sickness and consequently less practice. Let the parents and teach - ers accept their part and responsibility in making use of known prevent - ive measures in the home and school. It may be said that heredity has much to do with disease. So it has, but the cause in such cases is only a little further back, perhaps, in the parent. Prevention on the part of one generation will affect the heredity of the next. Viewed in this light, it is easy to see our health obligation to future society, and that the stock or strain of breed of man can be markedly improved thrcugh prevention. Just what legislation should be enacted to prevent the marriage of unfit persons is not fully agreed. We face the fact that the union of feeble-minded persons or of other degenerates is most destructive to society. It decreases health and causes the human stock to run down. The penitentiary and insane asy - lums of our State have many patients whose criminality and condition of ill health can be traced back to particular preventable acts that gave them preventable disease. We refer now to certain diseases easily avoid - ed, but practically incurable when contracted. Their spread is due very largely to immorality, the control and prevention of which present the largest conservation problem of this age. </seg>

Conservation stands for the right development of resources viewe&lt; in the light of public welfare. This idea of equity has permeated every department of industry. It was first directed towards the resources o basic importance, such as coal, iron, soil, water power, and the forest Soon the major emphasis shifted as the notion that all useful plants an&lt; animals as well as man came to be regarded as natural resources. Th last, and in some respects most important, move in conservation was the extension of its principles to business, not for the purpose of holdin business in check, but primarily for protection against fraud. Such development is badly needed in most states, for fraud is tracking legit mate business at every turn. Furthermore, business is shot through an through with petty graft. It is sore with deceit, trickery, swindling, an even theft. This should not be, for the name "business" stands for honesty, good faith, integrity, honor, stability. Plain it is that many transactions in the world of commerce fall outside the realm of true business. They grade from dealings that are only apparently criminal to those that are plainly so. The different lines of business are conserved in many ways. This applies to practical developments in improving the processes In - volved in handling commodities all the way from manufacture to sale; to trade, in the direction of economy in buying, transportation and sales; to doing business more economically in stores, by increasing the efficiency of help, protecting the wares, and looking after collections. It is bad business for a town to have too many stores for the amount of trade, caus - ing undue expense for store-room, heating, lighting, and help. Such does not conserve the interests of either the business man or the public. Much talk is heard about cooperation between town and country. This is well founded, for it gives strength and harmony to business. On the part of farmers, poor cultivation, careless handling of stock, buying on time, etc., should be regarded as bad business. Poor schools, too many church buildings, badly kept roads, unclean streets, and grafting officials are evidences of bad business on the part of the public. So there is room for practical conservation in many lines of business. It will prevent waste, improve efficiency, and thereby decrease the cost of commodities. A more general movement of this kind would promote real business and work a public good at the same time. It is not the function of this paper to recite at length any of the methods whereby system and efficiency are developed in particular In - dustries. The purpose is to review certain classes of fraudulent promo - tion that are operating under the guise of business. Such fraud is mani - fest in forms of cheating, double dealing, doubtful promotion, and pur - poseful swindling in various enterprises, as in mining, irrigation, drain- </seg>

It is in part the result of a definite field survey. Mine Promotion. — The amount of money sent from our State, appar - ently for the purpose of developing copper, gold, silver, lead and line prospects in other states, is enormous. The return for this has not aver - aged one cent for each dollar invested. It might be well for Nebraskans to recognize the fact that nearly all sure propositions are not available for Eotion. In the language of a practical mining man, "Persons on the id look after all good deals; the others are fit only for promoters, lermore, a mere prospect is not a mine." Oil and Gas Promotion. — Perhaps no excitement causes one's gam - bling spirit to rise higher than does that of a developing oil field. At such times everything looks good to the public, and fabulous returns ap - pear to be in sight for all who invest in time. This gives opportunity for professional promoters to get in their work, sometimes on a large scale. It Is difficult to show the criminality of such procedure, for it is neces - sary to prospect nature's hidden treasures. Locally, then, it may be a good service in certain places for persons to put money into wild catting. This proves or disproves certain things. Professional promoters do not work in this way; they have a sure thing, so they claim. Let it be known that most of the money sent from Nebraska for investments in oil regions has been lost. It has gone to promoters and for wild catting, and not for developing proved territory. It is not good business to accept the unqualified statements of most oil and gas promo - tion concerns as a basis for investment. r-rigatlon Schemes.— The Federal Government has expended a vast if money in developing the irrigation resources of the various dry states. This is thought to be reclamation of economic importance. Furthermore, many reliable individuals and private companies have done as well or even better in developing some projects. As a result of irriga - tion development thousands of happy homes are now located where once was only dry land. Notwithstanding this fact, there has been much fraud in irrigation promotion. Scheming individuals have sold illegiti - mate propositions in which there was no show of success because of a lack of water, unsuitable land, or heavy graft. Nebraskans have invest - ed in many irrigation prospects outside the State. Fortunately, however, most of their money has gone to successful enterprises. In a good many eases it has been invested in the stocks of concerns than can hardly hope for success. Drainage Schemes. — -One of the largest lines of improvement awaiting development in the United States is in the field of drainage, whereby swamp and flood lands are brought under cultivation. The amount of land that either has or can be improved by drainage is said to be about 75,000, - 000 acres. The Federal Government, various states, companies, and indi - viduals, are doing this reclamation. Much of this development is well (I) </seg>
            <seg id="p295">295 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA 8TATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 2SS iied, yet there are parasites in the form of graft and bad deals, which t be called deliberate steals in some cases. Examples of such are rn to exist in a few states. Perhaps the most striking one, however, . Florida. Much Nebraska money went there, and a considerable seems to have been squandered on projects than can never succeed, hers, ministers, farmers, and many merchants have been victimized. te language of one of Florida's representatives at the National Irriga- Congress of this year, "Persons selling certain wet lands of Florida practicing fraud and should be prosecuted as criminals. They are ing the good name of Florida and swindling people in the North, ment is not necessary. There are good propositions in Florida. Land Schemes in General. — There are many other land projects be - side those of irrigation and drainage. The public has Invested very large - ly in small tract propositions In Florida, Texas, and other states. Some of this laid has considerable value, but most of it has been over-estimated, and many investors are quite apt therefore to lose all or nearly all of their money. The country being smooth and attractive causes the aver - age farmer or person from the city to attach more value to the land than it really possesses. Also it may look more inviting at one season of the year than at another. For instance, there are places in Texas to which the agents take their victims in the dry season, and to other places during the wet season. The writer heard a Texas representative declare in a national meeting than many of the small tract propositions, together with certain land schemes.of his state, were filled with fraud. He criti - cized northern people for thus promoting Texas. This should serve at least as a warning to Nebraskans. There are splendid agricultural propo - sitions in Texas, but they are not handled by the average promoter. They are placed on the market by responsible land agents. tOry Land Deals. — The dry land deals of the United States and of tico have not been free from fraud, caused in part by misinformation the part of agents, but due more largely to deliberate misrepresenta - i. For instance, there are places in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Colo - o, western Nebraska, Wyoming, and other states subject to such pro- Lion. The fact is that a part dt the land in the dry area of each state ned is well suited for dry farming, but that unscrupulous agents sell thing and everything to unsuspecting persons are being good, await - the plow and successful development. So it is that geographic posl - 1 has been overworked in the land business. The following points e been overdrawn. 1. The argument that most agricultural land Is under cultivation. L2. The notion that dry farming methods are successful on almost kind of soil. Such is not true. 3. That the climate, referring to the rainfall especially, is becoming more favorable for agriculture in dry regions as the years go by. This notion, used in deceiving thousands of people, Is greatly in error. 4. Another condition bas been a cause for much misunderstanding and a considerable amount of temporary development by periods. It </seg>
            <seg id="p296">296 at PBOCBKDINOS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AORICTLTIRK come* from the fact that the amount of rainfall fluctuates at more or leu regular periods, ten to twelve years apart. During the wet years every - thing is boomed; at dry times the reverse occurs. Reliable information concerning the fluctuations of climate would be worth millions of dollars to Nebraska in conserving its Industry. Rather careful study is being directed towards this problem. Misrepresentation and Overvaluation. — Not only do certain pro - moters misrepresent specific propositions for the purpose of re - ceiving gain therefrom, but in many cases they advance the sale price unduly. An example of this kind was brought to the writer's attention a few years ago when he was asked to examine a large tract of land in Mexico for bankers in Nebraska. They were to buy the tract for a little less than $1 an acre, if the land proved to be suited for colonization, the purpose being to dispose of the land to Nebraskans. My report was adverse both as to the land and the scheme. Later, a concern operating from a city in a neighboring state purchased the place and Bold It to Nebraska farmers at from $10 to $20 or more an acre. The farmers and townspeople who went onto the land, as they have done in - many other similar places, lost out. Those victimized said hard things about the promoters, the city, and Mexico. Nebraska lost several citizens and much money in the deal. Such a thing would have been prevented if we had a law for the conservation of business against such procedure. The public craze for land has made it easy for promoters to do their work. Many farmers, dominated by a spirit oj consideration for their children and believing the dope of the promoter, sold the old home places in agricultural regions and moved onto nearly worthless land, with the assurance that it would become about like the agricultural land in time, and that each child would then have a farm. Such a deal is criminal. Certain railroads are not free from blame. Let it be known that mere be - lief, opinion, and sentiment are not strong enough forces to overcome the influence of land nearly worthless for agriculture. The farmer who ac - cepts the bad dope is also to blame. The time is sure to come, however, when the arguments that now seem to hold for land developments in gen - eral will not be regarded as having much value in a particular transac - tion, for facts concerning the land in the deal will be demanded. Reliable persons who have at heart the best possible development of their states stand strongly against misrepresentations whether uninten - tional or not. Doubtful promotion serves only in closing land deals, and in directing settlers to the land, but in the long run the process works a positive harm to the misguided people as well as to the state if the land is not suited for habitation. Fortunately, there are few doubtful land pro - moters in Nebraska. Some states do not stand so high in this respect. We have learned that it pays to tell the truth when it comes to trans - planting a population. If the Federal Government had made a soil survey of its domain ahead of settlement and development, it might have been used first to direct the homesteaders and later as a basis for land transactions. Such </seg>
            <seg id="p297">297 PROCEEDINGS XEItHAHKA STATE BOARD OF AUKICII.TUKE survey would have cost about as much as a single battleship. It would have been a constructive influence of great value. Fruit Land Promotion. — Thousands and thousands of dollars of Ne - braska money go to the fruit districts of the West and Northwest. The investors see visions of fabulous returns. Some may do well on their in - vestments, yet we are convinced that there is more excitement than solid fact in at least a part of this promotion. The leading fruit man of the northwest, one directing a large enterprise, told the writer that not half of the so-called best projects could succeed. Let this be a warning, at least to persons who have money to invest in fruit land of other states rather than in southeastern Nebraska. Some of the projects are sure to succeed and to give good returns on the money invested therein. Many of them never can succeed, for they were started without due regard to soil, exposure, markets, etc. It so happens that the propositions handled by promoters are the least sure, and that they receive investments on the part of the general public. Eucalyptus Promotion. — For many years the forests of the United States have been in process of depletion. Some have seen in this, and with good reason, an approaching timber famine. The alarm has been sounded, and the demand has gone forth for better methods in timber utilization, for fire protection, and for tree planting. This is the right thing without doubt, but it affords a loop-hole for promotion. Let it be understood, also, ..iat some trees grow faster and are more all-purpose than others. The eucalypts are of this kind. They are of many kinds. Such trees can not be grown on any and every type of soil and are lim - ited somewhat by climate. It so happens that California, because of its soil and climate, is the leading state in the culture of eucalypts. It has several successful groves and larger plantings, yet the situation is worked for all it is worth and more. Perhaps a majority of the propositions are bad. The public is worked according to several plans or selling schemes. The fact is that there is too much graft in most of them. In some cases only prospects are promoted. The process has gone on to such an extent as to attract the attention of many prominent Nebraskans, especially while in California. Several of these have looked into the eucalyptus business with considerable care. They report much fraud. It would seem, therefore, that Nebraskans should be cautious in this line of in - vestment for it may not be good business. The tree must have suitable soil, climate, and care. Promotions and Local Industries. — There are many examples wherein scheming individuals take advantage of an unsuspecting public, usually in a small town, for the purpose of getting hold or capital through the guise of starting an industry, such as a brick plant. The people are in - vited to invest, they do so because of the attractiveness of the proposi - tion as laid down by the promoter, but fail to inquire into the responsi - bility of the person who collects their money. In most cases of this kind, and there are several in which $20,000 or more was taken from a town, the larger part of the subscriptions went to the promoter and the </seg>
            <seg id="p298">should be looked after by commercial clubs or responsible local men. The term promoter as here used is not intended to apply to enterprising, pub - lic-spirited Individuals who organize a legitimate company. Promoters' Methods. — Many plans are devised for securing money from the community. In the first place a selling scheme is perfected. It is constructed in a way that leaves no flaws, apparently. Each agent learns the dope to perfection; he tries to become expert in applying it to the different types of individuals. Too often, it is of little concern whether the project has merit or not. The chief object 1b to get money. Extravagant claims are made, in which returns of even 100 per cent or more a year are said to be a sure thing. The influence of nationality, church, and fraternal order may be brought to bear in securing sales. In this connection the person who assists the promoter is perhaps given a reduction or some rake-off for his influence. The dope is given him often and systematically. So he 1b soon able to realize the greatness of the project This is promotion psychology. Shares, stocks, etc., are offered at a high enough price to permit reduction for quick sale, which bait works in many cases. The above kind of thing has been practiced in most communities of Nebraska for years, and the wonder of it is that it can continue and why the State should permit it to continue. It is time to call this so-called business by its right name, which is fraud. It should be stopped. Many towns have lost $20,000 a year; McCook reports a to - tal loss of about $1,000,000; Lincoln and Omaha have been centers of pro - motion. The State loses $3,000,000 or more a year. Effects of Fraud on Business. — Persons who lose in illegitimate prop - ositions are apt to become suspicious of reliable business, even that done by men well known in the community. Furthermore they refuse to put money into local developments in which the returns are sure, though smaller, than those promised by promoters. Persons with money to in - vest should be attracted more by propositions that can insure 8 per cent than by those that promise almost 'anything. Local propositions are backed by responsible men as a rule, whereas the others may be sup - ported only by the statements of irresponsible persons. The one is close home where you can manage it, and the other is distant, perhaps at the end of the rainbow. In one you get an interest, in the other a promise to deliver an impossible thing. The drain is away from the home, school, State. Perhaps the greatest loss of the State is the people who are lured away to places where they are, in many cases, less well off than in Nebraska. Many are put out of business entirely by fraud. Regulation and Supervision. — Business embodies transactions in which the dealings are done on the square. It is dominated by honesty, good faith, integrity, and honor. The sooner we emphasize the real spirit of business in all transactions of the individual, the community, and the State, the better it will be for society. The demand then is for business and not for misrepresentation and fraud, which are but parasites. Let bosineas demand protection against fraud. Protection is needed in the («) </seg>

Sucb law should not have as its primary purpose the holding of capital at home. This should be the second purpose. The main object should be to conserve business. Though our State has led in the agitation for conservation of busi - ness, Kansas has gained prominence in enacting an effective measure In the form of the well-known Blue Sky Law. We will do well to pass such a measure with a few modifications. That the State is ready for such a law is evidenced by the very general interest in the subject. Most state meetings of farmers, merchants, and bankers held during the past year passed resolutions favoring a measure of this kind. Several of these organizations appointed committees to work with the director of the con - servation survey in framing a law for conservation of business. The movement for square dealing is quite general throughout the United States. Apparently several states are to enact laws along this line as soon as their legislatures convene. The following points should be provided in framing the la.w: 1. Title and purpose. 2. Outline of the business regulated and supen ised 3. Examination and passing upon the validity of concerns seeking to do business, noting their showing as to incorporation, by-laws, officers, kind and place of business, financial condition, etc. 4. Registration and certification, perhaps by the banking board. The State should not guarantee. It should only evidence the fact that the concern has made the proper showing. 5. Regulation and control by the banking board. 6. Field examination of the properties, stocks, etc., offered for sale, if called for by a citizen or would-be purchaser. This might be done by the conservation survey working with the banking board. 8. Penalties. y. f ccs. There are several laws for the conservation of business. We now need a special act against doubtful promotion. This Is nearly unani - mously agreed among farmers, merchants, and bankers. None op - pose the measure openly, and there is not apt to be opposition before the legislature unless it comes from persons who make gain through graft. In this connection the opposition, if it shows up, will have the embar - rassing situation of appearing on the side of fraud. No legitimate con - cern need fear such a law. In its practical operation the act would be nearly self-operating If properly administered in the beginning, for only reliable parties would seek registration. The others, knowing the law and that they could not comply with it, would not apply. Nevertheless, due care should be exer - cised in framing the act to make it just, fair, and workable. </seg>

The problem of the 1 survey is to discover these influences and to evaluate their impor- The inventory In business has long been recognized as essential. Likewise that the correct accounting of receipts and expenditures is nec - essary to success In business is universally admitted. But until the last decade we have not, as a people, recognized that the same methods must be applied to agricultural pursuits. There is now a demand for the rural inventory along many lines as shown by soil, horticultural, farm manage - ment, special Industrial, social, and educational surveys. Still others could be named. The results of these special investigations may have considerable value. If the rapidity and unscientific spirit which sometimes characterized the work does not lead to wrong deductions and grave er - rors. The scope of such surveys is not fully agreed. Neither is there agreement as to methods of doing the work. In some of the so-called surveys quest ionaires are sent to a chance collection of names; data thereby collected are tabulated and deductions are made. As a rule such procedure gives little more than an opinion. It seems, therefore, un - warranted to base a survey on the questionaire alone. The statistical method appears to be over-emphasized on some surveys. We do not wish to discourage the gathering of agricultural statistics, but we do mean to say that the average statistical data are not fully reliable, and they only express the agricultural practice. There is more to a survey than fig - ures. Back of the figures and rural activities are the conditions which control them. To these we must go for basic facts which determine the agricultural practice, the amount of production, etc. It seems, therefore, that our rural survey should be made by personal work on the ground — in the field, farm home, and country town. Here the person doing the work sees success and failure sometimes side by side. He first becomes a student and later a teacher. He learns real facts, not fanciful notions, selecting what really have importance. There are many state surveys. They usually work along separating lines rather than through coopera - tion. The rural survey is more comprehensive. It uses the results of other surveys when available. It emphasises the fundamental influences effective in agricultural development. No rural survey should be started because It Is the custom. The work must be purposeful and useful. The view-point of the State is to be kept in mind, and survey facts are not to </seg>
            <seg id="p302">302 J02 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE be distorted by sentiment or prejudice; otherwise the results may be misleading and worse than useless. The question arises, what facts are of fundamental Importance? Recognizing that certain influences are basic, it behooves us to attempt to learn what they are. For Nebraska we must know definitely the life and industry of the commonwealth. In brief, we should appreciate the geography of our State, the reaction between life and natural conditions. It is the province of this paper to point out these fundamental controls. The factors here outlined are emphasized in the Nebraska surveys. They were presented at two annual meetings of the National Association of Conservation Commissioners, and represent the unanimous opinion of those bodies. In the movement for a fundamental basis of investigation, Nebraska has taken a prominent part. The subject is now introduced by asking a practical question, one that comes to every person who seeks a home in another state or country. What would such persons ask about the country? The inquiries would be in regard to the things that affect the work, health, and success of people — the favorable and unfavorable as well. If we could tabulate all the questions concerning the new home they would be found to refer principally to structure, topography, drain - age, local climate, ground water, soils, and the native life of the region. The inquirer would also desire to know something of the social and in - dustrial conditions if the region is settled. We do not maintain that an agricultural survey should undertake to cover the whole field of investi - gation concerning these points. It should use the facts gathered by the physical and biological surveys, evaluating their importance. We will review some of the relations that exist between rural development and the controls above named. Structure. — By structure is meant the underground make-up of a re - gion, the kind and arrangement of the materials of the land. Structure Is directly related to mineral resources, topography, water supply, and ■oils. It determines the kind and availability of coal, building stone, clay, sand, etc. Geologists do an important work in describing and mapping the structure of the land. Too often rural people do not realize the fun - damental importance of this survey. The water supply and soils vary with the geological formations. Sand and sandstone formations usually contain good water, but the soil is likely to be deficient in fertility. Limestones yield hard water, but the soils will probably be fertile and valuable If deep enough. Shale land yields very little well-water, usually of bad quality. Where the shale is rery deep, storage of rainwater in cisterns and reservoirs is necessary- Shale land Is likely to have a heavy gumbo soil, one that is slow, cold, and hard to work. It would seem that every farmer would be in favor of such geological surveys as accurately determine the structure of the state, for this in - formation Is of use for many purposes, especially in soil studies. Topography. — By topography we refer to the surface features of the land. These features are caused by wind, running water, etc.. raodi- </seg>
            <seg id="p303">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE Hi fying the land. Topography is bo closely related to structure that one acts as a key to the interpretation of the other. The harsh, hummocky surface of granite regions usually differs from the gentler slopes of the stratified areas. The surface presented by slightly covered rock slopes stands in clear contrast to that found where there are deep mantles of looser materials. Topography controls the location of railways and canals. It should also be considered in laying out rural highways. The system of road - building which insists on roads along section lines, regardless of dis - tances or slopes encountered, needs to have its view-point challenged. Boads should be built for comfortable travel and not to mark the boun - daries of farm units. At present many farmers are retarded in market - ing grain because of a few unnecessary high grades between the farm and town. Farming is mostly on smooth or rolling land. The rougher areas K given over more to grazing and the forest In this we see the rela - which topography bears to the use of land. I Farm homes should be planned with respect to topography. Thte consider drainage, direction of exposure, and accessibility of good ways to markets. Roads planned according to surface slopes would also lead to convenient location of homes. Cities are built along great highways, which are controlled by topog - raphy. Lands not located near great natural highways must be provided with the best roads possible to connect them with the distant markets. These roads should avoid unnecessary curve and grades. The building of such roads according to topographic controls would eliminate useless toil in delivering products to the markets. This would mean increased prosperity for producers and consumers alike. The United States has spent large sums of money for topographic mapping for army use. Cer - tainly agricultural interests deserve even geater recognition. Can there be any question that rural development demands that the surface ot the land be accurately mapped? About 40 per cent of Nebraska has been eo mapped by the United States Geological Survey. The State is now co-operating in this work, which is to be completed as fast as funds' are available. Topographic maps are necessary for field work on the other surveys. It is of value to a state for its citiienzs to have access to au - thentic descriptions of its types of topography in which is shown how the land forms were developed by the various natural agencies. Drainage.- — Another fundamental factor in the development of a state is its drainage. The type of drainage is related to rainfall, topography, and the texture and structure of the land. It is of importance in erosion, water power, and sanitation. Smooth land under low rainfall has lit - tle run-off. Rough land tends to drain more rapidly than smooth. The relations therefore of topography and drainage are very close, both as to cause and effect. Open textured soils and subsoils give relatively more drainage to the underground than to the surface. Stream utilization for power is dependent on constancy of flow as well as volume. This calls for gaging extending over several years. In bridge (S) </seg>

Many bridges have been built too small and great damage resulted because of lack of data. In irrigation the minimum should be known so that necessary storage facilities may be provided or the amount of land to be irrigated limited to available water. The amount of run-off on agricultural land should be known because of Its relation to rainfall, soil wash, and erosion. Soil wash depletes fertility, and erosion carves many Nebraska farms into remnants separ - ated from each other by nearly impassable gulleys. In some places ero - sion is being prevented with, fair success, but the various ways of check - ing it are not generally enough known. To this problem the survey idea should be applied so that the success of the few may become known and the means of success placed within reach of many. Drainage conditions in irrigated districts have not always been un - derstood by the settlers. This is responsible for many failures. It is the duty of the State to study this problem in connection with every irrigation enterprise within its borders and to place accurate, unbiased information within reach of its citizens. By so doing it will minimize the danger of failure and increase the probability of success. That means real development. Nebraska is sometimes considered a dry state; nevertheless it has several thousand acres of fertile wet land. The streams of eastern Ne - braka generally have meandering courses in broad valleys. These flood - plains are regions of great fertility, but they have been poor producers because of overflow of the streams at times during the growing season. Some of this land is being reclaimed by ditches and straightened stream channels, and more could be improved. These flood-plains should be mapped and accurate data gathered as to their conditions. Such data are of use in reclamation. It is not generally known that Nebraska has a good many lakes, probably five hundred or more. Many of them should be drained. Which? Some may be utilized for fish and game production. Which? Some may be developed as potash producers. Which? The state's should accurately map and describe their water features, such as streams, lakes, bays, and marshes. Such information is of use tn irrigation, drainage, navigation, fish culture, city water supplies, etc. The location of water features is shown on topographic maps. The hy - drographlc department of the Government is studying surface water features, having published many bulletins thereon. This work is of value to agriculture. Local Climate. — The influences of climate are common talk among farmers. The elements — temperature, sunshine, wind, humidity, and rainfall are recognized. The United States Weather Bureau is doing a splendid work, yet more than general ideas Is needed. This fact is rec - ognized in fruit districts especially. The need there is for a knowledge of local climate, even that of the farm or certain parts of it. The cli - mate of the soil is coming to be regarded as having even more import- </seg>
            <seg id="p305">305 I K( H K K 1 ► I K Kit AS Iv A S 1 AT b BOARD Ob AG KILL LTL RK Mb ence than that of the atmosphere. Herein lies a new Held of study. Soil climate varies with slopes as to direction aud steepness. How much warmer will the soil on a south facing slope be at stated times than the soil on a north slope? Will the soil on a steep slope warm up more rapidly than on a gentle slope? How will the climate of a sandy soil differ from that of a clay soil? How will these differences affect crops and the selection of seeds for such crops? These are questions which should receive consideration in a rural survey. The planting of orchards and ornamental shrubs should be based on such data as are Implied In these suggestions. It is a well-known fact that the amount of rainfall is no more im - portant than its form and distribution. When is precipitation most abundant? This question answered means that crops adapted to such distribution can be selected. Does the rainfall have a tendency to be violent and of short duration, or steady and prolonged? Are hail - storms frequent? Are the rains usually accompanied by heavy winds? The modern idea is not to accept general statements but to determine climatic data, accurately to local areas, even to specific farms in so far as it is possible. The elements of local climate factor very materially in agricultural development and must be recognized as fundamental influ- ences. Ground Water. — Rural investigations sometimes overlook the Im - portance of the water in the ground. This water has value because it serves as the source of crop water and usually also as a supply for man and beast. There are two zones of ground water. The upper is where the spares between the earth particles are not completely filled with water. This is called the capillary zone. The lower is where the spaces are completely water filled. This is termed the saturated zone. The upper limit of the saturated zone is known as the water table. Ground water is related to structure and topography and affects soils, plant and animal life, and the desirability of regions for homes. If the water table is too far below the surface and the soil texture open, drouth conditions are likely to prevail and drouth resistant crops must be relied upon. If the water table is too near the surface, opposite conditions are true, but then the handicap is almost as serious, for the best crops will not prosper if the upper subsoil is water-soaked. The depth and character of the wells in any region is dependent on groundwater as well as rock structure. Where shallow wells are used what is true of the quality of water? Are they located up-grade from cattle yards and other sources of contamination? Are they well graded M as to prevent entrance of surface run-off and resultant pollution? The water supply of any region is one of its important features. Where easily obtained and of good quality it furnishes a very valuable asset; whereas if difficult to obtain or of poor quality it means a serious dis - advantage to the development of the district involved. The desirability of farms for homes is directly related to the water supply conditions. 30 </seg>
            <seg id="p306">306 We PROCEEDINGS NEHKASKA 8TATK BOARD OF AGRICULTURE In the rural survey the various phases of the groundwater problem should be investigated. The amount of water held by the soil is even more important than the quantity of rainfall. The depth to the water table is a leading factor. The quantity, quality, and accessibility of well water for any region must be considered of fundamental importance. A survey of the underground water is made by bydrologists, usually in con - nection with geological work. Soil*.— That the soil of any region is an important control in agri - cultural development is so generally conceded that no argument seems necessary. We have long realized the importance of the soil as a resource, but we have not understood the care necessary to maintain that re - source. This is probably due to a failure to understand the relation of soil to structure and topography. If we know the origin of soils, we will be able to comprehend their content and properties. The soil sur - vey which fails to take into account the origin of the soil based on structure conditions loses sight of the primary cause of different soil classes. For any locality we should know: By the breaking down of what rock or rocks wag the soil produced? What were the predominant mineral elements in these rocks? Is the soil residual, that is. was it formed by weathering of the underlying rocks? If transported, how was it placed there, by water, glacial action, or wind? What relation does the soil bear to adjacent slopes? The relation of tlir water table to soil needs emphasis. Upon the distance of the water table will depend to some extent the use of the land If too near the surface, swampy, ill-drained conditions result, and the use of the land is limited to very narrow bounds. If the water table is far below the surface, soil structure and texture will be especially Important. Farm management demands intelligent comprehension of soil char - acteristics. These are intimately related to climate, structure, topography, and drainage. The soil survey must study the soils and classify them as to origin and properties and present a comprehensive discussion of each. The soils must be clearly and accurately shown on detailed maps, to that the fanner will be able to know definitely the kinds and distri - bution of the soil? on his farm. Such a survey should have been made of all public domain preparatory to settlement. If the people could have known whether the land is clayey, sandy, stony, smooth, rough, dry or wet. It would have served to guide them in selecting suitable places, preventing much fraud. The soil survey is needed in settled districts to serve as a basis of farming, road-making and land dealing. It is the natural basis for reshaping the agriculture of old districts. The compre - hensive coil survey takes into account all fundamental Influences affect - ing agriculture. It is so far as it goes an agricultural survey. Native Life. — The native plants and animals of a country represent the natural selection of the fittest for the conditions encountered. The life of a region reflects the topography, soil, and climate under which it lives. The cactus of the desert and the pond lily and watercress of the </seg>
            <seg id="p307">lakes and marshes represent the extremes of moisture conditions. For the intermediate stages there are equally well suited forms. Animal life shows the same adaptability to soil, temperature, and moisture. In many cases some forms of native life can be economically perpetuated, and become valuable assets. In developing a new country the first duty rid be to learn what is there, and to protect the valuable forms of whether plant or animal. Iln new territory the native plant life reveals to the keen student ch concerning the soil and climatic conditions. In older communities undisturbed patches of vegetation tell the same story. By studying such life the qualities needed in cultivated crops may be fairly well determined and the losses incident to haphazard experimenting avoided. Certain districts may not be adapted to cultivated crops or domestic animals. This is particularly true of desert and mountain regions. Such districts usually have developed types of life adapted to them. Many of these forms may be of value to man. This is especially true of fur-bear - ing animals and of a number of valuable plants. In such cases lands which would otherwise be waste can be made productive of relatively good returns. We have many lakes and streams. The waters in these are not all of the same temperature or purity. The rivers, creeks, and lakes should be utilized for flsh production wherever possible. Which are favorable to flsh propagation and which arc not? What kinds of fish are best adapted to the various conditions existing? The State owes such information to its citizens. Native life then needs to be considered in a rural survey because: (1) it gives a summary history of soil and climate influences; (2) it may lead to economic production of certain native types of plants and ani - mals; (3) it presents concretely the problem of utilization of waste lands: (4) it will give emphasis to the need of utilizing our lakes and streams as a source of food supply. L Industrial Conditions. — The industrial conditions of a region are prac - lly determined by its physical features. Hence the industrial sur - vey must be based on the fundamental influences if it is to be compre - hensive. In the rural survey the Industrial conditions of most importance would be those directly or indirectly concerned with agricultural prod - ucts. Special farm product investigations are necessary. The forage, grain, and animal products are to be studied with a view of learning the exact present status as well as to determine wherein weaknesses lie and to find means of overcoming them. Under this head will come mar - ket facilities and cooperative enterprises. How is the product delivered to market? How may this be reduced? Unnecessary expense of de - livery is an economic waste which a community should not tolerate. This brings up the problem of good roads. Are rural highways as good as business economy demands? If not. why not? Where roads are poor, local haulage is expensive and the net returns of farm production de- </seg>

Prosperity depends on Industry. Industry depends on natural con - ditions and upon related industrial activities. The human element Is important Hence the need for broad consideration when a survey is undertaken. Social Condition!. — If a move intc new territory is contemplated, the questions of vital interest are not only of the natural and industrial con - ditions but also in regard to social conditions. By this is meant the classes of people as to race and culture, and the opportunities offered for advance in social and intellectual lines. These characteristics of peo - ple are closely associated with their occupations. The pursuits of the people of any locality are. as we have noted, largely dominated by the physical basis of industry. Hence the social survey must recognize the fundamental physical influences if it is to correctly interpret conditions as they exist. In the social rural survey the data of most vital interest pertain to the following lines: L(a) History of settlement. The time of settlement and the places which the pioneers came serve to indicate whether a community was given initial impetus to progress. Influx of later settlers needs be noted. Races and nationalities are of interest. The3e data will serve to explain certain human characteristics and to point out certain in fluences to be overcome. (b) Condition of agriculture. The kinds of homes in a region are fairly good indications of its prosperity. The attention given to conserv - ing farm labor, especially the elimination of women's drudgery, gives a clear insight into the social standards prevailing in a community. (c) Education. The kinds and accessibility of schools represent a line of inquiry of universal interest. How does school equipment in the country compare with that In the city? What is true of lengths of terms, preparation of teachers, school spirit of the patrons? Is it true that our rural school f compare unfavorably with the schools of the cities? If so, why? Good schools are essential to progressive communities. The rural survey should gather reliable data and present the problem fairly and clearly to the people of the State. (d) Religion. The churches in a community reflect to some extent at least the social standards and ideals of the people. The rural surrey needs to consider the denominations represented and to measure their activities in social, intellectual, and religious lines. Are there too many churches? Should the church become the social center of the rural district? ■ (e) Recreation. Dwellers ir. the country districts are usually said give too little attention to the playside of life. Whether or not this conception is true is aot positively known. So the questions stand, each demanding answer: Do farmers realize the value and necessity of </seg>
            <seg id="p309">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATK BOARD Or AQRIcn.TTKK MB play? What are the amusements prevailing in country life? What forma of recreation seem best suited to conditions? What is the relation of the discontent of young people on the farm to lack of recreation advantages? Possibly with investigation of these problems may come suggestions as to remedies. Increased attention to making farm life pleasant means doubly increased happiness and prosperity. In closing this review of the fundamentals of the rural surveys it should be understood that the importance of the conditions affecting agri - culture in general can not be considered as having equal importance at any and every locality. Any one of them may be the controlling feature with the rest of little importance. For instance, the problem may be that of drainage, of low rainfall, of rough land, or some other factor. This will show up in the Investigation. Let it be recognized also that every state should complete the fundamental surveys for use in general develop - ment as well as for their agricultural importance. One-tenth the amount required for a single battleship would be a sufficient fund for each state. Until this work is done and done with accuracy, there can be no real basis for agriculture and the related industries based thereon. Know - ledged gained from the basic surveys will be of great importance in de - fopment. Thus far we have magnified notions and unrelated facts our agricultural surveys. It is time to build from the ground up and begin to build on the ground and not in the air. Special surveys relating to agricultural practice and to rural life should follow the physical and biological surveys. It Is not a pleasant fact to know that Nebraska has not yet accurately mapped its lands, wa - ters, and forefl. The same kind of comment can he applied to several other states. The departments responsible for this work should receive adequate financial support. The people in turn should demand results. Many special surveys spring up with more or less importance in the development of a state. Most of them are interested in rural af - fairs as will be shown by a brief review. Biological Surveys. — Under this head come various investigations of plants and animals to which reference has been made. The best results of such researches are attained when the work is closely connected with the results of physical surveys. It would seem, therefore, that biologists should demand accurate maps and reports of the geologists, geographers, and soil men. Fruit Survey. — Several states have made investigation in fruit rais - ing. Of these New Yotk State has taken foremost rank. Persons en - trusted with the survey work visit the various fruit districts, study the management of orchards, the kinds of land used, marketing, etc. In each case the data gathered thereby are used to the advantage of fruit growers and to the interest of state development Information of this kind is needed in Nebraska. The Well-water Survey. — About half of our State has been mapped ring the well-water conditions. These investigations were made arlly for the purpose of improving the public health. The need for (8) </seg>
            <seg id="p310">310 310 PROCEEDINGS NKHKASKA STAI K IH)AI(l) OF AURICULTIKK ■ore accurate Information concerning the location and care of wells is plainly shown. Health 8urvty. — Many persons are now associated with Nebraska's Rural Sanitation and Health Surrey. Thousands of homes are visited and accurate data are obtained relating to sanitation. Such investiga - tions should prove valuable to the public. Farm Management Survey. — This activity is making a special study of rural economics. The object is to determine to what extent there Is either good or bad management in the country. Those doing the field work find it necessary to base their .work on the physical survey and to check up all the processes Involved in the operation of the farm. In this way the investigator detects both the efficient and inefficient meth - ods Involved in farm management. Agricultural Survey. — This is rapidly coming into prominence in sev - eral states. The investigations are made in the field and are concerned with all the factors that affect rural industry and rural life. In some places the persons directing the agricultural survey assume to investi - gate each fundamental condition affecting the agricultural practice. In others the work is conducted primarily on a statistical basis. It would seem that the rural survey should concern itself primarily with physical factors in their relation to rural industry and rural life. KGood Roads Survey. — Many farmers have been opposed to any and change in road building and road maintenance, because of their fear of new policies. Specific information gathered from surveys shows that the road tax voted in most states is not economically used, and that good economy demands more efficiency in road construction and road maintenance. Education Survey. — Many persons object to changes in rural schools, whereas others advocate the consolidation of districts and the introduc - tion of subjects that bear a more direct relation to the life of country students. Consequently an attempt is now being made to learn the rural needs in education. Church Survey. — One of the last movements to gain headway in a number of states is the so-called "religious survey." In some localities the principal purpose seems to have been that of determining the church affiliation rather than to determine the religious beliefs and life of the people, which would be a nearly impossible thing to do. The survey so far as it has progressed, has plainly shown that the religious life of the people bears a close relation to the physical condition of the town or country in which they live. For instance, there are places in Nebraska without church or Sunday school. An Inquiry into the cause shows that It would be difficult for the people, being so widely separated to get to - gether for such services. Persons making this survey have been greatly handicapped by the lack of maps and other data. Summary. The rural survey must first seek to discover the facts of existing con - diUona. </seg>
            <seg id="p311">r 311 It must recognize that fundamental influences exist which largely control the development of a region. The broad controls which affect development are based on struc - ture, topography, drainage, local climate, soils, and native life. These furnish the essential basis for all rural activities. The industrial and social conditions are primarily the results of the relation of man to the natural conditions under which he lives ana does his work. The special surveys of agricultural industries and rural life should be made from the common basis of physical conditions and extended into their respective fields. This is the Geographic basis. It gives con - sistency to the work and value to the results. </seg>

            <seg id="p313">THE FEEDING OF THE DRAFT HOR3E FOR MARKET. By Frank Howard, Pawnee City, Neb. I expect you will be or (eel something like my wife says sometimes when she asks me to talk about something besides horses, but yon all know a person is liable to talk about something they are doing, or have made their living at. I have been engaged In the horse business for about thirty-two years. During this time the horse business has had many ups and downs, but I will say that good draft horses have been very high the greater part of these thirty-two years. My subject today is "Feeding the Draft Horse for Market." This is a business much neglected in this, the richest agricultural country in the world. We can raise everything they do in the other agricultural states, and in addition we produce alfalfa, that rich Illinois, rich Iowa, or rich Missouri has not made a success of. In my opinion horsemen are, to a certain extent, born horsemen — not made like men in many of the professions. The Lord has fitted us each for some certain work. There is a shortage of first-class draft horses in the country, and con - sequently a big demand. A friend horse buyer of mine said the other day that he had an outlet for a hundred head of good draft horses. Now these little horses — outclassed things — sell about like a lot of runty pigs. Let the fellow who thinks he is wise, but don't know much, raise this kind. I will give $300 around for a large number of first-class horses, bat don't know of one in my country for sale which is worth the money. Mr. Horse-raiser and Up-to-date-farmer, I think it's time for you to wake up, get out your pencil, and see if you can't figure out a profit. Now don't let any one out-talk you and tell you that people won't be working horses in a few years, and that the automobile is going to take the place of the horse. Eire entering upon my subject I should like to give you my idea as ling a draft horse, as the words draft horse mean a great deal. Bay about breeding will be short. In the first place we will look im (the mare to raise draft horses from), for I think that is where the average horse raiser is lame. Don't think because you are breeding to a good draft stallion that any kind of a mare will raise a good colt. Re - member the stallion only has half of the job to do. In the first place the draft mare should weigh from 1,500 pounds up to as big as they grow, with plenty of bone, good, flat clean bone. Horse raisers, breeders of draft horses, do not be afraid of having good money invested in good brood mares to raise real draft horses from, as you can not raise draft horses out of little, fine boned mares. Remember that like begets like, whether pure bred or scrub. Now a few words about the sire, which is just aa important as the dam. A real draft stallion should weigh about a ton, for aa a rule we fall short of weight in the dam, and to raise draft horses we most have the weight and the bone. The draft stallion should have a </seg>
            <seg id="p314">clean flat bone, and should look and be rugged In every way. He should be low down and wide out, and have all the qualities that go to make a first-class draft horse, and he must be able to transmit these qualities to his get. I have often thought that a first-class draft stallion would make a good draft gelding, or turn it the other way, a first-class gelding would have made a good draft stallion. Horse buyers have a system of looking over a horse when about to make a purchase, but this system is hardly ever explained to the public. But if you will give me a few minutes I will give you my idea and way of looking at a horse that I am about to buy. If you will follow me closely and do as I do there is no need of getting deceived in the purchase of a horse. After asking for the harness to be removed I step in front of the horse, look at his teeth to get his age; next look at his eye, which should be done when he is facing out of a barn, not in sunlight but in good barn light. Next look for splints below the knee, then look and feel for side bones, then glance back over the hocks for any kind of spavin. Then step to one side and take a side view. Then step behind the horse to see that the hips are alike. Roll over the mane and see that there Is no blemish covered up. Back him up and turn short backways to see that he is not crampy or string welt. Now ask to see him walk off, then to take a trot; and last but not least run him to the top of his speed about three blocks to test his wind, placing your ear close to his nostrils when he first stops. tit you will follow this outline of looking at a horse when you go to you will not be very badly deceived. However, there are many other things to be considered, but I will not attempt to talk long on any one of these points. We will take color for illustration. It alone is a very im - portant point in the draft horse, as some colors have much greater selling value than others. Take some of our highest buyers, Swift and Armour for instance, they work grays as a rule, and pay very high prices for just the kind that suits them. Our breweries work grays and roans, and some of them dark sorrels. The brewers are generally high buyers, but must have an advertised color. The National Biscuit Company uses grays in some cities; in Philadelphia they use grays altogether. So you see a horse's color is of great value in many cases. When we horse buyers are buying a horse that is to sell in open sale ring, we have to consider and merely make a guess as to how he will ap - pear in the ring, as some horses "get away from the whip," as we term it, better than others, and some have a lofty way of moving about to make them sell well. Some are sour and headstrong, not making a good appear - ance in the sale ring. A horse's best age for market is from five to eight years; some might be fed at a profit a little younger, some a little older. We will now consider preparing the horse for market. Before putting your horses on feed after you raise or buy them, especially if you intend feeding them for some time, there are a few things which should be done to them. The first thing is to float off the rough edges of his grinders, as they are often in bad shape for him to grind his feed right, which is im - portant in a feeding horse. If h» has any colt teeth they should be pulled, </seg>
            <seg id="p315">as a horse with a full mouth is of more value on the market.. Next the ragged edges should be trimmed off his feet. It Is very important that a horse has good feet, as most of them go east to do hard work on paved streets, and an eastern buyer demands the best of feet. A western buye is not eo strict about the feet, as they generally expect to use them on dirt yet all buyers like good feet. In fact, I think any farmer for his own use should keep his horses' feet well trimmed, for he can not tell when h might want to sell him; in fact he is better for farm work with good fee Remember that all these little things are necessary to make a first-class horse. There is another thing of great importance I want to impress upo your minds: whether you are raising horses to feed or buying them to feed be sure to get them rugged, big boned, good middle, and low down, would rather a horse would look a little coarse when I go to feed him tha to look too fine and delicate. When he gets the fat he will have the qua ity, for quality Is fat. These are the best definitions I know of. Now when you get possession of one of these truly good types of the draft horse my advice would be to get him in fine shape before offering him for sale. Do not lead him in to show a buyer, ragged, rough, and poor, then wonder what is the matter with the horse buyer. Too many of the poor ragged kind that are classed too thin in flesh when led in to sell really have no job on earth. Mr. Horse-buyer doesn't want to hurt your feelings, so, thinking the best way to get rid of you without hurting your feelings is to say that "he is just a little thin for the market; might buy him next time I come. You go home feeling good toward the buyer, think - ing he is a good fellow; but if he had told you the truth, that you did not have the right kind of a horse for the market, or that your horse was no good on earth, you would go home telling your friends the horse buyer was a fool and didn't know a thing about a horse. Horses are like oysters in a way; they have their seasons. So when you go to feed horses for the market you should have a knowledge of what kind each season of the year demands. However, I would say that extra good draft horses are generally in demand the year round. Jersey chunks and grocery wagon horses sell best in the spring; southern horses (those for the cotton fields) sell best in the fall and early winter. I am afraid I will give my profession away and make horse buyers of all my friends. No, this one sentence I don't mean, as I think the business of buying horses is hard to learn and easy to make mistakes at, and not many horse buyers ever get perfect in the business. I have heard a great many times that when a man gains perfection the good Lord takes him, so I guess that's the reason we never get perfect. I will go back to the text of feeding horses for market, which I claim is the most profitable of live stock feeding if properly tended to. My ad - vice would be, if you are feeding a short feed and only a limited number, to keep them up pretty close, that is, in box stalls or tied, and have a good little lot to turn them in just a few minutes in the warm part of the day. But if you are going to feed in large numbers, good warm open sheds with juat an average sized barn lot is my idea, not putting over forty in the lot </seg>
            <seg id="p316">— twenty is better. They should be pretty closely watched when they are first put together, and if there are any bad ones that keep constantly biting and kicking they should be put by themselves. Now about the feed. I do not consider it a secret about being a good horse feeder, for I think if a man is a good cattle and hog feeder, or an in - telligent man and has knowledge of what kind of food makes the moat fat, he ought to succeed as a horse feeder. Just a little difference be - tween feeding horses and cattle; horses should have better roughness, for they grind their feed better than other kinds of live stock; therefore get more good out of it. It requires good hay and roughness to keep them on what we term a balanced ration. I feed oats, corn, and bran about equal parts. When I first put them on feed I make it a little stronger of the oats and bran, then gradually fix it stronger with corn. The feed man should have a watchful eye on the horses he is feeding all the time, and he can tell a balanced ration when he has reached it. As to hay and roughness I generally feed alfalfa and some other good hay or roughness with the alfalfa, as I think a change or different kinds of roughness bal - ance a horse feed better. A horse on feed should have free access to good water, a tank heated in extreme cold weather, and plenty of salt, but not too much at a time. By this way of feeding, a horse should put on from two to four pounds a day. I generally weigh my horses often when on feed, and set down the weights; if they don't gain three pounds a day I think they are not doing well. It is not necessary to curry much when feeding, for when a horse gets fat he gets good haired and sleek. I have given you my general idea of the horse business as to breeding, feeding, and general care of the horse. I have taken all the time I have to spars along these lines. It might not be amiss to say I know a little more than I have told you, but you see by this time that I have not the Cway of telling what I know. You know poetry is good if read in the t tone. A NEW REQUIREMENT IN PURE BRED CATTLE, Prof. E. W. Hunt. There are in the feed lot at home two sows that were rejected as brood sows last spring for unsatisfactory performance at farrowing time. They were sired by the same sire and had practically the same breeding. They are of the same age and of the same general type and conformation, and weighed practically in the same notch. They have always been in the beat of health. They were turned into the feed lot at the same time and have had the same feed, and today one of them weighs 100 pounds more than the other. Why? Because one of them, under the ordinary condi - tions that prevail in the ordinary feed lot, has a greater capacity than the other for converting feed into flesh. A beef animal is one that converts feed into beef, and the best beef animal Is the one that, under ordinary conditions, and from a certain </seg>
            <seg id="p317">amount of ordinary feed, produces the largest amount of beef. A dairy animal is the one that converts feed Into milk, and the best dairy animal is the one that, other things being equal, under ordinary conditions, and from ordinary feed, produces the greatest amount of milk. The value of any animal depends entirely on its capacity to convert feed into a market - able product. It would not seem necessary to state and restate so simple and obvious a truth were it not for the fact that a large percentage of cat - tle on the farms of Nebraska do not possess this capacity to a remunera - tive degree. It is estimated that 60 per cent of the milch cows in the State do not pay for their board. It is feared from what investigation has already been made that beef cattle can not make a better showing, on a strict economic reckoning. What are we going to do about it? In what direction does the remedy lie? Shall we stop raising cattle because with our present methods we have been raising them at a loss? The world needs cattle products, and we must furnish our share of them. The remedy lies in improving our methods. If we can not now raise cattle at a profit, let us learn to do so. It can be done. The first step in this direction is proper breeding, breeding not so much for registration or conformation to type, as for economic produc - tion. Pure breeding is not an end in itself, but only a means to an end. Conformity to type is merely a means to an end. The end to be gained is remunerative production, the capacity to convert feed into a market - able product. Too many breeders fail to keep this end continually in view. I believe in pure bred sires to improve the stock on the ordinary farm, and use them exclusively. I do not dare to breed to grades, no matter how good individuals they may be, because I have atavism to reckon with. Atavism translated literally is grandfather-ism. It is the name of the tendency In all breeding to revert to some remote ancestral type. If I breed to a grade, the atavistic tendency may cause a reversion to some re - mote ancestral scrub in which there will be neither pleasure nor profit. There is always a danger that this will be the case. To illustrate: the Duroc hog is of comparatively recent origin. A friend of mine who is in the pure breeding business paid $100 to have one of his prize sows bred to the celebrated Can't-be-beat. The atavistic tendency asserted itself. In the resulting litter he got one boar which he kept as a curiosity. It was a veritable razor-back, a genuine Georgia wind-splitter. It would take a greyhound to catch him. On the other hand, if my sire comes from some long, illustrious ances - tral line, if the atavistic tendency asserts itself, the reversion will always be to some noble type in which there will be both pleasure and profit. Grade breeding makes atavism a menace; pure breeding through a long line of noble ancestors makes it a benefit. For this reason I believe in pure bred sires; but the breeding must be of the right kind. Such breed - ing takes time. It is a question, not of years merely, but of generations. It must be continued with one end in view long enough to convert atavism from a menace to a benefit. Until we have such breeding as this and make </seg>
            <seg id="p318">6 the prerequisite to registry the careful intelligent buyer will not be sat - led with merely the certificate of registration when he selects his breed - ing Hock. Conformity to a standard type is also desirable, but it is by no means necessary. The necessary qualification, the qualification without which all others are of no account, is the capacity to convert feed into a market - able product. Every feeder knows that it is not always the steer that most closely conforms to the beef type that makes the most profitable showing in the feed yard. The dairy type in an animal does not insure milk production. Harrington of Ainsworth has a herd of pure bred Here - fords, the finest typical beef herd' that I have seen, and yet among them are some very heavy milkers. At a judging demonstration held a few yearn ago in Gibbon they showed the poorest on the score card. These I think are exceptions to the general rule, but there are exceptions enough to for - bid making conformity to standard type an end In itself, and to demon - strate the unwisdom of being satisfied with it without looking beyond it to the really useful purpose of all breeding. I believe in conformity to stand - ard type because capacity for economic production generally goes with It and because, if an animal has the capacity for economic production, its conformation to type makes that capacity more profitable to the owner. But let us not be satisfied with this. Let us not overestimate it. The present method of making awards at our stock shows almost exclusively on the basis of conformity to type, by emphasizing this feature, has had a tendency to minimize the really important purpose of all breeding — the production of a capacity for converting feed into a marketable product. I have nothing but praise for the careful, intelligent, conscientious breeder. He has done wonders for the improvement of our cattle. But he should not be satisfied with his work. He has other heights yet to gain. Until he succeeds in eliminating from public recognition all purely commercial breeders, and produces cattle of uniformly high productive capacity he will not have attained the high aim of all breeding. How is this to be done? That is the problem to be worked oat by the breeders themselves. The breeders of dairy cattle have already made a good beginning. Certain families of dairy cattle are now generally known to be heavy producers, and members of those families command the high - eat prices. And this work has only just begun. Some similar system of practical tests for producing capacity must be devised by the breeders of beef cattle. The breeder who succeeds in producing a family of beef cat - tle of uniformly high producing capacity will not only command the mar - ket of the future, but will have done his part towards solving the problem of profitable beef production on the average farm, and will have earned the gratitude, not only of the State but of all mankind. It can not be done at once. It will require, perhaps for generations, the exercise of high in - telligence, careful, accurate observation and an unending attention to de - tail; but who would not pay the price? Just a word to the men who grow the cattle on the average farm. It is bow generally admitted that every animal is the result of the combined </seg>
            <seg id="p319">influences of heredity and environment. If the breeder supplies the proper heredity, you must supply the proper environment. Unless you do your work well his work will be of no avail. Environment includes care and feed. Your work is really more important than his. I had rather take my chances with a scrub with plenty of feed and the proper care, than with a pure bred animal without them. No one has any warrant to expect to make money out of cattle so long as a large share of the scanty and im - proper feed they get is used up for body heat and mechanical energy. The generous feeder who provides comfortable shelter from wasting weather can make money now, with cattle as they are. Cooperate with the breed - ers. Give him a chance to show what can be done with cattle that are bred right. If the breeder does his work well and the grower does his work equally well, cattle growing in Nebraska will be remunerative, no matter what prices farm land may bring. PROBLEMS FOR THE BEEF BREEDERS. By Chat. Graff, Bancroft, Nebraska. In taking up this subject, many difficult phases present themselves. Many and various conditions apply to the different states and localities, all more or less applied to suit circumstances prevailing in each agricul - tural state or district. As the beef breeds play an important part in this line, it devolves upon the beef breeders to work out and solve the difficulties that may from time to time confront them. While the breeders have made rapid progress in recent years, in developing a superior beef animal, they have not always been awake to see that no undue (or I might say foolish) re - strictions were placed upon the industry by legislation or otherwise to make it difficult or unprofitable for the breeder to find an outlet for his surplus. During past few years, in those states which were unable to get direct legislation enacted along a certain line, influence has been brought to bear upon the governor to issue a proclamation in conformity with those states that already had this new law upon their statute books. I refer to the regulations and the restrictions placed upon breeding cattle by the so-called Tuberculan Test Laws. I well realise the import - ance of guarding against disease in our herds, and we should use extreme methods to prevent and eradicate the same upon its first appearance. It is admitted that cattle not stabled and that run out in the open the year round are more free from this disease, and it is found much more preva - lent in the dairy herds farther east where poorly ventilated stables abound. Why, then, subject the breeders of the beef breeds to this imposition when it is admitted that the test is not always to be relied upon? Cattle not used to handling are more or less excited by being roped and subdued in order to make the test. The change that will affect an animal in this process is to be expected and some declared suspicious, «o the breeder or owner-to-be is at sea regarding what to do. Shall he sacrifice a valuable </seg>
            <seg id="p320">rding animal and in addition throw suspicion upon the entire herd? should at least be careful in our haste to eradicate this disease in our herds that it be done along rational lines in order that the cure may not be more dangerous than the disease Itself. We should always bear in mind that those who, at an outlay of considerable capital and labor, are in the business of breeding and raising pure bred cattle, are entitled to the same rights and privileges as one in any other legitimate line of business. If not, the business will be crippled and the advancement be thereby re - tarded. I have had more or less experience the past few years in connection with the foregoing question, and can not help but feel that not always have the breeders been consulted in placing these unreasonable restric - tions upon the breeders of this country. These restrictions and regula - tions are forced upon us by others than the breeders, and for no other ap - parent reasons than to give them also a profit growing out of the breed - ing business. In my business when I want to send out an animal to some other state, it matters not what age, if only a calf four months old, I must first call in a veterinarian, miles distant, to have this calf tested. In order to do this, he is required to make two trips or come on two different days, and his charges for this are high. Of what value is a test in this caee, and under the laws no allowance whatever is made. The breeders too often are misled by these new cures and remedies that are heralded throughout the land, but do not stand the test of time, and are often dis - carded after much injury and loss have been sustained. It must be apparent to any one that in order to improve the beef breeds, great numbers of breeding animals are continually being trans - ported by rail to different states. The beef breeders are (by many not in the business) supposed to be just coining money, and the feeling am on s such is that the breeder demands unreasonable prices for his stock offered for sale. Such ones have but little knowledge of what it re - quires to establish and maintain a pure bred herd and to keep up ac - curate records. A pure bred breeding animal, to have value as such, must first be bred by one who values honor above money. If not, the purchaser may not get value received. Also the speculator in breeding stock is another factor that the repu - table breeder has to contend with. He is to my mind responsible for the distrust which prevails to a large degree among the uninformed. He is the fellow who is usually on hand with trading property to exchange for a herd which some fellow has perhaps obtained by buying inferior animals from some one who got them much along the same lines. If the reputa - ble breeders would make it a hard and fast rule to beef out all such animals in their herds that do not come up to a certain standard, this traffic referred to above would soon be eliminated. Also it is vitally im - portant that the officers of the Breeders' Associations are the men of the highest character and integrity. They should deal without fear or favor </seg>
            <seg id="p321">1'H.M KKIiINliS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AUKHTLTIKK 321 and perform their duties in such a way that any one becoming associated, as a breeder, who is or may be inclined to be indifferent, careless, or dis - honest would find it very poor grazing in this field. Again, those of you who are inclined to differ with me upon the fol - lowing subject as breeders of registered beef cattle are entitled to a hear - ing as to the regulation and restrictions to be adopted to prevent disease in our herds. Others not identified with the breeding business, and who for personal reasons take an active part in foisting upon the breeders un - reasonable and expensive measures, to give them also a profit growing out of the same, should come out in the open and explain to the breeders their position. As a breeder, sending cattle of all ages in to many states, I now find so much red tape to contend with that I am about ready to swap places with the professional man, knowing that the breeders' chances of making good in such an arrangement would at least be equal. The professional man might in that case lose interest and think twice before attempting to purify the earth and everything upon it. I have all my life handled cattle, and for the past twenty years have given most of my time and efforts in building up a herd of breeding cattle. During this period I have endeavored to inform myself relative to the dis - eases the bovine breed is heir to. I have followed the profession through those trying periods when they were tussling with diseases called "hol - low-horn" and "wolf-in-the-tail ." Also when the dishrag had to be sub - stituted for the cud the old cow had lost. Have also followed carefully the trail of the festive grub or ox warble. They are heading now to dis - cover how this warble always appears just under the skin on the top line between the shoulder and hip by saying that the animal in some form eats this grub and it then works, out always at this particular point. How the little calf that receives his entire nourishment in milk from the dam has these grubs, we have not been told; also why it is that cattle with a very thin hide are much more affected with this grub. Is it, after all, not possible that this warble or grub is deposited by the big black fly, as it is always found upon this particular part of the animal where the tail can not reach them? While this agitation has been going on in regard to tuberculosis, some of our live stock journals, it appears, carry a professional "Hoss" Doctor upon their pay roll who, week after week, dishes up this tuber - culosis bugaboo and how dangerous this disease is. When the old farm - er writes in saying that his old cow seems to be a little indisposed, the holler comes back to look out; that the case seems suspicious, and to have her tested for tuberculosis. The same is true if she has fleshed up and thereby becomes a little sluggish or lazy, or if thin in flesh and has that tired and hungry look; or if she gets bloating spells, or perhaps gets poor carrying around part of a spool of barbed wire or a couple of young trees for a yoke to keep her from getting where she might be able to get something to eat, besides the rag-weed, sour-dock, and jimson weeds. In fact if she. in any way does not carry herself as a well-behaving good a </seg>
            <seg id="p322">cow should, look out; the case seems very suspicious and you should forthwith have her tested for tuberculosis. After all this has been dished up to the readers the past few years, it may give many the belief it Is just fool luck and providence that the entire bovine breed has not been wiped from the face of the earth. How sad to contemplate after all the old cow has done for the human race that her days seem to be numbered and the time is near at hand when she will be no more. It is enough to make the average man feel fearful for the outcome. If. after the old row has for ages nourished and fed the hu - man race, and in addition has perpetuated and reared her own species, how sad to behold that the time has arrived when we should always be suspicious of the cow, her ancestors, and posterity. Hope springs eternal in the human breast that the foregoing is but a dream, and that the cow will soon be able to prove her innocence and once more take her place as of yore to nourish and feed the multitudes. To use a court parlance: today she stands convicted without so much as a charge having ever been filed against her, and without ever having been indicted or without ever having had a fair trial. All for no other reason than that her half-sister in the East has been more or less afflicted with this malady. What would we think of a law that, in order to convict the guilty, the entire human race was held guilty until each and every one had stood trial and proven their innocence? Is not that the present condition the beef breeds are subject to? Thirty-nine states now have this law in some form. All the middle states, with the exception of Illinois. And is It not a fact that, only for the activities displayed by the veterinary profession have these measures been inaugurated? I know from personal experi - ence the profession has been entirely too active in assisting the breeders to obtain legislative enactments that more often give them the lion's share growing out of the same. Just recently a meeting was pulled off at Chi - cago claiming to be of national scope by an organization calling them - selves the United States Live Stock Sanitary Association. From the press reports, we are led to believe that this meeting was of monstrous propor - tions in numbers. Prom all the resolving and resoluting which appear to have taken place at this meeting we are led to believe this body was composed of men having only the general welfare of the people at heart. They deplored the condition that Illinois finds herself in, denounced the attitude of the people of said state for their short-sighted policy by saying that Illinois is thereby fostering a disease-producing center which must be a constant source of danger to surrounding stateit. Is this not conflicting argument which calls Illinois the dumping ground for diseased cattle and in the same breath acclaims it is dangerous to the surrounding states, when all the surrounding states have a law prohibiting such cattle from en - tering unless they have first obtained a certificate of health, showing that they are free from tuberculosis. The members of this meeting were not the breeders. Look at the officers elected and you will notice; Dr. </seg>
            <seg id="p323">So-and-son from here and Dr. So-and-so from there. Does any one believe that these fellows coming from everywhere (long distances) at a great ex - pense to some on* which reports giveth not, are doing this for the sole purpose of preventing the bovine breed from becoming extinct? The breeders of beef cattle feel that an injury has been done them and a blow dealt the industry that was ill deserved. Those identified with the breeding of the improved breeds of beef cattle, those who have put a vast amount of capital into the business, those who have made it a life work are to my mind the best qualified to say what regulation should be applied, and they should be at least consulted before any re - strictive measures are inaugurated. At this Chicago meeting I noticed these fellows also resoluted that the legislators and the governors must be looked after, which shows that they understand their business. But why not look up the breeders? Is it not possible that they, too, might kable to offer some advice and in that way create a more friendly ing between them? In closing I can not refrain from calling attention to the resignation of Prof. H. R. Smith, as Professor of Animal Husbandry at the State Farm, a man whom I have known for many years and with a keen satis - faction noticed his diligent and faithful service. I feel that I voice the sentiment of the breeders of improved live stock of Nebraska when I say that few men anywhere in any state holding a like position have done as much for the improvement of our live stock industry. He has himself to hundreds of our citizens by his untiring efforts in ■ofession Hundreds of our young men whom he has instructed in the science of breeding and feeding the past ten years will swear by him and much regret his leaving us. He is a man well known by our people and un - derstands the condition existing in our State. Considering all the fore - going, I feel that a mistake (if not a serious blunder) has been made in Nebraska by permitting Professor Smith to leave us. El is not my purpose to criticise those responsible, but to call your tion to these matters. It appears to me good and valid reasons not been given us why this change was deemed necessary at this when Nebraska has made such phenomenal progress in more and r improved live stock under his instruction and guidance. Nebraska has just begun to develop her possibilities as a producer of beef, and with the great shortage of beef cattle that now confronts us in the United States we should encourage and stimulate the industry- Nebraska offers many advantages for the production and finishing of beef cattle, and will, if we do our duty, make much more rapid progress In the future than ever in the past. So my friends let u» not shirk our duties. Let us all push and pull for better things. </seg>
            <seg id="p324">THE DEBT BREEDERS OWE TO THE SOIL. By Thot. Andrews. Let ua first consider why the breeder is in debt to the soil. We are told by authority that the plants grow in the soil, take from it from two hundred to cix hundred pounds yearly of the minerals found in it. and the passage of water through it also carries away other qualities, so that the soil would gradually lose its power of supporting plant life were it not enriched. Now the soil has given us of its richness for food for our live stock, and in return demands pay, with interest, in other words demands fertilization. How else can this be accomplished but by giving back what we have taken from it? It would be a ruinous process to go drawing upon this supply without adding from time to time. In the form of fertilizers, the most common of which is barnyard man - ure. The breeder owes his entire success to the soil. To be a successful breeder, good soil is the first consideration, then give it good care, sell nothing from the farm in the way of grain, hay, or straw, but rather feed your hay and grain and use your straw for bedding. In this way plenty of manure will be obtainable, and this should be car - ried back to the soil, which yielded you so plentifully. By so doing, good rich pasture will be grown for your stock, which a breeder can do nothing without. Good grass is king for the breeder. There is as much difference in the crops raised on a poorly nour - ished farm and a richly nourished farm as between a suit of clothes made from poor material and one from good material. Just as true as I have good stock, proper care and feed must be given them, so it is to have good soil it must be cared for and fed scien - tifically. Let os. then, keep this in mind "give of our best — and the best will come back to us" for the Interest and welfare of our posterity. CAN THE RANCHER AFFORD TO FINISH HIS CATTLE IN THE FEED LOT? C. 8. Reese, Simeon, Nebraska. I appreciate this opportunity of meeting the men from all parts of Nebraska who are engaged in the great live stock industry. My subject will be dealt with from the viewpoint of the average rancher, in the light of experience and consideration of present conditions as found in my sec - tion of western Nebraska. The country in which we live being largely devoted to stock grow - ins. very little grain is raised, and as railroads are not numerous, the average rancher would of necessity have to secure a location in a region where grain is grown, or on the railroad where it could be shipped in should he wish to finish his cattle on grain. In either event, this would require a separate business from the home ranch. </seg>
            <seg id="p325">We have been unable so far to grow tame grasses to a very great ex - tent, and with a few exceptions are using the hay and grazing provided by nature. They do not make a balanced ration fed with corn, and this would operate against the proposition of finishing our own cattle. We are anxious to learn to what extent the legumes can be grown. We are watching the Experiment Station at Valentine and our progres - sive neighbors for light on this subject. If we can be shown how to do this It will revolutionize stock growing in our part of western Nebraska. Until we are taught a better way we can only make the best use of what materials we have at hand. Many of my neighbors have been engaged in feeding cattle previous to taking up the ranch business, and I do not know of one who is finish ing his own cattle. The feeding of cattle successfully is a business of its own, and in my Judgment is not practical for a rancher unless he is situated in a section where alfalfa can be grown and grain secured without extra expense. Under such conditions I believe he could finish products successfully. We want to be in the finishing game however, and realize that it is up to us to deliver to the man who completes the finishing, an animal that is as nearly finished as is possible under our conditions. Our him cattle brought as high as six cents on the market last fall. Bear with me while I digress from my subject, while I give you a method which is practical and profitable, which in my judgment is the one we will be forced to adopt in the future. I was very much Interested in an experiment made at the North Platte station. One hundred steer calves were purchased at weaning time and carried until they were past three years old, when they were shipped to market at South Omaha. These cattle lost money, and the conclusion of those in charge was that it is not profitable to grow feeders for market under their conditions. We ranchers are operating under very similar conditions. Our land and feed have risen in value. We no longer have the use of Uncle Sam's domain for grazing. We must own or control all of the land we use; $4 and $5 per ton for prairie hay is a common price of late years. You ask. How, then, will you raise a steer until he is past three yean old and sell him at a profit? Unless conditions change mightily, the three-year-old steer must go. He has been weighing from eleven to thirteen hundred pounds. A two-year-old must take his place. This Two must, by breeding and feeding, be made to weigh about as much as the three formerly did. If we find this ground untenable, then the yearling weighing eight or nine hundred or more must take his place. There are several pure blood herds in our country. We find they keep fat on less feed than the grades. The drouth taught us we must keep fewer cattle. We have been using pure blood sires for several years. The quality of our cattle is improving splendidly. We must se - lect the cows that keep fat and raise their calves as the future mothers of our herds. Those calves will be fed a light grain ration the first win - ter and then given all they can eat until they are past one or two; </seg>
            <seg id="p326">thus we will be able to deliver an animal of good quality, one which will be in good condition and require a minimum amount of high-priced feed to finish. At the sale of the international yearling, two, and three-year-old steers an average of $11.09 for yearlings, $11 for two's and $11.04 for three's was received. This is a good omen for the younger cattle propo - sition. One of our best stockmen, who has practiced It for several years, states that a light grain ration the first winter will add two hundred pounds to the weight of a steer when he is three years old if properly cared for after the first winter. One of our chief hopes is to bring our herds as nearly as possible to a pure blood basis. The cattle from one of our ranches of high grade and good quality will bring a price so near to that received for grain-fed stock that many time* the expense of the feed lot is not returned to the feeder. The greater part of western Nebraska is essentially a lire stock country. There must be regions where cattle can be grown at a profit to the operator. A friend tells me that a three-year-old feeder steer in Germany is worth about $100 and bogs $12 per 100 pounds. This Is largely due to the dense population and cost of production. We are trav - eling In that direction. Cattle can not become as cheap as they formerly were and not wreck those who are raising them. Sin riew of the present outlook, a shortage of four million cattle and Increase of sixteen million people in the United States in the last ten years, the rancher is Justified in meeting a reasonable expense to better his herd. While sections of the West will be taken and converted into profit - able agricultural regions, there will be vast domains which will be de - voted to raising live stock for many years. Neither the soil or rainfall is suitable for farming. I would not change this condition. Feeders need the stock raised in such places to fill feed lots in the grain belt. It will be under different conditions when you men can grow feeder cattle on land worth from $100 to $200 per acre. The rancher with his cattle, sheep, and grass is a very necessary factor in this great agricultural life. I do not see that it is practical or desirable that he should finish his cattle in the feed lot. He has a place to occupy which requires skill and training in order to succeed. In the future all his energy will be directed toward bringing up the quality of his stock rather than to increase the number in his herd. In following out his chosen line he will be able to deliver goods to the man who raises grain that will furnish n business that will maintain the fertility of his soil. The rancher's and farmer's interests go hand in band, and thus they will be able to furnish meat at a price the laboring masses can af - ford to pay. It is said that a pessimist always goes broke in this country. While conditions in most all agricultural life have changed a great deal there are bright prospects ahead. When we had free grass and cheap feed we </seg>
            <seg id="p327">received a light check on sale day. Now cost of production is high, bat the check on sale day is correspondingly high. IThe rancher's business is being established on a solid foundation is coming to where "none dare to molest him or make him afraid." The round-up wagon has been replaced by schoolhouses and churches. Cowboys now use pitchforks more than lariat ropes. The men cooks have been replaced by refined wives, and children play around comfort - able homes. The jingle of spurs has given way to the sound of organ or piano. The 1912 rancher is a student and a valuable citizen of our great State. FEEDING TESTS. By Prof. H. R. Smith The average of three tests in which corn and prairie hay was com - pared with corn and alfalfa hay, 900-pound steers made average daily gains of 1.5 pounds on corn and prairie hay, 2.1 pounds on corn and al - falfa, 36 per cent more corn was required to make a pound of gain with prairie hay than with alfalfa hay, and the cost of producing gains was 32 per cent greater with prairie hay. In these three trials there was found to be an average loss of 27 cents per head on corn and prairie hay, and a profit of $5.02 on corn and alfalfa hay, and these profits were made on a selling price of but $1.25 per hundred more than the cost price at the be - ginning of the feeding. In two trials in which corn and alfalfa was compared with corn, alfalfa, and corn stover, the average daily gains were identical, but the cost of producing 100 pounds of gain was 40 cents per hundred less by using corn stover with the alfalfa than with alfalfa alone, and the net profits per head were 56 cents greater where the stover was used. In this computation the stover was figured at $2.50 per ton. If it had been figured at $4.35 per ton there would have been no advantage in using it in the ration, nor any disadvantage. In other words, corn stover proved to be worth $4.35 per ton. In this comparison the corn had been husked in the stalk in order to get an accurate weight on the grain. Had it been fed unhusked such as is possible in commercial feed - ing, the cost of production could have been further decreased and the profits made correspondingly greater. The average of the three tests show that corn stover has a value two-thirds as great as prairie hay for feeding purposes. It is safe to conclude that the portion of the corn stalk ordinarily consumed has a feeding value fully equal to prairie hay pound for pound. In a comparison of wheat bran, cottonseed meal, linseed meal and alfalfa hay as sources of protein, it was found in one test that the aver - age daily gain on corn, bran, and prairie hay was two pounds; on corn, cottonseed meal and prairie hay 2.3 pounds; on corn, linseed meal and prairie hay 2.5 pounds; on corn, alfalfa, and prairie hay 2.3 pounds. In another experiment the average daily gains of corn, bran, and corn stover was 1.8 pounds; on corn, cottonseed meal, stover 2.1 pounds; on corn. </seg>
            <seg id="p328">pounds. In both tests the lowest cost of production was by the use of alfalfa. With this bay the average cost of producing gains was $7.20 per hundred, figured on a basis of 36 cent corn and $6 alfalfa. The coat of production was higher on the other protein foods in the order named. With linseed meal costing $30 per ton. the cost of producing gains was 18 per cent greater than on alfalfa at $6 per ton. The alfalfa proved to be worth $13 per ton in comparison with linseed meal at $30. With cot - tonseed meal costing $30 per ton, it was found that beef was produced at a cost 17 per cent greater than on alfalfa hay at $6 per too. With bran costing $16.50 per ton, it was found that beef was produced at a cost 38 per cent greater than on alfalfa at $6 per ton. It is safe to aay that three pounds of good alfalfa hay is equivalent to two pounds of wheat bran for beef production. In three experiments in which a heavy feed of com with alfalfa wad compared with a medium feed of corn, and a light feed in which corre - spondingly more alfalfa was used in the latter feeds, the following con - clusions were drawn: with com above 35 cents per bushel and with al - falfa not to exceed $7 per ton, the old method of fattening cattle for market, namely that of crowding with grain and using but little rough - age, is much less profitable than a more moderate use of grain and cor - respondingly more roughage. Not to exceed three-fourths of a full feed of corn and a correspondingly larger quantity of alfalfa will give prac - tically the same daily gains; the cattle will take on quite as good a finish during an equal length of time on feed, and will bring as much per pound as when given all the torn that will be consumed; and these things will be accomplished at a reduced cost of production with larger profits to the feeder. With a good quality of alfalfa at $6 per ton or less, and corn above 50 cents per bushel, Eomething approaching half a full feed of corn is still more profitable, if one is in a position to keep the cattle in the feed lot one or two months longer than the usual time given to a full feed of grain. Lengthening the feeding period increases to some extent the interest charges on the money invested and the labor connected with ri feeding operations, but with the more liberal use of alfalfa the manure more valuable and a larger market provided at the farm for a hay crop, which at $6 or more per ton in the stack or mow is exceedingly profitable to grow. Allowing $1.50 per ton for harvesting the crop, a field » alfalfa yielding 4 tons to the acre for the season (an average crop in braska) the net revenue per acre at $4.50 per ton would amount to $18 which is 6 per cent interest on $300 per acre. With the increased demand for corn and the limited area adapted for its successful growth, this grain is certain to command a much higher price in the future than it has in the past. From the results of this series of experiments it would seem advisable to make a larger use of roughage and less grain than has been done in the past. Former experiments also show the advisability of feeding with the alfalfa some cornstalks to lessen scours, to furnisu variety, and to lower the cost of production by the utilization of a cheap feed which otherwise goes to waste on the average Nebraska farm. </seg>
            <seg id="p329">THE ALL-PURPOSE CATTLE. By Wm. Ernst The farmer of today, with hie high-priced land, can not afford to keep scrub cattle on his farm. It costs just as much, yes, it costs more, to raise a scrub cow than to raise a high grade or pure bred. As the price of farm land went up, many fanners reduced their herds, in fact quit the cattle business keeping only a few milch cows for the family use. The pastures and meadows were turned into grain fields, and the farmer coined money for a while, cropping those fertile lands, made fertile by the good old cow. Not a great many years and the farmer discovered that cropping the land year after year and hauling those crops to market exhausted the fertility of the soil, and humus, not absorbed by continuous cropping, would wash' away. It soon became apparent that to save the farm tho cow had to be returned, and today no up-to-date thinking farmer will dispute the fact that live stock in general, and cattle in particular, must be kept on the farm. Many fanners who returned to the breeding of cattle to save their land, call their herd a necessary evil, which Is perhaps a most appropriate name for their kind of cattle, be - cause, owing to their poor quality and breeding, they are not a paying proposition to their owners. The only cattle that pay today, on high - priced land, are either cattle of the Improved beef breeds or of the dairy or milking varieties. By careful breeding and selecting, some of the breeders of the so - called beef breeds have succeeded in producing great milkers. I will not set up the claim that the Shorthorn cattle are the only beef breeds that can be made profitable as a dairy herd; in fact we know better. We have owned pure bred Hereford cows which raised two calves at a time, which would weigh 400 lbs. each at weaning time. I remember distinctly of sending a 900 lb. Hereford cow to market, with her two calves, the two weighing 900 lbs. at less ihan seven months of age. We owned many Angus cows, two and three years old, which had spoiled udders, because their calves could not handle their milk. Had those cows just spoken Ibeen properly handled and their records kept they might have equaled ne of the Shorthorn records which I will speak of. With your permission I will go a little into Shorthorn history to prove what has been accomplished with pure bred Shorthorns at the pail. One of the first of the English breeders to pay special attention to the dairy quality of his herd was Jonas Whitaker, whose cows were cele - brated throughout all England for their splendid udders and their heavy flow of milk. Bates was always proud of his butter record. In the early days there was scarcely a herd of note that did not possess cows of ex - ceptional capacity in this direction. Sir Charles Knightley, with his "Fawsley Fillpails," carried the reputation of the Shorthorn as a milking stock throughout the entire cattle-breeding world. A cow, "Dowager 3d." bred and owned by C. A. Pratt, of Rushford, England, had a milk record of 68 pounds in one day, from which 2 lbs. </seg>
            <seg id="p330">and 10 oz. of butter were made. Her record for one year was 561 lbs. of butter. According to an official test made by the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture in 1890. tbc cow "Mistletoe of the Grove" performed at a two-days test as follows: first day, milk 32 lbs. and 7 oz., butter 1.46 lbs.; second day, milk 28 lbs and 9 oz., butter 1.27 lbs. Total milk for two days was 61 lbs.; total amount of butter in two days was 2.73 pounds. At the Nebraska State Fair in 1891 "Lady Jane Constance" (vol. 31, page 747) in a two-days test made 2.6 lbs. of butter, while "Maggie Gunter ' (vol. 32, page 508) made 2.4 lbs. I could produce a long list of records equal or superior to the above, but will now turn to records that will In - terest you more, because they are nearer to us. I will speak of Short - horn milk records made at this, the University Farm of Nebraska, under the direction of Professor A. U Haecker. In 1903 we sold the State Uni - versity the cow "Floranee Airdrie 6th." This cow made an average ot 422.93 lbs. of Dutter per year for three successive years, and her one year's record was 10.438 lbs. of milk and 494.9 pounds of butter. The herd bull "Florence Viceroy," reared at the University of Ne - braska, now In use at Wolfcreek Stock Farm, has a double cross of "Flor - ence Adrie 6th," of which cow Professor Haecker says in a letter under date of May 13, 1911, "Counting her six complete yearly records, during which time she had six calves, I know there is no record, in this or for - eign country, of a pure bred Shorthorn cow that is better." Another cow, "Nelly 2d" (vol. 49) showed the following official rec - ord at the State Farm for one year: 9.393.5 pounds of milk, testing 3.53 per cent butter fat, and making 386.75 pounds of butter. The mother of this cow, "Nellie Burdick," took a hundred-dollar prize for being the best milk cow in the state of Kansas. She produced under the Fair Associa - tion restrictions in two days 68 pounds 12 oz. milk, testing 4.1 per cent butter fat. We had another daughter of "Nellie Burdick" tested at the State Farm. This cow "Linda Belle," when only two years old, made a butter record 137 pounds of butter In eighty-eight days. The mother of our herd bull "Varsity Florence," bred and owned by the University, at the age of two years three months and twenty-five days, produced 5.785.4 lbs. of milk, containing 4.33 per cent butter fat according to the University records. We have established oue fact, and that is that in order to develop the udder of our cows to its best capacity we had to establish the rule of breeding our heifers at the age of about eighteen months, and further - more we raise the calves of our best milkers by hand. We had a good herd of milking Shorthorns well under way when our progress along this line received a back-bet, by using pure Scotch bulls. We were com - pelled to do so because young bulls were hard to sell unless they had at least several Scotch top crosses. But fortunately one of our Scotch herd bulls, "Baron Surmise," while himself of the beef type, proved to be one of the greatest milch cow producers we ever owned. However, we did not find this out until we had sold him, and we bought him back at a </seg>
            <seg id="p331">long price when we discovered our mistake. In speaking of "Baron Sur - mise" a 2,100 pound bull of an outspoken beef type, we have to admit that his male calves did not always carry that character, but many of them made good as milk cow producers. I will refer to only two of them. The first, "Varsity Surmise," found his way in a roundabout manner to the dairy herd of the Hospital for the Insane at Lincoln. A former owner, to whom we had sold the bull, wanted him back when his heifers freshened, and here is what Steward Albert D. Gilmore wrote as under date of October 22, 1907: "Varsity Surmise is worth a thousand dollars to this institution. The State Farm hag a cow with us at present which they desire to breed to him. Another son of 'Baron Surmise' went to E. A. Foster of Phoenix, Arizona, who sold him for $2,000 to head a Uiiry herd in that state." In conclusion, I want to state the fact that in order to produce large milking Shorthorns we have not been compelled to sacrifice either the Mze nor the easy feeding qualities of our herd. Our cows weigh in ordi - nary flesh from 1,500 to 1 600 lbs., and most of them hold their flesh re - markably well during heavy flows, of milk. It is a well-known fact that the milking habit is one which may lie dormant if neglected and which is yet susceptible of cultivation to a re - markable degree. At present a large portion of Shorthorn breeders de - vote their attention rather to the development of the feeding and flesh - ing qualities of their stock at the expense of the milk-making tendencies. This is a point which needs attention. It is a well-known fact that the best milkers as a rule prove the best mothers, rear the best calves, and thus become the most reliable sources of profit in the herd. A typical Shorthorn cow requires no "wet-nurse" for her calf and by judicious sys - tem of selection and management any good breeding herd may become noted for its milk as well as for its beef. In this fact lies the chief glory of the Shorthorn. 1. Jonas Whitaker was a cotton manufacturer of Leeds. Yorkshire, England. He closed out his herd in 1833. 2. Thos. Bates bought in 1804 from Charles Collins the four-year-old cow Duchess by Daisy Bull (186). She is described as a deep rich milcher, making as high as 14 lbs. of butter per week. She gave on grass alone when six years old 14 qts. of milk twice a day, of which 42 os. of butter (21 lbs. and 10 oz.) were made. She became the mother of the great Duchess Tribe. 3. Nellie 2d was bred lour months after the above test was begun, and consequently her yearly record was reduced perhaps 100 lbs. In but - ter. Had she not been bred until the close of the test she would have produced 500 lbs. of butter. It must be understood that those tests are quite expensive. In the case of Nellie 2d we lost the use of her for a full year because, while the cow was milked at the University Farm, we raised her calf at home by hand, besides shipping our herd bull up here. 4. We broke off the test of 'Linda Belle" in order to ship her home to be bred to "Baron Surmise." She would have made 450 lbs. easy dur - ing the year had we gone on with the test. She has done it ever since. </seg>

By Mark Woods. certainly appreciate the very great honor of your placing me on program. I was born and raised on a farm in Illinois. About the thing I can remember in my early childhood was being treed by a blood Berkshire boar and riding on the back of old Gilderoy, an im - ported Oallaway bull who came in the second importation of Oallaway cattle that ever crossed the water to America. So you see from my early infancy to the present time, I have always had more or less dealings and association with pure bred stock. My father emigrated to Nebraska thirty years ago. Like most young men he came west to grow up with the country. He landed in Lincoln $10,000 in debt, but he had the nerve and good luck to be able to borrow $1,500 more money, which he in rested In two imported Gallaway bulls and two imported Gallaway cows. This was the last debt that he paid off, and in those days money cost 10 per cent I have heard him say a great many times he paid ten per cent interest payments of $160 each before he finally succeeded in paying the principal. We had sixty cows of our own. We bred these cows and all our neighbors' cows, contracting all the bull calves at weaning time at a fair price. These young bulls we fed all winter, and in the spring shipped them west and sold them for eeed for the ranchmen in Colorado, Wyom - ing, and Montana. It took these cattle but a few years to raise the debt. Many who know my father well will see why it is that he is always advising a young man to handle thoroughbreds, to buy a few good bloods, to breed pure and better stock. He does that not only because he suc - ceeded in it himself, but because he saw many hundreds of others do likewise. The State of Nebraska is simply one great big farm. It has no for - ests and no mines, but it has treasures locked in its vaults of fertile soil that far excel either of those other natural resources. It is the combina - tion on the locks of these vaults of our vast prairies that organized agri - culture, improved live stock breeders' associations, and our agriculture experiment schools have been so successful solving for the past twenty years. We can all remember when we had but two crops in Nebraska, one of corn, the other hay, and no market for either. I have seen 6,000 bushels of corn piled on the prairie and left to rot, as it did not pay to kMl it fifteen or twenty miles to the railroad for eight and ten cents per </seg>
            <seg id="p333">. bushel. We young men who are living today owe a great debt of grati - tude to the pioneers of those western prairies. The hardy men and women who braved the tomahawks of the Indians, who endured the heat and drouth of the treeless plains, who sacrificed their lives in the terrible blizzards and the awful prairie fires, that left nothing but death and deso - lation in their wake. A few of the survivors of these trials and priva - tions are with us. A few years more and only from the pages of history can we learn of the price they paid that the younger generations might occupy this wonderfully fertile land, whose secret treasury doors we have been unlocking from year to year, and that have been yielding gold far beyond the expectation of the wildest dreams of our fathers and fore - fathers. While we have none of the trials and tribulations of these hardy pioneers, nature never intended that we should be without our troubles. The luxury of yesterday is the necessity of today. While our diversified crops have greatly increased our revenue strangely enough our wants seem to keep pace with them, and like an avenging shadow, it is ever just over our shoulder. Modern transportation facilities have opened the markets of the world to us and against us. It is still and al - ways will be the survival of the fittest. Yesterday it was a contest of muscle and brawn; today it is a contest of nerve and brain. Success means making two blades of grass grow where but one grew before; in producing a better quality and larger quantity of beef, pork, or mutton on a smaller area and in the most economic fashion. These problems all have to be worked out on a scientific basis. It is just as necessary for the farmers of Nebraska to have a large corps of scientists at work In our laboratories as it is necessary for the United States Steel Co. to have chemists constantly at work in their laboratories. Carnegie is probably the greatest steel man of the age and when asked recently why he succeeded, he answered because he followed the advice of many great men with which he surrounded himself. He tells the story of Schwab coming to his office and telling him he could make fteel $10 a ton cheaper by the open hearth method, that he demonstrated it in the laboratory. Carnegie did not wait for some other steel manu - factory to take this up but he was the first in the market. Our scientists and laboratories have told us how we can feed balanced rations, how we can save 40 per cent of the corn crop by the use of the silo, how we can produce beef 33*4 per cent cheaper by the proper selection of feeding animals. They have demonstrated this for years in their laboratories and in the feed lots. There are even tome farmers who are so back - ward today that they are not growing alfalfa. It took twenty years to convince sixty per cent of the farmers of Nebraska that alfalfa was a great crop. I hope it will not take as long to bring about the other eco - nomic changes that have proven themselves in our laboratories to be sound, and correct. We can not today farm as our grandfathers farmed. We can not use the same tools that our grandfathers used, in planting and harvesting our crops; neither can we use the same machinery t&gt;ac they used in converting it into beef, pork, or mutton.

It is no more profitable today to raise and feed a poor grade of cattle, and they are just as surely a thing of the past to the wise man as it is that the bronto will soon be known only in history. The advice of all the great economic experts today is to raise fewer stock and better stock if you would reap the greatest reward for your labor and your feed. You should colonize in your community and should pick out some breed of stock that is especially adapted to your own necessity and to your local conditions. and then by cooperation and the use of the very best sires that you can buy, you should make it your life business to try and excel the other localities in your specialty. »For instance, take the country of Perch in France. It is known &gt;ughout the civilized world for its Percheron horses. Streams of gold ■ from South Africa, from South America, from North America, and the civilized countries on earth. The same is true with the Hereford"? in Herefordshire, England; with the white and black Holstein in the lit - tle country of Holland; the Clydes, the Gallaways and Angus in Scotland. Just suppose today that just one county in the State of Nebraska made it their business to raise the very best Holstein cattle, and say that 25 per cent of the farmers in that county had been continually raising these cat - tle, attaining a higher standard every ten years. The amount of wealth that would today be flowing into that county would excel the crops and the live stock industry of any four counties in the State. Remember you can always judge a man by the kind of stock he has around him, and a man who is living on a Nebraska farm today without any stock is nothing more nor less than a grafter. Grafters in the past ten years have been very unpopular. We have weeded them out 01 the country and state organizations and our city governments. We have ex - posed them throughout the country from ocean to ocean, but, gentlemen. 1 believe today that the man who owns a farm on our broad prairies, who is raising wheat and corn and oats and shipping it to market on wheels, is really a greater grafter than the man who steals in our city councils. He is either grafting from his children or grafting from unborn generations. He may think that he owns the land; he may have the title to it so he can read his abstract clear; but when we stop to think he owns nothing. In a few years he will only occupy six feet of space in the nearest cemetery, and the land will be passed on to others. He is simply tenant today, and for every bushel of corn that he ships to market lie is robbing the future generation of 15 cents; he is robbing the soil and placing nothing back; he is drawing out the deposits in nature's savings banks that have taken thousands of years to accumulate, without redepositing one cent in re - turn, and as I said before, for a few paltry dollars, is either robbing his own children or the unborn generations of their rightful heritage. </seg>
            <seg id="p335">RELATION OF THE BEEF PRODUCER TO THE MARKET. By Bruce McCullough, Omaha. K'here can be no two opinions as to the value of scientific agriculture, ing is unquestionably the greatest science of them all. but it has re - mained for the twentieth century to accord the school of agriculture its proper high place in the field of human research. Scientific farming is simply following natural laws instead of going against them, and if there is one thing more than another that the study of agriculture teaches it is that live stock forms an important and even necessary part of the equip - ment of all successful fanning operations. It is therefore eminently ap - propriate that a great university such as ours should attach much im - portance to the study of live stock, with a view to improving the breed - ing and care and feeding of the animals that perform such an important part of the machinery for converting the raw products of the soil into commercial products and at the same time conserving and increasing the fertility of the land. In the study and discussion of live stock matters the important ques tion of the market value of the stock is too often overlooked. Many farmers never vary their program, year in and year out. They figure on so much corn, wheat, oats, pasture, etc., every year, and the only varia tions are due to unfavorable seasons. The condition of the markets seems to be the last thing to be considered, if it is considered at all. They handle live stock in the same manner, having a certain number of cattle, hogs, and sheep ready for market at certain times every year, the only variation in the program being caused by disease, shortage of feed, or similar circumstances. In other words, they do not study what the mar - ket calls for, and it is this very thing that I am here to urge upon all. I am very glad to say that Dean Burnett and Professor Smith have always manifested a lively interest in the market end of the business and have shown a disposition to prepare tbe kind of stock for the market that the market called for, and at the time that the demand for it was best. With the farmer who raises stock for profit the study of the market is of vital importance. The modern live stock market is the result of an evolution that has been going on for centuries although greater changes and improvements have been brought about in the past fifty years than in any previous five hundred years of history. Think for a moment how simple the process of marketing cattle is under modern conditions. Stock that is ready for market is loaded on the cars, and there the responsibility of shipping ends, and the railroads, the stock yards and the commission men do the rest. No matter whether one or 1,000 head of stock are sent to market, the shipper is absolutely certain of a market for them, and he is also absolutely certain to get the money for them, no notes, no waiting, noth - ing but the cold hard cash. The shipper sometimes thinks that the sim- plifylng of the system has brought too many middlemen into the business, and this is perhaps open to discussion. • </seg>
            <seg id="p336">Id order to get at the question properly, it is necessary to compare ancient and modern market methods, and to comprehend the many com - plications that have grown up with our present high state of civilization. A century ago, yes, even half a century ago, the fanner took his cattle direct to his butcher, who slaughtered the animals and retailed the beef to the consumers. The same thing can be done in many places today, but it is neither desirable nor profitable in most sections of the country. Now more than three-fourths of the cattle of this country are raised in the West and consumed in the East. Obviously the old method of deal - ing directly between the producer and the consumer is out of the ques - tion. The West would be overstocked with cattle and the East would be understocked with beef. Some plan had to be adopted to meet the changed conditions as they arose, and one of the first big changes was the driving and shipping of cattle hundreds of miles to eastern slaughter houses, where they were butchered and sold. It was a cumbersome and very expensive method of meeting the difficulty, but it answered the purpose for a while. As the cities increased in wealth and population and the country developed its agricultural resources, the difficulties of providing beef for the people increased along with the difficulty of finding a profitable market for the greater live stock output of the farms. The old hand-to-mouth methods were out of the question. Feast and famine supplies of stock at market centers were responsible for ruinous fluctuations in prices from day to day, and the marketing of cattle became a gamble pure and simple. This was the situation as it existed in the period immediately after the War, and there are many men living today who will remember the uncertainties of the live stock business as it existed from the close of the Civil war up into the early '70s, since they were more than once the vic - tims of the fluctuating conditions. One story will illustrate this. A well-to-do Pennsylvania farmer fattened 100 head of fine four- and five-year-old bullocks for the market He took them to Buffalo, but founil the market glutted and the price too low to suit him. Prom Buffalo he went to Philadelphia, where he again happened on an overstocked mar - ket. He was anxious to sell, but could not get a bid. There was nothing left for him to do but go on to New York city with them. This he did, but found the market overloaded with cattle, and bids were hard to get. There were no commission merchants in those good old days, and big and little butchers all came down to the stock yards every day for their sup - plies. Our Pennsylvania friend was desperate. No one wanted !00 cattle, and he was afraid peddling them out would take all spring. At this Junc - ture a speculator or gambler arrived on the scene and offered him a lump sum for his entire herd. It was not as much as he expected, but it offered a way out of his difficulty, and in sheer desperation he accepted the offer. There were few big transactions in those days, and the farmer was com - pelled to take a ten-days note for the amount, the speculator figuring that he could turn the cattle in that time. Before the end of that period, however, a big butcher who purchased most of the cattle failed in busi- </seg>
            <seg id="p337">ness, the speculator busted, and our Pennsylvania friend was compelled to go back to his home without a red cent. And this is only one of the hundreds, yes thousands, of similar instances that were constantly tak - ing place in the good old days. It took years and it took brains to develop the present system of marketing cattle, and whatever may be its defects and shortcomings it is so great an improvement over the methods in vogue half a century ago that there is really no comparison. The speculator has been or is being eliminated, and the man who has cattle ready for market has the abso - lute certainty of a demand for them and a sale that will net him spot cash. Such a thing as a stockman not getting the money for stock lie sells a packer is never heard of now, and in an experience of nearly twenty-five years in the business here at the yards I have never known of such a case. The evolution was gradual, however, and like all improvements was bitterly fought all along the line. Perhaps the first innovation was enor - mous refrigerating plants in connection with tbe slaughter houses. This naturally did away with the irregularity and uncertainty due to feast and famine supplies. The legitimate outgrowth of refrigeration was the use of refrigerator cars in which to transport the fresh beef to all parts of the country. There Can be no doubt that the present magnitude of the packing business is due primarily to refrigeration. Not so many years ago the trade considered the packing season from November to March, the winter months. Today the packing season covers the entire year, and both fresh and cured meats are obtainable every day in the With the arrival of the big packing houses located at convenient centers for securing live stock and distributing meat products, there came a demand for the live stock commission man at these centers whose duty it should be to keep himself posted on supply and demand and market conditions generally, so that the shipper of live stock could be assured of a fair and equitable price for his stock. Men who were on the market only once or twice a year could not possibly keep posted as to prices. They would be at the mercy of the buyers whether they accompanied their stock to market or not. It was to meet this condition, this natural demand, that tbe live stock commission merchant became a factor in the There are many who do not understand, hence do not appreciate the important part the commission merchant plays in the marketing of live stock. If such people could only have seen how the business of buying and selling live stock was done before the days of commission merchants and live stock exchanges they would know that the business could not now be conducted without them. The fees they receive for this work are small as compared with fees paid for similar services in other lines. Take butter, eggs, poultry, grain, hay. stocks, bonds, in fact any com - modity that is traded in, and the commission fees are much larger in proportion to the value of the commodity than in the case of live stock. </seg>
            <seg id="p338">packers nowadays. Are their charges for slaughtering, handling, and r touting meat excessive or extortionate, and if so is there a remedy? A few years ago the Garfleld commission made the only authorized and exhaustive investigation of the dressed meat business that was ever made. That commission reported to Congress that the profits of the dressed meat business were not excessive, but so firmly convinced was Congress and the country in general of the rapacity of the packers that t report was literally "laughed out of court." That report is still on rd, however, and it is worthy of note that it has never been success- fully contradicted either in part or in whole. It is such a big question, dealing as it does in the hundreds of mil- lions of dollars annually, that the average man can have little compre - hension of it, much less an adequate and just comprehension. Only last year, however, the pioneer and largest live stock organization of the country, the Texas Cattle Growers' Association, called the packers on the carpet with the complaint that the stork men were not getting enough for their cattle as compared with the prices the consumers were com - pelled to pay for their beef. It was a direct challenge to the packers, and instead of running away from it one of the packers, Swift ft Com - pany, gladly agreed to open all their books and show their figures on any bunch of cattle selected by the association. I can not here go into the minute details of the transaction, but the figures stand unchallenged and are worth referring to since they have been given to the country, examined, and audited as correct. The trans - action involved the sale, slaughter, and distribution of a bunch of 279 cattle at Fort Worth, Texas, in June, 1911, and the figures show that the beef from these steers was distributed over a large territory and sold in twenty-seven markets, scattered all the way from El Paso to New York. The following tables show the exact figures on this beef: Cost packed in coolers $15,900 28 Deduct by-product profits 3,893 91 Net cost to packer $12,006 37 Net selling price 12,360 18 Net profit to packer $ 353 81 In other words, the 279 head of steers yielded the packer a net profit r$1.27 per head, or less than 11 cents per hundred head of live weight. Now I am not here to defend the big packers. They have shown plenty of ability to take care of themselves, but I do say that these big packing plants have been of incalculable value to the live stock producers country. They have created markets for meat where there were markets, until today it is possible to secure fresh meat daily in every city and in almost every village in the United States. They have created an outlet for the live stock of our farms and ranches for every day in the year, and in this way have added to the value of every farm In the </seg>
            <seg id="p339">EThe dressed meat industry of this country has been reduced to an :t science, waste has been eliminated, and economics introduced wherever possible. By operating on an enormous scale the smallest by - products are saved, and the whole business is conducted according to the strictest business principles. I wish I could say as much for the average live stock raiser. Right here is the lesson for the farmer and breeder to learn from the packer. Professor Pugsley told us a day or two ago that no business operation was so poorly managed as farming. I tell you that no business is so well managed as the packing business. Railing at the packers aud calling them thieves does not do any good. It speaks of envy and spite. Let us learn from the packers and run our affairs as intelligently ate they do and we will have no occasion to regret the result. It all simmers down to this: In this fast age of complex business activities the old methods will no longer do. Margins of profit in the live stock business are smaller all along the line, and the stock raiser must meet these conditions by closer application, eliminating waste and keeping his eye on the market. In other words, the marketing) of live stock has now become strictly a business proposition, and the stock raiser must become a better business man. THE HOG INDUSTRY. By Chas. Dawson, Fairbury, Neb. The history of the origin and development of the American hog is really but the review of many events and epochs, which have marked off the four hundred years of the time in the growth and development of a few scattered colonies to the new ranking nation of the world, which possesses all things, agriculturally, commercially, and otherwise, in the greatest abundance, that ultimately creates the highest magnitude of power, health, and wealth to the arm, mind, and body of men and na- tions. Agriculture is the bed-rock upon which nations are builded, and their existence, degree of power, and importance are measured largely by their agricultural resources, power, and volume of food productions. Agriculture thus becomes the most vital, broadest, and deepest busi - ness of any nation, for it enters into every channel of business, affecting not only every inhabitant of that country, but it also enters and affects the intercommercial relations with foreign countries and their inhabi - tants. Agriculture, being broad, is made up of many branches and subdivi - sions. First, plant life being divided into foods and forages for both man and beast; the grains, nuts, roots, grasses, etc., furnishing such a varied diversity of food elements for every purpose and use, from mere sustenance of life to the highest possible state of finish for the animals </seg>
            <seg id="p340">of the great meat-producing branches of agriculture, namely, cattle, hogs, sheep, and poultry. The part that -the hogs take in the great business of agriculture and their consequent influence in the uplift and upbuilding of the nation is our story to relate, so we will commence with the history of the new world, wherein it tells of the ships that sailed westward and eastward as traders and explorers to far away unknown lands. As the ships of this early day were slow sailers, such voyages often took years of time, and in consequence they carried live pigs, which were fed and fattened aboard ship, to be killed on (tome far distant sea when fresh meal was needful in their diet. So through the agency of accident or design, many of the new discovered islands and lands of the new world became planted with breeding species of European and Asiatic types and breeds of swine. Columbus is credited with being the first voyager to import hogs to America, as he in his second voyage turned loose several pair of reddish cast pigs of the Spanisn type, on the West India Islands. Other Spanish voyagers followed his example with similar importations to various set - tlements to both North and South America, but there was no definite attempt to establish hog raising or pork production. On the contrary, hogs were allowed or forced to take to the woods and fight out their own problems of starvation, combatting for life, and sustenance in Nature's most primitive stronghold. In consequence they became wild and fero - cious in disposition, hardy and vigorous in body, but slow in growth and maturity, low in production of meats and fats, retrograding as the years went by, until we scarcely recognize the few remaining hog-like animals that infest the forests and glades of Southern Central America as being related by links of descent to the old-time European hog. hThe real inception ot the present American hog was the importations Virginia by the English in 1609 and subsequent dates and to their other colonies along the coastline. However, many of these went the way of the Spanish importations, but from the fruits of success attained by colonists who cared for their swine there steadily grew a well-defined business of pork production and demand for a type and breed best fitted for the New World. The early Indian wars and the following French and Revolutionary wars tended to make this demand more imperative, but it was not until after the War of 1812 that there was a real beginning of type and breed improvement, although for several years previous to this time various importations had been made of English, Chinese, Indian. Spanish, and African types and breeds. But very few of ihe early hog raisers kept their hogs in pens, so various types and breeds roamed the woods and fields, crossing and intercrossing upon one another, oftentimes inbreed - ing until all known line of descent was lost. But Nature has her own way of perpetuating animal life so that by the law of "the survival of the fittest" she weeded through the tangles of the beginning and with man's aid perpetuated certain types, and breed improvements began to mate - rialiie in certain localities. </seg>
            <seg id="p341">The Berkshirea evolved from the big old lop-eared spotted English Berk to the black, white-pointed, upright-eared, dished face, improved Berkshire of today. The Red Hog, from a primitive appearing reddish cast animal, was being transformed, in the valleys of Connecticut, New York, and New Jersey, into a real meat and lard producer of prodigous size and weight. The Chinese and white colored pigs of New York and Pennsylvania were slowly growing into the modern type Chester Whites; while selected individuals of nearly every type, breed, and color were slowly forming the basis of the coming Poland China, but it was not until the year 1830 to 1840 that witnessed certain pronounced types and breeds meeting the demands of most producers and consumers. Corn was recognized as the staple hog food, and coupled with the opening up and settling of the great valleys of Ohio and Illinois, hog raising became a necessity — to consume and market the staple crop of this region, which was corn. So it was only natural for the hog to pre - vail as the meat producer, and the type produced in this pioneer country was one that was peculiarly fitted, not only a marketable unit of meat and lard, but also a vehicle of transportation of its own self to market, it being not an uncommon sight to see droves of many hundreds of long - bodied, long-legged traveling built hogs that had been growing a year or two on the grasses and nuts of the woods with almost another year of corn feeding to fatten, trailing along to some distant market, sometimes over 100 miles away, oftentimes feeding along the highways en route, putting on their last touches of finish. But the coming of the railroads and the building of great hog pack - ing houses, near the center of hog production, gave cause for the hog raisers to breed much of the vehicle part oft from the then prevailing types and breeds. From now on the development of types and breeds was raptd. The hog was beginning to be recognized as a pork-producing machine, as an animal that could convert the grains, grasses, and by-products of the farm into concentrated marketable form, thus enabling the hog producer to carry his crops of grains to market in a few wagon loads of hogs, wherein four or five times this number would be required to haul the grains in their natural state at a much less net result in dollars and cents. So, as the years went by, the breeds became fixed in certain locali - ties, the Cheeters in Pennsylvania, the Durocs and Jersey Reds in New York and New Jersey, the Berkshires in many various places, with the big spotted forefathers of the Poland Chinas predominating in the valleys of Ohio. Then came the Civil war to stamp indelibly in the minds of all that the hog oils the mechanism of war, puts fight in the stomachs of men, keeps warm the heart of love, courage, and endurance, and brings finally successful termination to the arms of might and right. The reconstructive period following this titanic struggle (of brother against brother, wherein the pork-fed one prevailed), brought about the real commencement of organized hog breeding. Lines of descent war* </seg>
            <seg id="p342">established, pedigrees were outlined, records organized, and the onward march of distinct types and breeds formulated to eventually reach the zenith of perfection. How successful each breed has been is evidenced by the wonderful Kuctions in both quantity and quality of pork, by individuals and ■ of all prevailing types and breeds of swine, in the show rings, on the rails of the parking house; the championship and market tops are found to belong in rotation perhaps to the Berks yesterday, the Polands today, the Durocs tomorrow, and to the Cheaters the day after. tSo high and so close are the qualifications of the leading breeds no man can assert nor prove any particular type or breed to be the for general pork production, or even to specialize in lard or bacon. Proof of this assertion will be found in the packing house by finding the finest strips of bacon being cut from Berkshire, Poland China, Duroc Jersey, and Chester White two hundred pound pigs and the finest of lards from the fats of their older, heavy weight brothers and sisters. True, the real bacon types, Tam worth, Yorkshire, etc., will top the mar - ket some days for bacon cuts, but they rarely, if ever, excel for pork and lard products. Corn, wheat, alfalfa, milks and grasses will always be the leading food factors in pork production, so the best rule to follow in the selec - tion of type and breed is to take into consideration first the locality, the food stuff it will produce in the greatest abundance, and the local market demands, then consider your own inclinations and prejudices and choose the type and breed you believe best adapted all around. In the majority of cases, whether the pig be black, white, or red, bacon or lard type, the venture will prove successful, but as a last pre - caution remember that over one-half the struggle depends upon the man. No hog type or breed of them will breed, grow, thrive, or fatten with profit unless there is a hog man daily controlling and caring for them. As in the past, much of the future depends upon how much will we use the pure breeds in pork production, how will we produce the types that possess the highest qualities of the market's demand, how well we learn and practice the demands of Nature's laws in maturing and breed - ing, the provision of ideal sanitary care and environments, the adoption of ideal foods and feeding methods. To many this means an almost en - tire change of system of producing pork, but we are due for many changes In our agricultural program. This becomes very evident when we take note of the facts In several of its departments: one being the gradual de - crease in meat production per capita and a lessening production of plant foods per acre and per capita. This means that the live stock industry of America is not keeping step with the growth of population, and that the crop wear on the producing acres has commenced to be a bald-headed kWe are already much concerned over soil conservation and are for - te to be guided by the present policy of England, France. Germany, Denmark, who long ago discovered that land cultivated for hundreds </seg>
            <seg id="p343">I years grew stronger in fertility and production when a rising ration meat-producing animals, such as horses, rattle, and hogs, was kept upon them. Figuratively speaking, America is at the stage where it has only proven that exclusive grain production will deplete the soil of its fertility and finally cause its abandonment for crop raising. Such farms are to be found in every state in our nation, but many are being reclaimed by a general dairying and hog-producing business, which oas been found to be unexceled in giving back to the depleted humus-robbed soils the required elements of plant production and to be the most remunerative business in all Agriculture. The dairy bringing in money every day, turning the investment over at least once a year and the hog putting two crops on the market annually, giving increase of self at least ten or twelve times annually. Production is one thing, marketing another. The dairy and hog farmer is fortunate in having products desired for almost every com - mercial use, and with one-half of the world using the fats of the hog to cook their goods, and with the other half using compounds and substi - tutes for lards and butter fats, with nearly every branch of commerce using substitute oils, when unable to secure the pure lard oils, the future should promise much to the hog and dairy man. While America is termed the wonderland of the agricultural world, we realize within ourselves that the barriers of our natural producing power have been reached; that our last fertile acres are known; that the plowshare is turning over the last virgin sod; that the reservoir and ditch are reclaiming the last stretches of cactus-burdened, sandy deaerts and malaria-infected swamp lands. It is no longer how many producing acres, no loqper where they are located, whether close to city in Florida or North Dakota, the worth and value of all producing acres will be measured by what they can produce, for future methods of transporta - tion will bring every producing acre to our back door, and the readjust - ment of land values will be figured on this basis. No longer of how many acres can one man tend, but how well can he tend each acre. This means intensive instead of extensive farming, for soon the teeming millions of our congested population centers will cry to us for bread and meat In fact, we are now witnessing their first feeling of unrest and hunger, and unless we subdivide the big farms into 20's, 40's, and 80°s and Increase the number of meat-producing animals to the acre, America, like China and India, may hear the famine cry throughout our land. Denmark, Germany, France, and England have harkened to the cry, and in comparatively a few short years restored the fertility of the soil and raised their productions of foods and meat. Denmark, for instance, only one-sixth as large as Nebraska, one hundred years ago could only produce small crops of barley, wheat, etc., on her barren sandy soils, having but comparatively few cattle or hogs; but under scientific con - servation and live stocking of her farms, she now enjoys the distinction of being the model dairy and hog nation of the world, producing the tin— &lt; </seg>
            <seg id="p344">of bacons, meats, and butter, exporting nearly one-sixth as much of these products as the whole of the United States, which is over two hundred times the area of little Denmark. Our only policy is to fall in line and adopt the method or those who have already been forced to conserve their soil before we can profit by their successes and failures, and in a few years our acres can be made to produce increditable amounts both in quantity and quality, as well as In dollars and cents, and the value of such acres figured at almost un - believable values. When the general trend is to this end, we can, with our wonderful diversity of food stuffs, ideal climates, conditions, etc., be producing the greatest quantity and quality of foods and meats per acre, with a surplus bounteous enough to supply all export demands, thus be - coming the granary of the world, and eventually shaping our producing acres into veritable mintages of silver and gold. But producing foods is only one part of the food question. The sell - ing of foods to the consumer is at least one-half of the proposition, and, curiously enough, America is doing this the longest way around and most unprofitable manner for both producer and consumer. Sometime in the near future we will adopt the cooperative methods, similar to that of the fruit growers of the Pacific Coast and of Denmark. Then the consumer will get the best of hams, bacon, sausages, eggs, milk, butter, etc., fresh from the farm at a much lower cost, giving him cause to use more freely of the farm's products, and not feel prohibited in doing so, as many are under present methods. For instance, the hog producer sells hogs to the shipper for $6 per cwt., who in turn ships them to a commission house, that sells them to a packer for $6.50, and after they are slaughtered it is safe to say the bacon sides do not cost to exceed 10 cents per pound, but the packer has an army of employees depending on the hog for his pay, so the packer sells the bacon from 15 to 20 cents per pound to the retailer, who sells it to the consumer at prices ranging from 25 to 40 cents per pound, thus passing through perhaps fifty hands from the farm to the consumer's plate. Cooperation will cut out over one-half of the middle man's profit, and probably give the producer 7 and 8 cents for his hogs, and bacon to the consumer from 15 to 20 cents per pound. PWe often laugh at the Chinaman for doing things backward, but — let ike an inventory and see what is the matter with us according to last census. Fully one-half of our population is directly dependent upon the products of agriculture, and the remaining one-half more or less indirectly dependent. So If agriculture goes up, we go up; if it goes down, we go down. This becomes serious when the census shows that the ratio of food production per capita is lessening instead of increasing. Hogs In particular, decreasing from one hog in 1480 to about one-half a hog per person in 1910. iMany attribute part of the cause of gradual decrease to the drift of ruralist to the city and town, and part to the prevailing high prices pork, food stuffs, and other things that enter into food production. </seg>
            <seg id="p345">True, all have their influence, one fact being very evident, that America needs more producers and less consumers, so the drift which has In - creased the population of cities in ratio of 40 to the 1,000 in 1800, com - pared with rural living people, to nearly 500 to the 1,000 in 1910 must be turned backward to the farms. Every inhabitant of the city is a con - sumer. Every professional, railroad, and laboring man, every sailor of the sea, miner of the earth, axman of the forest must be classed as con - sumers, hardly ever as a producer; then with the farmer himself as a consumer of perhaps one-fourth or one-half of what he produces, we would search long to find a real producer only. Through the efforts of the press and teachings of our experimen schools, many farms and sections of America are adopting the twentiet century methods of farming and live stock production. Such farms wi be the first to reap the golden harvest. The movement is growing slow in volume, and it already shows some evidence in the last census an&lt; market reports, and while the number of hogs slaughtered during 191 and 1911 shows quite an increase, the total pounds show signs of force marketing of light weight. Pigs, from high cost of foods and prevalenc of disease, also account for a slight decrease of total hogs as shown b the 1910 census; but in spite of this the course is set onward and u ward, with each year showing an improvement in methods of breedin feeding, and caring for swine. This will bring forth a gradual upbuildin of the herds of hogs, a gradual elimination of prevalent hog diseases, tl restoration of the fertility of the farms, and eventually give decided i crease of pork production, first on the unit of power, whether measured by the acre or breeding animal, and a total production closer to th domestic and the foreign demand. All in all, the whole system of food and meat production will underg a reorganization and become a purely business proposition. The hap - hazard lucky, root-hog-or-die policy of the past can no longer be enter tained. It is "do it right or not at all," and when these methods are 1 full practice we will no longer feel nor fear the market gluts and breaks There will always exist a demand for the supply, and the hog raiser an dairyman of the future will be forced to his utmost efforts to produce a equal of consumption. So we may paint the future of the hog industr in the rosiest of colors, perhaps not so bright as in some times of th past, but with more enduring colors and tints. As we judge much of th future by the past, many of us may grow quite enthusiastic and attemp to overreach, forgetting that much of the bitter accompanies the sweet, as the veterans of hog production can attest to. In conclusion, I quote one of the oldest hog breeders, one who had experience in every department; a man who for nearly sixty years did nothing but breed, feed, buy, sell, exhibit, and judge hogs. "The hog has been hailed as the mortgage lifter, but his activities in that employment and habit of rooting everything, at least once over, lost him that Job lou» - ago, but a hog will root, so he commenced to turn up the big red barns, the modern farms houses, and the modern mechanisms of farming." </seg>
            <seg id="p346">This is not all, for as we journey across the land to our vision comes also the many storied buildings of the city, the great manufacturing plants, costly edifices of worship, imposing seats of learning, with the railroads checker-boarding the map, and the fertile acres blooked out like gardens, and attending all these come the pleasure trips to the moun - tains, seashore, and Europe. All the financial, social, and political favors, all these and others that bring to mankind and those in dependency the fullest sense of satisfaction and comforts of life, will be found to be more or less dependable upon high bred, high fed, highly cared for hogs, root - ing and feeding, back top-deep in the fields of clover and alfalfa, and again upon him lies the greater part of the responsibility of maintaining our present state of prosperity and to increase the valuation of our farm - ing lands. We oftentimes acclaim corn to be king and alfalfa to be queen, but when we find that it takes hogs to convert corn and alfalfa into its most profitable and marketable form, then we realize that corn and alfalfa are but vassals to bis Majesty, the Hog, the uncrowned King of all meat - producing animals, the peer of all agricultural products, in point of pro - duction, profit, and power of influence. Shall we crown him? No, let us leave him to his humble task and duty of rooting up the things that go far in making man's stay here below full of the pleasures and comforts of life, by his multitudinous presence in our fields and pens and on our breakfast plates. MUTTON PRODUCTION. By G. W. Hervey, 20th Century Farmer, Omaha. K Mutton production in its broadest sense would imply the sheep output be world, that is turned to consumption as a meat product. This would give us as a producing basis or an annual estimate to figure from, of approximately 460,000,000 sheep, representing all the countries of the world from which statistical information is available. I might say that this is not available in all the sheep-producing countries every year. There are four countries out of about forty that compile statistics that produce more than half of all the sheep in the world; about 58 per cent of all the sheep are credited to Australia, Argentine, Russia, and the United States, and in the order named. Australia is far in advance of all others, having a sheep population of about 87 'i millions at its latest esti - mate. Argentine comes next with 67 V4 millions, Russia with 57% mil - lions, and the United States with 56 V* millions for the same period. The United States, as is the case of all the sheep-producing countries, fluc - tuates greatly in numbers produced or in statistical records. The United States m .in the last ten years has been as low as 45,000,000 sheep and as high as 64,000,000 and might be called under normal conditions to be a tie with Russia for third place in sheep population. </seg>
            <seg id="p347">Mutton is becoming an important factor in all sheep-growing coun - tries; it is gaining in favor among meat consumers everywhere. The old time prejudice that it had a sort of wool flavor has been removed by a better system of killing and dressing the carcass. Refrigeration and clean - liness, which are observed by present day slaughtering methods, have had much to do in solving prejudiced fancy imagination. Lamb was introduced a few years ago into the American meat markets, and the craze for lamb grew beyond all bounds, until half of the consumers could not tell where the line of demarkation was drawn, where lamb left off and mutton com - menced, so lamb, sheep, or mutton now goes with the great bulk of meat eaters, willing to take chances whether it is old or young. Forty and fifty years ago the butchering of a lamb, in most of our eastern states, would have been regarded as a kind of sacrilige, a viola - tion of sacred things by the then interested sheep raisers. Sheep were raised for the wool they produced, and this was the only thought. The flocks were small, and only the surplus, those above the carrying capacity of the farm, were disposed of. There was a demand generally among the farm - ers for all the surplus that a neighbor had, these to be used in stocking up for wool production. The keeping of sheep for the fleece they pro - duced was regarded the best paying industry that the farmer would en - gage in, and in this way and over very large districts of country com - prising practically all of the states east of the Mississippi, there waa a Ctantly increasing market created for all the sheep that exceeded the ing capacity of the farm Sheep were kept until quite old, beyond the age of profit and useful - ness. Hundreds of sheep died every year, in every sheep-growing com - munity, from old age, the enfeebled conditions attending old age and over - crowding of the pastures and winter supply of feed. The pelts and wool from the dead sheep were promptly removed and sold to the pelt buyers who traveled over the country in their canvas of taking up the product of the surplus of the flocks. This industry developed into large plants, where rendering tanks and appliances were erected for the purpose of utilizing the old sheep, the thin and enfeebled members of the flock that were each year, after the shearing season, sorted out and held as pelters to go into the pelter market. The pelt factory utilized the refuse of the carcass for feeding hogs. Other features, tallow, or grease, bones, pelts, etc., were put into commercial form and shipped to eastern dealers where they were finally disposed of. The western and southwestern sheep trade for many years took large numbers of young sheep from the eastern flocks for stocking up of the range, thus helping to relieve the congested conditions that occasionally seemed to prevail. But the solution of the overstocking of the eastern farm came in the demand for mutton. First this found an outlet for the wether division of the flock by creating a demand for the fat sheep. Fanners became feeders of sheep, and a few sheep were fed in each neigh - borhood each year for the fat sheep market. Then the increased demand called for more sheep to supply the mutton markets of the eastern cities, </seg>
            <seg id="p348">and in place of turning the old, snaggy, toothed ewe over to the pe\ buyer, she was turned into the feed yard, and in a few months was ready to go to the fat market and sell for mutton purposes. Thus the mutton industry grew to take up every form of animal that comprised the flock. Mutton production in the old eastern states has not developed much be - yond the feeding of a carload or two by the farmer feeder. The sheep population of the five grand divisions of the world is ap - proximately as follows, and will help locate in the mind where the sheep of the world are: Europe 172,089,000; Asia, 133.489,000; Central and South America. 90.349.000; North America, 62,339,000; Africa, 1,321.000. The male and female produce of the flock are about equally divided, take it by large sheep producing districts or down to the individual flock; thus it is readily observed that this non-producing forty per cent of all the sheep of the country is practically born in the class of mutton pro - duction, and to this add from a fifth to a fourth of the female population which will be yearly coming into the mutton ranks, and you have a pretty fair estimate. It is plain, if the meat demand of the world will justify the marketing of these sheep as mutton, that they will come forward each year in about this proportion or will adjust themselves to satisfy the demand. The receipts of the sheep at four of the large western markets for the year 1911 give some figures on mutton production that have some significance in an understanding of how the mutton ranks are filled. The reports are as follows: Chicago, 5,736,244; Omaha, 2,977,570; Kansas City, 2,175,498; St. Louis. 992,000; total. 11,881.307. These, with the other live stock markets of the country and the little local markets that are scattered everywhere that are taking more or less sheep for mutton consumption will represent, in the aggregate more than one-fourth the entire sheep population of the country, that has passed into mutton pro - duction in 1911 The growth and development of the sheep business on the western range was the first real evidence of what the sheep industry of the United States meant to the meat supply of the country. This was first impressively brought to the attention of the public when the western sheep-feeding industry was first introduced in Nebraska in 1879. The beginning of the western sheep-feeding industry is credited to Dodge county, Nebraska, where in 1879 near Fremont, the first big sheep feed - ing operations were started. The largest number of sheep ever fed In one county in any state was in 1892, when the sheep feeders of Dodge county had in their yards more than 200,000 sheep, being prepared for the mutton market. In 1893 the sheep feeders of Nebraska finished for the mutton trade 400.000 sheep. In 1894, the year of corn crop failure, there was practically a relinquishment of all that had been acquired in the line of sheep feeding. As an evidence of what the strength and purpose of the sheep - feeding Industry was in the minds of operators in those days, we need only to refer to the year 1895 when Nebraska had but 125.000,000 bushels </seg>
            <seg id="p349">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OP AIJRIi T LITRE 34* of corn, a little more than a two-thirds crop, and the sheep-feeding In - dustry came from nothing back to 300,000 sheep in this one year, and in - creased steadily to 1897, when there were over 1,000,000 sheep finished in the feed yards of Nebraska for the mutton markets of the country. The sheep-feeding business by this time became pretty well distributed over the corn-growing sections of the State, in flocks from a few hundred to 30,000 head, under individual feeding ownership. The sheep-feeding business is being carried on at the present time with a little more system, a little more attention to details, a little more observance of eronomy in the use of feeds in order to get the best results in gain and make the surest profits. The sheep-feeding Industry has changed as to a more widespread distribution of the business. The farmer and small feeder are now engaged more in the feeding of sheep than in the days of large flock handling. It is not an uncommon thing to find as low as two or three carloads of sbeep being fed by the farmer feeder. This applies to the producing states generally over the western corn belt country. The common farmer has been given opportunity to observe the value of the sheep as an economic and profitable means of converting the crops of the farm into a concentrated market product. Mutton production is an easy proposition where the farmer buys his feeder sheep, much easier than where they are raised on the farm. It is easy for the farmer feeder to handle 200 to 300 sheep on the farm through the feeding season and keep them in comfortable growing condition, gaining a little each day. They can be let out of the feed yard onto the pasture field or into the stalk fields on bright sunshiny days. They gather up the waste and volunteer growth of grasses and weeds, and really seem to be a help to have them on the farm. But the real sheep - feeding business, carried on under conditions where thousands of sheep are to be reckoned with, is an entirely different proposition. Thus we find, .n denning the sheep feeding industry of the present time, that there are two distinct conditions of handling this buiness now in use. Especially is this true in comparing the sheep-feeding methods of the old eastern states with those of the western corn belt states. There has in recent years been a great change in reference to the lamb increase of the flock. Formerly the lambs were reserved to grow and mature on the range and in the flock. In these latter days there has sprung up a great demand for lamb in the meat markets of the country, and the sheep grower is anxious to ship what will bring the best price and sell most readily, and three to five dollars per head for the present year's crop of lambs looks pretty easy money, and the lambs are shipped out, until train loads, yes hundreds of thousands of this class of stock, leave the range and enter into the meat supply of the country, before they have entered the age for taxation or become a part of the enumera - tion records. As these great shipments of lambs are observed coming forward from the range, it seems that the flocks of the range had en- </seg>
            <seg id="p350">struction of the western sheep industry; yet this lamb slaughter has been going on for several years and still they come. Some feeders prefer the lambs to feed while others prefer the more mature sheep; this is a matter of fancy. If lambs in good thrifty con - dition can be had it is generally believed that they will make the largest gains, because they have the element of growth in them and may be fed sixty days longer. The lamb is estimated to make a gain of forty pounds on a five to six months' feed, costs more per hundred to start with and sells for more when brought back to the fat market, and taken all around, is regarded by some feeders the most desirable sheep. The average of having sheep in the feed yard is four months, and in this period the gain is estimated all the way from twenty to forty pounds per head. This wide margin is due to the very wide difference In the quality of sheep, a wide difference in the ability of the sheep to take on flesh; there is also a wide difference in the way sheep are handled. It is often asked how much corn will sheep consume, in a certain period. This again depends upon the sheep, kind, size, age, etc. It is usually esti - mated that grown sheep on full feed will consume three to four bushels of corn per hundred head per day. These sheep In the beginning are started on a light feed and gradually increased, little by little, until they are taking practically all they will clean up. Shelled corn is the main feed with most feeders, though a mixture of oats and bran is often used and serves the purpose of an appetizer, fed occasionally. The estimate of how much feed will it take of all kinds to finish a bunch of a hundred sheep on a four months' feed, this being the average feeding period? This depends somewhat upon weather and attending conditions, but the best information, where everything is weighed as fed, puts the estimate at seven and one-half tons of hay and 400 bushels of corn; where alfalfa molasses feed is used there are ten pounds of this added. As to the cost of preparing a bunch of sheep for the fat market that will depend upon the coat of the feed. The estimate of how much feed Is required can be taken by the inquirer and figured out on the cost of feed in your locality. It is generally believed that the sheep-feeding or mutton-producing industry, where the feeder is prepared to handle sheep, offers less risk than any other branch of live stock feeding, and the chances for gain equally encouraging. PROFITS IN SHEEP. By Prof. Ellis Rail, University of Nebraska. The subject assigned to me, and the one which Is advertised on the program of this meeting, is Profits in Pure Bred Sheep. Now it strikes me that pare bred live stock is bred and raised by about one fanner out of every hundred, and with sheep farmers the percentage is even less. rt that whereas 1910 reports show Nebraska to have only about a quar - of a million of breeding sheep, and to rank about twenty-eighth in </seg>
            <seg id="p351">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA 8TATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 361 the sheep Industry, that the need of the farmers in this State is not to know so much the value of pure bred sheep themselves as to know the profits in just good types of grade and crossbred market and stock sheep. And so I intend to confine my remarks this morning more to the profits that may be had from sheep of any good sort than to discuss the probable value of pure breds over other sorts. Now please bear in mind that through this discussion we shall draw our conclusions as to results from what should be done with a desirable class of animals, and not from any sort that may be called just sheep. The average price of wool throughout the United States for some years is a little hard to determine. And especially is it hard to say what the price per pound has averaged for any given state. But taking a period of ten years it is safe to say that Nebraska farmers have received an average price from 18 to 20 cents per pound, and with fleeces in this State averaging seven pounds per head, the returns from wool have been from f 1.25 to $1.50 per head. The report of the State Board of Agricul- ture for 1910 gives an average value of sheep in this state as $4.50 per head. This is the price of mature sheep, or rather the valuation of the same. Sheep may be lower now but they frequently are much higher in price, so that a valuation of $4 to $5 for breeding sheep is a fair estimate of their usual worth. For the last five years the average, price for better grades of fat sheep at Omaha has been almost 6 cents per pound. Feeder lambs of course have been lower, but on the average not more than a cent a pound less, taking one season of the year with another. With these figures now in mind let us form a brief theoretical ledger and see what a few sheep might return in the way of profits. First, simply con- sider it on the basis of one animal. Cost of a ewe in late summer or fall $4 50 Service of a desirable ram, proportionate cost 40 rl: Corn 30 pounds, oats 30 pounds, bran 20 pounds, or oil meal 6 pounds, about 80 Roughness 1 60 Pasture, 6 months 76 Total »7 95 Returns, wool 7 pounds at 20c $1 40 Lamb, feeder, 60 pounds at 5c S 00 Ewe 4M ToUl WM Profit , »S Now 95 cents or a dollar does not look like a great deal of money, but our total theoretical investment here was a little less than $8. the returns from which were 12 per cent. Putting our problem now on a basis of a hundred ewes, and a total investment in sheep and feed approxi- mately eight hundred dollars, we see that our profit would amount to </seg>
            <seg id="p352">practically one hundred dollars, or 12 per cent on the total investment, figuring, of course, that all the feed was purchased at the same time the ewes were. As a matter of fact, it would not be, and, too, the returns from lambs and wool would come in about eight months instead of wait - ing until the end of a year. Now we are not going to go into an analysis of the probable proflu from a cow or from a bow, but we merely wish to know if any cattle men feel that they are making 12 per cent on what they have invested, count - ing in both the value of their breeding animal and of the total feed and pasture consumed? Also we would ask the same question of swine men. We have looked into the problem of swine production pretty carefully, and, without giving a complete statement of coBt and returns, will say that unless more than five pigs per sow are raised, there is not a cent of profit on the investment. So much for the theoretical profits. But you ask does this work out? Hag it been demonstrated? I wish to quote you only a few example* as regards returns from a breeding flock. A good many years ago my father purchased 60 head of ewes of rather poor quality. He kept them nine months, during which time they were wintered and also produced their lambs. When the sheep and the lambs, also the wool, were sold, and the note which bad been given for them at time of purchase was taken up with the accumulated interest, a balance of $209 remained to pay for the feed and pasture eaten. The feed which these ewes actually had was 28 shocks of corn fodder, or the stover from one and a fourth acre of corn, end 120 bushels of oats. They received a rather liberal allowance of oats because at that time the little amount of corn fodder was the total amount of roughness available. But was not $209 a mighty good price for 120 bushels of oats and the stover from an acre and a quarter of corn? tYes, you say. but can such good returns be realized with large flocks? old neighbor. Wm. Barker, who at the time of his death was the thiest fanner in the county, one fall purchased 1.000 head of sheep, a good many of which were feeders. A note was given for them. In one year enough sheep and wool had been sold to pay off the note and still a thousand sheep were on the farm. In other words, this man had been E:o make his feed for th» 1,000 sheep bring him enough to pay for bead. Instances could be multiplied with ease, but we do not wish upy too much time thus. At this point, no doubt, some of you at least are turning over in your Minds the fact that you have known men to try sheep who did not suc - ceed. Have you never known men wbo made no money, but rather lost on cattle, hogs, or horses? Do you conclude that because these men failed to make a profit there is no profit to be had from the raising of these classes of animals? Why then should you condemn, or have no confidence in the sheep business — simply because some men have failed to make it pay? One of the greatest criticisms of the farmers as a class U their inclination to assume that a single example proves a proposition </seg>
            <seg id="p353">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE 351 Allow an illustration on this point. Near Cambridge, I believe it wag, some years ago a certain farmer purchased a good German coach stallion. The horse suited the fancy of many people, and he was patronized quite freely, with the result that a large number of colts was raised. Now it so happened that a vicious nature was dormant in this horse, which, transmitted to his colts, manifested itself in them through the inclination to kick. And at least 6 per cent of his colts were bad kickers in harness. What is the opinion of many farmers in that vicinity? Namely this, that German coach horses ara the meanest breed of horses on earth, and you couldn't induce one of them to breed to a German horse because the colts would be too mean. Their ideas of the temperment of the breed have been drawn from their experience with a single individual; whereas, as a matter of fact, that particular individual was a poor representative of the breed as far as temperment was concerned. Why should we be so hasty and unfair in our conclusions? And so with the sheep question. All my life, though I am not so old, I have seen dozens, scores, and hundreds of men take a few or many ewes and make from them a much greater profit than the theoretical profits derived from our first consideration as to the possibilities from breeding sheep. I have seen, too, men fail to realize anything on their investments, but, I have seen a less percentage lose on sheep than on either hogs or cattle. R, a few words about profits from feeding sheep, especially lambs. b is the most profitable sheep to feed, both from the point of of production, and also because of the market demand. It may take a bit more skill and experience to handle lambs than it will to feed older sheep, but it will usually be a more paying investment to feed the young things. Henry, in his manual on "Feeds and Feeding," estimates that lambs will make 25 to 30 per cent more gain from the same feed than will older sheep. The cost of making a pound of mutton is less than that of making a pound of either pork or beef. An inspection of the various rations which you see exhibited in the south end of this room will show you bet - ter than any discussion why there is a chance for the sheep or lamb to more than hold its own with the hog or the steer in competition for cheap production of flesh. While a greater number of pounds of dry matter are required for producing a pound of mutton than a pound of pork, yet the pork must be made mostly from grain, and the mutton is largely from cheaper roughness, and therefore is produced at a total cheaper coat. Now, what can be done actually in feeding sheep? As was done in discussing breeding sheep, I want to cite you a few illustrations of what farmers have done in the last year or two. I need not remind you of the slim and somewhat visionary profits that cattle feeders have been mak - ing in the past few years. You know without my calling attention again that cattle feeding has been more of a gamble than a certainty for some time. If any one made on a load of cattle a hundred dollars last year or will do 80 this year, he was or will be an exception. Tet last year my </seg>
            <seg id="p354">father, who has never fed but two or three loads of sheep, put in a load of native lambs, carried them on light feed for some time, then fattened them out for a March market, and cleared over $1 per head. The total investment for feed, lambs, and labor did not amount to $600, while the net profit, allowing for all feed consumed and the original price of the lambs was 25 per cent, or $150, with the investment running less than six months. Well, you Bay, you do not know anything about sheep — never had any, etc. Only this week more than one man has said this same thing to me. Ever since I have been in Nebraska I have known our good friend, Sam McKelvie, and have had more or less work with him. Frequently we have talked over the sheep-feeding question, and every year he has said, "If we had ever handled any sheep we would put some in this fall, but we are just afraid to try it." But this year the old gentleman and his son who is on the farm at Fairfield finally bought a couple of loads of lambs. 540 head in all. Half were bought September 6, and the rest a week later. These lambs cost $4.70 per cwt. and weighed an average of 62 pounds. On December 5 a double deck load was sent to Omaha, and a few days later a small single deck load went up. These lambs all sold for $5.70 per hundred, and averaged 92 pounds. The re - mainder, numbering 214 head, went to St Joseph on January 7, weighing 90 pounds and sold for $6.25. The cost of these lambs at Omaha yards was right at $1,700. The selling price was over $2,900, or a difference of $1,200 to charge up to feed, incidental expenses, and profit. A word about the feed these lambs consumed. For 67 days they ran in 23 acres of corn which Mr. McKelvie estimated at a forty- to fifty - bushel crop, or having about 1,100 bushels of corn. Some time after the lambs had run on this corn 100 head of shoats were also turned in and left until the feed was all consumed. About 60 tons of pumpkins also were in this field. These hogs made a remarkable growth, and Mr. Mc- Kelvie estimated that they gained a total of 12,000 pounds which, at $5.50 per cwt, would have been worth more than $650. But all the time the lambs were getting a living, too. On about November 15 the lambs and swine had finished the corn, and the lambs from that time until they were sold ate a little less than 500 bushels of corn and about 14 tons of alfalfa. At 60 cents for corn and $10 for alfalfa this would mean $440 worth of feed besides the corn which was hogged down. But from that 1,100 (estimated) bushels of corn and 6 tons of pumpkins was produced over $650 worth of pork, so there could not be a big feed bill against the lambs. While we can not get at the definite profits of this feeding ven - ture, it is evident that more than $500 clear money resulted from it. And this week one of the firm said to me, "We have over 200 head of cattle this winter and we won't make as much as we did on the sheep." Now there are one or two other phases of this question to be touched. Sheep do not always make a profit if it has to be counted in dollars and cents the first year; but as an aid to keeping up the soil they arc our moat valuable domestic animal. The fertility of Great Britain and her annual crops of grain are kept up and made possible only with the aid of </seg>
            <seg id="p355">sheep husbandry. Sheep manure is richer than that of other domestic animals. It contains 6 to 8 per cent more nitrogen, twice as much phos - phorus, and more potash than does cattle excrement Not only that, bat a larger per cent of fertilizing elements consumed as food by the animal is returned to the soil through the excrement. Jordan reports that of the total fertilizing elements consumed by sheep, more than 80 per cent is recovered in the excrement. Finally, to be brief, the labor proposition in its relation to sheep handling is worth a good deal of consideration. The man who feeds two to four hundred head of cattle annually will find that he can make just as much mutton with half the labor and at least an equal, if not a much larger profit. Mr. McKelvie has said to me repeatedly that the amount of labor incident to the fattening of the 540 lambs was astonishingly small, whereas the feeding of 200 head of cattle all winter entails no small amount of expense. Now I am not supporting mutton production on the proposition that all other lines of stock should be subsidiary to it. The proposition is that sheep are a profitable investment. That farmers should understand this fact, and when conditions are right, should feed sheep. Not only that — nearly every farm needs more or less. One of the places where profit accrues from sheep husbandry is in a more complete utilization of all the forage the farms produce. Enough goes to waste on every quarter-sec - tion in the farming district to feed 20 to 50 sheep. At present there are not to exceed 250,000 sheep in the State, or less than one to a quarter - section. If only 25 to the quarter-section were had instead of one the farmers would own $25,000,000 worth more of live stock than at present, and this would be grown and produced on wbat now is mostly wasted. Think of it, men! Is there no profit in animals which if given an oppor - tunity would add at least $25,000,000 to the wealth of the State without lessening in any way our cattle or swine production? Profits from sheep? Yes. The cheapest meat producers of our do - mestic animals. Less labor required to handle. They are the best scav - engers of any of our live stock, and they return to the land a larger per - centage of fertility per portion of food consumed than do cattle, horses, or swine. NORTH NEBRASKA'S SOIL RICHEST IN THE WORLD. By Hon. George Coupland. Ellgin, Neb., Dec. 2. — Editor News : Having known you for a long term ars and your deep interest in things which concern the people of eastern Nebraska, I was not surprised when a few weeks ago you me to prepare for your readers a short article giving the result of some of my personal observations relative to the fertility of this wonder - ful Loess soil which covers most of the counties in tMs portion of the </seg>
            <seg id="p356">It is now over thirty years ago since I took up a pamphlet issued by the Burlington railroad company, which purported to give a description of the lands they owned in the county where I now live and some of the adjacent counties. I will remember being attracted by the report of Pro - fessor Aughey of the state university as to the composition of the soil and its evident usefulness for ali round farming purposes, and it only seems like yesterday that I laid down the little booklet which had reached my home across the Atlantic, saying, to myself, "If it is only half as good as he says, it is good enough foi me." A few months later I decided to leave the old home to come to the place which had such promise for one who desired to settle in a goodly land. Well do I remember after my arrival on the place where I have lived since that time, taking up a handful of kindly soil which it has been my pleasure to own and till during these years, and after examining it, saying "This is the best soil I ever saw or handled." And now, after thirty years of experimenting, cultivation and examination, you ask me the question, "What do you think of it now?" I am sure you are not prompted by a merely curious inquiring spirit, but you want to know the facts for the benefit of your readers, and I shall endeavor to answer your inquiry in as plain and practical way as I possibly can, avoiding the tech - nical and having in view that which you are anxious to know — what the soil in this portion of the State is worth for practical farming purposes, and if it has the qualities which are lasting as to its future fertility. Yet I must confess that in endeavoring to answer your questions I shall be largely governed by the thought of impressing my fellow citizens with the idea that the possession of such a heritage as we enjoy should arouse in us a spirit of pride and appreciation, that is, knowing the value of this ■oil. We should be proud and appreciative of it and anxious to care for and conserve so goodly a possession. The study of the soil and the plants which grow upon it has always at - tracted the thoughtful and inquiring mind. Since the dawn of history we find that men were anxious to find out the operations of nature's laws and to co-operate with her, if perchance they could assist to a larger useful - ness. The history of investigation along agricultural lines is a very in - teresting and fascinating one, and it seems as the years go by and we get in closer touch with the natural laws which govern the machinery at work in the soil, and the plants which we plant and cultivate, we realize more and more the necessity of an intelligent co-operation with these laws and the individual operators which carry on the business of pro - viding and supplying plants with food. This machinery and these operators which do this work do not per - form their functions in a haphazard way. The machinery is wonderfully and ingeniously constructed, and the operators are expert and indus - trious, but it is a very easy matter for man to interfere with the opera - tion of the machinery and impede the forces which keep it in motion. During the past 100 years some of the keenest observers and scien - tist! have been busy trying to find out the best methods of co-operating </seg>
            <seg id="p357">with the forces at work in the soil. The result has been that we are acquainted now with the fact that a certain combination of elements goes largely toward the making of food for growing crops. If all these ele - ments are present, conditions are favorable for plants to grow, providing sufficient moisture and warmth is supplied. If any one of these essential elements is lacking, trouble arises, and it is like a machine minus a cos wheel, the machine can not work. Every Essential Element Present. Now here let me say that in this wonderful Loess soil of ours there has been provided in great abundance every element and condition to make a perfect and lasting fertility machine, and these elements are not confined merely to a surface foot or two of the soil, but to a depth in most places of fifty feet, and in many places much deeper do we find an abundant supply of the elements which are convertible into plant food. Plants as well as animals, if they are to grow and produce gener - ously, must be provided with a balanced ration, that is, food adapted for their requirements. The four essential elements necessary to a vigorous plant growth are nitrogen, potash, phosphoric acid and lime. If any one of these things is lacking in the soil, or perhaps of limited amount, it is impossible to suc - cessfully raise crops. Of the elements I have just named, three of them are rock particles, but the nitrogen has been gathered from the air and fixed in the soil, and before it can be used as food by plants must be transformed or changed into nitrates, and when it is thus changed it be - comes soluble in water and the plant can use it. The rock particles I have named, to become available for plant food, they too, must be made soluble, and this is partly accomplished by the carbon dioxide, of which a large percentage of the body of plants is con - structed. This, too, has been gathered by the plant from the air, and where the plant dies and decay commences, this element is released in the soil and it attacks the minerals just spoken of and makes a portion of them available to succeeding generations of plants. I may say here that all this fixation of nitrogen and its transformation into nitrates is done by minute organisms which live in the soil, and also that the release of the carbon dioxide in the dead plant is through the efforts of other busy little workers whose business it is to break down plant tissue. In fact, these are what we may well term the operators of the fertility ma - chine, and if these operators are to do their work effectively, conditions in the soil, both as to mineral supply, moisture and heat must be so blended together as to render it a congenial place for them to live, mul - tiply and do their allotted tasks. So, in arriving at an approximate esti - mate as to the present and future ability of our Nebraska farms we must ask the questions: What is now present in the soil? What, if any peculiar ability does it have to store up moisture for future use? What are the conditions as to warmth and other things which make it a happy home for the industrious little workers I have spoken of? </seg>
            <seg id="p358">If from an examination of the soil we find that it does contain the minerals necessary in abundant supply, that it does have unique ability to store up moisture and that it is a happy place for benignant bacterial life to multiply and operate, then we can say with assurance, this is a goodly land, whose agricultural future is secure. In arriving at an ac - curate conclusion, we must apply the scientific test as to what these farms of ours actually consist of, and here I wish to say that in applying this the severest of all tests, I do it because I am most deeply anxious that those who live upon and own our lands and those who inhabit our towns and may perhaps have pecuniary interests in the country shall be advised as to the actual value of what they possess. So that a spirit of pride of possession may be theirs and an anxiety to use their possessions judiciously aroused. I wish here to acknowledge my great indebtedness to and apprecia - tion of the assistance of Doctor Alway, soil chemist, and Doctor Waite, ■oil bacteriologist of the state university, both of whom are devoting their splendid abilities to the service of our State. The laboratory de - terminations are theirs, so the figures 1 shall give tell the exact story of the soil as we have found it. Contents of North Nebraska Soil. tThe land upon which I live — and it is typical of northeastern Ne - ka soil — the most of it has been under cultivation about thirty years, a record of the different croppings has been kept. The surface foot of each acre of the original prairie contained about 122,500 pounds of or - ganic matter, 7,035 pounds of nitrogen, 18,000 pounds of potash, 1,500 pounds of phosphoric acid, and from twenty to as high as eighty tons of lime. During these years on the fields that have been cropped there has been no appreciable depletion of this mineral content. In the second foot there U 3,600 pounds of nitrogen, 21,000 pounds of potash, 2,400 pounds of phosphoric acid, and also a great increase in the lime. There is a de - crease in the nitrogen down to the seventh foot, when it reaches 900 pounds, and from there to the twelfth foot it remains about the same. The total nitrogen content of the first twelve feet per acre being 21,600 pounds, the mineral content of the soil shows a large increase in the lower depths, there being in the third foot 27,000 pounds of potash and 3,000 pounds of phosphoric acid, and from the fourth to the twelfth foot 28,500 pounds of potash and as high as 33,000 pounds, the phosphoric acid averaging 3,900 for each foot from the fourth to the twelfth, the total potash for the first twelve feet being 348,500 pounds, and phosphoric acid 42,000 pounds and the lime content being especially rich. The market price of all this fertility matter, if we had to purchase it from the com - mercial fertilizer manufacturer, in the first four feet of each acre of our land would be for the nitrogen $2,300, potash, $4,725, phosphoric acid $648. Totaling $7,673. This is to a depth to about which the corn roots went down in my fields this last year. </seg>
            <seg id="p359">But the total value of the elements I have just named in the first twelve feet of each acre is $23,370, an 1 all this fertility matter 1b con - tained within the area that the alfalfa roots penetrate, in fact they go much lower than this. The actual value of the lime is not given in this calculation. Suffice it to say it would add very materially to the totals I have given. These estimates only cover the available fertility matter contained in the minerals I have named. If we were to take the entire amount of these elements present it would be about two and one-half times as much potash and over one-third more phosphoric acid. Now comes the other side: What have and do we take out of the soil by crop - ping, and what can we add to the soil by planting certain crops? Thirty - two crops of wheat averaging twenty bushels to the acre, assuming that grain, straw or stalks are removed from the field, would take 1,120 pounds of nitrogen, 1,120 pounds of potash and 640 pounds of phosphoric acid, of a total value of $281. Thirty-two crops of corn at sixty-five bushels to the acre would take 2,400 pounds of nitrogen, 1.920 pounds of potash and 640 pounds of phosphoric acid, totalling $534. Two tons of clover hay would take 2,112 pounds of potash and 896 pounds of phosphoric acid, of a value of $159. Four tons of alfalfa hay would take 1,096 pounds of potash and 1,312 pounds phosphoric acid, the value being $284. It is questionable Cther these two latter crops remove any nitrogen from the soil, and I will discuss a little later on. tSo far I have shown what this soil of ours contains, what proportion is removed by a series of croppings, and perhaps here I ought to say only about twelve pounds out of every 1,000 pounds which enters the composition of plants and cereals comes out of the soil, the source of the other 988 pounds being air and water, the carbon and tne nitrogen being taken out of the air, and it is most interesting to know that that which is so important to and so largely used by plants is held in the air about and above us in such abundant supply, for it is estimated that there are 30,000 tons of nitrogen hovering over each acre of our lands waiting to be trapped and transformed into plant food, and where it is that local conditions are favorable for the utilization of this great ocean of fertility matter then we can say we live in a rich farming country. As I have before intimated, heat and moisture are controlling factors in the production of plant food. We may possess every element neces - sary which goes to the making of this food, but if the soil in which it is contained does not have the ability to store up the rains and snows which fall upon it, the forces which transform and prepare these different things which plants require to nourish them cannot perform their functions prop - erly. And now I will give the results of some very interesting investiga- t which will show the peculiar ability of our soil to bottle up and take if the moisture which falls. Moisture Nearly All Retained. First let me say that the soil particles are neither too large or too </seg>
            <seg id="p360">tm PROCEEDINGS NKItKASKA STATE BOARD OK AUKIClXTrRE ■mall. If they were too small, there would not be much room for water to accumulate between them and they would pack close together and could not take up much water. If they were too large, the water would rapidly drain away, but our soil is of such a texture and character, also depth, that practically our loss of water is very small. I think Professor Bar - bour, our state geologist, estimates the loss by run-off to the streams to be about ten per cent, whereas in some of our eastern states more than half of the moisture which falls is not retained by the soil, but passes off to the watercourses. L About the beginning of last September I dug two pits on my land. in an eight-year-old alfalfa field, and the other about thirty steps away from it, in an adjacent corn field. The corn field has never had any leguminous crop grown upon it These pits were dug to determine sev - eral things I had in mind, viz., the moisture content of the two fields, what the alfalfa had added to or taken from the soil, and whether nitrify - ing bacteria operated at a lower level in the alfalfa field than they did in the corn field, and how far the alfalfa and corn roots penetrated. There having been a very great shortage of rainfall during the past growing season, these moisture investigations speak with peculiar force. The first foot in the corn field contained 14V4 per cent of water, the sec - ond foot 17 per cent, and the third about 19 per cent, and averaging about the same amount down to the twelfth foot. In all, there was enough water to equal thirty-two inches of rainfall. The corn roots had pene - trated down in this field about three and one-half feet and never once during the summer was there any indication that the corn was suffering for lack of moisture. Of course, the water that was in the surface soil had been conserved by good tilling, and what had been used up in June, July and the early part of August was replenished by the later rains which came. Now. what had happened in the alfalfa field? This crop is a great user of water and not only does it get its supply from the store near to the surface, but it digs deep and draws up its water supplies from far down in the earth, that is, where conditions are favorable for it to dig and the storage capacity for taking care of water is good. There was a difference in the amount of water in these two fields in the first twelve feet equivalent to ten inches of rain, or 1,130 tons of water to the acre. The alfalfa having during its life there used up what had fallen and drawn upon the available reserve which was bottled up In the lower levels. f These moisture determinations show beyond doubt the wonderful ility of our soil to store up the moisture which falls upon it and hold a reserve for a deep-rooting plant like alfalfa, which has such remarkable value as a restorer of the nitrogen which has been used up by preceding cereal crops. And here follows the very important question as to the nitrogen supplies which plants require. Can we supply this indefinitely without calling upon the commercial fertilizer manufacturer? This is a serious question, for unless natural conditions are favorable </seg>
            <seg id="p361">(or us to do this inevitably there is only one thing before us — these sup - plies will have to be brought from somewhere else if they can not be manufactured on the land. On my own farm thirty-two crops of cereals have used up one-third of the nitrogen which was in the original prairie. Doubtless what is true on my land is true on other farms where there has been no other rotation except corn, oats and wheat. The query now arises, is there a crop we can plant which will replen - ish or at least maintain without depletion our nitrogen supplies? And are our soil and moisture conditions favorable to grow that crop? I say without hesitation they are, and I can also say that unless we plant this crop there is trouble ahead for us. Crop to Replenish Nitrogen. «As I have already stated, the nitrogen that plants require and use has be obtained from the air, and that we have a limitless supply to draw upon. How this transference from air to soil or plant took place, and how this gas was transformed into a substance which plants could use to nourish and develop their bodies, puzzled investigators for many years. Men in England, Germany, France and in other European countries, as well as our own, tried to find out just how the thing was done, and through the years, especially during the last ten years, many important discoveries along this line have been made, so that now we know that it is through the agency of minute bacterial life which exists in the soil, whose business it is to take hold of the nitrogen gas and fix' it in the soil; and then there are other little fellows who live with them, who convert it into ammonia, then to nitrite, and finally into nitrate, in which form the plant can use it, but there are other little chaps whose home is in the soil and who have a peculiar liking for clovers, alfalfa, vetches and other legumes, and when these plants send out their small rootlets, attach themselves to them, make a nodule on the root, begin to multiply rapidly and in some mysterious way feed the plant with the nitrogen it needs — in fact, seems to supply, at least for a while, all that it does need, so that the soil upon which these different legumes grow is not further depleted of its nitrogen, but it is rather increased. Now to raise such crops as alfalfa and clover successfully, these small organisms must be present, and so that they can be present, conditions in the soil must be congenial for them. If the proper mineral elements are not in the soil, they can not live there, and if they do not have moisture and warmth they can not live and multiply and do their tasks. Now it is unquestion - ably a fact that we have all the necessary elements in this soil of ours to make it a very happy and congenial place for these valuable little workers to pursue their trade, and the earth takes care of so efficiently the mois - ture which falls, that this is certainly an ideal place for this wonderful combination of legumes and bacteria to carry on the perpetuation of our </seg>
            <seg id="p362">Value of Alfalfa. To illustrate: On the field I have referred to which has been in alfalfa eight years — and this is the oldest one I have, other fields having been plowed up which show a very great ability to raise crops — the weight of the alfalfa roots to the acre contained in the first foot was 5,069 pounds, containing 105 pounds or nitrogen, worth in the market $17.50, equivalent to ten and one-half tons of fresh barnyard manure. In the first ten feet of the field there were 9,459 pounds of roots, containing 172 pounds of nitrogen, worth $28.67 equivalent to seventeen tons of fresh barnyard manure. Now this is not taking into account the amount of leaves that had fallen from the alfalfa stalks, which adds very materially to the ■tore of fertility matter, and not alone does the alfalfa dig down deep, but in filling up the tunnel which it digs with organic matter, it adds largely to the soil's ability to store up moisture, and it doubtless obtains a considerable amount of its mineral supply in the lower depths, where It is so abundant, also the breaking up of the subsoil by its great root system, which makes it easier for succeeding crops to root deep, and I hope to find out next year how much deeper corn will go down in an old alfalfa field than where alfalfa has not been grown. In Bumming up the question as to the potential and future ability of this eastern Nebraska soil (and the same thing is true of a large area of our State) I say that there is no doubt that if we are wise enough to judiciously till, crop and husband its resources, it has a long and great future before it agriculturally. Tested by every known scientific test, it has unique lasting qualities. Its undeveloped potential richness is very great, and I never talk or cor - respond with men who have made soil studies a specialty but they always refer to the remarkable wealth of our soil and its deep-seated accumula - tion of the elements which are necessary to support plants and also which make it congenial to and an ideal place for the bacterial life which oper - ates the fertility machine. Let me in conclusion make an appeal for a higher appreciation of these rich possessions of ours, so that we will seek to use judiciously and carefully the fertile lands given into our charge. That our efforts shall be to assist rather than impede nature's laws. That we shall not be rob - bers, who either selfishly or ignorantly exploit the soil. If the people who lire upon these fertile valleys and uplands do this they will be at the end of the centuries what a gracious providence evidently intended them to be, one of the most favored portions of this globe. There are quite a number of other things which are suggested by what I have written, but space forbids me referring to them. Perhaps at some future time I may have something more to say. However, let me urge the young people who live on these eastern Nebraska farms to seek a liberal education along agricultural lines, for there is no department in our national life demanding a better equipped mind or hand than that of the man who is to be the conservator of the basic wealth of the nation. </seg>
            <seg id="p363">and who doubtless will have to supply in the future as in the past the virile blood necessary to keep alive the activities of letters and commerce in the more congested centers of our country. Need of Better Educations. tl am sure you will permit me, to most earnestly call the attention of men of mature years, those who live upon the land and those who live in our towns and cities, to the great importance and imperative neces - sity of providing the means to give a suitable education to the young peo - ple who are to live upon the lands which I have described, so that they shall be able to put this undeveloped potential wealth to its greatest test and use. I know of no more important or urgent matter, and one which is so far reaching in its influence for the good of the state, than the preparation of our young men and women for an intelligent and useful life upon the Our state university with its agricultural school and college, has been trying to do the best it could with the means at hand, and we are now asking that this school of the people-shall be generously supported by the people, for personally I feel it is one of the best dividend-paying invest - ments the people of our state can make, both morally and economically. rE BEGINNING OF THE TEACHING OF AGRICULTURE IN OUR PUBLIC 8CHOOLS. By S. C. Bassett, Gibbon, Neb. Nebraska was the first state to require, by statute, that teachers In public schools should qualify themselves to teach the elementary princi - ples of agriculture, the same as to teach other branches of learning in such schools. The following is a brief history of the causes, incidents, and events, also the names of some of the individuals taking part, in this most im - portant educational movement. In the year 1889 the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska requested "that the State Board of Agriculture appoint a special committee to consult with a like committee of their board touching certain questions concerning the management of the Uni - versity Experiment Farm and Agricultural Experiment Station of Ne - braska" (Report State Board of Agriculture 1889, page 33). The commit - tee appointed on the part of the State Board of Agriculture consisted of Robt. W. Furnas of Nemaha county, P. H. Barry of Qreeley county and S. C. Bassett of Buffalo county. This committee, on the part of the Board of Agriculture, was continued from year to year, and at every meeting of the joint committees the principal subject of discussion was, "How to secure a larger attendance of students at the agricultural college of the University." In the year 1898, at a farmers' institute held in the village </seg>
            <seg id="p364">of Callaway, in Custer couuty, J. D. Ream of Broken Bow (an officer in a rural school district) in a private 'discussion on the teaching of agriculture in the comomn schools related the following incident: that he had re - quested the teacher in their school to prepare and deliver, occasionally during the school term, a short lecture or talk on some of the elementary principles of agriculture applicable to farm conditions, which he felt sure would be of interest and profit to the school children. After a few weeks had passed Mr. Ream inquired of the then teacher, J. G. W. Lewis, how he was succeeding with his talks on elementary agriculture. Mr. Lewis replied that he did not feel competent to talk or lecture on the subject as he had never received any instruction along such lines himself. E'he relation of this incident to S. C. Bassett, who was in attendance e institute, seems to have started a new train of thought; that is. before we could teach even the most elementary principles of agri - re in the rural, graded, or normal schools, we must first teach the teachers themselves. In the year 1899, , at the annual meeting of the State Board of Agriculture, S. C. Bassett, president of the board, in his address as president (report of State Board of Agriculture 1899, page 12), In discussing "Agriculture in schools" in part said: "If today any considerable portion of the people of this State should earnestly desire — demand as it were — that instruction in agriculture be given in our common schools, it could not be done. Illustrating the situa - tion in this respect, — a resident of a rural school district requested the teacher to give one or two hours each week to instruction in some of the elementary principles of agriculture. Weeks passed, and as nothing was done, he inquired of the teacher in reference to the matter, and received the information that the teacher did not feel competent to undertake the task, having received no instruction along that line himself. The stat - utes of the State designate the studies, and degree of proficiency in the same, to which a person must attain in order to be licensed to teach in our public schools, but in the studies so designated agricultural education has little or no part, flence it is that we must begin at the very founda - tion in this matter; that the teachers in our common schools should be required to pass examinations in agriculture as well as in mathematics, history or grammar. When this is done, there will be no difficulty in having agriculture taught in our rural and high schools; and when the time comes in the history of this State and its university that agriculture is taught in the rural and high schools being given the same relative im - portance and attention that is now given to other branches of studies, there will be no dearth of students in the courses of agriculture and me - chanic arts in our university." The address of the president was referred to a special committee, which later submitted the following report: "That we heartily endorse the sentiments expressed in our president's message in relation to the taking up of the study of agriculture in our common schools, and we recommend that the president, secretary and board of managers be appointed a legislative committee to draft a bill to so amend our laws as would cause the taking up of the study of agricul- </seg>
            <seg id="p365">ture in our common, graded, or high schools and normal schools, and that said committee confer with the regents of the University with regard to the furtherance of agricultural education. "Respectfully submitted, (Signed) "W. R. MELLOR, "M. W. CHAPPBL, "J. R. CANTLIN, "Committee." At the annual meeting of the State Board of Agriculture, held January 15, 1901, S. C Bassett, president of the board, again discussing the subject of "Agricultural Education," in his address as president of the board in part said (Report of State Board of Agriculture 1900, page 9): "I think we are all fully agreed that before the principles of agricul - ture in any form, even in the most primary manner, can be taught in our common schools, we must prepare the teacher for this line of work, and it is suggested that we seek to amend our present law relating to qualifica - tions of teachers to whom first and second grades are issued, so as to require a knowledge of the principles of agriculture of those teaching In our common schools." At the same meeting of the State Board of Agricutlure, J. B. Dins - more offered the following resolution which was adopted: "We, the members of the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture, seeing the need of more general knowledge of agriculture among the boys and girls of Nebraska believing that all teaching should be in the order, first concrete then abstract, and that nature studies should be introduced into our county and village schools, respectfully ask the legislature to make such additional requirements for first, second, third grade, and state teachers' certificates as will show the holder's fitness for teaching one or t studies in pure agriculture." (Report State Board of Agriculture &gt;age 58.) S. C. Bassett was named as a committee on the part of the board of managers of the State Board of Agriculture to have prepared an amend - ment to the school laws of the State requiring teachers to pass certain re - quirements as regards the teaching of the elementary principles of agri - culture in order to be issued teachers' certificates. To Doctor Charles E. Bessey, who, as dean of the agricultural col - lege and at times acting chancellor of the University, had taken at all times, during his sixteen years (at that date) connection with the Uni - versity a deep and active interest in all matters pertaining to agricultural education, was submitted the proposed amendment, and herewith is a copy of his letter in reply: </seg>
            <seg id="p366"/>
            <seg id="p367">Ei amendment, as worded by Doctor Bessey, was placed, by S. C. in the hands of Hon. J. D. Ream, member of the legislature from county, and by him offered as an amendment to a bill Introduced in the house at the request of State Superintendent W. K. Fowler and re - lating to qualifications of candidates for teachers' certificates. State Superintendent Fowler was in hearty sympathy with the pro - posed amendment and willingly consented that it be offered as an amend - ment to his measure. The amendment was defeated in the house, largely for the reason that a like attempt was made to compel the teaching of music in public schools. When the same bill reached the senate. Senator J. E. Miller of Buffalo county offered the amendment to the Fowler bill, and it was again defeated in the committee of the whole, and for the same reason as in the house. Senator Miller then made a personal plea to the senate to adopt the amendment. In substance he stated that the amend - ment had received the unanimous endorsement of the State Board of Agri - culture and of the Dairymen's Association. In addition it was endorsed by Dr. Charles E. Bessey of the State University, by State Superintendent Fowler as well by a host of farmers throughout the state. He also re - quested its adoption saying that as he belonged to the minority (Populist) party he had not been able to secure favorable action on any of his meas - ures, and as a personal favor requested the Senate to grant him this re - quest. And as a personal favor to Senator Miller, a staunch friend of agri - culture, of education, and of the rights of the people, the senate adopted the amendment, the house concurred in the senate amendment, and the same became a part of the school law of the State. The law as amended gave the teachers of the State until July, 1902, to comply with its provi - sions, and this was accomplished by reading circle work under direction of State Superintendent Fowler. It was at once, realized by those inter - ested that text-books relating to the elementary principles of agriculture and suitable for use in rural and graded schools would be needed, and State Superintendent Fowler addressed letters to the superintendents of all the other states, making inquiry if such suitable text-books were in use or had been published. It was then learned that no text book relating to the elementary principles of agriculture and suitable for use in rural and graded schools had been published. At the request of Superintendent Fowler Dr. Charles E. Bessey, professor of botany, Lawrence Bruner, pro - fessor of entomology, and G. D. Sweezy, professor of astronomy, all of the University of Nebraska prepared the copy for a text-book entitled, ""New Elementary Agriculture for Rural and Graded Schools," and the same was published by "The University Publishing Co.," of Lincoln, Nebraska, being first issued in the year 1903. From the year 1871 to and including the year 1880, a period of ten years, there was in attendance at the college of agriculture of the Univer - sity a total of seventy-four students. Beginning with the year 1881 students taking courses of study in the college of agriculure were grouped with those taking courses in engineer - ing and catalogued under the heading industrial college, since which data </seg>
            <seg id="p368">it has been difficult to determine the exact number in attendance at the college of agriculture. There is the best of authority for stating that in the year 1889, when the Bute Board of Agriculture was invited by the board of regents of the University to cooperate with the University by appointing a committee as herein related, there was at that date, 1889, in attendance at the college of agriculture approximately thirty-eight students. In the year 1900, the date when the school laws of the State were amended so as to require teachers in our public schools to qualify them - selves to teach the elementary principles of agriculture, there were in at - tendance at the University in the college of agriculture, including the school of agriculture, two hundred students. I At the present date, 1910-1911, there are in attendance at the Univer - in the college of agriculture, including the school of agriculture, t hundred forty-nine students. THE NEBRASKA RURAL LIFE COMMISSION By F. G. Odell, Secretary. • At the session of the Nebraska Farmers' Congress held in Lincoln, January 20th, 1911, a resolution was unanimously adopted requesting the governor to appoint a commission for the study of rural life conditions in this State. Subsequently the following joint resolution, prepared by the legislative committee of the Nebraska Farmers' Congress, was introduced in the senate by Senator Ollis of Valley county, and in the house by Rep - resentative Sanborn of Sarpy county, and unanimously adopted by both houses of the legislature: S "Whereas, the universal tendency of population seems to be toward e cities, with the ultimate effect of materially depopulating the country districts to the detriment of agriculture and the decreasing values of real estate, and "Whereas, other states, notably the states of Washington, Oregon, Idaho, Montana and Michigan have already appointed country life com - missions to investigate the social and economic conditions surrounding farm life and to report thereon, and "Whereas, the superintendent of public education and the Nebraska Farmers' Congress have already requested that such a commission be ap - pointed for the study of rural life conditions in this state; therefore, be it f "Resolved, that the senate, the house of representatives concurring erein, respectfully request of the governor of Nebraska that he appoint a commission to be known as the Nebraska rural life commission, such commission to consists of not less than five nor more than nine members, and be it further k "Resolved, that said commission shall serve without salary and make report of their findings to the governor in the same manner as re - of other public officers of this state." </seg>
            <seg id="p369">In pursuance of this resolution which immediately received the execu - tive approval, Governor Aldrich appointed the following commission: Pm. L. C. Lawson, Clarks, chairman; Dr. Chas. E. Bessey, University raska; Dr. Geo. E. Condra, University of Nebraska; Prof. J. W. Be, superintendent of public instruction; Hon. R. W. McGinnis, Fre- Hon. J. D. Ream, Broken Bow; Hon. J. A. Ollis, Jr., Ord; Hon. J. 8. ty, Minden; Hon. W. S. Delano, Lincoln; Frank G. Odell, secretary commission, Lincoln The commission organized on February 23, 1911, and immediately be - gan a campaign for an appropriation for expenses of its prospective inves - tigations. A bill carrying an appropriation of $5,000 was defeated in the house committee on finance, ways and means, and subsequently, through the efforts of the members of the commission, aided by Senators Brown of Lancaster and Ollis of Valley an item of $3,000 for the expenses of the commission was included in the general appropriation bill as a Senate amendment. This was finally cut to $1,500 in the conference committee and passed both houses in this form. For purposes of investigation the commission has divided its work into ten sections with the following chairmen, each of whom has the assistance of two other members of the commission and is further empowered to select advisory assistants from among interested citizens: Investigation Sections. Education — State Supt. Crabtree. E Health and Sanitation — Commissioner Condra. ultural Schools — Commissioner Bessey. Organizations — Commissioner Ream. Cooperative Organizations — Commissioner Canaday. Landlord and Tenant — Commissioner Ollis. Farm Labor — Chairman Lawson. Taxation — Commissioner Delano. Transportation — Commissioner McGinnis. Publicity and Statistics — The Secretary. The removal of Superintendent Crabtree from the State created a vacancy on the Commission which has been filled by the appointment of his successor in office, Superintendent Jas. E. Deizell. LThe Commission has sent out to the farmers of the State twenty sands copies of the following explanatory letter and questionnaire: — To the Farmer* of Nebraska. The Nebraska Rural Life Commission was instituted by a joint reso - lution of the thirty-second session of the Legislature of Nebraska to make an inquiry into the social and economic conditions of farm life in Ne- The purpose of this inquiry is to ascertain any important facts which </seg>

The Commission particularly desires knowledge of any facts or sug - gested remedies which will increase the desirability of farm life, tend to check the drift from the farm to the city, and make the ownership and operation of a profitable farm more easy of accomplishment. E these purposes the following list of questions has been prepared, answers are desired from every farm reader. The press of the urged to give this circular the widest publicity in order that a tative expression may be secured. Please answer questions in full, add on separate sheet any comments or suggestions which you think proper, and mail to the secretary of the Commission at Lincoln.

Odell, Secretary Nebraska Rural Life Commission. Lincoln. In addition to the copies of this questionnaire sent out directly by the Commission, a circulation of several hundred thousand has been reached through the daily and weekly papers of the State, so that the entire State is becoming well Informed as to the work in hand. Replies have been received to this letter to the number of several thousand, which will, after proper classification, give valuable data as to actual farm conditions in the State. Important Work Undertaken. rln addition to the outlined work of its various sections the Commission undertaken, through a subcommittee of the educational section, to re - view the text-books and reading matter which are being circulated for the use of rural schools. This committee is composed of a number of the leading educators of Nebraska, who are by reason of ability and experi - ence especially fitted for this important service which is being carried on under the superintendence of Commissioner Bessey. It is the purpose of the committee to incorporate in their report a bibliography of such pub - lications as are especially fitted for use in the rural schools of Nebraska. The Association of County Superintendents of the State has under - taken to make a "School Survey" of the rural conditions of each county, with a view of determining the local needs and such conditions as must be met in making more efficient the rural school. The primary purpose of this survey is to effect a re-direction of education, in order that the farm- </seg>
            <seg id="p372">er'i child may be taught the practical dignity and usefulness of the occu - pation of fanning, and in so far as possible, check the rush to the city. This particular work is entirely original and gives promise of great effi - ciency. Along the same line is the work of Commissioner Condra, who is push- Ing the Rural Survey on broad lines, such as will invoice the physical, ma - terial, and social resources of each farm community. This is a work of years before the entire State shall be covered, but the preliminary results reached are most gratifying. This Commission has been most fortunate in securing the voluntary and effective cooperation of all State departments; in this respect it is en - abled to divide its purely statistical and technical research into several divisions, which make for speed, accuracy, and economy. At this writing (January 15, 1912) the letters received from farmers of the State, to the number of over five thouland, indicate several striking things which are generally understood as being true, and of which these voluntary expressions of opinion and facts cited are confirmatory: Among these things are the following: 1. About 95 per cent of the correspondents say that the rural school fails to lit a child for farm life, and that the tendency is to lead them to the city. 2. Over 90 per cent of the writers complain of the injustice of low taxes on land held for speculative purposes and demand an equalized tax on land. About 60 per cent declare for removal of tax on improvements on land and over 50 per cent declare for some form of the single tax on land. 3. The letters received are almost unanimous in their demand for par cell post and a larger extension of rural free delivery privileges. 4. About 75 per cent of the writers declare that the agricultural effort of the present is too much centralized on the point of increased production, and demand that the agricultural colleges begin to teach practical rural economics In the way of cooperation in buying and selling, banking and credit, etc., and that this plan of educational effort be extended to the farmers' institutes. 5. Religious facilities seem fairly satisfactory throughout the State, but there is a general complaint that the social side of farm life is greatly neglected. 6. The conditions of farm homes are generally stated as being satisfac - tory. It is significant, however, that the replies so far listed are from the men, and it is possible that "when letters come in from the farm women the conditions of the homes will be shown in a different light. 7. There is a generally expressed opinion that tenant farmers have ■mall chance of becoming owners under prevailing conditions. Eie thanks of the Commission and of the people of the State are the State Board of Agriculture for numerous courtesies and ma - assistance received, not the least of which is the occasional clr - n of the publications of the Commission in the correspondence of </seg>
            <seg id="p373">is of material benefit to this Commission in view of its meager funds. The Commission is entirely non-partisan and has no political signifi - cance, being composed of men of all parties, each earnestly desirous of serving the State to the best of his ability. Their services are being given entirely without compensation and should meet with a hearty re - sponse from the people. Any communications addressed to the office of the Commission at Lincoln will be appreciated and promptly acknowl - edged. Let us work together for Nebraska. IMPROVING NEBRASKA ROADS. Address Delivered by Dr. Edward Gladfelter, of Central City, Neb., Be - fore the recent Meeting of the Nebraska Good Roads Association. In taking a survey of the present condition in which we find this road question, we have several matters indelibly impressed on our mind. It is simply wonderful to find the enormous misdirected efforts and the ex - penditures annually of thousands, yes, millions of dollars in m wasteful manner, without accomplishing a penny's worth of improvement, and, in the majority of cases, we find that we have a great deal worse condition than existed before any work was undertaken. S Where one mud-hole existed they have made a dozen and, in the con - ruction of their ditches along the roadside, deep holes and pockets exist, preventing drainage rather than giving it and, of course, then in goes a culvert across tbe road and usually of plank, built so that you have a pro - jection above the road surface, ranging from six inches to a foot. Whereas, if the ditches were properly constructed there is absolutely no need for a culvert. About two years ago, a few of us in Central City, Neb., took it upon ourselves to inquire into the situation. A general survey convinced us that something was radically wrong, and all the money up to this time had been spent without any result, and enough of it to provide perma - nent highways for every road in Merrick county, and we are forced to the conclusion, that our road laws in Nebraska are the worst bunch of conglomerate rot ever in existence. For example, under a supervisors' system such as we have in Mer - rick county, this board ha3 no control over the highways, except to establish the road, but their maintenance and construction is delegated to township boards, of which we have thirteen and some of these are di - vided in several parts. Again, the personnel of these boards is changed about every year or two, each and every member having an idea of some hap-hazard plan, tearing out the work of former boards and none having a knowledge of proper construction, nor any definite, sane or precon - ceived notion of the ultimate object to be obtained. Now, it la incon - ceivable that so many people composing these boards can acquire suffi - cient knowledge, in such short periods of time, to become expert road - builder*. Experience so far, at least, confirms the fact, that about the only thing they become expert in, is to spend the road revenues without </seg>
            <seg id="p374">any permanent benefit. In fact. In most Instances they place the road out of commission and frequently the highway is abandoned, so far as travel is concerned. Again under a commissioner system, which at least elim - inates so many boards of control, more uniform work may be obtained, but even this system gives us nothing that brings the right kind of re - sults. We found the United States government, while not giving any di - rect financial aid toward highway construction, it has maintained a high - way department, presided over by 1* W. Page, director, who has made many experiments with soils and educated a number of men, who, today, are road experts and by proper application to this department for their services can be assigned for thirty days to any district, to disseminate the knowledge this department has obtained to treat the kind of soil and condition prevalent in the district to be worked and improved. Our first move was to take advantage of the government experiments and secured the assignment of one of their experts, Mr. Dodge. The result, after his investigation of our conditions, was that wo were a very favored country in that we have material at hand to construct good sand-clay roads and built us an object lesson on a mile out of sand and clay, at a cost of $400, that challenges in efficiency the more expen - sive road construction, such as macadam and asphalt Since then we have constructed more mileage, the cost running as high as $900, per mile. These roads need to be maintained by the use of a King split log drag, after every rain; the cost of which will vary from $10 to $20 per mile per year, paying at the rate of $4 per day for man and team. The result of this experiment has practically made every citizen of Merrick county good road boosters, the rural districts see their distance cut in two to the towns and cities. In other words the farming districts become citified and the land values are greatly enhanced. Today, we can boast of the greatest number of good road enthusiasts within the confines of any com - munity. We formed the Merrick county state good roads association, solicited donation work and money, which was librally provided, went out with a slogan, "Across the county in two days!" On one mile of sand we dumped 1,600 loads of clay and mixed it with the sand according to the United States specifications. All this was donated work, and shows some of the enthusiasm aroused. This, across the county road, is part of the greatest transcontinental route in the state, namely, the Platte valley transcontinental route, which follows the Union Pacific railroad across the State and is a river grade road to Denver, Cheyenne and the Pacific coast The only hills on the entire route are on the Dodge Btreet road out of Omaha to Elkhorn, after which you strike the grandest stretch of 400 miles of the finest standardized sand-clay road in existence, very few turns and just a few connecting links now remain incomplete, but by next July this entire route can boast a route without a bump or a hump, •very culvert placed beneath the road surface, at least one foot, and smooth as a boulevard. "Open 'er up," will be a by-phrase. By the way, this is the natural and historic transcontinental route, traveled by buffalo and Indians from time immemorial, followed by the early fur traders, the </seg>
            <seg id="p375">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE S75 Mormons, the Oregon pioneers, the forty-miners, the Holladay sixteen coaches, the pony express, the Union Pacific railroad and thousands of people annually passed over this route on foot, in wagons and on horse - back in the dajs of the California gold excitement, and today increasing numbers find it a delightful automobile route. I make mention of this route because it passes through our county and our organization had much to do, of course, with other valuable assistance, in improving this particular route. This good roads movement is very contagious and is epidemic, not only in our community but everywhere. Farmers begin to realize the reduced cost of hauling and benefits. The treatment of this infection must be worked out on a broad and impartial plan that will bring the right kind of results. All told, in our county, we last year constructed twenty mile* and made provisions to construct twenty more and the first time in its history to get results worth while. Why? Simply because we had a demonstra - tion of the right way and held fast to the one standard, a part of which I will enumerate. First— A survey, to obtain your water levels, this too will obliterate over one-half of the present culverts in place. Water is a road's worst enemy. The survey will assure you that the ditches will carry off the water. In this connection, the shape of your road crown is an important factor, not too steep, but shaped like a duck's back. (You know, nothing sheds water better than a duck's back) high in the center with a slope gradual to the ditch, so it is possible, if necessary, to drive down into the ditch with safety. We aim to have actual road surface of eighteen feet and on the Platte valley transcontinental route, we made it twenty-four feet, making the entire width forty-eight feet from ditch to ditch. Second — Another and important fact is, the proper mixture of soil. You are aware that sand is a good road in wet weather, clay and gumbo is poorest then. In dry weather, clay and gumbo are at their best and in wet weather at their worst. The United States government finds that a mixture of sand to the point of saturation in the clay will create a com - bination of soil that is a better road material than either alone for any condition of weather, wet or dry. Third — The culverts should be a permanent type, cement preferred and should be so placed that they permit a foot of dirt on top of them. These significant facts prove that with even the means at hand and money available, by properly directing our efforts, much good can be accom - plished until we have a revision of our laws and obtain state and federal aid. Recently, I attended the national good roads congress, called by the federal fraternities, held in Washington, D. C. Their purpose was to form a national good roads organization, creating a central national body, cen - tralizing all the good road organizations into one big head, so they can collect all the scattered efforts into one big forceful unit, to induce this glorious country of ours to see the necessity of giving federal aid to th« </seg>
            <seg id="p376">LTo this end the national highway association of the United States organized December 11, 1911, at the head of which we placed Senator Dupont from New Jersey. This association to meet annually in Washington, D. C, the purpose of which is to obtain federal aid and every road organization in the country, corporation and individual may become a member at $1 per. Every organization should be represented by at least one membership and a greater number if possible. This dollar is the means that will give it the working force. To my mind, this organization will be the vital force in obtaining federal aid for permanent highway construction. This organiza - tion proposes to work in a broad and impartial way and formulated a bill calling for an $80,000,000 appropriation for road extension. Representa - tive Prouty, of Iowa, introduced the bill in congress, which proposes an apportionment among the various states of $5,000,000 in 1912, $10,000,000 In 1913, $15,000,000 in 1914. $20,000,000 In 1915, $30,000,000 in 1916. The federal expenditure on each road is limited to one-half of the total cost. It was the consensus of opinion, this bill would pass and you can see the necessity of a readjustment of the Nebraska road laws, so we will be able to take advantage of federal aid when it is available. Our State must have a law built on these same broad lines, so that the State, county and pre - cinct can raise the other 50 per cent of construction. We must see to it that our next legislature provides laws in conform - ity to modern methods, the detail must be worked out by a proper com - mittee, or some one capable of preparing a bill. It is absolutely neces - sary that we create a state highway commission, state highway engineer and deputy engineers in each county, a provision for bonding the State, (Pennsylvania is now amending their laws to permit the state to issue $50,000,000 worth of bonds to construct nineteen perma - nent highways in the state, the cost of which will be $15,000 per mile), also means whereby our convict labor can be employed. Other states, Colorado, being one, have received fruitful results from such employment. In conclusion, let me say, it is impossible for all of us to become expert road-builders, our present laws now impose this on us. Road construc - tion, to get the best results for money expended, must be supervised by men who have made scientific, thorough study of it, and who are making it their life occupation. Then, and then only, can we look for the right kind of permanent results. Our work in Merrick county received much publicity and the newspapers were successful in molding the right kind of opinions that was of immense benefit to us. I am of the opinion, that the right kind of newspaper publicity is the thing that will help us bring the quickest results of any means we can employ. The Romans, centuries ago handed us a heritage, but somehow, we are just awakening from a Rip Van Winkle sleep, and I predict the United States, the states and counties and precincts will soon be headed the right way and our road construction will excel any in the world. Just now, Germany holds the pennant, with the tonnage cost of six to eight cent* per mile, while ours is twenty-five cents. This country knows how </seg>
            <seg id="p377">to beat it and we are out to make it an accomplished fact. Finally, I want to extend an invitation to our neighbors in the southern part of the state, to join us and work together in harmony for the general good of this cause, rather than any particular sectional one, accomplishing results for the whole people. THE USE OF THE SPLIT-LOG DRAG ON EARTH ROADS. By D. Ward King, Expert on Split-Log Drag, Office of Public Roads Department of Agriculture. The earth road is by far the most common type of highway in this country. Its cheapness in comparison with other types of construction and the absence in many sections of the country of rock, gravel, or other hard natural materials for road building will render its use necessary for many years to come. There are at present in this country about 2.000,000 miles of such roads, most of which must be maintained by some means more or laaa inexpensive. The split-log drag is of great service on roads of this class, and an increasing mileage of the rural highways of this country is being kept in repair economically and well by the use of this simple imple - ment. It is now in use in many states of the Union and in foreign coun - tries also, and its adoption in most localities where there are earth roads will doubtless increase. The aim in writing this bulletin has been to give a concise descrip - tion of the construction of the split-log drag and the method of using it which will give the best results. The ditch cleaner, another useful im - plement for use on earth roads, has also been briefly described. Construction of a Drag. The author has experimented with a great variety of devices for road dragging, but has found the two-slab log or plank drag with liberal "set back" the most satisfactory. Double drags for working both sides of the roadway simultaneously have been tried with only limited success. The reason for this lies in the fact that both sides of an earth road are never exactly alike. This causes the two parts of the drag to work unevenly and to interfere with each other. It is also impossible for one man to operate both parts successfully as will be shown later on. STwo mistakes are commonly made in constructing a drag. The first in making it too heavy. It should be so light that one man can easily it Besides, a light drag responds more readily to various methods of hing and to the shifting of the position and weight of the operator, both of which are essential considerations and are discussed more fully under the head "How to use a drag." A drag can be made heavier at any time by proper weighting. </seg>
            <seg id="p378">The other mistake is in the use of squared -timbers, instead of those with sharp edges, whereby the cutting effect of sharp edges is lost and the drag is permitted to glide over instead of to equalize the irregulari - ties in the surface of the road. These mistakes are due partly to badly drawn illustrations and plans of drags which have occasionally appeared in newspapers and partly to the erroneous idea that it is necessary that a large amount of earth shall be moved at one time. A dry red cedar log is the best material for a drag. Red elm and walnut when thoroughly dried are excellent, and box elder, soft maple. or even willow are preferable to oak, hickory, or ash. The log should be 7 or 8 feet long and 10 to 12 inches in diameter, and carefully split down the middle. The heaviest and best slab should be selected for the front. At a point on this front slab 4 inches from the end that is to be at the middle of the road locate the center of the hole to receive a cross stake and 22 inches from the other end of the front ■lab locate the center for another stake. The hole for the middle stake will lie on a line connecting and halfway between the other two. The back slab should now be placed in position behind the other. From the end which is to be at the middle of the road measure 20 inches for the center of the cross stake, and 6 inches from the other end locate the cen - ter of the outside stake. Find the center of the middle bole as before. When these holes are brought opposite each other, one end of the back slab will lie 16 inches nearer the center ot the roadway than the front one, giving what is known as "set back." The holes should be 2 inches in diameter. Care must be taken to hold the auger plumb in boring these holes in order that the stakes shall fit properly. The hole to receive the forward end of the chain should be bored at the same time. The two slabs should be held 30 inches apart by the stakes. Straight - grained timber should be selected for the stakes, so that each stake shall fit snugly into the 2-inch hole when the two slabs are in the proper po - sition. The stakes should taper gradually toward the ends. There should be no shoulder at the point where the stake enters the slab. The stake should be fastened in place by wedges only. When the stakes have been placed in position and tightly wedged, a brace 2 inches thick and 4 inches wide should be placed diagonally to them at the ditch end. The brace should be dropped on the front slab, so that its lower edge shall lie within an inch of the ground, while the other end should rest in the angle between the slab and the end stake. A strip of iron about 3% feet long. 3 or 4 inches wide and M, of an inch thick may be used for the blade. This should be attached to the front slab, so that it will be one-half inch below the lower edge of the ■lab at the ditch end, while the end of the iron toward the middle of the road should be flush with the edge of the slab. The bolts holding the blade in place should have flat heads and the holes to receive them should be countersunk. If the face of the log itanda plumb It is well to wedge out the lower </seg>
            <seg id="p379">edge of the blade with a three-cornered strip of wood to give it a set like the bit of a plane. A platform of inch boards held together by three cleats should be placed on the stakes between the slabs. These boards should be place at least an inch apart to allow any earth that may heap up and fall ove the front slab to sift through upon the road again. The end cleats shoul be placed so that they will not rest upon the cross stakes, but drop in side them, while the middle cleat can be shifted to either side of the mid die stake. These cleats should extend about an inch beyond the flnishe width of the platform. An ordinary trace chain is strong enough to draw the implement, provided the clevis is not fastened through a link. The chain should be wrapped around the rear stake, then placed over the front slab. Raising the chain at this end of the slab allows the earth to drift past the face of the drag. The other end of the chain should be passed through the hole in the end of the slab and is held by a pin passed through a link. One and one-half trace chains are sufficient. In many logs the grain runs around the tree in such a way that when split the slabs will be in a "wind." If this wind is not more than 4 inches in 8 feet, the timber can be used to good advantage by setting it so that the blade end of the log shall slant forward when the other end is perpendicular. The construction of the drag in this case is the same as in the above, but care must be taken that the holes bored to receive the stakes are plumb. No wedging under the lower edge of the blade is necessary in using such a log. Drags are often constructed of planks instead of logs. There is noth - ing in the construction of a plank drag that calls for particular mention except the strengthening of the planks along their middle line by a 2 by 6 inch strip. A triangular strip may be used under the lower edge of the blade to give it the proper cutting slope. How to Use a Drag. The successful operation of a drag involves two principles, which when thoroughly understood and intelligently applied, makes road work - ing with this implement very simple. The first concerns the length and position of the hitch, while the second deals with the position of the driver on the drag. Each influences the other to a large extent, and suc - cessful manipulation of the drag is dependent upon an understanding of both of them. For ordinary purposes the snatch link or clevis should be fastened far enough toward the blade end of the chain to force the unloaded drag to follow the team at an angle of 45 degrees. This will cause the earth to move along the face of the drag smoothly and will give comparatively light draft to the team, provided the driver rides in the line of draft. Sometimes, however, conditions are met which require special treatment and in a rolling country such conditions are not infrequent. Often a flat place several rods in length or a seepy spot needs special attention. </seg>
            <seg id="p380">tThe distance from the drag at which the team is hitched affects the h of the cutting. Shortening the chain tends to lift the front slab from the ground; a longer hitch causes the blade to cut more deeply. The length of hitch may be regulated by lengthening and shortening the chain at the end which runs through the hole in the blade end of the If small weeds are to be cut or a furrow of earth is to be moved, the doubletree should be attached rather close to the ditch end of the drag. The drag will now move nearly ditch end foremost, and the driver should stand with one foot on the extreme forward end of the front slab. This will swing the drag back to the proper angle and will cause the blade to plow. This hitch requires slow and careful driving in order to prevent the drag from tipping forward. If the blade should plow too deeply, as it may do in a wet spot, the driver should shift his weight toward the back slab. If straw and weeds clog the blade, they can usually be removed if the driver shifts his weight to a point as far as possible from the ditch or blade end. Similarly, if he steps quickly away from the ditch end, the load of earth may be dropped into a low place or mudhole. Some attention should be given to the edge of the blade. In the be - ginning, the average earth road requires no steel plate on. the drag, though the drag will be better preserved if the steel is applied at first. At the end of a year's work, if the dragging has been faithfully done, a steel plate will be needed. If the twist of the log is properly used or the three-cornered strip of wood is placed under the blade as described, a flat piece of steel will answer. In case the blade stands perpendicu - larly it should be slightly cupped when sharpened. Usually two horses are enough to pull a drag over an ordinary earth road. When four horses are used, they should be hitched to the drag by means of a four-horse evener. The team should be driven with one horse on either side of the right-hand wheel track or rut the full length of the portion to be dragged, and the return made over the other half of the roadway. The object of such treatment is to move earth toward the center of the roadway and to raise it gradually above the surrounding level. While this is being accomplished, all mudholes and ruts will be filled, into which traffic will pack the fresh earth. When to Use a Drag, rfhe drag does the best work when the soil is moist, but not sticky, earth then moves freely along the faces of the slabs. If the road- Is very badly rutted and full of holes, it may be well to use the drag once when the ground is slushy. This treatment is particularly applic - able before a cold spell In winter when it Is possible to have a roadway frosen smooth. r smooth road surface is secured by this method. Clay, when mixed water and thoroughly worked, becomes remarkably tough and lm- </seg>
            <seg id="p381">pervious to water. If compacted in this condition it becomes extremely hard. Another valuable result of dragging is the reduction of dust, for the particles of clay cohere so tenaciously that there is but little wear when the surface is smooth. Dust on an earth road is due to the breaking up under traffic of the frayed and upturned edges of ruts and hoof prints. If the surface is smoothed after each rain and the road dries hard and even, no edges are exposed to crushing and the only dust which forms is that due to actual wear of the road surface. There are bo many influences at work and conditions are so varied in different localities that it is quite impossible to lay down a general rule for the number of treatments needed to keep a road in good condi - tion. A tough clay or a stiff sandy clay will resist the action of wheels and hoofs for a longer period than a loam, other things being equal. Cer - tain sections of a roadway will require more attention than others be - cause of steep grades, seepage, exposure to hillside wash, etc. The best guide in meeting these conditions is the knowledge and experience gained while dragging the roadway. There is one condition, however, in which special treatment should be given to a road. Clay hills under persistent dragging frequently be- Ee too high in the center. To correct this it is best to drag the earth ird the center of the road twice and away from it once. Use on Rocky Roads. Ei soils full of loose stones or even small boulders the drag has done Bervice. The loose stones are drawn into a windrow down the cen - the road while the earth is deposited around the boulders in such a way that the surface is leveled. The loose stones in the center of the road should of course be removed. When there is a large proportion of small stones or gravel the drag will keep down the inequalities in the surface. Cost Data. There is little available data on the cost of maintenance of earth roads by dragging. However, there is no doubt as to the economy of the drag, either in first cost or in its operation. The most elaborate form will cost but a few dollars for material and labor, while one man and team can operate it successfully under all usual conditions. As a consequence, the statements given below are well within reason and in - dicate what may be accomplished with a very small outlay. The following figures show the cost of maintaining ordinary country roads per mile per year without a drag, and may be taken as a basis of cost of such maintenance. They were obtained in Kansas by Prof. W. C. Hoad, of the University of Kansas, in 1906, and were taken from the offl- </seg>
            <seg id="p382">382 PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE Crawford county $52 Douglas county 38 Franklin county 34 Johnson county 48 Neosho county 40 Saline county 43 The average cost is $42.50 per mile per year, and it may safely be ■aid that the cost of dragging would be trifling in comparison. P. P. Sanborn states: "The least expense per mile (for dragging) was about $1.50; the greatest a little over $6; the average expense per mile for 5V» miles a little less than $3." Commenting further, Mr. San - born declares: "The writer has lived by this piece of road all his life, and although we have had the extremes of weather this season, both wet and dry, not for forty years has the road in question been so free from mud and dust. Parties who have known the road all their lives are agreed that it never was in so good condition a season through." tWhen R. H. Aishton, general manager of the Chicago &amp; Northwest - n railroad, investigated the work of the split-log drag at Sac City, wa, preliminary to the campaign inaugurated by that company in 1905. he learned that one township had experimented with the drag on 2« miles of highway for a year. He found that the township paid for the making of the drags and hired men to use them, including the original cost of the drags when figuring the expense of the year's work. The total expense for the twelve months averaged $2.40 per mile, and the roads were reported to have been "like a race track" the larger portion of the year. Keighborhood of farmers in Roy county, Missouri, employed one members to drag a 5-mile stretch. He received compensation at of $3 per day. When the end of the year came and a settlement le, the cost for the year was found to be $1.66 per mile. The road is a tough clay, and my informant declares it was always much bet - ter than the other roads in the neighborhood. Prof. William Robertson, of the Minnesota Agricultural Station, after a year's experience in dragging a "main road made entirely of gumbo without any sand or gravel, and which during the past year has shown k defects either by rutting or development of soft places," fixes the cost the work at not to exceed $5 per mile. The Ditch Cleaner. The ditcher or ditch cleaner is a convenient device for cleaning ditches. It consists of a guide plank, 2 inches by 12 inches by 12 feet, and a mold board, 2 inches by 12 inches by 8 feet. These are braced with a crosspiece 3 feet long. The mold board should be shod with an Iron plate M inch by 4 inches by 3 feet, held in position with %-inch bolts countersunk. The cross brace should be hollowed 3 Inches on each ■td« at the middle, the hollowing to begin not legs than 4 inches from </seg>
            <seg id="p383">each end in order that its bearing against the guide and mold board planks shall not be shortened, nor the nailing space decreased. This it done to prevent earth from heaping up in front of the brace. A light platform is needed to make the use of the ditcher safe. To secure the best service from the ditcher, a weight of about 200 pounds should be placed over the front end. The essential thing to be gained is to have the ditcher maintain a smooth even surface on the bot - tom of the ditch. There is then no obstruction to the flow of water. This requires that soft, muddy holes be passed over lightly, and hard, high places be reduced. This result is obtained if the driver shifts hi* weight forward or backward as a high point or a mudhole is approached. If the driver shifts bis weight forward, the point of the ditcher is driven into the ground. If he moves back, the pressure on the forward end is relieved and the pull on the chain tends to raise it. Besides cleaning the ditch, the ditcher assists in preserving the slope from the side of the road to the bottom of the ditch. This keeps the road safe from possible accident to traffic from ditches with too abrupt slopes. Conclusion. The advantages to be gained from the persistent use of a road drag may be summarized as follows: 1. The maintenance of a smooth serviceable earth road free from ruts and mudholes. 2. Obtaining such a road surface with the expenditure of very little money and labor in comparison with the money and labor required for other methods. 3. The reduction of mud in wet weather, and of dust in dry weather. There are also several minor benefits gained from the use of a road drag, besides the great advantages which always accrue from the formation of improved highways. IMPROVEMENT OF NEBRASKA FIELD CROP3. By Nebraska Experiment Station. The improvement of field crops in Nebraska resolves itself into three principal lines of improvement: 1. The selection of the best varieties. 2. The improvement of these varieties either by acclimatization or some other method of plant breeding. 3. Improved soil culture. The importance of using the right varieties is well illustrated by the results of variety tests conducted at the Nebraska experiment station dur - ing the last five years. Some twenty-five varieties of corn have been tested. The average yields of the two best and two poorest yielding varie - ties for four year* are as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p384">Corn. 1902 1903 1904 1905 Ave. 75.1 80.6 65.0 74.0 Hogue's Yellow Dent 75 . 4 Keids Yellow Dent 68.9 72.2 82.8 60.8 71.0 Riley's Favorite 53.2 51.0 80.4 56.1 60.1 Silver Mine 50.0 58.1 65.1 63.4 69.1 State average, 31 bushels. The two poorest yielding varieties are not by any means the most Inferior varieties we have grown at the station, since we usually drop very poor varieties of corn after one or two years' test. The variety that baa been carried as much as four or five years is at least up to the average, or above it. It will be noted that the average yield of the two best varieties is twelve bushels above the average yield of the two poorest. When we remember that all of the varieties were grown under exactly the same con- ditions, and that the two best varieties cost no more to plant, cultivate, or harvest and yet gave a clear average of twelve bushels to the acre better yield for a period of four years, the value of replacing the poorest varieties by the best will be seen. Winter Wheat and Oats. With winter wheat and oats similar results covering a period of five years have also been obtained, as is shown by the following tables Wheat. 1902 1903 1904 1905 1906 Ave. Turkish Red 30.0 31.0 17.8 36.0 62.0 35.3 Bl« Frame 10.8 27.3 17.5 25.0 54.0 26.9 Yarsolav »29.9 16.3 4.5 21.5 45.1 23.4 Glrka 26.2 25.0 t... 21.8 47.5 24.1 State average, 18.8 bushels.

It will be noted that the best variety of winter wheat has outyielded the two poorest varieties by an average of eleven bushels to the acre, while the best variety of eats has outyielded the poorest variety by sixteen bushels to the acre. •1901. tNot threshed </seg>
            <seg id="p385">385 At the Experiment Station Farm, by growing the best variety of corn, wheat, and oats, instead of one of the poorest varieties in each case, we would get twelve bushels more per acre each year, or a total for live years of sixty bushels; for the wheat, we would get a total of fifty-five bushels more per acre, and for the oats a total of eighty bushels more per acre. This large total of increase yield per acre is all clear gain, since it costs no more to grow an acre of good variety in the place of a poor variety. Some - times it even costs less, since they are usually more vigorous and keep down the weeds better. The question which at once arises is where and how shall we secure the best varieties. In the first place, the varieties that do well in one locality are not always varieties that do best in an - other. For example, Hogue's Yellow Dent has given good results at the Experiment Station Farm, but north of the Platte river Reid's Yellow Dent seems to be much the better corn; also in the western part of the State there are varieties that seem to do better than either of these. The best varieties for every section of the State must be carefully worked out by Eparative tests. Also, there are even several strains of the same vari - for example, the Silver Mine referred to in the above chart haa not n very good yields. Pie importance of having seed thoroughly adapted to our climate and mditions can not be too strongly urged in Nebraska; especially is ue in central and western Nebraska. Here we have a soil usually and even more or less sandy, a medium to light rainfall, and dry temperature. In fact, conditions are so different in many respects that we have found that it takes two or three years for corn brought from regions only a few hundred miles east of here to become thoroughly adapted. For a number of years we have been growing corn obtained from various places in other states and this State to test the value of acclimatization. In many cases we have had the seed of the same variety coming from two different sources planted side by side. The result of such tests for the last two years is shown by the following table: Differ- Ene and place of origin. 1903 ing, Nebraska ing, Illinois 1904 95.2 76.6 1905 69.8 69.8 Ave. 82.5 73.2 ~ iilver Mine, Nebraska Silver Mine, Illinois 70.0 65.1 76.1 63.4 73.0 64.2 i !now flake White, Nebraska 73.7 tnowflake White, Illinois 68.7 84.8 72.8 74.5 67.1 77.7 69.5 S ioone County White, Nebraska loone County White, Illinois 76.2 68.9 76.2 68.9 5 leid'8 Yellow Dent, Nebraska teid'i Yellow Dent, Illinois 87.1 63.4 75.2 ;:; </seg>

This difference in favor of home grown seed is probably due to the fact that in moving corn from Illinois with its heavier soil, greater rainfall, and more humid air, to Nebraska, with an entirely different soil, less rainfall, and a much drier air, the corn suffers by the change. It takes some years before it is thoroughly accli - mated and can yield as well as home grown corn. We will also find the same difference grown in eastern, western, or central Nebraska. Seed or two varieties, Nebraska White Prize and Silver Mine, was obtained from Saline county, Nebraska, about twenty miles from the experiment station, and from Washington county, which is one of the river counties. In both cases the Saline county corn outyielded the other, due to the fact that it was grown under conditions of soil and climate more like those at the experiment station. In another case Iowa Gold Mine, from Buffalo and Washington counties, was grown side by side, giving very much increased yield from the Buffalo county seed. Difference in Soil and Climate. EIn comparing the Silver Mine, the seed of which was obtained from ois and Washington county, it will be noted that the Illinois seed ltly outyielded the Washington county seed. At first, this seems to be an exception to the general rule for Nebraska seed to yield best. How - 6er, on careful comparison it will be seen that the conditions in Washing - ii county are not so different from those which prevail in Illinois (cen- «f .9 10.1 iv. a 76.9 63.5 67.6 ... ,.« 89.2 79.0 84.2 82.1 79.0 80.5 70.0 65.5 76.1 61.3 73.0 63.4 ::: 84.9 73.6 73.3 •57.9 69.4 ,„ 65.1 C3.4 64.2 65.6 51.3 63.4 </seg>
            <seg id="p387">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA STATE BOARD OF AGRICULTURE SOT tral), since it hag heavy soil, almost as much rainfall, and a (airly humid air. In Nebraska, for every fifty miles west of the Missouri river, you set into a different condition of soil and climate, and corn plants will probably experience more of a change in being moved fifty miles west of the Missouri river than 600 miles east. For Nebraska conditions the value of home grown seeds can not be too strongly urged. . Similar experiments with wheat have also shown the superior value of home grown seed wheat as compared with that brought from a distance. Too much faith must not be put in the name of a variety, as is well illustrated with an experiment with St. Charles White Corn. St. Charles White. 1904 1905 Average Lancaster county 60.6 70.8 60.7 Nemaha county 84.2 80.9 82.5 Difference, 21.8. It would be expected that the St. Charles White from Lancaster county would give the better yield, but, on the contrary, the seed from Nemaha county yielded better by almost twenty-two bushels. This was not due to the effect of climate, but rather due to the fact that we had two different strains of St. Charles White corn. It is therefore not only impor- tant to get the right variety of corn, but also to have the best strains of that variety. Usually superior strain is due to the better selection on the part of the grower. In pressing the claims of good seed the fact must not be overlooked that good soil is fully as important, and in some cases probably much more important, than seed selection. The best seed obtainable can not be made to yield on a poor and half-tilled soil. A great many complaints are heard from, farmers throughout the country to the effect that their seed "running out" and will no longer produce well. To test the value of poor seed when grown under the best cultured conditions, some years ago we took Turkish Red wheat and separated it into two parts, according to the weight of grain. Then the lighter half was taken and again separated into two parts, and the lightest portion taken. This was the lightest one-fourth of the original sample. The next year the crop obtained from the "light seed" was again separated into four parts, and the lightest portion planted. The process has been continued for a number of years with the following results : Poor Year Seed County State 1902 24.6 20.8 1903 SO.O 20.0 16. &lt; 1904 15.6 12.0 13.8 1905 23.2 23.8 20.4 1906 62.5 28.0 23. « Average 31.2 20 .95 19.0 </seg>
            <seg id="p388">It will be noted that during the period of five years the yield from the light seed has given good results. Whatever the cause it is apparent that the light seed has shown good yielding qualities under favorable condi - tions. It would seem from this that the constantly decreasing yields of wheat in the wheat growing section of the State, where it has been grown on the same land year after year without change, is due rather to the decreasing fertility of the soil than to the fact that the seed is "running A Permanent Agriculture. The Principle of Crop Rotation Example No. 1. Farm is divided into fourteen fields: Six fields in alfalfa and pasture. Eight fields are in grain crops. One or two fields are manured each year. The rotation passes over the farm in eight years and is completed in fourteen. With this rotation, at the end of fourteen years: t Every field has been in alfalfa or grass six years, or is under these Every field has been manured twice. Every field is in a high state of productivity. Without rotation or manure: The fields grow less productive each year. The first system means a permanent agriculture and productive land for centuries. The second system means a rundown farm in two generations General Explanations. Example No. 1 is simple, a model rotation, and may be changed to suit particular needs. In other words, it is simply to illustrate the principles of a rotation of crops. The principles are 1. That a certain portion of the farm should be laid down to crops such as alfalfa or grass, and a portion be under cultivation. 2. That each year, or alternate year, a part of the sod land shall be broken up and an equal portion of the cultivated land seeded down. </seg>
            <seg id="p389">PROCEEDINGS NEBRASKA 8TATE BOARD OP AGRICULTURE 38B The period of the rotation depends on nature of crops used : 1. If clover only is used in rotation with grain crops, the sod should be plowed in two years, and may be cropped in grain three to five years. 2. If alfalfa or pasture is used in the rotation, the sod should remain four to six years, and may be cropped in grain six to twelve years. The proportion of the farm laid down to sod and the proportion kept under cultivation depend on many things, such as the following: 1. Where a part of the farm mutt be kept in permanent pasture. On many farms some part is not suitable for cultivation, and can only be kept in pasture. In such cases it may be desirable to keep as large a portion of the cultivated land in grain as possible. 2. Where the entire farm it suitable for cultivation; and the pasture land may be in the rotation. On such a farm, where stock is kept, it may be desirable to have as much as one-half the land under forage and pasture. The crop grown will depend largely on climatic and soil conditions: The legumes for Nebraska are red clover and alfalfa. At present red clover is cultivated successfully in only about one-fourth of the State. Where red clover is grown it may be used in rotations, but on a very large proportion we will have to use alfalfa for leguminous crop. In the south cowpeas are very successful in the rotation, and in some regions soy beans are used, but neither of these crops give much promise in Nebraska. Rie grasses used for pasture will vary in different regions. For east - ebraska, timothy, brorae grass, meadow fescue, blue grass, white , and alfalfa mixtures are most important; but as we go west in the State, timothy, blue grass and white clover become less reliable, except on first bottoms, or under irrigation. Where shall the manure be applied is a matter to be considered. It is generally conceded, however, that in shorter rotations it should be applied to the sod land one or two years before breaking up, for the following 1. The growth of forage or grass is stimulated, giving increased yields. EA new broken sod, especially when turned in the spring, does not large amount of available fertility at once. It takes about two o reach best condition. The decayed manure furnishes available T for first crop. </seg>
