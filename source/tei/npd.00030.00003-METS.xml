            <seg id="p013">13 [NCBEA8CD RETIREMENTS FOB ADMISSION While the university of Nebraska has always maintained a relatively high standard for graduation, the needs of the state have sometimes seemed to require a standard for admission lower than one which the best colleges of the country now recognize as desirable. In the early days students so admitted completed their preparatory work in the Latin school or preparatory department. Later, when this had been abolished, the university permitted students who had attended a high school for three years or even less to enter conditionally and finish their preparatory work in the university proper by taking more than the number of hours required for graduation. For a number of years, however, we have been gradually raising the standard for admission. In September, 1911, for instance, only those were conditionally ad - mitted who could present 24 admission "points." The most radical recent change, however, was inaugurated at the beginning of the present school year, when the minimum for full admission was set at 30 "points," and that for conditional admission at 28. In this way we severed direct articulation with some three hun - dred three-year Nebraska high schools. In view of the fact that the free high school tuition law permits pupils from such schools ■•ii«l any four-year high school and thus complete a full high school course, this action has caused no special hardship to any one. Subsequent results have shown the wisdom of the univer - sity s action. Though this raising of standards has had a tend - ency to decrease attendance at the university, yet the four-year high schools have been strengthened, many three-year schools have been encouraged to become four-year schools, and no indi - vidual student has suffered. Again, in the past certain classes of music students were per - mitted to take certain university courses without presenting any definite certificates of scholarship. Such students must now meet practically the same requirements as other students. In the same way pupils enrolled in the secondary school of agriculture or in the temple high school are no longer permitted to register in university classes. B mission to the law college is now based upon one year of work. This has caused a marked improvement in the ter of the student body in the college of law, and has sent </seg>
            <seg id="p014">many lew desirable students to institutions with lower standards of admission than ours. Ete college of medicine, as previously announced, now offers years' course above the high school, or a four years' coarse g upon two years of selected college work. Requirements for admission to the summer school are now the Mae as to the regular colleges of the university. The iimir school may now be regarded as a half semester's joint iif inm of the various colleges, with the work of the teachers college given special emphasis. All of these modifications in admission requirements have tended to improve the quality of the student body, and render the work of the institution in a more genuine sense that of a true university. EFFECT ON ATTENDANCE OF INCREASED REQUIREMENTS The biennial report of two years ago contained the following: ' ' During the past four years the average increase in attendance has been over 250 annually. This means that we are now caring for over 1,000 more students than four years ago." Increased entrance requirements, however, have made the last two years' increases smaller than those of the two previous bienniums. Owing to the fact that we no longer include in our total enrolment in absentia students not registered for degrees, an exact compari - son is difficult. Further, the severing of the relations which existed for seventeen years with the university school of music also eliminated some 700 names. These factors have eliminated in all approximately 1,200 names which, had the old system been followed, would have appeared in our grand totals. As these students were never more than a nominal expense to the tax - payers of the state, there has been practically no decrease in expense to the institution. Compared as closely as possible with that of the preceding biennium, the enrolment for the bienninm just past shows an increase of about 100 per year. In view of the very marked raising of admission requirements, which might be expected to cut down attendance, this increase in enrolment of high class students is gratifying. Nevertheless, it should be remembered that this increase has been in the class of students M </seg>

ADVANCE IN SCHOLARSHIP r hiring the last two years the scholarship of the student body noticeably improved. The publicity given to the scholarship rds of various groups of students, notices of failure to make grades and consequent severing of relations with such students, and other activity on the part of the delinquent student committee, may have created the impression in some quarters that the .students do not now take as serious a view as formerly of their regular tasks. Such, however, is by no means the case. These activities are only the manifestations of a successful effort to improve scholarship. Not only has the percentage of delinquency in scholarship been reduced but the scholarship standards of the departments have been raised ; so that, while the various depart - ments have been demanding more work and higher scholarship in order to obtain passing grades, a greater number of students than ever have succeeded in meeting these demands. In this connection the conscientious work of the delinquent student com - mittee and its efficient secretary deserves special commendation. Higher standards of admission are, of course, another potent ewe of this improvement in scholarship.

            <seg id="p018">THE TEACHING STAFF The continued increase in the cost of living, and the great Material success offered in other lines of work, have made the position of the professor relatively less desirable than it was a number of years ago, and have tended to bring the teaching profession into disfavor with the most active and progressive young men in college. This, in turn, has tended to lower pro - fessorial standards. Other institutions have in part solved this problem by rapidly increasing the salaries of their more brilliant men. As a result of these conditions, Nebraska has lost some men whom it would very gladly have retained. On the other ■ many of our i: professors have, through love of the ui resisted attractive offers from institutions paying larger salaries: and iiat we have lost our best m&gt;-n would very great injustice I 1 opportunity service above material advancement.

First, certain things in connection with the college of agriculture should be made plain. This college bears precisely the same relations to the university as the college of engineering or the college of law. Its work is not confined to the university farm, nor should it be ified with the material equipment of the farm campus. In one of its very important departments — that of forestry — I its entire class work at the city campus. A student registered in the college of arts and sciences, or any other college, can elect studies in the college of agriculture just as freely as ein, provided lie meets the specific require - a of his own college. It very frequently happens that a I in the agricultural college takes the major n of his work at the city campus, while a student registered arts college may be carrying the major portion of his work at the university farm. Though nominally divided into college* — partly for administrative convenience, partly in accord with cus - toms prevaili- the university is a unit. The purpose of all its colleges is. first, to train for good citizenship, and, second to train efficient and expert men for chosen callings — callings which require high mental development. Particularly does the university desire to furnish to the people leaders in those lines of human activity which are developed by study and research. The school of agriculture, however, has a somewhat different purpose. For convenience its activities are confined exclusively to the university farm. Its purpose is to train practical farmers, and its students are those who are unable or feel that it is unde - sirable to take a course in the college of agriculture. It is of strictly high school rank, aiming to furnish practically the same degree of culture and mental training as the four-year high school. In a word, it has the same academic standing as some 140 other high schools in the state, but with the special aim of turning out 19 </seg>
            <seg id="p020">practical farmers. Except in so far as its graduates, like other successful men. become natural leaders in their immediate com - munities, it does not aim to train agricultural leaders. This is the work of the college of agriculture. In discussing the suggestion that the other colleges be removed to the university farm, therefore, several things must !&gt;■• enn - sidered : The inn the total expense over a long period of years, the effect on the students in the agricultural colleL' ner colleges, and the • upon the school of ;. -an institution somewhat distinct from the u ier activities, though closely associated with part of the work of the agricultural college.

Further, should the legislature adopt this general suggestion, the regents do not wish to be understood as committing themselves to this exact type or order of development. While considerable money could be expended profitably on the present site without purchas - ing any more land than the relatively small area necessary to till out the present rectangle, it would of course be necessary to ask future legislatures to make appropriations for more ground. It should be borne in mind, also, that in acquiring this ground of two plans can be followed: One is that pursued at Minnesota, of purchasing at one time enough land for future university needs. This, naturally, means a large initial expense. The other is the Iowa plan of buying the land piecemeal as needed, which means a smaller initial expense, but greatly appreciated values upon the parcels latterly purchased. One or the other a </seg>

NEW BUILDINGS NEEDED The original cost of all the buildings at the farm and city campuses, including those now in course of erection, is not much in excess of the single academic high school building of the city While comparisons with other institutions are some - times misleading, the board believes that the university of Nebraska is by far less adequately housed than any other great lition in the country. They believe that their own and their cessors' plan of putting the money at their disposal into instruction rather than into buildings has been justifiable on the ground that the institution's soul is of more consequence than its ■rtksftsai t he time has come when the state of Nebraska face the problem of adequately housing its university stu- This plea is not made on account of any especially changed conditions. The congestion of our students in poorly lighted basement rooms, in old, firetrap buildings, without ventilation excepting the cracks around the doors and windows, in buildings one of which has walls cupped out so as to suggest collapse in wind of any violence, in buildings another of which is ltd from top to bottom, means a disgraceful and appalling condition of affairs. To obtain a plant comparable with those in neighboring states towards which we feel a generous rivalry, and 'ride should demand that we equal, if not excel, to Nebraska young people as good educational facilities as they ire by traveling not more than five hundred miles, ould at once enter upon a program contemplating the ulti - mate erection of new buildings costing a total of from two to two and a half million dollars. Whether or not the legislature decide ■iovc the university, we must immediately enter upon an program of this sort. Even these additions would make • ctable and not dangerous competitors, in material equipment, of some institutions which are even now not doing the educational work which we are doing. To care adequately for the work now conducted at the city campus, there should be a large addition to the museum, an addition to the chemical laboratory, and more adequate quarters for gymnasium work and drill.

I To the average citizen, the university's work in agriculture eals as among the most important of its many and varied vities. To the farmer it offers the practical solution of many iis problems; to the business man, assurance of the state's continued agricultural prosperity, and consequently assurance of its continued business prosperity: to the city dweller, hope for abundance of foodstuffs at reasonable [trices.

AVOIDANCE OF DUPLICATION During the last few years the people of a number of states ■ aroused by the unnecessary and wasteful duplication rk in their state institutions. Especially is this true where iiid grant col! narate from the university. Though we ■ i. like some of our neighbors, have to contend with divided ami so ha\ d the difficulties connected with I to define the work of the respective schools — difficul - ral states have resulted in the appointment of common boards of control — yet there has been at times some pressure for duplication in the work at our farm and city cam - p ises Whether or not the university is to be physically con - solidated upon the farm campus, the regents believe that all build - .uust be erected where most needed, and are resolved not to permit any unnecessary duplication of any of the university's activities.

THE EXPERIMENT STATION Though the experiment station publishes a separate report, a of its activities may not be out of place here. Supported to a very large extent by appropriations from the fed - eral government, the station aims, in accordance with the terms of these grants, to discover new agricultural truth. The facts which rs aud the agricultural theories which it tests are taught to the students in the college classes, and carried out by the agri - cultural extension department to the farmers of the state. The m, now very largely supported by government funds, might well, like the substations, receive a special appropriation from The central station should always remain the principal laboratory of the agricultural college, while the substa - should be used to demonstrate the applicability to local con - -rricultural theories and practices.

The de - partment of mechanical engineering, under the general direction of the professor in charge, has prepared the mountings and other mechanical parts of the instrument. The total result is an instru - ment worth about seven thousand dollars, made without much ex - pense to the institution, since most of the material consumed could ■ </seg>
            <seg id="p030">in any case be charged to the practice work of the students who made the parts. It now becomes necessary to house the instru - ment properly. For this purpose a small observatory, costing about $15,000, should be constructed. REPAIRS AND UPKEEP OF BlILDlNCiS cessary repairs have been postponed from year to year, and only those most urgently needed have been cared for. In order properly to heat all the buildings, which already overtaxed its capacity before the law building was cut into the system, the b house at the city campus must have new boilers. Some of the boilers have been in constant use since the old main building was for the first time steamheated. about thirty years ago, a time coal stoves were still in vogue.

The mill levy, at the time of its adoption, would have been pie to support the university for all time along the lines then laid out. It is now insufficient for salaries and general main - tenance at the city and farm campuses, to say nothing of the mul- titude of other university activities. E should be remembered that only about two-thirds of our funds are derived from taxation. The remainder comes interest on invested funds, from the federal government, from the sale of produce, and from student fees. It should not be bmed that the university cash fund is entirely made up of pay - ts by students. Part of it comes from the sale of produce; part of it is made up of fixed sums retained from year to year. For example, the $10,000 permanently invested in the book store for the purpose of selling books to students at cost may be turned over twice each year and may be figured as $40,000 in the biennial grand total, though no additions whatever may be made to the original $10,000. Finally, it should be remembered that the fees are small in comparison with those in many other state institu - and in most cases mere pittances in comparison with the charges at most privately endowed institutions. E spite of the board's desire, expressed two years ago, to any further extension of duties, the 1911 legislature saw charge the institution with the management of a hog cholera B plant, the legislative reference bureau, a new school of agri - ■ I ;i iipw substation.

            <seg id="p036">Re statutes of the state require the board of regents to report bien - to the Governor and the legislature the expenditures for support University "in detail." Heretofore that has been done literally. Bat the volume of business has become such that a book of 350 page* solidly filled with items corresponding to each voucher drawn against the several 'unds no longer answers the purpose of giving full informa- Uon In brief and convenient form. E'o years ago the regents gave notice in their report that the I of reporting would be changed in such manner as to preserve the of the law requiring detailed reports while reducing the talk 1 and emphasizing the feature of condensed statements. The pr— '—t Pl*n is to present in one statement in the briefest form the —lire expenditure for support of the university for the biennium — showing the general purposes of expenditures and the funds drawn against respectively. This is done in statement No. 1 immediately fol - lowing this prefatory note. Statement No. 2 is a reclassification of ex - penditures alon" the lines of apportionments of moneys for departmental purposes. It is explanatory and designed to show the cost separately of the various branches of university activity. Statement No. 3 is designed to show the financial resources and the status of all funds set apart for university support or specially appropriated therefor, at the close of the biennial period. Statement No. 4 shows the moneys received at the uni - versity from fees, sales and other sources and transmitted to the state treasure- Thus the whole of the university biennial finance is set forth ■pon little aore than a dozen pages. For purposes of detail the entire university expenditures are divided Into three groups or schedules — salaries and wages (schedule A), main - tenance or general current expenses (schedule B), and permanent im - provements including land (schedule C). These schedules show the total amount paid to any person or firm during the two year period, and that tsaonnt is set down but once in the proper schedule. The arrangement is alphabetical. Occasionally, in such cases as the purchase of building materials which are used both in general repairs and in new permanent improvements, the name of a person or firm appears in both schedules B and C. Also, in cases where employees or officers have paid out money for the institution or have traveling expenses their names will appear la both schedules A and B — one covering salary, the other covering current expenses. These are obviously necessary cases of duplication. A statement of condition of the student loan funds on November SO, 1112, is added separately from all funds and monies used for support of the institution. The usual property schedule is also appended showing all of the real and chattel property under control of the regents, with an estimate of its value. ■ </seg>

Technically, it should include every paid service; but It has not been found practicable to adopt that rule absolutely. Substantially, it is a list of all persons em- ployed by the university regularly or temporarily during the biennium ended November 30, 1912, with the amount paid to each during that period. No attempt has been made to give exact titles; these change in many cases during two years. Titles or other designations of service are stated substantially as used when the service was rendered, or at the end of the biennium. The items of this schedule are found grouped by totals and funds under "salaries and wages" in statement No. 1, pages 37 to 41. They are also found distributed to departments under the same heading in statement No. 2, pages 42 to 46. 51 </seg>

In other words, it is the entire university expenditure for the two-year period ended Nov. 30, 1912, other than for salaries and wages, permanent improvements and land. Occasionally the name of the same person or firm occurs in both schedule* B and C. Such repetition is obviously necessary, as in cases of building materials or labor supplied for new structures (schedule C) and general repairs of old structures (schedule B), by the same person or firm. Schedules A. B and C are made without respect to "funds" or the sources of the moneys expended. Expenditures shown in this schedule are dis- tributed to the proper "funds," as the latter are defined by law, in state- ment No. 1, pages 37 to 41. They are again reclassed and distributed by departments to the various branches of university activity, in statement I pages 42 to 46. For this purpose divisions of experimentation and administration are treated in the same manner as departments of in- Bt ruction. ~ </seg>

It Is held by the attorney general of the state that this fund is not within the scope of general statutes regulating methods of expenditure* and reporting of public moneys. It is therefore reported separately from uni - versity resources and expenditures. The Webster donation (of which the interest only can be used) and the unused portions of the Waddell and Whitmore donations are kept invested in securities bearing 5 per cent interest. Loans are made under rules prescribed by the board of regaats and published in the university catalog. FINANCE STATEMENT Respectfully submitted, J. S. DALES, Custodian.
