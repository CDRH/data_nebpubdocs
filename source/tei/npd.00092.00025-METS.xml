         <seg id="p003">Sorghum Production in Nebraska R. L. CUSHING, T. A. KIESSELBACH, and 6.J. WEBSTER 1 SORGHUM is a relatively new crop in Nebraska, and, because it offers some special problems, it is advisable for growers to make a thorough study i)f varieties and production practices. They may thereby avoid many of the difficulties which might otherwise be encountered. It is therefore the purpose of this bulletin to present as complete information as possible, re - garding the production of sorghum for grain and forage in Nebraska. Sorghum has been grown for centuries in certain areas of Asia and Africaf There the sorghum'plant furnishes not only feed grain and forage for livestock, but also food for human beings. In addition, die stalks are sometimes used for fuel, or as material for the construction of simple shelters, fences, and furniture. Although sorghum is widely used in other lands, [it has only recently become important in the United States. Since the first sorghum introductions were made, less than 90 years ago, the acreage planted to this crop has increased steadily, until now sorghum is grown on approximately 13 million acres annually. About a third of this acreage is devoted strictly to the production of grain, most of which is used as feed for livestock. The remainder, aside from a small acreage used for the pro - duction of sorgo syrup, is utilized as forage or as a combination grain and Table \.—Annual harvested acreages of grain and forage sorghum in Ne - braska, 1929-39} Year Grain Forage Total 000 000 '--;.- 000 ¦ ."¦ • 1929 15 ¦¦¦-': ¦&gt; 120 135 1930 17 1H 131 1931 21 125 146 ; 1932 ¦•¦¦¦¦¦ 29 " . 181 210 1933 43 250 293 1934 ¦..¦•-. 101 382 483 1935 .;¦.¦¦; 357 V 405 : 762 1936 . .128 .235 363 1937 184 331 515 ¦: 1938 326 612 y , 938 1939 &#132;-'.,'¦' 541 ; - : r 783.. 1,324. | Average 160 ¦ 322 ; 482 ¦ .'Data from Nebraska Staie-Pcderal Division of Agricultural Statistics. forage crop. The leading states in sorghum acreage are Texas, Oklahoma, Kansa::, Nebraska, South Dakota, New Mexico, Missouri, and Colorado. Sorghums are now of much greater importance in Nebraska than they were «yen 10 years ago. Table 1 shows die annual harvested acreage of grain and forage sorghums in Nebraska for the years 1929-39. The recently increased acreage reflects ; the search on the part of farmers for a more 1 Assistant : Agronomist and Agronomist. Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, and Field Assistant,!

The acreage of grain sorghum has increased much more rapidly than that of forage sorghum, probably because a drouth-resistant grain crop has been sought to replace part of the corn acreage. Sorghum also has proved to be more resistant than corn to grasshopper attacks. This has been partly responsible for the increased use of this crop. Finally, the expansion of the sorghum acreage in Nebraska would have been limited had there not been superior varieties available for distribution. Only the development of early - maturing varieties, like Early Kalo and Sooner, by the state experiment stations and the U. S. Department of Agriculture has made possible the northward extension of the sorghum belt. The distribution of the forage sorghum acreage in Nebraska in 1939 is shown in Figure 1. Some sorghum was grown for forage in all parts of the state but most of the acreage was located in the central, south-central, and </seg>
         <seg id="p005">Sorghum Production southwestern counties. Only small acreages were reported from the sand - hills area where little of the land is under cultivation. Grain sorghums were centralized largely in the south-central and southwestern regions of the state as shown in Figure 2. This concentration is further indicated by the fact that 36 per cent of the grain sorghum acreage was in the 18 counties which lie entirely south of the Platte river and west of York, Fillmore, and Thaye: counties. It is particularly in this area of the state, where corn failure; are rather frequent and where certain available sorghum varieties are well adapted, that a further increase in the acreage of grain and forage sorght ms would seem to be justified. V VARIETIES GROWN IN NEBRASKA ¦•¦¦¦¦¦ :"¦¦¦. -I ¦'¦...¦¦•¦..;¦ ;.:¦'.¦ Since many of the varieties of sorghum now grown in this state have been cjnly recently introduced, most growers have not had opportunity to become acquainted with the different types. A better understanding of the types into which the varieties are grouped will result from a review of the following outline and descriptions. 1. Sorgo (stalks sweet). Varieties: Black Amber, Atlas, Early Sumac, Leoti, Red Amber, Orange. / 2. brain sorghum (stalksj not sweet). a. Milo. Varieties: Sooner, Day, Colby, Dwarf Yellow. b. Kafir.

Grass sorghum. Varieties: Sudan grass. ¦ "Sorghum" is the common name applied to a group of annual plants known botanically as Sorghum vulgare Pers. It is used in the same sense as the words corn, wheat, oats; or alfalfa. ¦¦/.'•. "Sorgo" is the name applied to the class of saccharine or sweet-stemmed varieties which are grown primarily for forage and for syrup. "Cane" is often used instead of "sorgo" but since "cane" is properly applied only to the true sugarcane, none of which is grown in Nebraska, the term "sorgo" is much preferred. In general, the stalks are filled with sweet juice and dry slowly when cut. The varieties differ considerably in height, maturity, and head character. The seeds, after removal of the hull, are small to medium sized and are either white or various shades of brown in color. "Grain sorghum" refers to that class of varieties grown primarily for grain and is distinguished from "sorgo" principally by a lower sugar con - tent on the stalks. Because of this and other differences the forage dries more rjapidly when cut. J "Mj\o" is the name of one group of the nonsaccharine or grain-sorghum class. Addition of the word "maize" to "milo" (milo-maize) is unnecessary </seg>
         <seg id="p006">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 329 and confusing. The stalks are relatively dry and are somewhat shorter and more slender than those of kafir. The heads are short, compact, oval-shaped, and have dark-brown chaff, while the seeds are large and yellow 01 white in color. Milo is commonly grown only for grain and is not suited for forage except in the form of winter pasture after the heads have been harvested. The name "kafir" represents another group of the grain-sorghum varieties. The word "corn" is sometimes added to "kafir" (kafir-corn) but the single term "kafir" is preferable. Ordinarily, the kafirs have thick, juicy stalks and grow to a medium height. The heads are cylindrical in shape, varying in compactness, and the hull-free seeds are white, pink, or red, and of medium size. Kafir is grown for both grain and forage. The term "feterita" is applied to a group of the grain-sorghum class having only one variety that is grown in Nebraska. Feterita matures early and has slender, dry stalks, oval compact heads, and large, soft, chalky - white seeds. It is grown for grain only. "Hegari" is the name of a grain-sorghum group represented by only one variety in Nebraska. ]t resembles kafir in general appearance, but is much later and suckers more profusely. Hegari may be grown for both grain and forage. Broomcorn is grown for the brush, which is used in the manufacture of brooms. Since the production in Nebraska is very limited, anil since it is not grown for either grain or forage, it will not be considered further in this bulletin. Sudan grass, since its introduction in 1909, has become very popular in the Great Plains region as an annual pasture crop. It has great value for this purpose but since under certain conditions it causes livestock poisoning, caution should be exercised in its utilization. Tests at the Agricultural Experiment Station at Lincoln have shown that Sudan grass is inferior to sorgo in cured forage production. During an 11-year period, when grown in cultivated rows, it has averaged 2.0 tons per acre compared with 4.4 tons for Atlas sorgo. In a 7-year test it yielded 70 per cent as much as Black Amber sorgo when seeded with a grain drill. Since Sudan grass is recommended primarily for pasture and its pro - duction for this purpose is generally understood, it will not be discussed further in this bulletin. Hybrid derivatives are a group including those varieties that have originated by selection from hybrid material. These differ widely in various characteristics. Descriptive Terms 2 Characteristics of the common varieties of sorghum grown in Nebraska are given in the following descriptions and are summarized in Table 2. A brief discussion of the origin and general nature of each variety is presented 1 Much of the material presented in thii section has been obtained from the following publication!: H. N. Vinall. |.

Certain of the characters used to describe sorghum varieties are constant and sjjecific. Others, however, are variable and may be greatly influenced by environment. Such quantitative characters as time of maturity, height, and stem diameter vary from year to year and it is recognized that their value in descriptions is somewhat limited. But since there are not enough definite characters to distinguish all the varieties it has been necessary to use some of these more variable ones. The following characters are used in the varietal descriptions. '¦. \ .. ; Maturity.—The time of maturity of sorghum varieties is an important characteristic. To a Jarge extent it determines the areas in which a variety can be successfully grown. There is considerable seasonal variation in time of maturity and it is also influenced by time of planting, temperature, day lengthl and drouth. Over a period of years, however, the relative order in time of maturity of the different varieties is comparatively constant. Using the number of days from planting to maturity as the basis for comparison, the following arbitrary classes have been used in the descriptions of varieties: </seg>
         <seg id="p008">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 329 Very early 90 days or less Early 91-100 days Midseason 101-110 days Late 111-120 days Very late 121 days or more Height.—When weather conditions permit sorghum varieties to com - plete their normal development, comparative heights are quite constant. Variations in height, however, are sometimes caused by drouth, thick planting, or other factors which stunt the plants. In the descriptions, the varieties have been grouped in three classes on the basis of their average height over a period of years, as follows: Dwarf 34 inches or less Medium 35-60 inches Tall . . 61 inches or more Stalk diameter.—There are differences in the stalk diameter of sorghum varieties and the stalks are described as thick or slender. In general, late - maturing varieties have thicker stalks than early-maturing ones. Juiciness. —At certain stages of development, all sorghum stalks con - tain a considerable amount of water. But as the plants mature appreciable differences in juiciness become apparent. Juiciness of sorghum stalks is roughly indicated by the appearance of the midrib of the leaf. Midribs of ]iiicy-stalkcd varieties are dull gray in color because of the presence of the juice. Midribs of dry-stalked varieties are white, indicating lack of abundant juice. Since the payability of sorghum stalks seems to be closely associated with the amount of juice, this characteristic is an important one to consider when choosing a variety to grow for forage. Stalks of the varieties herein described are classed as juicy, semijuicy, and dry. Sweetness.—The amount of sugar in the plant juice determines the rel - ative sweetness. It also influences the juiciness of stalks after they have been cut, because juice low in sugar seems to evaporate more rapidly than that high in sugar. The sorgos are generally classed as sweet, the grain sorghums as not sweet. Actual determinations of sugar content were not made but relative sweetness was estimated by taste and the varieties classed as sweet or not sweet. Tillering.—The number of tillers or suckers produced by sorghum is governed largely by the variety but may be influenced by growing condi - tions. Kafirs tend to tiller sparsely under all conditions, whereas milos will tiller sparsely under drouth conditions but profusely when moisture is plentiful. The spacing between plants also influences tillering. The varieties are described as tillering much or little. Leaves.—There is an absolute relationship between the number of leaves produced by a variety and the time required for it to mature. Early varieties have few leaves and late varieties have many. The varieties are classed as leafy, midleafy, and not leafy. Head length.—There are definite differences between varieties in the length of the head or panicle. Head length is described as short, medium, or long. </seg>
         <seg id="p009">Sorghum Production Head erectness.—With the exception of a few varieties, sorghum heads are borne erect on the stalk. Recurving, or "goosenecking," which is char - acteristic of some varieties, is caused by a thick heavy head being forced out the side of the top leaf sheath which results in bending the young soft s|em just below the head. After the bending has occurred the stem becomes stiffened and is permanently recurved. Varieties are described as having erect or recurved heads. J Head density.—The density of the head is determined by the length of the head branches. Heads in which the branches are long appear to be loose ,or open, while those in which the branches are short are compact and tjie seeds appear to be crowded together. In these descriptions heads are classed as loose, semicompact, or compact. . .'-V . Glume pubescence.—The glumes or hulls, which clasp the sorghum seed, jnay be covered with many fine hairs or may be smooth, depending on the variety. Glumes on which the fine hairs are present are said to be pubescent and those which are free of hairs are called glabrous. On some varieties the pubescence tends to become detached from the glumes at maturity and it is the pubescence knocked off in threshing that sometimes makesj this operation so disagreeable. The glumes are described as being pubescent or glabrous. • : Glume,color.—The color of the glumes on mature plants is a rather definite characteristic.. They may be straw colored or white, red, brown, reddish black, or black. •. Awns.—Certain varieties of sorghum are characterized by the presence ol anipwn or beard on the lemma. With the exception of Feterita and Hegari, the awns are readily observed. These two varieties, however, have very short awns which usually do not extend beyond the tips of the glumes. The presence or absence of awns is a character helpful in identifying sorghdm varieties and those described in this bulletin are classed as either awned or awnless. ¦ : : ; ' Kernel size.—Although kernelsize is subject to considerable variation, it is si fficiently constant within a variety to aid in identifications. Based on the ni mber of seeds per pound, the following classes are used: Small ....;.......... .30,000 or more seeds per pound Medium:.;.........,. 17,000-30,000 seeds per pound Large ; 17,000 or fewer seeds per pound ¦ Kernel color.—The kernel colors used in the varietal descriptions are yellow white, pink, chalky white, buff, and reddish brown. Coloring of sorghdm kernels is formed in two distinct layers. Yellow or red pigments are foiind only in the epicarp or outer layer of the seed coat. Beneath the seed coat, next to the endosperm, is a layer of cells which are present only in certain varieties. These cells are called the nucellar layer and when presenj are always colored brown. When color is lacking in the epicarp and the nucellar layer is absent the seeds are white. Yellow or red kernels have pigment in the epicarp and the nucellar layer is absent. Kernels in which the epicarp is pigmented and the nucellar layer is present are buff to </seg>
         <seg id="p010">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 329 reddish-brown in color, while those which have the nucellar layer but no pigment in the epicarp are chalky white. The presence or absence of the nucellar layer is helpful in distinguishing between certain varieties. For example, the kernels of Atlas and Hegari are similar in outward appearance but the nucellar layer is present in Hegari and absent in Atlas. Grain Sorghums Kalo (Fig. 3) originated as a selection from a natural cross between Pink kafir and Dwarf Yellow milo at the Fort Hays Experiment Station at Hays, Kansas. Kalo is capable of giving high yields when conditions are favorable but has produced satisfactory yields even under conditions of severe drouth. The stalks do not make good forage and are likely to lodge if left standing after full maturity. Kalo is susceptible to chinch-bug injury and should not be planted in the southeastern part of the state when chinch-bug infestations are likely to occur. It is best adapted to the south - central area of the state. Description: Plants midseason, medium height; stalks slender, semijuicy, not sweet; tillers little; midlcafy, head medium length, erect, semicompact; glumes pubescent, black; asvned; kernels medium-sized, yellow, often with dark splotches, nucellar layer absent. Early Kalo (Fig. 3) was selected from Kalo at the Fort Hays Experi - ment Station before the hybrid strain from which Kalo was derived had been purified. It closely resembles Kalo except that it is a few days earlier and is several inches shorter in height. Despite its comparative dwarfness, Early Kalo lodges too badly after maturity to be suitable for combine harvesting and it is best harvested by binding or heading. While it does not yield as much under favorable conditions as Kalo, Early Kalo has given excellent results during periods of drouth. It seems to be somewhat less susceptible to chinch bugs than Kalo. Of all the varieties tested by the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station, Early Kalo appears to be best suited for grain production on dry land in most parts of the state. The first large distribution of Early Kalo seed was made in 1937 by the North Platte Substation and it is now one of the most widely grown grain sor - ghums in Nebraska. Description-. Plants early, dwarf to medium height; stalks slender, slightly juicy, nut sweet; tillers little: not leafy; head medium length to long, erect, semicompact; glumes pubescent, straw to reddish straw; both awned and awnlcss types are found in rhc strains now in use: kernels medium-sized, yellow often with dark spots, nucellar layer absent. Sooner milo (Fig. 3) was developed at the Southern Great Plains Field Station, Woodward, Oklahoma. It is widely adapted in Nebraska and is one of the; most important grain-sorghum varieties. Sooner has proved especially promising during years of extreme drouth, but, like the other milos, has a rather high potential yield capacity and can readily respond to more favorable moisture conditions. Although it has sometimes been successfully harvested with a combine, Sooner tends to lodge too badly when left standing after maturity to be satisfactory as a combine type. </seg>

Day milo (Fig. 3) has the same parentage as Sooner and was also develqxd at the Southern Great Plains Field Station. It resembles Sooner except that it does not grow as tall and is a few days later in maturity. Day is sufficiently lodge resistant to permit combining and at the present time is pro! ably the best adapted combine-type for Nebraska conditions. Description: Plants early, dwarf; stalks slender to mid-thick, dry, not sweet; tillers little; not leafy; head short, erect, compact; glumes pubescent, black; awned; kernels medium to large, yellow, nucellar layer absent. • Colby milo was developed from the same cross as Sooner and Day but the purification, testing, and distribution were done at the Colby, Kansas, Substation. It is similar in appearance to Day except that the heads are somewjiat less compact and are exserted further above the top leaf. Colby shows some tendency to produce recurved peduncles. Description: Plants early, dwarf; stalks mid-thick, dry, not sweet; tillers little; not leafy; head medium length, some tendency to recurve, semicompact; glumes pubescent, black; awned; kernels medium to large, yellow, nucellar layer absent. Dwarf Yellow milo has been widely grown in the southern Great Plains |Sorghum belt. It is not adapted to most parts of Nebraska, but, since the milo seeds are all similar and because Dwarf Yellow milo seed is </seg>
         <seg id="p012">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 329 plentiful in the south, it is sometimes sold as Sooner or Wheatland to un - suspecting farmers in this state. The only area of the state where Dwarf Yellow milo can be expected to mature safely is that portion subject to chinch-bug infestations and since the variety is susceptible to chinch bugs, it is of little value in Nebraska. Description: Plants late, medium height; stalks mid-thick, scmijuicy to dry, not swirl; tillers much; iniil-lcafy; heads medium length, often recurved, compact; glumes pubescent, reddish brown to black; awned; kernels large, yellow, nuccllar layer absent Western Blackhull kafir (Fig. 4) is widely grown in Kansas and prob - ably all of this variety that is used in Nebraska has been introduced from that state. Western Blackhull has produced excellent yields in the south - eastern part of the state but it will not mature grain consistently in the western and southwestern regions because of the shorter season and lower rainfall in those areas. It is grown primarily for grain but the stalks are often utilized as forage. Description: Plants late, medium height; stalks mid-thick to thick, semi-juicy, not sweet; tillers little; leafy; head medium length, erect, semi-compact; glumes pubescent, black &lt;&gt;r brownish black; awnless; kernels mid-size, white with reddish brown to black spots, nuccllar layer absent. Pink kafir (Fig. 4) was selected at the Fort Hays, Kansas, Experiment Station from material originally introduced from Africa. It has given good yields of grain and forage at Lincoln when drouth was not severe. Be - cause of its late maturity it is best adapted to the southeastern part of the state, although it has been successfully grown as far west as Phelps county. Description: Plants lare, medium height; stalks mid-thick, semijuicy to dry, not sweet; tillers little; leafy; head long, erect, scmicompact; glumes pubescent or partly pubescent, straw colored; awnless; kernels small to medium size, pink or nearly white, usually with some dark brown or red spots, nuccllar layer absent except for thin remnants. Club (Fig. 5) was selected from a row of Dawn kafir at the Fort Hays, Kansas, Experiment Station. It has given good yields in eastern Nebraska but is unsatisfactory at North Platte because it will not mature consistently. Club usually fails to head when growth is retarded by drouth but is quick to respond to late rainfall. Its resistance to chinch bugs suggests that Club may be useful in the southeastern part of the state where these pests are sometimes troublesome. Description: Plants midscason to late; medium height; stalks mid-thick, scmijuicy, not sweet; tillers much; leafy; head short, erect, compact; glumes pubescent, black; awnless; kernels medium-sized to large, white with reddish black spots near the tips, nuccllar layer absent. Cheyenne (Fig. 5) (sometimes called "Sweet Stalk") was developed by Albert Weaver of Bird City, Kansas. It is an early-maturing variety that has found considerable popularity as a dual-purpose type, even though the stalks are lacking somewhat in juiciness and sweetness. Cheyenne frequently lodges soon after ripening and it is susceptible to kernel smut. It is best adapted in the western third of the state where early maturity is of importance. </seg>

Description: Plants very early, medium height; stalks slender, scmijuicy, not sweet; tillers little; not leafy; heads long, erect, loose; glumes pubescent, black; awnless; kernels while, sometimes with reddish black spots, nucellar layer absent. Feterita (Fig. 4) was one of the first grain sorghums grown in Ne - braska, early introductions having been made in the period between 1905 and 1910. It is fairly well adapted in this state but often gives poor stands because the soft seeds rot quickly in cold, wet soil. Feterita stalks do not make good forage although they are sometimes used for that purpose. Description: Plants midseason, medium height; stalks slender, dry, not sweet; tillers much; not leafy; heads short, erect, compact; glumes pubescent, usually black but may be straw colored or reddish brown; short tip awns; kernels very large, chalky white, usually with red and black spots, nucellar layer present. Hegari (Fig. 4) came into prominence in Nebraska as an emergency crop in 1935 because of the shortage of other sorghum seed. Very little grain was matured that year, but on many farms it produced considerable forage. When grown on dry land in Nebraska, Hegari has given very erratic results. In years when rainfall is abundant it has given good grain yields, but during seasons of severe drouth it has rarely matured grain. It yields well when grown under irrigation, but should probably not be planted for grain on dry land except when seed of better adapted varieties is not obtainable. Description: Plants late to very late, medium height; stalks thick, semijuicy, slightly sweet; tillers much; leafy; head short to medium length, erect, semicompact; glumes pubescent, black to reddish black; short tip awns; kernels medium sized, white with rcddjsh brown to black spots, nucellar layer present. Grohorna originated in Oklahoma, and its parentage is somewhat in doubt. The variety received much unjustified promotion about ten years ago and is still grown to a limited extent in several states. Grain from Grohoma is not of good quality and yields have not been promising. Grohoma is not recommended for any part of Nebraska. Description: Plants late, medium height; stalks thick, semijuicy, slightly sweet; tillers much; leafy; head long, sometimes poorly exserted from the top leaf, erect, semi - compact; glumes pubescent, black to reddish black; awnless; kernels medium sized to large, buff or light brown, nucellar layer present. Wheatland miJo is grown to a limited extent in Nebraska, but because of its relatively late maturity, is not widely adapted. Wheatland is a combine type that was developed from a cross between kafir and milo at the South - ern Great Plains Field Station, Woodward, Oklahoma. It is lodge resistant but chinch-bug susceptible. Description: Plants midseason to late, dwarf; stalks mid-thick, scmijuicy to dry, not sweet; tillers much; mid-leafy; head medium length to long, erect, scmicompact;glumes pubescent, dark reddish brown; awnless; kernels large, pale yellow to yellow, nucellar layer absent. </seg>

Sorgos .. ¦ Atlas sorgo (Fig. 6) was developed at the Kansas Agricultural Experi - ment Station at Manhattan from material supplied by I. N. Farr of Stock - ton, Kansas, who had found a field cross between Sourless sorgo and Blackhull kafir. In Atlas have been combined the tall, sweet, juicy stalks of Sourless sorgo and the white, palatable seed and lodge resistance of Blackball kafir. Atlas may truly be called a dual-purpose variety since both the grain and forage are of excellent quality. Atlis is the best forage sorghum variety for eastern Nebraska. Over a period of years at Lincoln, it has given a higher average yield of forage than aiy other variety tested. It is superior to other sorgos in quality of seed ai id lodge resistance, and it is one of the varieties most resistant to chinch bugs. Atlas requires a long growing season but it will ripen under eastern-Nebraska conditions if growth is not retarded too long by drouth. Further west in the state it will not mature seed consistently except under irrigation and as far west as North Platte it probably cannot be depended upon to mature, even under irrigation, except in years when the growing season is unusually long. However, its superior forage yield has been demonstrated at North Platte and it is likely that it may be grown profitably </seg>

Leoti produces forage of excellent quality and is sufficiently early in maturity to be well adapted in the central, southwestern, and western parts of the state. It is susceptible to smut and lodges severely under certain conditions although it is more lodge resistant than Black Amber. Description: Plants midscason, tall; stalks mid-thick to thick, juicy, sweet; tillers iiukli: niuMcaty; head medium length, erect, scmicompact with the upper branches of iht luad dronpinj:; glumes usually glabrous except near tip and base, dull yellowish nil: awncil; kernels medium sized, bull, nucellar layer present. Black Amber sorgo (Fig. 6) was probably one of the first sorghum vanities to Ire grown in Nebraska and is still widely used in the northern and western parts of the state. In general, Black Amber is fairly productive but it may now be replaced with superior varieties except where earliness is essential. Black Amber seeds are usually enclosed in heavy, black glumes and, because of this, stands are more easily secured than with most other varieties. Black Amber stalks are rather slender and may lodge severely where the growth is heavy. Description: Plants early, tall; stalks slender to mid-thick, juicy, sweet; tillers much; not Icaly; head medium length, erect, loose; glumes glabrous or only slightly pubescent, htack; both awneil and awnlcss types arc found; kernels mid-sized, buff or reddish hri'wn, nuccllar layer present. Red Amber sorgo is almost identical with Black Amber except that the glumes are red instead of black. There is an appreciable acreage of Red Amber grown in Nebraska and much of the so-called "Honey Drip" is really Red Amber or Red and Black Amber mixed. Early Sumac sorgo (Fig. 6) was selected from Standard Sumac at the Fort Hays F.xpcriment Station, Hays, Kansas. It is slightly later than the Ambers and has given higher yields where it will mature satisfactorily. Early Sumac tends to lodge and is susceptible to head and kernel smut. It is adapted to the same general regions as Leoti. Description: Plants midscason, tall; stalks mid-thick, juicy, sweet; tillers much; Icaly; head short, erect, compact; glumes thinly pubescent, black to reddish brown; awnlcss; kernels very small, dark reddish brown, nucellar layer present. Orange sorgo (Fig. 5) is probably a selection from one of the early African introductions. It is one of the varieties of lesser importance in Nebraska, although it is grown to some extent in the southern and south - western parts. Description: Plants midscason to late, tall; stalks mid-thick, juicy, sweet; tillers nnn.li: Icaly; head medium length, erect, scmicompact; glumes usually pubescent but sometimes glabrous, straw-colored to reddish brown; awnlcss; kernels mid-sized, deep reddish brown although sometimes lighter, nucellar layer present. </seg>

These factors must be considered when deciding what variety is to be grown* {". ¦ The degree of adaptation or suitability of a variety for the prevailing conditions of .climate may determine to a large extent its performance in any given locality. In Nebraska the gradual northward and westward </seg>
         <seg id="p018">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 329 reduction in summer temperatures and length of growing season, and the westward decrease in rainfall require a corresponding change to smaller and earlier-ripening varieties. Furthermore, some of the varieties that mature satisfactorily in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas are too large and late for Nebraska. It has been recently established at this stattion that varieties normally grown under the relatively short days of the south require more time to mature in the north where the days of the growing season are materially longer. Sorghum is a warm weather crop and does best where summer temperatures are relatively high. In case of serious moisture deficiency, the plants tend to develop more slowly and maturity may thereby be delayed several weeks. This suggests additional care to avoid using types that are too late and may be caught prematurely by fall frosts. In general sorghum may be grown successfully on all types of soil where other standard cereal crops thrive. It has some tolerance for alkaline or salty soils. Under some conditions varietal resistance to diseases and insect pests means the difference between good yields and complete failure. Ease and economy of harvesting are influenced by lodge-resistance, height, erectness of head, stem-diameter, and tillering. The quality of grain and forage that is produced by a variety will help to determine its value. There are striking differences in these respects. The value of a variety can not be measured entirely by its yield. Some varieties are capable of high production but have undesirable characters that make them unsuitable for the purpose under consideration. However, since yield over a period of years is to be regarded as the response of a variety to the sum of the factors of the environment, it is an important index to the value of the variety in question. Variety Yields at Lincoln A number of sorghum varieties have been tested in comparison with corn on the Experiment Station farm at Lincoln for 13 years, 1925-39, with 1926 and 1933 omitted. The usual care was taken to provide uniform field management and to reduce yields to a uniform moisture content. The tests have been in four-row plots replicated from two to four times, and the acre yields have been computed from the yields of the two middle rows. Previous to 1937 all planting was done at a single date but beginning in 1937 four replications have been planted on May 25 and four on June 5. The yields for 1937, 1938, and 1939 are the averages for the two dates of planting. Uniform stands have been obtained by thinning to the desired spacing while the plants arc in the seedling stage. Average grain and forage yields obtained from varieties tested during the 13-year period are reported in Figures 7 and 8. During this period the average annual precipitation has been 23.5 inches compared with the 61-year average of 27.1 inches reported by the Lincoln station of the U. S. Weather Bureau. In only three of the 13 years, 1931, 1932, and 1938, was the annual precipitation greater than normal, which indicates that these tests have been made during a rather consistently dry period. </seg>

' The two grain sorghum varieties, Pink kafir and Feterita, have yielded an average of 27.5 and 22.4 bushels of grain per acre, respectively. Poor stands in some of the earlier years were responsible in part for the com - paratively low yield of Feterita. There is not a significant difference be - tween the grain yields of Atlas sorgo and Black Amber sorgo but the Atlas grain is more palatable and has. a higher feed value. The standard local corn variety known as Hogue Yellow Dent was grown in the sorghum test previous to 1936. Beginning in 1936 a locally adapted strain of Krug was used.' Kll of the five sorghum varieties yielded more grain than corn, and Pink kafir, which has the highest average yield, produced almost 50 per cent more than corn. These data indicate that during periods of deficient precipitation, adapted varieties of sorghum will produce appreciably more grain than corn, even in eastern Nebraska. . In Figure 8 are given average yields of cured forage from four sorghum varieties and corn during this same 13-year period. In general it may be concluded that Atlas and similar varieties of sorgo will yield approximately twice sis much forage per acre as corn. The superiority of Atlas for forage </seg>

It has yielded considerably more than Kansas Orange and Black Amber and is also superior to these varieties in grain quality and lodge resistance. In 1932 a number of improved varieties were introduced for testing. The more promising of these have been tested each year since, with the exception of 1933 when unfavorable soil conditions at planting time resulted in unsatisfactory stands. The seven-year period in which these varieties have been tested has been extremely unfavorable for crop produc - tion. Average annual precipitation for the period is 21.7 inches compared with the long-time average of 27.1 inches. Thus there has been an average annual precipitation deficiency of 5.4 inches, or a total deficiency of 37.8 inches for the seven-year period. Eighty-one per cent of this deficiency has occurred during the growing season since the average precipitation for the months of April to September has been 4.4 inches less than the long-time average. Temperatures during the growing season have also been unfavorable in the years for which yields are reported. Mean tempera - tures for July and August, the months in which sorghum is heading and corn tasseling, have averaged 5.7 and 4.0 degrees higher during the seven - year period than for the years 1887-1939. Annual and average grain yields for the seven-year period 1932 and 1934-39 are presented in Table 3. Despite the unfavorable conditions pre - vailing during these years, some of the sorghum varieties produced satis - factory yields. Early Kaio was the highest-yielding variety with an average of 22.3 bushels per acre, while Atlas was the lowest with 13.2 bushels per acre. Corn, in these same tests, yielded an average of 10.0 bushels per acre. Following Early Kalo were Feterita, Sooner, and Kalo with average yields </seg>

Early Kalo, Sooner, and Day each failed twice during the same period. The data indicate that in seasons when precipitation is low and temr.erat.ures high, sorghums can produce considerably more grain than corn As a seven-year average, the seven highest-yielding varieties, Early Kalo 1. Feterita, Sooner, Kalo, Day, Club, and Black Amber, have produced slightly more than twice as much grain as corn. For consistent yielding ability, in spite of adverse conditions, early-maturing varieties are superior to tljose of late maturity. The average yield of the four earliest-maturing varieties, Early Kalo, Sooner, Day, and Black Amber, was 20.5 bushels per acre, compared with 16.4. bushels as an average for Atlas, Pink kafir, Wesern Blackhull, and Club, the four latest-maturing varieties in the test. A return to more normal moisture conditions may favor the later - matiring varieties, although limited data suggest that even when conditions are favorable early maturity is advantageous. : V Cured forage yields of six sorghum varieties and.of corn averaged for the period, 1932 and 1934-39, are shown in Figure 10.

Day was the shortest-variety in the test, averaging 28 inches in height, as compared with the tallest variety, Black Amber, which averaged 69 inchesj In general the kafirs were intermediate in height while the sorgos were taller. Early Kalo and Day tillered less than the other varieties, each having an average of 137 stalks per plant. In contrast, Hegari averaged 2.07 stalks per plant and it was followed closely by Feterita with 1.83 and Atlas with 1.77. There was a tendency for the sorgos to tiller more than the grain sorghums and, as a group, the kafirs tillered least. Tillering is greatly influenced, among other things, by moisture, and the low average number of stal ss per plant for all varieties may be attributed to the deficiency of precipitation during the past three years. . - There was no appreciable lodging of any of the 16 varieties in 1937 and 1938, so that the three-year averages represent lodging that occurred in 1939. Much of this lodging was occasioned by chinch-bug injury, although a high| wind in early September was'also a factor. Sooner averaged 20 per cent lodged stalks, which indicates its chinch-bug susceptibility. Club, Hegari, and Wheadand did not lodge in any of the three years, while Day, Western Blackhull, and Atlas showed only a trace of lodging. As would be expected, those varieties in which the glumes remain attached to the seed after threshing gave the lowest test weights.

Three varieties, Early Kalo, Pink kaiir, and Atlas, each gave average test weights of 57 pounds per bushel. The data in Table 3 also enable a comparison of the yields of Leoti, Hegari, Cheyenne, and Kansas Orange, which were not grown in all of the years reported in Table 2. During this period, Club has given the highest yield with an average of 23.4 bushels per acre. It is followed by Kalo, Black Amber, Early Kalo, and Feterita with average yields of 23.0, 22.7, 22.0, and 21.3 bushels per acre, respectively. The average yield of Sooner is somewhat less, principally because of the low yield produced in 1939 as a result of chinch-bug injury. For the three-year period, corn has an average yield of 0.8 bushel per acre. No grain was produced in 1937 and 1938, and there was a yield of only 2.5 bushels in 1939.

During the 28-yeaF period, 1907-34, annual precipitation of less than 13 inches was recorded in only two years, 1910 and 1931. In 1937 and 1939, when the average precipitation was less than 13 inches, sorghums growing on cropped land were near failures while in these same years, grain sorghums on fal - lowed jland averaged 32.3 bushels of grain and forage sorghums averaged 3.6 tons per acre of forage. The average grain yields of Substation White corn and six varieties of grain sorghum for the three-year period 1937-39 are shown graphically in Figure^ 12. During this period Day yielded slightly more than Early Kalo (Fig. 13) while Early Kalo produced nearly three times as much grain as corn under these adverse conditions. Highland averaged 3.5 bushels less than Early Kalo during this period. During the six years 1933-39, Early Kalo averaged 20.5 bushels or 131 per cent of corn. Club kafir yielded 38.9 bushels during this three-year period. This variety, Kalo, and Wheatland are too late in maturing to be safe varieties to grojv at North PJatte. The first frost in the fall of each of these three years was later than normal. : . For. the two-year period 1938-39, the yields in bushels per acre of the following varieties were: Early Kalo 34.1, Sooner 31.2, Day 37.9, Colby 30.4, Highk nd 29.4, and Improved Coes 34.5. Average forage yields of corn and six varieties of sorghum are shown for the five-year period 1935-39 in Figure 14.

Leoti and Early Sumac were superior to Black Amber in yielding ability and they mature safely in an average season. Leoti is considered the best forage variety grown in the test. : Cheyenne is usually grown as a dual-purpose variety. Its forage is inferio' to that of Leoti but in most years it will produce a fair yield of grain.' Improved Coes is also considered a dual-purpose variety. Its forage </seg>

These tests have been conducted cooperatively by the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station and interested fanners. They have been located in all parts of the state and during the past three years resuli s have been secured from a total of 109 tests. After one year of testing it W£s obvious that certain varieties were not adapted to all parts of the state. Therefore the state was divided into four regions, the boundaries of whici are indicated in Figure 15. Different.varieties were assembled.for the tests in each region so that only those which showed promise were included. Grain yields of varieties that have been tested throughout the threeiyear period are summarized by regions in Figure 15. Ir: Region! I, the southeastern part of the state, results have been ob - tained from 16 tests. Kalo and Early Kalo have produced the highest average yields in this region. A moderately severe chinch-bug infestation in some parts of the region in 1939 tended to lower the average yields, especi - ally cf Sooner and Day. Pink kafir, in spite of its chinch-bug resistance, has yielded less than these two varieties, probably because its late maturity has been a disadvantage during drouth years. Of the two forage varieties, Leoti has yielded more grain than Atlas. R:gion 11, including the central, south-central, and southwestern parts of th: state, contains a large percentage of the grain sorghum acreage in Nebraska. Grain yields from eight varieties in 43 tests have been obtained in this region; The superiority of Early Kalo and Sooner is indicated by the fact that, each yielded 21.9 bushels per acre, almost 4 bushels more than </seg>

Kalo and Cheyenne yielded (ess than Day but appreciably more than Leoti, Early Sumac, and Atlas, j In Region HI Sooner yielded only slightly more than Early Kalo, while Day yielded about four bushels less than these varieties. They were followed in order by Cheyenne, Black Amber, and Leoti. Over much of this region the snort growing season does not permit the common sorghum varieties to mature. This accounts, at least in part, for the low yields reported. In general, conditions in Region IV are relatively favorable for crop production. As an average of 24 tests, Early Kalo has yielded 34.7 bushels per acre, followed by Kalo, Sooner, Day, and Hegari, which have yielded 33.1, 32.9, 28.9, and 26.3 bushels per acre, respectively. Average grain yields of the j three sorgbs were 18.2 bushels for Leoti, .16.2 bushels for AtlasL and 14.6 bushels for Early Sumac. i { RECOMMENDED VARIETIES Regional adaptation and: the intended utilization are factors in the recommendation of varieties for farm production. It is usually not advisable to depend upon a single variety for both grain and forage as those most productive of grain commonly yield forage of inferior quality and palatability. The state has been divided into four regions, and recom - mencations are made by regions, keeping in mind the fact that 'the boundaries are somewhat arbitrary and flexible. For the reason thatlno one variety has proved consistently best in any one region, several 'are suggested and final choice will rest with the grower. It is often advisable to pi int two or more varieties of somewhat different type on the same farm to take advantage of seasonal differences in climatic conditions. For exaimle, in Region II Early Kalo, which has demonstrated its ability to prodi cc grain! under unfavorable moisture conditions, might be planted on p:rt of the acreage and Western Blackhull, which has a high potential yield capacity when conditions are favorable, could be planted on the remainder. ¦ ¦'¦¦;¦¦ ': .; .; The recommendations for each of the.four regions, as shown in Figure 16,. are based on Varietal performance in Experiment Station tests at Lin - coln and North Platte and in cooperative tests located throughout the state. A return of more favorable moisture conditions may justify changes in present recommendations. "J.; Region I.—ln general, the later-maturing varieties, such as Pink kafir, Club, and Western Blackhull, are best for grain. Under some conditions, for ci ample a long series of drouth years or following an early-summer hail storm, the use of earlier varieties would be advantageous. Varieties which are susceptible to chinch bugs should not be used when chinch-bug in - festations are likely to occur. On the average, Atlas is unsurpassed for forage, although Leoti may sometimes be more satisfactory in the western and northern parts of the region. Region ll.—Early Kalo and Sooner may be used for grain production in all parts of this region, as may Day and Colby when a combine type is </seg>
         <seg id="p030">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 329 desired. Kalo and Western Blackhull are somewhat later in maturity and are suggested primarily for the southern and eastern parts of the region. Chinch-bug infestations may occur in the southeastern area of Region II in which case it would be inadvisable to plant chinch-bug-susceptible varieties. The choice of a variety for forage production will rest largely with the individual, although it should be noted that Leoti and Black Amber have matured seed more consistently than Early Sumac and Atlas. Region DDL—In the southern and northeastern parts of this legion Early Kalo and Sooner are sufficiently early to mature satisfactorily. The western and northwestern areas, however, have such a short growing season that only the earliest varieties will mature. Preliminary testing indicates that for these areas Improved Coes and Highland are best adapted for grain production. Black Amber may be successfully grown in all of Region 111 and Leoti and Early Sumac are suitable in the southern and eastern parts. Region IV.—ln most parts of this region grain sorghums will probably not be of great importance, because of the relative dependability of corn. However, in certain parts of the region they may regularly be used to ad - vantage and in other parts they may have value as a catch crop. Early Kalo, Kalo, Sooner, and Day are the best adapted grain sorghum varieties, while Atlas, Leoti, Early Sumac, or Black Amber may be used for forage. SEED SELECTION AND TREATMENT Sorghum seed should be kept as free from mixtures as possible. The crop planted from impure seed is variable in height, maturity, head shape, and seed color, thus making harvesting more difficult and lowering the quality. All types and varieties of sorghum hybridize freely with each other, making it difficult to maintain purity when two or more kinds are grown in close proximity. Whenever possible, the seed field should be iso - lated from other sorghum, and the further precaution taken of selecting well-filled, mature, typical heads from healthy plants of uniform height. Field selection should be even more rigidly practiced where isolation can not be provided. Removal of hybrid or off-type plants from the fields aids in keeping the seed pure. All sorghum seed should be treated for the control of kernel smut and and certain fungi that cause rotting of planted seed. Treatment with copper carbonate dust at the rate ot 2 to 3 ounces per bushel of seed or with New Improved Ceresan at the rate of Vi ounce per bushel will effectively control this smut and often improves the field germination. These dusts may be applied to the seed with a treating machine, barrel churn, or by shaking the seed and dust together in a closed can. Seed treated with copper carbonate may be stored indefinitely but when treated with New Improved Ceresan it should be planted within four weeks after treating as otherwise the germina - tion may be injured. Caution: Copper carbonate and mercury (New Im - proved Ceresan) dusts are poisonous to man and to farm animals. </seg>
         <seg id="p031">Sorghum Production SEEDBED PREPARATION AND PLANTING • The principal objectives of seedbed preparation for sorghums are to kill weecs, conserve moisture, and to pulverize and warm soil. Warming is particularly essential because sorghum seed germinates poorly when the soil is co|d. Weed control is also important because sorghum plants grow slowly during the early stages of their development and it is much easier to kill weeds before seeding than after the small plants have emerged. Any prac - tical procedure of preparing the seedbed that accomplishes these objectives is satisfactory. 1 ests to determine the merits of different methods of seedbed preparation have been conducted at the Experiment Station for three years, 1937-39. Five methods have been used and all of them can be accomplished with the machinery usually found on farms. They are as follows; (I) The field is blank listed in the fall. When weed growth begins in the sjpring the ridges are thrown in with a listed-corn cultivator. Should it be necessary to kill a second crop of weeds before planting, either a disk harrow or a one-way disk can be used effectively. When it is time to plant, the furrows made in tne fall are reopened and the seed is dropped at the sametime. : " , . &#132;..-.. / !¦'..' : ¦ (|J).

The field is disked in the spring and is listed at the time of planting. On the whole, conditions at the time of planting have been unusually favorable for the germination of sorghum seed during the. years of these testsJ The soil has warmed early in the spring and has not been excessively mois^. As a result, all the methods have given satisfactory stands and the gravest differences have been in yield. Average grain yields of Kalo from the five methods are presented in Table 5.

         <seg id="p032">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 329 yielded 21.8 bushels compared with 20.5 bushels from blank listing in the early spring with the ridges split at planting. Early spring listing, with the ridges later thrown in and the old furrows reopened at planting, yielded 18.8 bushels as against 18.6 bushels from surface planting on plowed land. The lowest average yield, 17.8 bushels, was produced by listing at the time of planting in soil that had previously been disked. There are several reasons why blank listing in the fall with the ridges thrown in and reopened at the time of planting is to be recommended. First, with this method the furrows lie open during the winter and early spring, facilitating moisture accumulation and warming of the soil. Second, control of weeds, both before and after planting, is usually more readily accomplished than when other methods of seedbed preparation are used. Third, the listing may serve as a control for soil blowing in certain areas. Although the method has given satisfactory results in most instances, a few precautions should be noted. It is usually not advisable to fall list sandy soils since they may thereby be made more susceptible to blowing. It is, however, often possible to blank list such soils in the early spring and when this is done the subsequent procedures are the same as those followed when the blank listing is done in the fall. In either case, the reopened furrows should be relatively broad and somewhat shallower than at the first opening. Reopening of the furrows at the time of planting can best be done with a loose-ground lister or a corn planter equipped with furrow openers. A mold - board lister may also be used for this operation but when it is, particular care should be exercised to make the furrows shallow. Ordinarily the soil is comparatively loose when the furrows are reopened and under such condi - tions the moldboard lister will usually not scour. Thus, if the furrows are deep they will be rather narrow and the steep sides are apt to wash down and cover the seed in case oi heavy rains. The lister ridges should be thrown in long enough in advance of planting so that the weeds which are covered will be killed. Usually rains may be expected before planting which will settle the loose soil and aid in reopening old furrows. Blank listing in the fall or early spring and splitting the ridges at the time of planting is praticed to some extent. Usually it does not give as good results as when the ridges are thrown in and the old furrows reopened at the time of planting. It can sometimes be used to good advantage, how - ever, as a modification of this method. In some seasons the soil in die lister ridges is too dry to provide favorable conditions for seed germination when it is thrown into the furrows and later nosed out. In such a situation it is advisable to split the ridges rather than to use the other method. Plowing, followed by thorough tillage, is a satisfactory method so far as getting stands is concerned. When handled in this way planting is done with a surface planter or with a planter equipped with furrow openers. The principal disadvantages of the method are that it is more expensive than listing and weed control is often more difficult where the crop is surface - planted. When sorghums are to be grown for hay they may be planted with a grain drill in soil that has been plowed and worked into good condition. </seg>

Listing in soil that has been disked in the spring (Fig. 17) is a common practice, but is often responsible for poor stands, due to seed rotting in the cold soil. The best weed control in sorghum fields is done before the crop is planted. The destruction of several crops of weeds by early and thorough tillage in connection with seedbed preparation greatly reduces the likelihood of a serious weed problem after the plants are up. Sorghum grows slowly at best, and cultural practices that control weeds, hasten the early growth of the sdrghum plants, and fit in with other farm practices, are to be recom - mend cd. .¦¦'¦: DATE OF PLANTING '.'¦' Sc rghum is a hot-weather crop. It originated in the tropics and even after iiany years of improvement, few varieties grow well in cool climates. For ti lis reason, planting should be delayed until the soil is warm enough to insure good seed germination and rapid emergence of the plants. FAr three years, 1937-39, an experiment has been conducted at Lincoln to de ermine the effect of date of planting on yield and other characters of soighum.' Four representative varieties differing as to type, Sooner, Kalo, Black Amber,land Atlas, have been planted in four-row plots on May 15, May 15, June 5, and June 15. Determinations of yield and other characters have been made only on the two center rows and each treatment has been replicated four times. Comparable stands were obtained by thinning in the seedling stage. The results from this experiment are reported in Table 6.

In comparison, emergence occurred in six days when planting was done on June 15. The number of days required depends largely upon temperature, provided other conditions are favorable. For example, during the three years, the mean daily temperature for the period of May 15 to May 24 averaged 67.8 T. as compared with an average of 78.6° F. for the period June 15 to June 24. In addition to being more rapid, the emergence from the later dates of planting was more uniform and the seedlings appeared to be somewhat more vigorous. As indicated by the number of days from planting to heading, the plants required less time to complete their vegetative development when planted late than when planted early. Atlas planted on June 15 required 14 days less than when planted on May 15. The other varieties responded in like manner. Part of this difference is accounted for by the more rapid emer - gence and plant development at the higher temperatures accompanying planting on June 15. The changing length of day under which the plants were grown undoubtedly also had an effect. Those planted on May 15 </seg>
         <seg id="p035">...-. Sorghum Production were physiologically receptive to photoperiodic effect at a time when day lengths were becoming greater and approaching the maximum. However, those planted on June 15 were in this receptive condition at a time when the days were becoming shorter, and were thereby induced to head in fewer days. [' Date of planting apparently had little effect on tillering. Some varieties tiller slightly more when planted on May 15, but there were no appreciable differences for those planted on May 25, June 5, and June 15. The number of barren stalks, as indicated by the percentage of stalks bearing heads, was not influenced greatly. In no case was the difference greater than 12 per cent and there was no consistent association between barrenness and date of planting. There was a tendency for plants to be slightly taller at the later plant - ing pates. Kalo, for example, averaged 39 inches in height when planted on May 15 as compared with an average of 46 inches on June 15. The same trend was noted with Black Amber and Atlas but the average height of Sooner was somewhat less at the June 15 planting than at the May 15. In general there was a close relationship between acre grain yields and the yield of grain per plant. The latter varied directly with head size. That is, the yield of grain per plant was determined riot by the amount of tillering but by head size. Thus the effect of date of planting on acre grain yields was exerted largely through head size." On the average, the amount of grain per head increased with delay of planting. Forage yields tended to be greater from late planting than from early. Yields of Kalo and Black Amber were consistently higher for the later dates, while Atlas and Sooner yielded slightly less for June 15 than for June 5. The data indicate that there is no advantage in planting sorghum for forage previous to June 5 at Lincoln. - Results show that there is a definite disadvantage in planting as early as May 15 for grain production. The lowest grain yields of Sooner, Kalo, and Black Amber were produced when planting was done on this date. Sooner and Black Amber each gave the highest yield when planted on June 5, wjhile Kalo has produced its highest and about equal yields when planted on May 25 and June 15, : A moderately severe infestation of chinch bugs in 1939. reduced the yields for that year and lowered the relative yields from the Tune 15 date of planting. While, the data show some inconsistency, probably because they represent only a few years of testing, they suggest that the optimum date of planting at Lincoln is about June 5. Data obtained from another test at Lincoln in 1939 indicate that injury from chinch! bugs can be minimized by early planting. Four varieties, Higiland, Sooner, Kalo, and Atlas, were planted at 10-day intervals from Apr 1 15 to July 24. The average grain yield of the four varieties increased wit! delay in planting until May 25 when the highest yield was obtained (Figure 18).| The yield then dropped rapidly, the average for the June 4 planting being only 7.5 bushels per acre compareoV-with 123 for May 25.

Although chinch bugs will attack sorghum plants in any stage of development, older plants are damaged less than young ones. 3 Thus when the chinch bugs began to migrate into the sorghum field, the plants from early planting were larger and better able to withstand their attacks. The average percentage of plants killed in the crop from the various planting dates is also shown in Figure 18. When chinch bugs are likely to be present in damaging numbers it is advisable to plant somewhat earlier than would ordinarily be recommended. By so doing it is possible to at least partially avoid some of the damage that may be done by these insects. As a general rule, sorghum should be planted about 10 days or two weeks later than the normal time for planting corn. In most parts of Nebraska this will be in late May and early June. </seg>

As a result of this diversity in manner of planting and because of differences in seed germination, varietal differences in size of seed, size of plant, and response to different spacings, and because of the great variation in growing conditions in Nebraska, many factors need be taken into con - sideration when deciding as to the amount of seed per acre that should be used in planting sorghum. .....' : Cultivated Rows In order to determine the effect of plant spacing within the row on yield and other characters fbur representative sorghum varieties, ranging from small and early to large and late types, have been grown with six different spacings at the Agricultural Experiment Station at Lincoln for three years, 1937J39. All jplantings (have been in four-row plots, with each treatment replicated three times, (and determinations of yield and other agronomic characters have been made only on the two middle rows. The desired spacings were obtained] by planting at a thick rate and thinning by hand after the plants had emerged. The results from this experiment are sum - marized in Table 7. . ;¦¦¦. v . Plants have headed slightly earlier when widely spaced than when closely spaced but it is/doubtful if the differences are great enough to pro - duce significant differe/ices in time of maturity. : Sjorghum varieties j exhibit distinctive tillering responses at various spacings. Of the varieties included in this experiment, Atlas showed the greatest tendency tq tiller at the wide spacings while Pink kafir showed the ieast. The responses of Early Kalo and Kalo were intermediate. In - vestigators at' other stations have found that milos tend to tiller much mor&lt;: profusely in thin stands than kafirs. 4 Since Kalo and Early Kalo were developed from a cross between milo and kafir it might be expected that they would tiller less than milos but more than kafirs. Although milo was not included in this test, the differences in tillering evident when Early Kale and Kalo are compared with Pink kafir indicate that this is the case. Because tillering helps the plant become adjusted to differences in spacing, it is evident that, other things being equal, varieties which tiller profusely will produce higher yields at wide spacings than varieties which tiller sparsely. ':¦¦•':.-. : ' The relative number of barren stalks is indicated by the percentage of stalks that bore heads.

There was a very definite correlation of barrenness with time of maturity and plant size. The small, early-maturing varieties produced fewer barren stalks at all spacings than the large, late ones. When sorghum is grown for fodder or hay the diameter of the stalk is an important character, since small stalks are consumed by livestock more readily and completely than large ones. There were progressive in - creases in stalk diameter with wider spacings between plants. Average stalk diameters of Pink kafir and Atlas, which are often grown for fodder, ranged from 0.65 and 0.72 inch at the 2-inch spacing to 0.97 and 0.95 inch at the 18-inch spacing, respectively. Early Kalo stalks averaged 0.60 inch </seg>
         <seg id="p039">¦¦•;¦ SORGHUM PRODUCTION in diameter at the 2-inch spacing as compared with 0.87 inch at the 18-inch spicing. There is some indication that sorghum plants are less likely to lodge at wide spacings than at close ones. This may be partly due to the larger stalks and partly because soil moisture is probably not exhausted as rapidly by widely spaced plants. [There was a tendency toward increased height with increases in distance between plants. The trend was consistent in all three years, and was probably a result of insufficient moisture to permit the plants to reach their maximum development at the close spacings. The amount of grain produced by a single plant was greater with an increase in space between plants. This was a result of greater tillering and ah increase in head size at the wider spacings. Kalo and Pink kafir pro - duced about five times as much grain per plant at the 18-inch spacing as at :he 2-inch, and the increases of Early Kalo and Atlas were nearly as large. The adjustment in tillering previously discussed and the response in head size account for the greater yield per plant and the maintenance of acre grain yields at wide spacing, even though the plant population was relatively low. |Head size is a character of particular interest if the crop is to be harvested by hand topping. When the heads are large, fewer need be haijdled in harvesting a given amount of grain than when they are small. From the data obtained in this experiment, it would/require about 2,000 heads of Early Kalo from the 2-inch spacing to make one bushel of threshed gra|n, whereas only 750 heads of the size produced at the 12-inch spacing would make the same amount. It is evident that thin stands are advisable whfn the crop is to be hand-topped and the data indicate that there will be little or no sacrifice in yield as a result of the wide spacing; [There is a direct relationship between spacing and forage yield. In all cases, dose spacing has produced the highest yield of forage. Obviously the] spacing ( determines the number of plants per acre and although the tillering is greater at the wide spacings this was insufficient to maintain the fulllyield per acre. ' Differences in average grain yield from the six spacings have not been large. In general, the results indicate that there may be considerable varia - tionj in plant spacing without an appreciable effect on grain-yield. There are; however, differences in varietal response, the small early-maturing varieties producing proportionately higher grain yields at the close spacings than the large, late-maturing ones. For example, the average yield of Early Kalo is c: sentially .the same at all spacings except 18 inches; where it is somewhat low:r. Atlas} on the other hand, has given the highest average yield at the 8-in:h spacing and yields from closer spacings have been definitely lower. It is| also of interest to note the seasonal response of the varieties to different spacings. In 1938, when moisture conditions were relatively favorable, the highest yields of Early Kalo, Kalo, and Pink kafir were produced at the 2 - and| 4-inch spacings, respectively. In comparison, moisture conditions in 1937 and 1939 were unfavorable, and in these years the highest yields were produced at the 8- and 12-inch spacings. In all three years, highest grain </seg>
         <seg id="p040">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 329 yields of Atlas have been obtained from the wider spacings, probably be - cause there was insufficient moisture, even in 1938, for the large Atlas plants to complete their full development at the close spacings. The data suggest that grain production is most dependable at spacings of 6 to 8 inches when early to medium early varieties like Early Kalo and Kalo are used. On the average, there probably will be little difference in yield if the spacing is somewhat less than 6 or more than 8 inches. If large, late \aneties are used, grain production is most dependable at spacings of 8 to 12 inches and the data indicate that with these varieties, variations in spac - ing will result in greater differences in yield than with small early varieties. Recommended spacings.—The plant spacing which gives the best re - sults depends upon the season, the variety, the location, and the use to be made ot the crop. Since climatic conditions cannot well be foreseen, the only way that spacing can be regulated to meet the season is to use the spacing which gives the best average result over a period of years. Different varieties respond somewhat differently to various spacings, and it is there - fore desirable to use the spacing best suited to the variety in question. An - other factor, one that is sometimes overlooked, is the location in which the crop is to be grown. Where moisture conditions are favorable because of greater rainfall, accumulation from runoff, or irrigation, it is possible to space closer than where moisture conditions are unfavorable. For this reason the distance between plants must be greater in the western part of the state, where rainfall is lower than in the eastern part. Finally, sorghum that is used for forage is usually closer spaced than that used for grain. As indicated by data from experiment station tests at Lincoln, and by observations in other parts of the state, the following general suggestions regarding distance betwen plants in 40- or 42-inch rows may be made: For grain— Eastern Nebraska: Early Kalo, Kalo, Day, and similar varieties 6 to 8 inches: Sooner, Club, Western Blackhull, and Pink kafir 8 to 10 inches. Central and Western Nebraska: Early Kalo, Kalo, Day, and similar varieties 8 to 10 inches; Sooner, Club, and Western Blackhull 10 to 12 inches. For forage— Eastern Nebraska: Atlas, Leoti, and similar varieties 2 to 4 inches. Central and Western Nebraska: Leoti, Atlas, Black Amber, and similar varieties 4 to 6 inches. The amount of seed to use. —The effect of different spacings between plants in the row has been discussed, but the problem of how to obtain the desired spacing remains. As previously mentioned, differences in seed germination, varietal differences in seed size, and differences in seedbed condition make it difficult to indicate the exact amount of seed that should be planted. However, a few suggestions can be made on determining how much seed to use. Only seed of high germination should be planted. No sorghum should lie used for seed that has not been tested for germination, and in general </seg>
         <seg id="p041">Sorghum Production seed that germinates less than 80 per cent is rather unsatisfactory. It has be:n established that the field germination o£ sorghum seed will usually average from 30 to 50 per cent less than the laboratory germination. 6 This suggests that under average field conditions, using seed of high viability, on.y about half of the kernels planted will produce plants. Thus if it is desired to obtain a field stand of two plants per foot of row, it is usually ne:essary to drop four seeds per foot. When seedbed conditions are un - usually favorable for the germination of the seed, particularly when planting is delayed until the first part of June, the field stand may be greater than 50 per cenl; of the laboratory germination. In such cases a stand of two pknts per foot of row could probably be obtained by dropping only three seeds per foot.

That is, using Early Kalo seed of high viability, it would require about 2% pounds of seed per acre to give a field stand of two plants per foot of row. Proportional adjustments may be made in case of imperfect viability. Variations in seed size and differences in the seed spacing desired necessitate adjustments in the planting machine. The size of the holes in the seed plate of the planter or lister must be such that the seed to be planted will pass through readily without clogging, but they must not be so large that the seed will be sown too thickly. Corn plates should never be used in planting sorghum because the large, widely spaced holes always plant too much seed and it is not uniformly distributed. Most implement manu - facturers can supply suitable plates for planting sorghum with either the lister or corn planter, but where these are not available, blank plates can be drilled. In general, holes 3/16 of an inch in diameter are satisfactory for seeding Early Kalo and varieties which have seed of similar size. Sooner milo and other large-seeded varieties usually require holes 1/4 to 9/32 inch in diameter, while varieties which have seed intermediate in size, such as Day, may be planted through holes 7/32 of an inch in diameter. To pre - vent clogging of the holes it is essential that they be reamed out on the under side, so that once a seed gets into the hole it will drop on through. The number of holes and the rotating speed of the seed plate may be varied to give desired rates of planting, but no recommendation can be given as to the number of holes to use, because the sizes of plates and drive gears differ widely in various makes of planters.

The close spacing obtained by this method pro luces very fine stems which are more palatable than thick ones.

As Jan average for the seven-year period, Black Amber planted at the rates of 25, 50, 75, 100, and 15.0 pounds per acre, yielded 4.65, 5.10, 4.95, 5.27, and 5.28 tons of cured hay per acre, respectively. While there can apparently be Considerable variation in rate of planting without very materially affect - ingl yield, the hay produced by. the thicker rates of planting was of finer quality. This would offset to some extent the greater cost of seed for the thicker rates of planting. Considering both yield and hay quality, about 100 pounds of jeed should be planted per acre in southeastern Nebraska. Further west, because of lower rainfall, the amount should be reduced.

Agr. Eip. Sn. It is doubtful if sorghum should be drilled in Nebraska for any purpose other than hay. Forage sorghum that is to be utilized as fodder or silage can be ijiost conveniently handled when grown in rows, although there is some sacrifice in yield in so doing. Under average conditions drilled sorghum produces very little if any grain, and this method of planting is not usually practicable where grain production is desired. Limited observations in irrigated sections of Nebraska indicate that, where suitable machinery is available, the dwarf varieties of grain sorghum can be satisfactorily grown in rows 20 inches apart. ¦ . : DEPTH OF PLANTING Sorghum seed should generally be covered with 1 toY/i inches of soil, ff the seed is planted shallower than this the surface soil may dry out before it geminates and if planted deeper the seedlings may fail to emerge. In ligh: soils the seed may be placed somewhat deeper than in heavy soils. </seg>
         <seg id="p044">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 329 It is particularly essential that the soil be firmly packed, since this re - tards drying of the soil immediately surrounding the seed. CULTIVATION Sorghums planted in rows are cultivated the same as corn, the amount necessary depending on the growth of weeds. Where the crop is listed, the first one or two cultivations are made with a listed-corn cultivator or go - devil, although one of the cultivations may be replaced by one or two harrowings. Should further cultivation be needed after the ridges have been leveled it can be done with the regular shovel cultivator. If the sorghum is surface-planted the first tillage operation may be a light harrowing just after the plants have emerged. This is followed by two to four cultivations with a shovel cultivator. Some farmers prefer to omit the harrowing. IRRIGATION Sorghum may be grown successfully under irrigation and usually pro - duces good yields of grain or forage. The rate of planting should be in - creased under irrigation; otherwise cultural practices are similar. Later - maturing varieties may be grown under irrigation than on dry land at the same location, because the more favorable water supply hastens plant development. Sorghums appear to have particular merit where abundant water for irrigation is available only in the fall and spring. If the subsoil can be thoroughly filled with moisture, sorghums can usually produce a satisfactory crop without additional summer irrigation. Even in other irrigated areas, sorghum may he of value because it can "wait" longer for moisture than most other crops. HARVESTING FOR GRAIN There is no single standard method of harvesting for grain that can be recommended as most practical under all conditions in-the state. Such factors as ncreage to be harvested, equipment available,~ngjrmal amount of fall precipitation as influenced by the location within the state, variety jjrown, need for getting a maximum amount of roughage, and the purpose for which the grain is used, all influence to an important degree the manner in which the crop may best be handled. The following methods are used extensively in harvesting sorghums for grain-, (a) cutting with a row binder or grain binder, (b) heading by hand or with machinery, and (c) combining. Several modifications of the above are possible. Cutting with a binder.—A row- or corn-binder is the most satisfactory method of harvesting if high-quality grain is desired and if the forage is to be utilized. Sorghums may be harvested in this manner at the time of maturity when there is little loss from lodging. The bundles are placed in shocks until dry enough to thresh. The entire bundle may be run through the threshing machine. Difficulty is sometimes experienced in threshing </seg>

Ther: is extra wear of the straw-racks and there is often some lodging of stalk: in the machine. It is usually considered a more desirable practice to top tie heads (from the bundles before threshing. A "cheese jknife" may be used to top the heads firom the bundles. This is a bng knife with a long handle attached to a suitable frame on the side of a ack. A discarded grader blade is sometimes adapted foil this purpose. A sp:cial vertical sickle on a combine works, very well for topping. The bund es may be hauled on racks to the combine but usually'the threshing is doie by pulling the machine from shock to shock in the field. It. growing varieties like Atlas many farmers have found that it is practcal to harvest a seed crop and still utilize the stover as silage. This is possible because the heads are matured while the stalks are still green and succulent. The crop is cut with a binder, and the heads are topped at the time the stover is put into the silo. These heads contain a high amount of moisture and must be spread out in small ricks until dry enough to thresh. Dwarf varieties such as Colby, Day, and Wheatland are too short to tie well ,vhen harvested with a binder. '¦ ¦ Heading.—-Heading may .be done by any of the following ways: by hand with a special row-header or so-called kafir header, or with an ordinary grain header. . ' Heading can be done whenever the seed is ripe. It is not necessary to delay until after frost but the longer harvest is delayed the lower will be the moisture content of the heads and consequently less danger of spoilage. "When the heads are harvested they are usually piled in ricks three or four :eet high|and five or six feet wide at the bottom. The ricks should be located on well drained^soil, preferably sod or stubble. To prevent some spoikge which may result from rain or high humidity the ricks can be put on a ayer of sorghum stalks: Under average conditions there is little danger </seg>

From F.B. 1764, U.S.D.A. of spoilage in the ricks in western Nebraska but in a more humid region or when rains occur and are likely to continue over a prolonged period it is desirable to spread the heads out under some type of shelter. After about 10 days or two weeks of warm weather the ricks may be threshed and the grain safely stored, or the heads may be piled in larger ricks or slatted cribs until they can be threshed or fed. Feeding experiments at the Lincoln and North Platte stations have shown that chopped heads of grain sorghum can be fed to cattle and sheep without threshing. This is a practical manner of feeding grain sorghums, especially when the cost o£ threshing is high. Sorghum heads in ricks may be threshed with a grain thresher by haul - ing them to a central point. A combine harvester, if available, can be used more economically. The reel and sickle can be removed from the combine and the heads are fed directly into the machine. One of the principal advantages of harvesting only the heads is that the stalks are left standing in the field. The stover produced by grain sorghums is usually not more than a ton per acre and its value is much lower than that produced by a forage sorgo. Unless there is a shortage of roughage on the farm the stalks may be of greater value if left standing to prevent erosion by wind and water and to hold any snow which may fall during the winter. The standing stalks may be grazed after being frosted and thoroughly cured without danger of poisoning livestock. Hand-topping with a knife is a practical method of harvesting when the acreage is small and when mechanical harvesters are not readily available. One man can top from one to two acres per day of an average crop. Plant - ing the crop thin aids in hand harvesting as fewer and larger heads are pro- </seg>

Most varieties will lodge soon after the stalk is killed by drouth or frost, and heavy losses often result from letting a crop stand for combine harvesting. , ¦¦¦'¦¦ The reel of a combine must be set the same as suggested for the grain header for best results. •'.

Setting the threshing machine or combine to avoid cracking.—Unless the threshing machine is properly set for threshing sorghums much of the grain will be cracked. All but one or two rows of concave teeth should be removed and the concave bars must be lowered on all machines using rasp - type cylinder and concaves. The cylinder speed should be reduced to one - half or two-thirds the normal speed for threshing small grain. Although the cylinder speed is reduced the other working parts of the machine must maintain the normal speed. HARVESTING FOR ROUGHAGE The time to harvest a forage variety for bundle feed or silage depends upon the kind of season in which the crop is growing, the available moisture in the soil at harvest time, and the length of time before the first fall frost. Definite rules cannot be given regarding the time of harvesting but a few basic principles may help in solving this problem. In general when sorghum is to be utilized as hay, cured fodder, or silage, the seed should be permitted to reach the hard dough stage before the crop is harvested. At this time the sugar content should have reached a maximum. At the Lincoln experiment station it was found that when Black Amber was harvested at the following four stages of maturity—first heads appearing, well headed, seed soft dough, and seed ripe—the relative yields were 100, 117, 129, and 138 per cent. When the soil moisture becomes exhausted in September and the lower leaves begin to fire, the crop should be harvested although the heads are not matured. If this drouth condition occurs in August it would be advisable under most conditions to delay harvesting. If there are early fall rains the plants will revive and a good growth of forage may be produced before frost. It is fairly well established that sorghum will make good feed even if cut prematurely. Since sweet sorghums have relatively large stalks which are high in sugar content the fodder dries slowly. Fodder should not be stacked or stored in a barn until it has had ample time to cure. When the material is </seg>

Fodder can usually be stored with safety when the moisture content is from-25 to 35 per cent. ¦ When close drilled or broadcast, sorghum is commonly mowed and cured in the swath or windrow. If the crop is not too tall and coarse, it may be cut with a grain binder and shocked in the field for curing. This method often facilitates handling and curing. : Silage made from immature sorghum may become too acid in the fermentation process. However, if drouth injures the crop before maturity it can be safely ensiled. :,'.-..¦¦ ¦ . [The field ensilage cutter (Fig. 24) is proving to be a very practical machine for harvesting sorghum. A great deal of labor is saved since cut - ting, chopping, and loading into wagons are all done in one operation. When the crop is placed in a trench silo, the wagons are driven through the silol which simplifies unloading and.assists in packing the silage in the trench. . '.¦¦;.•'¦ -.'¦'.. STORING SORGHUM GRAIN Difficulties with heating and spoilage of sorghum grain in storage are common. Such storage problems are usually traceable directly to high moisture content in the grain at the time of threshing. Conditions at the time of harvest influence the moisture content and hence the keeping qualities of the grain. The moisture content of the grain as the crop stands in the field may be raised several per cent by fall rains and high humidity. Therefore, threshing or combining should be done only following a period of several days of dry weather. : ..! •. Grain which has been harvested by a combine usually causes most of the difficulties in storage. There is a tendency to hasten the harvest before the stalks lodge and before the grain is thoroughly dry. A moisture content of 14 per cent'or less at the time of storage-should be satisfactory. If higher </seg>
         <seg id="p050">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 329 than this, it may be necessary to move the grain to prevent heating and possibly molding. Moisture contents which may not be too high under winter conditions may prove too high when the weather turns warm the following spring. Methods for minimizing danger of spoilage in storage are: (1) grow short-season varieties that will mature properly before frost; (2) avoid cracking of grain in threshing because a high percentage of cracked kernels is conducive to spoilage; (3) avoid getting stalk material into the grain, as this normally carries a relatively high water content; and (4) watch the grain carefully after it is put in the bin and if necessary move it as an aid in drying. Special-type bins with ventilators may be used which will effectively lower the moisture content of the grain. SORGHUM IN THE ROTATION For years it has been the common opinon among many farmers that sorghum is "hard" on the land. It is true that yields of crops following sorghum are usually somewhat lower than those obtained following corn. The principal reason for this is greater soil moisture depletion. Since sor - ghum yields more tonnage than most crops and commonly continues growth much later into the fall, it takes more water out of the soil and hence leaves less for the succeeding crop. The effect in a year of inadequate soil moisture is obvious. However, depletion of soil moisture is not the only adverse effect of sorghum on the soil. It has been noted that the yields of following crops are lowered even on irrigated land. The explanation for this is that there is a temporary tie-up of available nitrates in the soil. This is fairly com - parable to the effect of putting too much straw on land. The effect can be overcome by adding nitrates to the soil in the form of manure or by growing soil-building legume crops. Still another adverse effect of sorghum often experienced by farmers is that it leaves the soil hard and "lumpy" and hence hard to work down into a satisfactory seedbed. Plowing or listing in the fall to facilitate the action of alternate freezing and thawing will help to alleviate this condition. Incorporation of organic matter will also aid in the tilth of the soil. At least part of the adverse effects of sorghum on the land are not so serious when the entire farm-management program is considered. Sorghum usually means livestock farming. Manure is then available to spread on the land, which aids materially in offsetting these unfavorable soil effects. Rotations with sorghum have not been fully worked out experimentally. However, based on observations, a few suggested practices in growing sorghum follow. Nebraska farmers have had considerable difficulty with corn "burning" following a legume crop. The reason for this is that the nitrate content has been built up to a point where it is too high in compari - son with available moisture. Since sorghum is relatively drouth resistant, and since it tends to "tie-up" available nitrates, it offers one of the best, possibilities as a crop to follow alfalfa or sweet clover. </seg>
         <seg id="p051">Sorghum Production ¦•¦:,.: One of the things to avoid in rotations is the sowing of winter wheat on l^nd which has been in sorghum during the same year. Since wheat requires considerable quantities of nitrates earlier in the season than any other crop, it suffers the most from shortage of nitrates. Spring-planted small grains yield better than winter wheat following sorghums, but crops whidh make most of their growth still later in the season do relatively bettejr. Corn pr sorghum following sorghum ordinarily does relatively well. In tSose parts of the state where land is summer-fallowed, a good three - year rotation I would be summer fallow, wheat, sorghum, and back to summer fallow. •!• - : : :: ¦¦• . ¦ uiujzation ¦-¦]¦¦;'¦:¦- '; ¦ 11 Corn Belt regions where they are grown most widely, sorghums are utilized in the same manner as corn. The Nebraska Experiment Station as Well as other stations in the Great Plains area have conducted various feeding experiments with.sorghums. No attempt will be made to give a complete review of this work in this bulletin. The whole sorghum plant may be fed, either gre:n, cured, or ensiled. Sorgium silage is considered to be from 90 to 95 per cent of the value of corn, pound for pound, for most classes of livestock, i Dry fodder or silage must be supplemented with some protein and mineral concentrate for fattening cattle or sheep, or to cows producing a heavy flow of milk. . The composition of the sorghum grain is very nearly the same as that of corn. Sorghums contain more protein while corn contains more fat. The carbohydrate content is nearly equal. It is generally considered that the f :eding value of sorghum grain is from 85 to 95: per cent of the feeding value of cornj for most classes of livestock. Because of the small size and hard less of the grain much of it is passed through the animals undigested. The grain should therefore be cracked for all classes of livestock, except hogs, sheep, and poultry when self-fed. The grain of sorghums is more palatible than corn. The brown-seeded varieties are somewhat unpalatable becaise of their bitter taste, and are eaten less freely than the white, yellow, or re 1-seeded varieties. ! -'¦-.' : . ¦ " ¦ DISEASES AND CONTROL MEASURES '» The most important diseases of sorghum are the loose and covered kernel smut i and head smut, weak neck, Pythium root rot, and the bacterial blights. Covered kernel smut of sorghum is the only one of these known to cause severe damage in Nebraska. The other diseases mentioned may cause consi ierable damage in certain years; however, in most seasons they are of minor importance, i .-' ; Lwse and covered kernel smuts.—The loose and covered kernel smuts of so-ghuni are very similar in appearance. Smutted [heads appearnearly normal when they first emerge from the boot, but instead of filling with normal grains, dark brown to black spore masses enclosed in a thin, whitish, 7This lection has¦ been prepared by J. E. Livingston, Department oE Plant Pathology. ..¦¦'. .. | </seg>
         <seg id="p052">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 329 or brownish membrane form in place of the individual kernels. These spore balls are usually slightly longer than the round, healthy kernels. As the season advances, the membrane surrounding the spores may be broken so that the head appears dark brown or black even at a distance. When the membrane breaks, the spores are liberated and distributed by the wind over a considerable area, thus contaminating healthy grain growing nearby. Further contamination occurs during threshing. The spores are carried from season to season on the surface of contaminated kernels. They germinate and infect the host only during the very young seedling stage, before the plants appear above ground. The organism grows up inside the plant and for this reason infected plants cannot be detected until the heads develop. The control measures recommended are the same as for any smut disease carried on the surface of the seed. Applications of 2 ounces of copper carbonate dust, containing 50 per cent of copper per bushel of seed, or }4 ounce of New Improved Ceresan per bushel of seed, have given good control. Feterita and all milos have been reported to be fairly resistant to covered kernel smut. Kafirs and sorgos are susceptible. No information is available on the susceptibility of varieties to loose kernel smut. Head smut. —Head smut of sorghum involves the entire head. The branches of the head, as well as the grain, are transformed into a distorted mass composed of dark-colored spores and plant fibers, similar to a gall produced by corn smut. Head smut rarely occurs in Nebraska, and then only a few scattered heads may appear in a field. The disease, like corn smut, canot be controlled by seed treatment. The ground on which an infected crop has been grown should not be replanted to susceptible varieties of sorghum for at least three years. Milos have been reported to show some resistance, whereas kafir and the sweet sorghums are susceptible. Weak neck.—Weak neck has become important in the last few years with the introduction of dwarf varieties of grain sorghums adapted to combine harvesting. These varieties must stand in the field until they be - come sufficiently dry for combining and safe storage and thus they must possess strong stalks and peduncles. Weak neck is chiefly a rot of the peduncle and is characterized by a discoloration and disintegration of the tissues which may involve all of the peduncle from the head on down, or may be confined to a small area. In the more severe cases the heads break over, either just below the head or more often at the junction of the peduncle with the uppermost node. Com - plete breaking-over does not necessarily occur unless aggravated by high wind and rain. Heads from infected plants are poorly developed with shriveled, lusterless grain which results in a greatly decreased yield of poor-quality grain. Late-planted sorghums are usually not as severely affected as early plantings. Considerable resistance has been reported for Wheatland, Black - hull kafir, Club, and all true sorgos in field tests.

Pythium root rot or milo disease.—The organism causing this root rot of mi o is carried in the soil from year to year. Susceptible varieties grown in inf :sted soil usually show the first symptoms in about 40 days. Wilting occurs, followed by a yellowing which begins with the lower leaves and spreads to the leaves above. This yellowing occurs first at the margin of the letf and rapidly extends over its entire area. The plants are stunted, they .may or may not produce heads, depending upon the severity of the disease, and they usually die prematurely. When infected plants are cut open at the soil line, the central cylinder of the roots and crown show a dark red discoloration. '.-.¦ The use of resistant varieties is the only satisfactory method of control.

Streaks and blotches appear chiefly on the leaVes, but may extend to the stalk. They vary in color from a brownish red top dark purplish red, and in size from a short, narrow streak to a large elongated blotch several inches in length. The disease usually appears first on the lower leaves about the time the plant begins to head and then gradu - ally spreads to jthe upper leaves. Damage is usualy small although during warm,] moist weather niuchjof the leaf surface may be killed. . Whenever possible, resistant varieties should be planted. Sudan grass, the milos, and Blackhull kafir are reported to show considerable resistance, while feterita and hegari are very susceptible, and the kafirs and sorgos show : ntermediate degrees of susceptibility. . INSECTS THAT INJURE SORGHUMS Th: insect that causes the greatest damage to the sorghum crop in Ne - braska is the chinch bug. Fortunately the area of chinch-bug infestation does not cover the entire state but is more or less confined to the southeastern counties. When outbreaks occur, all sorghums are likely to be damaged, since no variety is completely resistant.

About the only time that grasshoppers eat sorghum leaves is when the plants are very young or when there is no other vegetation in the vicinity.

August, 1938. severe in early-planted sorghum, which suggests an additional reason for late planting. In certain seasons, and particularly in the eastern part of the state, corn earwo-ms havejbeen responsible for some damage to sorghum heads. They seem to be most troublesome in compact heads where they feed upon the grain pnd cut some of the small branches from the rachis. The damage to sorghum caused by the corn-leaf aphid, sometimes called "plans lice," is probably of slight economic importance in Nebraska. But in some instances the insects have been observed in considerable numbers. They usually cluster in the leaf whorl, and when especially severe may interfere with the normal exsertion of the head. The sticky fluid secreted by thd aphids apparently provides a favorable medium for the growth of fungi in the head, and the mold formed by these organisms may lower the quality of the seed. No practicable methods of control are known, except that c; rly plantings seem to be damaged less than late plantings. '¦' LIVESTOCK POISONING All sorghums are capable of producing sufficient prussic (hydrocyanic) acid to cause the death of livestock when pastured under certain conditions of grojvth. The leaves, particularly young leaves, contain most of the poison but young branches and suckers on large plants may be as dangerous as young| plants. )Vhen the plants are stunted, wilted, or recently frosted, they may cause death when eaten by the animal. Grain sorghum and sorgo are both much more potentially dangerous than Sudan grass, which ordinarily causes little trouble. Under no condition should livestock be pastured on grain jorghum [and sorgo except in the fall and winter after the plants have been killed and are completely cured. ' "¦'"."'¦'¦.¦' .•'¦ </seg>
         <seg id="p056">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 329 There are many unsolved problems in connection with livestock poison - ing on sorghums and Sudan grass, yet a few principles have been fairly well established. So far as is known, there is no danger of poisoning from feeding the grain or heads, and there appears to be little or no danger from feeding well-made silage or well-cured hay, fodder, or stover of any of the sorghums. There is some evidence that hungry animals and animals in poor condition are somewhat more susceptible to poisoning than animals in good health. For this reason it would seem advisable to give the animals a good fill before turning them onto the pasture. There are also indications that animals receiving a regular ration of a starchy concentrate, such as corn, kafir, or milo grain, are less likely to be poisoned than animals which receive no grain. Caution should be exercised in pasturing Sudan grass that has been stunted by drouth, and frozen Sudan grass should not be pastured until the dead plants are thoroughly dried. Should livestock be poisoned on sorghum or Sudan grass, a veterinarian should be called as soon as possible. Antidotes are now available to him which, administered in time, have been found to be effective. SUMMARY Sorghum has recently become of special interest in Nebraska as a rel - atively dependable crop to meet conditions of prolonged drouth. The acreage harvested has increased from 135,000 in 1929 to 1,324,000 in 1939. About 60 per cent of the crop is utilized as forage and the remainder as grain, aside from a very small amount used for the manufacture of syrup. There are many distinct varieties of sorghum, only part of which are climatically adapted in Nebraska. Descriptions of 23 varieties of greatest importance in this state are given in this bulletin. Yield is usually considered the most important of the factors which influence choice of variety. Yield tests at Lincoln and North Platte and on farms throughout the state have demonstrated the superiority of Early Kalo, Sooner, Kalo, and Day for grain production. Under conditions of chinch-bug infestation, Club and Western Blackhull kafir are more suitable in southeastern Nebraska. Highest yields of forage have been produced by Atlas, Leoti, Kansas Orange, Early Sumac, and Black Amber. The relative dependability of sorghum in seasons of unfavorable climatic conditions, as compared with corn, has been demonstrated by yield tests at Lincoln and North Platte. As an average for several years, Early Kalo has yielded more than twice as much grain as corn, and other adapted varieties have given similar results. In general, superior varieties of sorgo have given forage yields double those from corn. Sorghum varieties should be kept free of mixtures by isolating the seed field from other varieties and by field selection of typical heads to be threshed for seed. Seed should always be treated for the control of smut with copper carbonate at the rate of 2 to 3 ounces per bushel or with New Improved Ceresan at the rate of '/2 ounce. </seg>
         <seg id="p057">, ' Sorghum Production Early and thorough tillage is essential in the preparation of a desirable seedbejl for sorghumsj The principal objectives are to kill weeds, conserve moisture^ and warm the soil. Any practical procedure that accomplishes these objectives I has been shown to be satisfactory. There is ordinarily no advantage from the early planting of sorghum. As a general rule, it should;be planted about 10 days to two weeks later than tFe normal time for planting corn. In most parts of Nebraska this will be in late May and early June. In areas where chinch-bug infestations are likely 1 o occur, damage from these pests may be reduced by planting some - what earlier than is ordinarily recommended. As a result of adjustments in tillering and head size there may be con-: sideraHe variation in plant spacing without an appreciable effecfon grain yield. However^ for grain production it is usually advisable to have stands too thin rather ( than too thick. Greater yield and higher quality of forage are usually obtained from Icloser spacings, either when grown in rows or when drilled. The following general suggestions may be made regarding distance between plants in 40- or 42-inch rows: Eastern Nebraska—for grain C to 10 inches, for forage 2 to 4 inches; central and western Nebraska —for j rain Bto 12 inches, for forage 4to 6 inches. When drilled for hay, about 100 pounds of seed should be sown per acre in eastern Nebraska and 75 pounds per acre further west in the state. ~ '"''¦.'•¦ When planting sorghum, the seed should generally; be covered with 1 to l'/ 2 inches of soil. It is particularly essential that the soil be firmly packed, since this retards drying of the soil immediately surrounding the seed. Ordinarily sorghum planted in rows is cultivated the I same as corn, the numbe- of cultivations depending on the growth of weeds. Sorghum may be grown successfully under irrigation and has particular merit where abundant water is available only in the fall and spring. Later - maturing varieties and closer plant spacings may be used under irrigation than on dry land at the same location. j Harvesting for grain is usually accomplished by binding, heading, or combining. Binding or heading usually permits the crop to be harvested before there is danger of lodging, whereas successful combining requires that it be left standing until the grain has dried thoroughly. Binding may be done with a rjow- or corn-binder or in some instances with a grain binder. In eithir case, the bundles are shocked for curing prior to threshing. Head - ing may be done by hand, with a special row-header, or with a grain header. When jharvestedj in this manner the heads are piled in ricks for curing. Combining may be successfully practiced with dwarf, lodge-resistant varieties. Where the machinery is available and the acreage to be harvested is .large it is usually more economical than theother methods. Difficulty is sometimes encountered in storing grain harvested with a combine because of high moisture content. In order to thresh sorghum grain satisfactorily it i i usually necessary to remove one or two rows of concave teeth and to reduce the speed of the cylinder from one-half to two-thirds the normal speed for threshing small grain. ' v '. i </seg>
         <seg id="p058">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Bulletin 329 When harvested for forage, sorghum planted in rows is ordinarily cut with a row-binder, although if the plants are not too tall a grain binder may be used. If the crop is to be used as silage, the field ensilage cutter is a desirable machine. Difficulty may be experienced in storing sorghum grain if the moisture content is greater than 14 per cent. Pieces of cracked kernels and stalk material in the grain also induce spoilage and should therefore be eliminated by careful threshing and cleaning. Yields of crops following sorghum in the rotation may be lower than those obtained following corn. The principal reason for this is the greater depletion of soil moisture by sorghum, but the temporary tying-up of avail - able nitrates is also a factor. Where summer fallow is practiced a good rota - tion is fallow, wheat, and sorghum. In other areas, corn and sorghum are better crops with which to follow sorghum than oats, barley, or wheat, and of the small grains barley or oats should be used in preference to wheat. Sorghums are utilized largely in the same manner as corn. The whole sorghum plant may be fed, either green, cured, or ensiled. The composition of sorghum grain is nearly the same as that of corn and it is generally con - sidered that its feeding value is from 85 to 95 per cent of corn for most classes of livestock. Like corn, sorghum grain must be supplemented with other feeds to provide a balanced ration. The most important disease of sorghum in Nebraska is the covered kernel smut, and it can be controlled by seed treatment. Other diseases of lesser importance are loose and head smut; weak neck; root-, crown-, and shoot-rot; and the bacterial blights. Chinch bugs may cause considerable damage to the sorghum crop in southeastern Nebraska, but the use of resistant varieties and early planting helps to minimize injury by these insects. Sorghums are not extensively damaged by other insects in Nebraska although grasshoppers occasionally cause some loss. All sorghums are capable of causing the death of livestock when pastured under certain conditions of growth but so far as is known there is little danger from feeding well-made silage, hay, or fodder and no danger from feeding the grain or heads.
