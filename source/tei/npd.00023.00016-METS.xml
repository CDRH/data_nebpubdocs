            <seg id="p005">253 The Nebraska Orthopedic Hospital was opened for the re - ception of patients October 1, 1905. This Hospital was created by an enactment of the legislature of the same year by means of which an appropriation of $10,000.00 was made for the establish - ment of the institution and its maintenance for the first biennium. The hospital was provided for the care of the destitute crippled and deformed of this state. The originators and those who aided in securing the passage of the law were influenced by the belief that by such an institution dependent cripples could be brought from various parts of the state and converted into selfsustaining and independent individuals. The law creating the hospital pro - vided that it should be located in a building at the Home for the Friendless in Lincoln. Before hospital work could be begun, however, it was found necessary to expend practically one-half of the original appropriation in remodeling the building Et hat it would serve the purpose. The basement and part he first floor of the building, which had been placed at Um al of the new institution, were finally remodeled in such ■ t fairly satisfactory quarters were obtained. From October 1, 1905. to November 30, 1906, the time remain - ing of the first biennium. 106 patients made application for treatment at the hospital. Eighty-one of these patients were admitted and treated. The activity of the hospital during these fourteen months may be indicated by saying that the patients cared for represented a total of 8,850 hospital days. This large amount of work was accomplished in spite of the fact that during much of the time it had to be done in an incomplete building. Lack of funds, however, prevented further improvements which had to be deferred until a larger appropriation could be secured. I During the biennium from October 1, 1905 to November 30, 16 and from November 30, 1906 to November 80, 1908 the ount of work done can best be reported by reprinting the lowing tables from previous reports which it seems best to in - t here for comparison with the biennium just closed. 12 </seg>

The second floor was arranged to provide two large wards, one for babies and one for girls, one for nurses and one for officers. The third floor when remodeled me three rooms for nurses, tv rooms, kitchen and two bed r&gt; for the cook ami her assistant Phree inside bath rooms were torn out and seven oir bath rooms were built providing adequate and sanitary a&gt;- modations for all the rooms and wards in the building. The solarium at the south end of the building was extended up two stories providing two outdoor wards, one for girls and on. boys, which are devoted particularly to the care of tuberculous patients. Finally a modern push button electric elevator of the automatic type was instilled, which provides transportation to all the floors of the building and which in the pri E our work is an indispensable feature ems only fair at this point to render a tribute to the interest and industry of the Board of Public Lands and Buildines in charge of the hospital during the biennium when this work was much of his time and energy to bringing the hospital to present state of efficiency. At the time when the hospital was tirst projected, it regarded by many as a rather visionary undertaking inasmuch ial need of such an institution had not previously apparent. The record of eighty-one patients cared for during the first n months howi monstrated conclusively lone. The chairman. Hon. II. M. Eaton, particularly. </seg>

We now have sixty beds and for several ths past have averaged more than that many patients, run - ? at times as high as sixty-seven. tAn effort has been made, especially during the past biennium, liscriminate in the admission of patients in favor of those who Id receive the most benefit from hospital treatment. We have q compelled to parole as many of our patients as possible in er to provide places for those for whom hospital residence : necessary. tBy reason of population as well as because of convenience te institution more patients have been admitted from Douglas Lancaster than from the western counties. The following ities, however, have at various times since the beginning of work contributed patients to the hospital. i Adams, Antelope, Boone, Buffalo, Cass, Clay, Colfax, Custer, cota, Dawson, Dixon, Dodge, Douglas, Filmore.

The large number of children, however, and the variety of branches which must be taught have rendered the services of our single teacher less efficient than we had hoped. The appropriation made two years ago provided for only one teacher. During the next bien - nium two or three must be supplied. It is recommended that three be provided for with a view to making industrial training still more a feature of our work. It should be remembered that many of these patients, even, after the best treatment that can be afforded, are incapacitated for most forms of employment. For that reason special occupations must be taught and a de - gree of efficiency acquired which renders their services of value in spite of their disabilities. Considerable progress has been made along the lines of pro </seg>

Special appliances and chairs have been purchased and our school room is now ready for more advanced and much better work than we have been able to do. More instructors and those capable of instructing along special lines will enable us to provide the better instruction necessary for our children which they should have. An increasingly valuable feature in the conduct of our hospital has been the training school for nurses. Our first class graduated March 14, 1908. Of the five members. Miss Bixby, after completing a post graduate course in Bellevue Hospital. York City, came back to the hospital a- :it and upon th« resignation of Miss Anna K. Ilardwiek, June 1, 1910, to be mar - ried, Miss Bixby became the head nurse and has since been in charge. Miss Mullen and Miss Capron who were graduat - the same time also pursued post graduate study in Harlem Fordham Hospitals, in New York City, and are now engaged in professional nursing in Lincoln. Mrs. Luella Stahl was married to Frank R. Miller and is residing in Lincoln. Miss Elizabeth Rogers was married to Albert Heman, of Omaha. On May 27, 1910, the second class of nurses was grad with appropriate exercises, the Board of Public Lands and Build - ings very kindly provided Representative Hall in the Capitol Building for the evening. Clara Anderl, Gladys Turner, Alice Miller, Laura Darrow and Wilhelmine Fuhrmann were gradu at this time. Miss Anderl has become assistant at the Ortho - pedic Hospital. Miss Turner is at Columbus, Xebr., Miss Darrow is at Fairbury, Nebr., Miss Alice Miller is in Lincoln. Miss Fuhr - mann will take a post-graduate course in New York City. The present biennium has been marked by an absence of many of the disturbing features of our work previous to this time. The fact that our building had been completed made it possible for us to care for a larger number of patients to better purpose and with less effort than before. On that account we have been able to accomplish the large amount of work which it affords us pleasure to report. Fortunately, also, the only epidemic disease which has visited us during the past two years has been whooping cough for which quarantine was not necessary and from which fortunately we had no fatalities. We owe much to the interest of the present Board of Public Lands and Buildings in our work. By means of their co-opera - tion and assistance the affairs of the hospital have been conducted (13) </seg>
