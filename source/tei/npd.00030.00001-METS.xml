Your question is: inty judge &lt;&gt;f Thayer county entitled to a return of this sum of $81 collected by him for |«Tformiii({ marriage ceremonies in tli lition to hi.« salary?" You state in your letter that the county judge relies upon use of Douyla.s County r. Yinsonhaler, 82 Neb., 810. In that case Judge Yinsonhaler was permitted to retain a amount of fees collected by him for performing mar - riage ceremonies. Upon a careful consideration of the case, \ ill find the decision was based largely upon the prop - ii that the law at that time did not require the county judge to charge fees for performing marriage ceremonies, suit . inasmuch as the law did not require him to make charges for those services, such fees as were collected there - for might be retained by him the same as they are retained by ministers of the gospel and other persons authorized to ■in such ceremonies. In that case the services per - formed by Judge Yinsonhaler were rendered from January 4. l'HM). to January :}. 1906, and, of course, the decision was based upon the law that was in force during that time. In the year 1907. the law prescribing the fees of county judges was amended so as to provide that the county judge should charge a fee of $3 for performing a marriage mi &gt;n v. Since that amendment, and as the law now stands, he duty of the county judge to charge this fee for ich ceremony, but it does not mean that he shall be entitled to retain that fee together with the salary by law. ion 947(1, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1909, pro - ry county judge, wli -hall in the aggre - &gt;-d the sum of $1,500 per annum, shall pay ■ into the treasury of the county in which he holds his office.

Particular attention is called by General Smith to that portion of section 27. chapter 12a, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, wherein cities of the metropolitan }&gt;ermitted to establish a pension fund and appropriate therefor rewards paid to any meml the police force of such city.

The argument of the Judge- Advocate Cienefal, to the that a police officer who arrests a deserter and turns •viT to the federal authorities thereby becomes an of the federal government, is sound. In offering a rd for the capture of a deserter the government is making an offer for an act. and a contract is consummated when that act is completed by' the delivery of the deserter. The fee therefor, or reward, paid for the arrest and delivery '■-ertcr is. in a way. the salary of the police officer, or any one else who makes the arrest, as a federal officer. It ii, under this view of the matter, that the state ought appropriate this salary of the officer who takes the ter. It would remove the incentive which now in - the police officer in making such arrest. In this way, the instrumentalities of the federal government in executing institutional powers would be burdened and retarded. The Tinted States supreme court, in Dobbin* v. Comm'r ■ unti/.

In the letter from (leneral Smith quotations are given from this leading case, and it seems unnecessary for me to further refer to it. The section of our law mentioned above will permit the board of fire and police commissioners of cities of the metropolitan class, viz., Omaha, to make exceptions as to any rewards mentioned therein. It is perfectly proper, therefore, for the board of fire and police commissioners to except all rewards offered by the United States government from the funds that are to be paid into the police relief </seg>

In that case a contract was canceled after nine months of the year had expired and a new contract entered into with another firm at higher figures for material. The court there held that the com - miaBioners. by canceling the contract, were endeavoring to the provisions of the statute, which clearly call for yearly contracts. I do not tee, however, why this decision would in any way interfere with the assignment of a valid contract, the assent of the board having been given to such --ignnient. It would not be advisable to release the old bond.

You ask following question: </seg>

It simply determines the amount of iv necessary to he levied for each fund for town pur - s; then the town hoard certifies this amount to the iv clerk, and the amount so certified is levied by the ty hoard. inn 4.V&gt;0. Cobbey'fl Annotated Statutes of IMS, is sufficient authority for the electoi :&gt;ecial town meet - ing to provide for raising money for repairing roads or build - iiul to act upon any subject within the power of the is at any annual town meeting which was postponed iiit of time. It is possible that a strict construction of '■(■lion would only permit the electors at the special ng to determine the amount necessary for the repair - ing of highways or buildings, or the repairing of bridges in cases of emergencies; but, in view of the fact that the annual town meeting was entirely overlooked, I think ithorities of the town would be justified in calling a il town meeting for the purpose of determining the amount of money to be raised for roads, bridges and general purposes. In calling such meeting the provisions of sections ■■•. 4").")0 and 4."&gt;7'.» ought to be closely followed. I regard the action of the electors at the town meeting, when they determine the amount to be levied for town pur - poses, as in the nature of a recommendation to the county ; It is the county board who makes the levy, and when it is made by the county board, upon recommendation of the town meeting. I do not think it is assailable. I. therefore, advise that a special town meeting be called, under the provisions of the sections aforesaid, that the amount for town purposes be ascertained and determined, and that the same be certified to the county board. ffore the amendment of section 4579, as it was in the piled Statutes of 1903, the county board had the power ake the levy under the circumstances suggested by There is some doubt about its power to make the as the law now exist-, without the determination and </seg>

From this definition 1 do take it that a morgue is limited solely to a public : This provision of the statute was designed to allow the coroner a *•"&gt; fee where the body of some unknown pi ound where it was supposed that he died by uni means, and where the sheriff saw tit to remove the body to some private house or public place with the expeel the body might be identified by friend.*. I &lt;i think it VM intended that where a body wa- found and identified at the time, and it m &gt;uppo-ed that dear produced by some unlawful means, the sheriff might re - the $5 fee by simply turning the body over to friend- The other provision of the statute which gives him &gt; viewing the body of j&gt;erson&gt; supposed to have died by un - lawful means, when it apjM'ars upon investigation that no inquest should be held, was intended to cover h; all cases which were not included in thooe cases where bodie - are kept in some particular place so that friends may iden - tify them. In other words, where the coroner finds it nec - essary to take the body to some residence or public place, and in good faith leaves it there for a sliort time for the purpose of having it identified, he is entitled to the $5 fee under that provision of the statute which relates to remov - ing bodies to the morgue.

Eion makes it a misdemeanor for any owner or of a billiard saloon or billiard table to permit min the age of eighteen years, to play at the game of s in such billiard saloon or upon such billiard table. '■ommonly understood in this day, the game of billiards is known as a separate and distinct game from that &gt;1. Now days, billiard tables are also constructed in a different manner from pool tables. However, the ques - tion to be determined now is what was the meaning of the words 'billiard saloons and billiard tables," as used by the legislature at the time this act was passed. This section of the criminal code seems to have been adopted at the time the criminal code was enacted, and, if so. it took effect in the year 1873. At that time, billiard tables were constructed very much in the same way as - ire at the present time; for instance, they am pockets at the corners and two at the sides, and, while the game of billiards was limited largely to the use of three or four balls, the game was played by using the if the table. The American Cyclopaedia says: "Milliard tables are divided into three classes; they may have four pocket .- six. or none at nil " Iii &gt;\Vbster's Unabridged Dictionary, printed in 1870, itisBaid: pMM of billiards is described as being played on a table having ile* and corners of the table." ■discussing the subject of billiards, Chambers En - media says : "The only other (came played upon a billiard table, which it is necessary for us to notice, is that called pool." The New International Encyclopaedia says: 'Pool is played with billiard tables, with fifteen numbered balls and one white unnumbered ball." </seg>

The county l&gt;o:ir&lt;l. by virtue of the new high school law, has no authority to appoint the principal and the teachers for the high school. Hon. James W. Crabtree, Suptrintendent of Public Instruc- l.incoln. Dear Sir: In reply to your verbal request for an opinion on the new county high school law I will say it is the judg - ment of this department that the new law took from the county hoard the authority to appoint the principal and teacher- for the high school during the coming year. This new act carried the emergency clause, and went into effect April 1(1. 1911. That act entirely repealed section 23, BabdrvMHW U. chapter 79, Compiled Statutes of 1909, and •ok away from the county board any authority that given it by previous legislation. Such being the it is not within the jurisdiction of the county board time to elect the teachers for that school. Ehc new act provides for the election of three members he board of regents on the last Saturday in June, 1911. ing the interim the county superintendent of public ruction is. by virtue of his office, secretary of this board, the county treasurer is treasurer of said board. Ii- not believed that the affairs of the county high I will suffer in any way by reason of the board's in - y to organize at once, and it does seem clear that the y board lias lost its jurisdiction over the county school and can not, therefore, elect teachers or per - other acts relating to the business of the high school which the former legislation conferred upon it.

Dear Sir: I am in receipt of yours of the 12th instant, in which you submit the following question, and ask the opin - ion of this department thereon: -lieriff entitled to jailer fees in addition to his fixed salary?" Our supreme court has recently rendered an opinion in hich it says that section 13, chapter 4(5, Compiled Statutes f 19()7, recognizes a distinction between the duties of the ftice of sheriff and those of the position of jailer, and gives he sheriff the election to act as jailer in person; and, if the leriff does not so elect, it provides that the jailer shall be deputy appointed by the sheriff. The opinion goes further ml holds that if the sheriff actually performs the duties f jailer, in addition to his duties as sheriff, he is entitled &gt; the comj&gt;ensatioii provided for the performance of such uties as jailer. (Dunkle r. County of Hall, 89 Neb., 585.) Hence, it follows that in cases where the sheriff performs the jailer's duties along with the duties of sheriff's office, he is entitled to the salary as sheriff and also jailer's fees. But, where the duties of jailer are performed by some other person, he only, and not the sheriff, is entitled to the jailers fees. Very respectfully. GRANT G. MARTIN, July 13, 1911. Attorney General.

You state that this : &gt;een aooeoBcd $10. (MM) by the state board, and that in the past the road has been subject to a municipal tax in ii the entire assessment. Y&lt;&gt;u have also transmitted to this office a letter fron al Agent John K. Webster, representing the Illinoi Central Railroad in Omaha, in which he protests again:* paying municipal taxes on the entire $10,000, which i igainst this company. As a reason for his pro - tot, he alleges that his company owns no track in this stat and uses a total mileage of 1.44S belonging to anothe corporation; that .358 of a mile lies within the city of Omaha while 1.0*1 miles lie outside of the city. Mr. Webste suggests that it is an error to make a return for termina ion of the entire $10,000, that his road should pa municipal taxes only on the proportion of the road whic it hin the city limits. In section 11, article 10, chapter 77, Compiled Statutes 09, 1 find that the state board is authorized to find the unit basis of city and village taxation, as follow ■■I shall first ascertain and tinil the total value of all the prop I company in the entire state of Nebraska.

Under the definitions in the terminal taxation statute, it seems clear that the Illinois Central, which merely runs its trains over the road of another corporation in Nebraska, might be called a car company, which is defined as follows: "The term 'car company.' shall include any person, association, or corporation owning or o|wrating sleeping care, refrigerator cars, stock </seg>

Suppose the Illinois Central ran its trains to Lincoln over the tracks of another railroad, and the Mate l&gt;oard should •Mess it $10,000 as at present , it is plain that this assessment would then be apportioned under the rule, according to the mileage traversed in each city and village on its line.

In substance your question is as 1&gt; this in &gt;uder these conditions, a legal newspaper, within mtemplation of your st;ii tion 11922. Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1909, relates to this matter and is as follow "That no newspaper shall be considered a legal newspaper for the pub - lication of legal ami other official notices unless the same shall have a bona jidt circulation of at least 2(K) copies weekly, and shall have been published within the county for M successive weeks prior to the publi - - and l&gt;e printed either in whole or in part in an office maintained at the place of publication."

Nowhere m the act are street railway companies specifically de&gt;ig- The act undertakes to define what is meant by pub - rviec corporations, but street railway companii not included in the definition unless the words "railroad" or railway" include them. Our supreme court and the courts of other states have construed the words "railroad" and "railway" as synonymous, and held, in effect, they do not include street railways. Other provisions of the valua - tion act prescribe the manner in which the physical valua - tion ul steam railroads, telegraph, telephone and express </seg>

It is true that the railway commission act in defining the common carriers" includes street railway Ibm ated either by steam, electricity or any other motive p but the valuation act does not use the term "common carrier." Hence, it may be contended with great forc« the physical valuation act does not include street railway lines. It is quite probable that our courts would so hold. However, it is so manifestly unjust to require one public carrier to submit its property for physical valuation and permit another public carrier ioh valuation that I am not inclined to hold that street railway comn alone should l&gt;e excluded.

Your first question relates to the following statute: Iiat no female shall be employed in any manufacturing, mechanical rcantile establishments, hotel or restaurant in this state more than hours during any one week and that ten hours shall constitute a labor. The hours of each day may be so arranged as to permit the yiiii'iil of such Imm c&gt; at any time from six o'clock A. M. to ten k P.

You further state that this question is still bein^ I. and you are frequently re - quested to instit ions against telephone com - panies that employ females in violation of this law. it employment is prohibited thereby, and you wish to know whether it would not be advisable to institute a prosecution and have the question determined by a court of eomp jurisdiction. §is always advisable to have a law judicially interpn i there is any question about it. and I think you « istified in presenting tse so that this qu&lt; be passed upon by the coin ■our second inquiry rel ection '24 1 .

It is true that the ommon labor" are often applied to those who work at unskilled employment for daily wages, but I do not think that is the meaning intended by this act. If barber - ing should be exempted from the provisions of this act, I do not see why plumbers, carpenters, mechanics, and trades - men of all kinds should not also be excluded. It is true, our court has held that performances consisting of music, danc - ing and feats of contortion engaged in on Sunday are not within the prohibition of this section. It seems to me that performances of this kind, when placed upon the stage by those who follow that as a vocation, should come within the prohibition of the statute. This statute ought not to be limited to manual or menial labor only. In my judgment, barbering, or any other trade, pursued on Sunday is a viola - 4 this law, unless those engaged therein come within the exceptions therein designated. irnmon labor," as used in Acts 1855, p. 159, of the laws of Indiana, making it criminal for any person to engage at common labor on Sunday, means such acts of labor or business as may be performed on days of the week usually ■cular business in the pursuit of a legal em - ployment. (State v. Conger, 14 Ind., 396.) i statute forbidding the exercise of any common labor Sunday means ordinary labor as contradistinguished ii intellectual.

Your third question relates to sections 6929 to 6929x3, ( obbev's Annotated Statutes of 1911, which is an act passed by the last legislature to provide fire protection and fire escapes, and regulation thereof under the supervision of the commissioner of labor or deputy commissioner of labor, and repeals section 0929, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of </seg>

(obbey's Annoi .tutes i ou call my attention t&lt;&gt; the fact thai the proviso in this &gt;n wax held unconstitutional at one tine by owsun court, but you further say that in 1906 the legislature re - enacted this section and thereby cured the constitutional &lt;-t.

If this proviso was not ger - to the section when it was sought to be amended in 1901, it certainly was not germane to it in the act of 1906. The title to the act of 1905 was not enlarged, and no pi was made to incorporate the subject relating to the taking of surety bonds and the payment of same.

To lccision Justice McClain and Chief Justice Sherwin dissented. According to the majority opinion in that case, the test is whether the first indictment was such that the led might lawfully have been convicted under it on proof of the same facts as those by which the second is to -tained. The rule, as stated in the dissenting opinion of Justice McClain. is that the second prosecution will be barred only where the transaction for which the defendant nee been prosecuted is the same as that for which he is proceeded against on the second prosecution, or at least involves the same acts. It is asserted there that identity of transactions is the controlling consideration under the rule of the greatest number of cases. The dissenting opin - ion holds that where the prosecutor under the second indict - ment sought to prove a separate transaction from that proved in the first prosecution, a plea in bar of former jeopardy would not be good. This Iowa decision can clearly be dis - tinguished from those of other jurisdictions, becau - differences in existing statute ( )f course, your newly discovered evidence may relate to -nmc transaction between the parties upon which you did not rely in the first prosecution, the transaction described lion 20M). In that case, it would be my opinion that a plea of former jeopardy could not be interposed. I he legislature has sought to define two separate offenses. • one of which this man was acquitted is not so heinous ime as that which you now seek to charge, and it seems le that our court would agree with the Kansas, Alabama, - courts, which I have already quoted, that a man , be prosecuted for incest even after being acquitted rape, or vice versa.

The agent gets from fifty to seventy-five per of the first premium; the examining physician gets a ind other expenses are incurred, which leave but all margin to the company out of the first premium. A- a result, if the company is to set aside the legal reserve necessary under this twenty-payment life policy, it must take it from its surplus and not from the premium paid on ilicy. In other words the surplus accumulated from premiums paid by other policy-holders must provide the -i rve for this policy-holder. A young company, without a surplus, will find itself unable to set aside the legal reserve if it writes any considerable amount of buM To avoid the necessity of taking this reserve from a surplus, some new companies are writing the "First Year Preliminary Term Policy."

Hence, little, if any, reserve is necessary the tirst year, and the company can use practically all of the premium in paying the expense of getting the business. Beginning with the second year, this policy will be valued similarly with that of the twenty-payment life, but, as it is now, to all intents and purposes a nineteen-payment life policy, the annual reserve set aside will be larger than the annual reserve under the twenty-payment life. It has been argued that this "First Year Preliminary </seg>

Iiis new mortgage law, referred to by you, makes a gage an interest in real estate for the purposes of aaMM - i and taxation, and it also makes the taxes assessed le mortgagee or his assigns a lien on said mortgage est . Under this law, the mortgagee or his assigns may the tax levied on the interest of the owner of the land, have a lien thereon secured by the mortgage, to the it of the amount so paid, with lawful interest. The gagor or owner may pay the tax levied on the mort - intereist, and when so paid by him the same is to be 'ded as a payment on the indebtedness secured by the gage, and he may offset any interest due on the mort - to the extent of the taxes paid thereon. ■ is also provided that the holder of either the interest tie mortgagor or mortgagee may redeem from tax sale interest sold.

It is, of course, quite evident that irrigation works are ■imaged either in the transmission of messages or the transportation of passengers. Their object and purpose • niething quite different.

The application that the pro - of the sale of the bonds proposed to be issued are to be for all these purposes, and particularly specifies that a if it is to be used in building elevat. II is quite clear, from the reading of the section referred above, the legislature had in mind that the cuiii - aoo should authorize the issuance of bonds of public ice corporations, and those were corporations who e pretending to serve, and were actually serving, the lie, and that the commission could only authorize the anee for one of four purposes: 1.

It is difficult to lay down a rule that would apply to each and every case. Each application of this kind mu passed upon and determined by :t full consideration of the purposes and objects which the corporation has in view, and of the various kinds of business which it undertak perform. If the service of the public was the prime and cont rolling object of this corporation, and it was possessed of some other property or was compelled, incidentally, to take over some other property in the course of its business, which did not exactly relate to its business as a public irporation but which at some time in the near future it proposed to utilize for that purpose. I think the commission would still be authorized to make an order for the issuance of bonds under such circumstances. I d&lt; think your body is required to authorize the issuan bonds by a corporation in process of organization. th&gt; ceeds of which are to bs devoted to a multitude of purposes, which arc entirely foreign to the public service feature inplated by its articles of incorporation. There is another feature of the law which it is well to observe. It provides that the capital Mock of a torpor formed by the merger or consolidation of two or inon porations shall not exceed the sum of the capital stock of •orporati' nsolidated. at the par value th - or such sum or any additional sum actually paid in cash. From the application, I learn that this proposed company i&gt; to be a consolidation of two former companies, the combined capital stock of which does not equal the capital stock of the proposed company. It does not appear that any additional cash is to be placed in the new concern, but rather that the new concern is to be capitalized for an amount equal to the inventoried values of the probities of the other compa If this is the tru*&gt; situation and the new company is virtually isolidation of the two other companies, under these circumstances the statute would be a barrier to said o«n - latir&gt;™ rnerefore, in my judgment, in this particular case I do </seg>

On the other hand, if you should not agree with me in this, and should think that this is a case where you have the right to make an order, I would suggest that -&lt;&gt; made that the bond issue be governed according to &gt; mount which is to be devoted to the public service ire of the business, and that the accounts of the com - be kept separate and its business segregated so that any time in the future the commission may easily ascertain what portion of its capital is devoted to the public service ;m&lt;l what portion is used for other private inter*- This would act as a foundation for the fixing of service in case it became necessary in the future for the com - mission to deal with that subject. I have suggested that 11 would be necessary for the commission to deal with each application as presented, and that it can not be guided by any fixed rule applicable to all cases. This is apparent for ■ n that one class of companies might wish the commission to vouch for a bond issue and in order to secure ach to its general private business a small public service feature, whereas another class of companies doing a lerable public service business, and wishing to escape the liabilities of the act, might combine with it other private enterprises. Hence, it becomes necessary to deal with each case separately, and determine the course to be pursued by all the facts and circumstances surrounding the same. Very respectfully. (1RANT O.

The ite expressly imposes upon the magistrate the duty of certifying the record to the district court, and nowhere do I find any provision which expressly authorizes the magis - :&lt;&gt; demand payment of any of the costs as a condition inlent to his performing that duty. lion 836, Code of Criminal Procedure, provides that he defendant is convicted in the district court, judgment for the costs before the magistrate, as well as judgment for costs in the district court, shall be assessed at him. This supports me in the view that transcript costs in the inferior court can not be legally exacted of the ■ lant before the magistrate makes his return of the proceedings to the appellate court. ion !i4t&gt;4, Cobbey's Annotated Statutes of 1911, which nigly permits of certain officers demanding advance payment of fees of this kind, has not been overlooked. More than twenty years after this enactment, our supreme court held that a constable had no right to refuse to summon a jury for the trial of a .misdemeanor case unless his fees were n advance. It is likely that this section escaped the court's attention when considering the case of Beach v. State, 27 Xeb., 400. However, this observation should be made: said section 9464 requires "the party, for whom any service is to be rendered, to pay the fees in advance," whereas said section 324, Code of Criminal Procedure, imposes upon the magistrate the duty of certifying a trans - script of the proceedings to the district court. A duty imposed upon the magistrate by statute can hardly be con - sidered a "service" rendered a party for which he is required to pay in advance. It may be that the conclusion reached </seg>
