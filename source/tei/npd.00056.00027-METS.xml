            <seg id="p002">SUMMARY 1. The soil and climatic conditions in the high altitude region of western Nebraska are suitable for the production and perpetuation of high-yielding seed potatoes. 2. Tuber line studies, with numerous lots of different varieties, revealed early and late maturing strains as well as a type of degeneracy very similar to, or identical with, "spindling tuber" (recently described by Shultz and Folsom). 3. This degeneracy manifests itself by a stiff, upright habit of growth and by an elongation of the tubers. Strains affected by it never recover, but become progressively weaker. 4. The degeneracy most common in western Nebraska is per - petuated thru the tubers and appears to be transmitted from plant to plant in the field. 5. Irrigation produces conditions more conducive to the rapid increase of this degeneracy than dry land culture, the per cent of degeneracy increasing and the yield decreasing with each additional year of irrigation. 6. This type of degeneracy has been studied in 10 different va rieties. 7. Many lots from isolated fields in the newer dry land potato growing sections are relatively free from this degeneracy. 8. This type of degeneracy causes very serious decrease in tuber yields till eventually no marketable tubers are produced. 9. Seed stocks produced on dry land at the highest altitude proved to be superior in point of quality and yield of tubers produced, when planted in comparative trials. </seg>
            <seg id="p003">SEED POTATO INVESTIGATIONS* H. O. WERNER AND R. F. HOWARD Accepted for Publication July. 1913 INTRODUCTION The Irish potato is one of the important cultivated crops in Nebraska. The average annual production for the 10-year period 1913-22 was 9,179,000 bushels. Approximately 75 per cent of the car lot shipments originate in 7 of the western counties. The other commercial shipping regions, which normally harvest and market their crops somewhat earlier than the western counties, are the Platte and Republican River Valleys in the south central and Brown County in the north central part of the State. The potato is also grown as an early truck crop near the cities of eastern Nebraska. The total garden production thruout the State is approxi - mately equal to the car lot shipments. The climatic and soil conditions of western Nebraska are especially suitable for the production of late potatoes. The altitude of this section is over 3,500 feet, thus making a short growing season, with a mean temperature of 66° to 68° F. (figs. 1 and 2). In these respects the conditions in western Nebraska are similar to those in the potato growing regions of Wisconsin, Minnesota, Michigan, and North Dakota (Reed, 1918). The annual rainfall in western Nebraska is 15 to 18 inches (fig. 3), while the potato regions of the Northern States have a precipitation of 20 to 30 inches (Kincer, 1922). This same relative difference exists when only summer rain - fall is considered. Relative humidity is also lower in western Nebraska. The relation between satisfactory yields and good seed has long been recognized by potato growers. It is common practice in the Cornbelt area and the Southern States to import frequently fresh or "northern grown" seed in order to maintain satisfactory yields. This has led to the belief that the productive quality of tubers is in some way associated with conditions under which the seed is produced. Until * These investigations were begun in 1917 as a joint project by the Departments of Horticulture and Agronomy. Since 1919, H. O. Werner, Associate Horticulturist, has had direct supervision of the work. </seg>
            <seg id="p004">Nebraska Experiment Station, Research Bul. 24 4 recently this belief has been a common one in western Ne - braska, even tho certain climatic conditions there are very similar to those of the northern seed-producing states. Many western Nebraska growers have demonstrated, however, that satisfactory yields may be maintained indefinitely by the use of local seed, especially that produced on dry land. Attempts have been made to determine why yields de - crease when the potato crop is grown under certain unfavor - able climatic conditions. Emerson (1914) compared northern seed with local seed at Lincoln. He noted a 23 per cent re - duction in yield the second year as a result of culture for a Fig. 1. — Altitude variation (in feet) in Nebraska (after Warren). The altitude ranges from less than 1,000 feet in the southeastern part of the State to more than 5,250 feet in the western part i Kimball County). The seed potato industry has been most extensively de - veloped in the areas above 3,500 feet. Altitude of trial plats given in Table 1. single season in eastern Nebraska. This reduction in yield was 32 per cent after 2 years and 46 per cent after 8 years of continuous culture at Lincoln. In connection with this work he grew certain plats under a heavy straw mulch. The tubers produced under a mulch gave yields the following year almost identical with those from fresh northern stock. Yields did not decrease with continuous mulching. He found, further, that potatoes which had deteriorated as a result of cultivation could be rejuvenated to their original productive - ness by growing them under a mulch for a single season. It has since been found (Werner, 1922) that the soil tempera - ture (at a depth of 4 inches) is lower in the mulched plat. </seg>
            <seg id="p005">Seed Potato Investigations 5 The mean difference for the period April 15th to August 28th was 7° F. This difference was from 4° to 6° greater during July and August. In the Atlantic Coast and Southern States, the production of a late or fall crop of potatoes for use as seed stock the following spring is quite a common practice. Such potatoes have been found to be almost equal to northern seed. (Rosa, 1922; Cooper, 1922.) Such a fall or second crop is developed under relatively low temperatures. This further suggests that temperature is an important contributing factor in de - termining the relative vigor of seed potatoes. Fig. 2. — Normal isotherm map of Nebraska, for the late potato crop season (June 1 to September 30), based on temperature records taken at U. S. Weather Bureau observation stations for period of 10 years or more. Numbers with dots refer to name, etc., of trial plats given in Table 1. Commercial seed potato production has not developed south or east of the 68° isotherm. In the light of the temperature relations referred to above, it seemed reasonable to suppose that good seed could be pro - duced in the high altitude regions of western Nebraska. Pre - liminary trials were made with western Nebraska stock at Lincoln (1915 and 1916) and various points in Southern States (1916) with a view of determining the seed value of this stock. Most of these lots gave very satisfactory yields when compared with seed from various northern seed-pro - ducing states. Later and more comprehensive tests of a similar nature revealed a large number of high-yielding west - ern Nebraska lots.

            <seg id="p007">Seed Potato investigations 7 The mosaic disease is known to be one of the most impor - tant factors affecting potato production in the South. These trials showed that mosaic was less prevalent in seed from Ne - braska than in that from the more humid regions in the states farther east and north.* (Edgerton and Tiebout, 1921; Tiebout, 1921.) Fig. 3. — Average annual precipitation for different sections of Nebraska (inches). Based on U. S. Weather Bureau records. (From Nebr. Research Bui. 19.) Data for various trial plats in Table 1. In the tests made at Lincoln in 1915-1916 with seed from western Nebraska there was considerable variation in yield. These differences in yield together with the uncertainty as to the necessity of importing northern seed into western Ne - braska justified further investigation. * Mosaic readings made April 23-24, 1923, at Baton Rouge, La., by Werner, on 81 distinct lots of western Nebraska Triumph seed showed distinct mosaic symptoms on 4.8 per cent of the plants. In the same trials Wisconsin seed (4 lots) averaged 10.1 per cent, North Dakota (5 lots) 17.1 per cent, Montana (8 lots) 3.0 per cent, and three check lots picked up on local markets 56.9 per cent. In these same trials, 26 Nebraska lots contained from 0 to 1.0 per cent mosaic. Simi - lar readings were made and reported by Tiebout and Edgerton, 1921. (Trials conducted by Louisiana State Experiment Station, and U. S. D. A.-B. P. I.) </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 Nebraska Experiment Station, Research Bul. 24 OBJECTS OF INVESTIGATIONS The objects of the investigations reported in this bulletin were: To determine the condition of western Nebraska seed stock by the tuber unit method and by comparative trials in western Nebraska and various other points. To determine the effect of culture, place, disease, etc., upon seed value. To perfect methods of applying results to seed production in western Nebraska. EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS LOCATION OF PLATS AND DISEASE CONTROL PRECAUTIONS All of the experimental plats were located in the western part of the State except two— one at Kearney and one at Lincoln. The soil type, altitude, moisture and temperature conditions, and the name of the cooperating grower, together with plat number, are shown in Table 1. The plats are referred to by town and number in the tables and discussion. The experimental plantings were usually made in a com - mercial field. The usual methods of disease control were employed. The plantings were always made on land that had not been in potatoes for the 3 or 4 previous years. The seed was dis - infected with corrosive sublimate except in a few instances where the tubers had sprouted excessively. Blackleg was almost entirely absent. Fusarium was never present to any great extent in any of the plats. A relatively small per cent of mosaic has been found to exist in western Nebraska. This is comprehensively shown by the fact that the 81 different lots, when grown in Louisiana, under optimum conditions for making mosaic symptoms visible, showed only 4.8 per cent of this disease. Whenever plants affected with mosaic were discovered they were removed from the plats. TUBER UNIT TRIALS TRIALS IN 1917 Preliminary tests made before 1917 showed a wide vari - ation in the productivity of various lots of western Nebraska seed potatoes. It was apparent in most cases that a given lot contained both productive and unproductive plants. In order to study the nature of these variations, tuber unit trials were begun in 1917. The early tuber unit trials con - sisted in selecting a large number of uniform tubers of differ - ent varieties from cellars of commercial growers and plant- </seg>

Each tuber was cut lengthwise into 4 equal parts and these seed pieces planted in adjacent spaces in the row. The space between the 4 hill units was the same as that be - tween hills. Each tuber unit was numbered and labeled by means of a wire stake and metal tag. One thousand Triumph tubers were selected from some Scotts Bluff County irrigated stock and planted by the tuber Fig. 4. — Total yield produced by 50 consecutive tuber units of Triumph potatoes in Scotts Bluff County, 1917, (Plat 9).

Striking uniformity of the 4 plants within a unit and a remarkable difference in vigor between units were plainly evident as the season pro - gressed. Within a unit the 4 plants were similar not only in general appearance but also in habit of growth, size, and date of maturity. At harvest time it was found that the hills within a unit were also uniform with regard to tuber type and yield. The differences between the units are illustrated by </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 Nebraska Experiment Station, Research Bul. 24 Eriation in yield from 0 to 20 pounds. In figure 4 the jlds of 50 consecutive units are graphically shown. This aph is representative of the other 950 units. The high and low yielding units were found thruout the field in such manner as to show that they were the result of conditions within the seed tubers rather than of varying soil conditions. The end hill of a good unit adjacent to a poor one was favored to some extent on account of better growing conditions. However, reasoning from the work of Stewart (1915), the uncorrected error per 4-hill unit in such Fig. 5. — Distribution of yield per unit of 450 Triumph tuber units, on basis of percentage of total number and total weight, Scotts Bluff County, 1917, irrigation, (Plat 9). A bimodal curve of this type is unusual. The left curve comprises all poor type run-out units, the right-hand curve comprises vigorous high yielding good type units. The individual unit yields (of 50 units) plotted in figure 4 show how the units of both groups were scattered thruout the field. This group of units was in a rapidly degenerating condition. cases was probably not more than 6 to 8 per cent. The units fell into 2 distinct groups, high yielding and low yielding. Of the total number of units, 44.4 per cent produced only 18.8 per cent of the total yield. Thus 55.6 per cent of the units produced 81.2 per cent of the yield. When these facts are shown graphically for the 450 units that were harvested, they produce the bimodal curve shown in figure 5. The low yielding units were characterized by a vigor proportionate to yield and a distinctly upright habit of growth. They were further characterized by having few stems, generally not branched. The tubers from such plants were often elon - gated and the skin color was much lighter than normal. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Seed Potato Investigations 11 These all were in the left modal group. The right modal group contained the vigorous high yielding lots of better type. The same year 266 Triumph units from dry land stock were planted in a similar manner at Alliance (Plat 11).

Altho the average yield of Triumph potatoes was 219.45 bushels per acre, a high yield for dry land culture, a number of units yielded 300 bushels or more per acre. account of this plat being dry land, the unit yields were less than in Scotts Bluff County — the 4-hill unit production being from Vfe to 10 pounds. The yields from the units of this stock produce the normal curve shown in figure 6. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 Nebraska Experiment Station, Research Bul. 24 A like number (266) of dry land Early Ohio tubers were also planted at Alliance (Plat 14). The yields from these Fig. 7. — Graphic presentation of total yield data for the first 50 tuber units of Pearl potatoes, of units 1 to 250, grown at Kimball, 1917, (Plat 4) with irrigation. Variations between tuber units were mostly due to variation in the seed. Land variation was not a serious factor for frequently very low and very high yielding units were adjacent in the row. The low producing units were degenerates and generally had poor type tubers. See also figure 8 and Tables 2 and 5. </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Seed Potato Investigations 13 were somewhat lower, altho in general the results were very similar to those secured with Triumphs at the same place (fig. 6). The unit studies with the Pearl variety in Kimball County differed from the others somewhat, in that both dry land and irrigated stock were planted; under irrigation in one instance (Plat 4) and on dry land in another (Plat 3). The original stock of this variety came from Wisconsin in 1910. From this stock 500 tubers were selected from a lot that had been grown on dry land the seven years previous and an equal number from a lot which had been grown with irriga - tion during the same period. Half of these tubers — that is, 250 tubers of each lot — were planted on dry land and the remainder under irrigation, for the additional purpose of determining the influence of continuous irrigation and of dry land culture on the stock. Variations of both seed stocks under both sets of cultural conditions were not unlike those secured at Alliance with Triumphs and Ohios. The yields of 50 irrigated units from continuously irrigated stock are shown graphically in figure 7. The difference in yield under irrigation between irrigated and dry land seed stock was not great. However, the range in variation as well as total yield was slightly greater in the case of the continuous dry land stock (Table 2 and fig. 8). The average yield per hill and the extremes in yield were greater in the irrigated plat than under dry land conditions. A study of this table and the related chart (fig. 8) shows that the yields of the units were distributed along a normal frequency curve with the highest number of units yielding at any one rate (mode) relatively close to the average yield of the lot (mean). In view of later work, it is believed that the reason the dry land stock did not outyield the continuously irrigated seed in this particular case (which was rather ex - ceptional) was because the grower of the irrigated stock an - nually was more careful in selecting his seed for type, thus probably eliminating some undesirable strains or disease carrying tubers. The correlation of weight and number of marketable (U. S. No. 1 grade) tubers per 4-hill unit of 250 continuously irri - gated units grown under irrigation is shown in Table 3. The more vigorous units not only produced more potatoes, but also developed more large tubers. The low-yielding Pearl units were also characterized by weak, spindling tops and the tubers from such plants were </seg>

A few produced uniformly strong plants while others gave both strong and weak plants (Table 8). In most in - stances where strong units produced weak plants, all hills from a given tuber were affected. In a few instances, how - ever, as in 1917, both strong and weak hills appeared from the same tuber. The behavior of 3 Pearl units is shown in figure 9. Unit 362 was a poor unit in 1917 and its progeny was weak in 1918; unit 374 was strong and its progenv was strong; while the progeny of the strong unit No. 50 pro - duced both strong and weak units. Other data are shown in Table 6 to further illustrate the performance of good and poor unit strains. Tubers from plants marked as showing "curl," *'curly dwarf," and "incipient curl" gave progenies which the next year were uniformly poor with regard to vine vigor, plant yield, and tuber type. Seed stock was saved from several of the uniformly vigor - ous Pearl units in 1918 for future study. Within 3 years, however, all of these had broken up and produced nothing but weak strains (Table 7). The rapidity with which this took place is illustrated in figure 10, the tubers in each pile being the product of 10 hills in 1920. The two 10-hill lots were grown adjacent to each other and came from adjacent hills of the same tuber unit in 1919. The behavior of the irrigated Triumph units in succeeding years was similar to that of the Pearls (Table 8). The per cent of weak units was greater in this Triumph stock (fig. 5) in 1917 and the strong units later broke up more rapidly and more completely. The weak units of this stock when planted on dry land at Alliance in 1918 continued weak. In 1918 and 1919, vigorous units from dry land were planted under irrigation together with vigorous units from irrigated stock. The dry land stock did not break up as rapidly as irrigated stock. In addition to the vigor differences of the units noted above, there were among normal plants striking differences in vigor and dates of maturity. DEGENERACY IN WESTERN NEBRASKA It was apparent from the tuber unit studies that there is a condition in western Nebraska seed stock which causes potatoes affected by it to deteriorate very rapidly, as meas - ured by yield and type of tubers. It was found that this degenerate condition is tuber borne, that there are different </seg>

Irrigated stock, as indicated by the trials already referred to and others to be mentioned later, seems to be affected more severely than dry land seed.

Each bar represents yield produced by a 4-hill tuber unit in 1918, from one of the tubers produced in the 1917 4-hill tuber unit. Unit 362 yielded below the mean in 1917 and produced elongated tubers. It produced only poor plants and poor tubers in 1918. Unit 50, which was a high yielding unit in 1917 (fig. 7), started to break up into good and poor units in 1918. Unit 374, which was high yielding in 1917, continued to be high yielding in 1918 without any indications of breaking up (Table 7). (This difference in the behavior of units 50 and 374 is probably due to difference in their relative proximity to degenerate units in 1917.) </seg>

            <seg id="p024">24 Nebraska Experiment Station, Research Bul. 24 COMPARISON WITH OTHER DEGENERATION DISEASES The most common type of degeneracy found in western Nebraska may be described as follows: TUBER CHARACTERISTICS Shape. — Long, cylindrical, and pointed at the bud end. In mild cases tubers are only slightly elongated and more blocky than normal. In very extreme cases the tubers are sometimes very ill-shaped and crooked (figs. 13, 14, 19, 21, 22). Flat varieties become cylindrical and much elongated Fig. 10.— At left, product in 1920 of 10 Pearl hills from one 1919 hill,— 14-4-19; at right, product of 10 hills from adjoining 1919 hill of same unit, — 14-4-20. Unit at left yielded 120 bushels per acre: unit at right, 29.3 bushels. Note high per cent of small and run out tubers in pile at right. (fig. 13). Tubers are very subject to growth cracks but are seldom knobby. Stolons are thickened, from 3 to 4 times the diameter of normal stolons. Size. — The size is frequently reduced, tho not always. Color and texture of skin. — The color of the skin of red or pink varieties is distinctly lighter than that of normal tubers and very commonly is yellowish or blotched. The skin is generally smoother and frequently has a shiny appearance. Russet varieties frequently do not develop russeting or develop it only in patches. In the more advanced type, lenticels are very numerous, large, and conspicuous. Eyes. — Very numerous, shallow and even bulging. The skin within and around the eyes of Triumphs is generally a deep red. Some eyes never sprout while others start much </seg>
            <seg id="p025">Seed Potato Investigations 25 later than normal. Rudimentary leaflets are frequently pro - duced on the newly formed tubers toward the end of the growing season. PLANT CHARACTERISTICS General habit of growth. — The plants lack vigor. They are erect, stiff, and spindling, with very few stems per hill. Stems have practically no lateral branches (figs. 12 and 20). Leaves. — Are smaller and generally somewhat darker in color, with an erect, stiff appearance. They are folded up - ward slightly along the midrib and have a distinct waving of the margin. These are the first symptoms noticed on slightly affected plants. Flowers. — Conspicuous because the blossom stems are stiff and more erect, generally extending above the leaves more than in normal plants. Degenerate plants have a tendency to bloom more profusely and to produce more seed balls. The dead blossoms adhere to degenerate plants longer than to normal plants. The naked blossom stems are much in evi - dence on spindling tuber plants until the end of the growing season. These symptoms characterize plants in the extreme stages of degeneracy. Early stages are difficult to detect. Plants apparently normal may produce tubers showing "run-out" symptoms. Likewise, apparently normal good type tubers may produce plants with symptoms of degeneracy. On the other hand, tubers showing distinct degeneracy symptoms never produce normal plants. It will be noted that this description does not correspond to that in published reports of mosaic, leaf roll, spindle sprout, and several of the other diseases considered as degeneration diseases. It does, however correspond very closely to that given for spindling tuber (Shultz and Folsom, 1923; and Fol - som, 1923), and is somewhat similar to a type of degeneracy found and illustrated by Stewart (1916) but without special comment. This spindling tuber type of degeneracy differs primarily from mosaic (as commonly understood) and leaf roll, in that it does not cause a mottling or crinkling of the leaves, nor has a net necrotic condition of the tubers been observed. It also differs from these 2 diseases in that the tuber type is distinctly influenced. The work reported herein suggests that the mode of transmission of this degeneracy trouble is similar to that of mosaic, which is tuber borne and insect transmitted. </seg>

PREVALENCE OF DEGENERACY The type of degeneracy described above has been found in in all experimental plats and in many fields in all parts of western Nebraska. It has probably been present there for a considerable length of time but seems to have become much more prevalent the last few years. This is indicated by the fact that it has been observed in all varieties and in prac - tically all the numerous lots which have been grown in con - nection with this investigation.

Very definite corre - lations between vigor of vine, type of tuber, and yield of tubers (or tuber production) were observed. In 1920, 114 Triumph tuber units were planted near Bay - ard (Plat 7) with tubers selected from that many high yield - ing hills in a plat on the same farm in 1919. The plants and tubers of each unit were scored on a numerical basis for both vine vigor and tuber type, using 1 for the lowest and 10 for the highest relative development.

Tuber type of vigor - ous units was best, but was lowered when units grew in close proximity to weak run-out units. (See Table 9, also figs. 16 and 23.) was from 1 to 10 and in tuber type from 1 to 9 (Table 9). When the vine vigor was below 8 the plants generally showed some of the distinct degeneracy symptoms. When the tuber type scored below 7 the symptoms of degeneracy in the tubers were not all apparent but the tubers were generally consider - ably elongated. However, when the tubers scored below 5 a number of the symptoms were distinctly in evidence. The exact 1920 field location of each of these 114 units, together with the relative plant vigor and tuber type score for each unit, is shown in figure 15. (This figure will be referred to later, in connection with field transmission studies.) A very distinct correlation between good tuber type and good vine vigor was discovered. Vigorous plants produced the bet - ter type tubers, while the plants of low vigor almost invari - ably produced only poor type tubers. (See Table 9, also fig. 18, fig. 22 and Table 6.) Both Table 9 and fig. 15 show that the decline in tuber type was greater than in vine vigor. /92O 7l/St/- O&gt;rit /YurTt6*r3 / z 3 ¥ S f ?. 3 * 5 / Z 3 4 5 *,-r*l U &gt;/}'° I"/!' 0 l"« 1 ■* [* P |4 N I \i |J B I* 15 r77Si /Jl _» ii _«. «J " r Li m * ' * 3 t «_ 4 s 1 18 I 1 W 8T~ V7 9 T" * T^ 9" t «" _/. i _£ _J_ _£_ »4 t _j_ _z_ £I_T m i i s * t f. 4 |r |r « &gt; e \t » j r « 5 r « s ■STAb Jl ri j * •" /I / J j ¥ i 1 " e list %, i k/i v" *.-* '• w "&gt; io v_ * * ir-*^r- « HTi ?7« I* $ * o i y '* r^r j Vs» t, r/y 7 M^£.JL^_^&amp;^L m I I / 11 y?j&lt;i rl/yi/a, tl &gt;l m, t[/A n a\ t,\ "H/H a\ r\ n 2 \ m W*le*&gt;** tutur typt \s A\ f, r€ tutrtr units frtm t </seg>

(For field location of units, see fig. 15; for vigor and tuber type, see Table 9.) It is evident that this group of units was degenerating rapidly and that such degeneracy was more evident in the tuber type than in the vine vigor. The yield records secured for 40 of the 1920 Triumph units in the Bayard plat showed a very direct correlation be - tween high plant vigor and high yield of tubers (fig. 16). Very poor yields were secured from the units of low plant vigor. The loss here from an economic standpoint was two - fold, for it has just been shown (Table 9 and fig. 15) that these plants of low vigor also produce only poor type tubers. Similar results with Pearl unit selections in Kimball County in 1920 are shown in figure 17. (See also Tables 5, 6, and 7.) </seg>

EFFECT OF CULTURE AND PLACE UPON DEGENERACY The general condition of the seed potato stocks in the irrigated regions of western Nebraska has been very unsatis - factory. It has been common experience that good new stock would produce high yields for 1 or 2 years, after which the yield and tuber type rapidly deteriorated. During recent years, dry land grown seed has been found to give satisfactory results. Trials have shown that as a class irrigated seed does not yield as well as dry land seed. (Werner, 1920, 1921.) This has also been borne out by the experience of practical growers (Janssen, 1919; Sheldon, 1920, 1921; Parrish, 1921; *m*\ •1 * H M * ** H • | ." • t^ • « !• 3 /»« • : </seg>

Some preliminary reports have shown that additional years of culture under irrigation aggravate this condition (Werner, 1920, 1921). Other investigators have reported upon the behavior of dry land and irrigated seed potatoes. Schollander in North Dakota (1912), Archer in Idaho (1920), and Edmundson in Colorado (1922) reported practically no differences in the yielding qualities of irrigated and dry land seed. Apparently they had only healthy, normal seed. Whipple (1919) ad - vanced the idea that dry land conditions in Montana, which resulted in a considerable check in growth of the plants, were not satisfactory for the production of seed potatoes, and pos - sibly were a factor in causing degeneracy.

            <seg id="p035">Seed Potato Investigations 35 The Nebraska results cannot be interpreted to correspond entirely to those of the above investigations, since degeneracy has been found to be more prevalent in irrigated stock, and affected plants or tubers never recover to the point of giving satisfactory yields; and, furthermore, the best seed stock has been grown on dry land. It is believed that irrigation as such is not the cause of the degenerate condition herein described, but that the growing conditions afforded by irrigation are more conducive to the development of degeneration diseases. Since this type of degeneracy appears to be similar to mosaic in its mode of transmission, this assumption seems to be Fig. 19. — Tuber types from strains of potatoes in various stages of degeneration, in Scotts Bluff County (Plat 9), 1920. Lower row grown from new dry land seed from Alliance (Plat 14). Middle row grown in Scotts Bluff irrigated plat one year. Top row grown in irrigated plat two years. Note increased elongation and roughness, also more numerous and more shallow eyes. All stock was grown in irrigated plat containing degenerate strains. Two lower rows are from same original tuber in 1917. in accord with the work of Elmer (1922), who reported that infection with mosaic was most easily accomplished when growing conditions were such as to produce an unchecked, vigorous growth. Carefully conducted experiments with tuber line strains from irrigated and dry land stock were made at Kimball, Alliance, Minatare, Bayard, and Mitchell to determine the relation of irrigation practice to degeneracy (no degenerate </seg>

Similar tests were made at Morrill, 1920 to 1922, with dry land and irrigated seed of 10 different varieties. The high yielding Triumph units from the 1917 Alliance tuber unit plat (dry land) were planted the following year under irrigation in Scotts Bluff County. Their average yield was at the rate of 403.7 bushels per acre, or approximately 4 times as great as the yield secured from several units selected from the 1917 irrigated plat. The yields of these dry land lots decreased very materially under irrigation. A very large number of degenerate plants were present in these irrigated plats. (Table 12, columns 3, 4, 5, 6.) In 1921 some of the stock irrigated 3 years was planted on dry land. The yield from this stock when planted under irrigation (123.2 bu.) was 28.6 per cent greater than that of the same strain grown for 4 consecutive years with irrigation (91.3 bu.). (Table 12, columns 7, 6. ) In 1919 one-half of the tubers of each of 2 other tuber line strains from the dry land plat at Alliance were planted under irrigation, and the remaining tubers retained under dry land culture. This was repeated for 3 years. Seed stock was also saved each year from the irrigated plat. The yields decreased with each succeeding year of irrigation when com - pared with fresh dry land seed (Table 12, columns 4, 5, 6). Some of this stock was also grown on dry land after 1 and 2 years' irrigation and then planted in comparison with irri - gated (1, 2 and 3 years) and fresh dry land seed. When irrigated stock was grown 1 year on dry land it gave an increased yield in comparison with continuously irrigated seed, but the apparent rejuvenation was far from complete, since its production was less than 50 per cent of that of tresh dry land seed (Table 12, columns 6, 7) . Some of this recovery is probably due to the fact that the dry land conditions of the 1921 plat were very severe, resulting in most of the weak plants being killed early in the season. It is probable, therefore, that only the 'stronger units of this plat were used as seed. This natural selection did not maintain for the irri - gated stock, because here even the weaker units produced tubers of seed size. ' The decreased yields referred to in these tests were due to the type of degeneracy previously described, since they were accompanied by the progressive deterioration in vine and tuber type shown in figs. 19, 20, and 21.

            <seg id="p039">Seed Potato Investigations 39 further emphasized by the trials with different varieties. In 1919 the original seed of 10 varieties was secured from various sources in the north and west. Each variety was divided into a number of small lots, which were distributed to the trial plats located at various places. Each year a representative lot of good type seed was selected from ah varieties in each trial plat. Some of this material was shipped to a central point for storage, to be used in a comparative plat on an irrigated farm near Morrill. By this means it was possible to compare the same original stock of 10 varieties after it had been grown from one to three years under irri - gation and on dry land. Each variety was planted in a sepa - rate row in all plats. The planting order in each of the plats was: Triumph, Early Ohio, Irish Cobbler, Downing, Pearl, Rural New Yorker, Russet Rural New Yorker, Green Moun - tain, Russet Burbank, and King. All of these were good vigorous strains except the Triumph and Irish Cobbler. These were retained, but more satisfactory strains of these 2 va - rieties were later included. The results from seed potatoes produced at Bushnell (dry land) and Morrill (irrigated) are shown in Table 13. Dry land stock when planted under irriga - tion produced a greater total yield than any lots of the same variety originally from dry land but given 1 to 3 years of irrigated culture. Each additional year of irrigation re - sulted in a relatively greater decrease in total yield of everj variety. The market quality was also poorer in all lots trom irrigated seed. In 1922 the degenerate or "run-out" (elongated, light colored) tubers of No. 1 size were weighed separately. The percentage of these tubers appearing in the different lots is shown in column 23, Table 13. With a single exception the dry land stock produced a smaller proportion of run-out tubers than any of the irrigated lots of the same variety. This degeneracy increased quite regularly with each additional year of irrigation. Thus, the mean per cent of degenerate tubers for all dry land lots was 9.7, after 1 year of irrigation 29.4, and after 3 years of irrigation 44.9. The No. 2's and culls contained even a larger percentage of run-out tubers. There was also an increase in the per cent of No. 2 and cull grade potatoes and a decrease in No. 1 grade (columns 20, 21,22), The effect of place combined with that of culture is shown for 6 varieties in Tables 14 and 15. The stock was grown at different places for varying lengths of time and then brought to the irrigated plat at Morrill for comparison. Some </seg>

            <seg id="p046">46 Nebraska Experiment Station, Research Bul. 24 of the points at which the seed was produced were irrigated and others were not. The Morrill and Bayard plats were located on relatively flat land that could be irrigated readily. The irrigated Kimball plat never received sufficient water to produce a maximum crop, while proper irrigation of the Minatare plat was difficult because of light soil and rougn topography. The highest yields from the trials at Morrill were gen - erally secured from the Bushnell dry land seed (Table 14). For this reason the total yield from this stock has been considered as 100 in the presentation of data. Yields from the other seed are given on the basis of per cent of yield compared with Bushnell stock. The yields from the Chadron stock were generally second to Bushnell, while all irrigated lots were considerably lower than these dry land lots. The reduced yields noted in Table 13 as the result of continued irrigation were consistently borne out by these trials. The percentages of No. 1 tubers of the different lots dis - cussed above are shown in Table 15. This is further evi - dence that irrigation of seed stocks affected the market quality of the tubers the following year. The direct relationship of tuber type to yield is shown in Table 13, columns 11 and 14. Whenever the tuber type was low the yield was correspondingly light. Deterioration in tuber type in irrigated stock is shown in the notes for tuber type as associated with yield for in - dividual tuber units of several varieties when grown under irrigation and on dry land (Table 11). The irrigated seed which produced lower yields and poor quality tubers also produced plants with distinctive degen - erate symptoms. The fresh dry land seed seldom produced degenerate or run-out plants the first year under irrigation. A few of the plants from seed irrigated 1 year showed serious degeneration, while many others exhibited mild symp - toms of degeneracy. Stock grown under irrigation 3 years generally produced only degenerate plants, most of them in the more advanced stages. Seed from the various irrigated plats gave relatively the same results. TRANSMISSION OF DEGENERACY Data already presented show conclusively that the type of degeneracy considered here is transmitted from one genera - tion of plants to the next thru the tubers. Tubers showing characteristic run-out symptoms never produced normal plants and tubers. Furthermore, a tuber line strain from </seg>

(Table 16.) Many tubers in such cases be - come so degenerate that they will not produce plants, thus accounting for many missing hills in some fields. As de - generacy progresses, the symptoms become more pronounced in both tops and tubers, and the yield is reduced (Table 13 and figs. 19, 20, and 21). This transmission applies to tuber type, vigor, type of plant growth, and yield. Low yielding units were not brought back to a normal condition by tuber line selection or by growing them in a possibly more favorable environment. Direct tuber transmission as just outlined can not account for the amount and rate of spread of degeneracy occurring in some lots. All high yielding tuber units from the Pearls and irrigated Triumphs eventually degenerated. In other cases, when degenerate and vigorous units were grown in close proximity to each other, the degeneration noticed later in the progeny from the vigorous units can be explained only by the assumption that this degeneracy is communicated from one plant to another in the field.

However, the earlier data yield many facts which are very suggestive. • A careful study of the field notes and data concerning the tuber units planted in 1917 and 1918 in Kimball and Scotts Bluff Counties (Table 8) has been made. Frequently when the progeny of good, vigorous hills produced plants ranging from good to poor, it was discovered that during the previous MMon the good unit was growing adjacent in the row to a poor degenerate unit (Table 8, units 173, 254, 278, 291. 358. and 366). The high percentage of degenerate plants in the Triumph field at Minatare in 1917 resulted in the distribution &lt;&gt;f poor plants thruout the entire field, so that practically all units degenerated in 1918. This is very suggestive that transmission took place during the growing season. The planting plan of the 1919 Kimball plat is given as Table 17. The adjacence of lot 923 (line e) to the very poor lots 13 and 19 in the next row very probably permitted of field transmission and may explain the rapid decrease in the ■ luality of lot 923 (Table 7). Further suggestive evidence on this point can be secured from figure 15. Some of the Triumph units at Bayard pro - duced very vigorous vines but very poor tubers. It is quite Itoasible that infection took place during the growing season and that the plant was not noticeably affected but that such infection was sufficient to influence the shape of the tubers The following year (1921) all selected units (marked in fig. 15) produced degenerate plants and tubers. In order to determine the extent of field transmission. M»me badly run-out tubers from 2 degenerating unit strains (560 and 580) of Triumphs were planted alternately in the row with good vigorous seed stock (T13) secured from a very good field in Kimball County. These plantings were made at the Scotts Bluff Experiment Farm on both irrigated and dry land in 1921. The seed used was the same in each plat, one-half of each tuber being planted in each plat.

            <seg id="p049">Seed Potato Investigations 49 Fable 17 — Relative position in field of unit lines and per cent of disease con ti a t in Table 18 show that the yield from the degenerated strains was very much less in 1921 than from the new healthy stock (T13). The close proximity of the run-out stock did not seem to have an adverse influence upon the yield of tubers in 1921. The healthy stock planted alternately with the most degenerate lot (560) actually yielded more than the same healthy stock planted elsewhere by itself (lines f, h, i, j, Table 18). (This may have been due to the lack of compe - tition on the part of the run-out plants). However, the proximity apparently had some influence upon the tuber type, for these same good lots adjacent to these same run-out lots showed some deterioration in tuber type in 1921 (Table 18, column 6), in comparison with the checks. (See fig. 22.) This condition of degeneracy showing conspicuously in the tuber type of vigorous lots and not in the vines has been noted frequently (see fig. 15). IVarl |x&gt;tatoes— Kiniball.

            <seg id="p051">Seed Potato Investigations 51 In 1922 the total yield from the normal vigorous stock was only a trifle greater than from the degenerate stocks (Table 18, column 8). There was a greater difference in the yield of grade No. 1 stock. The tuber type was only slightly better (column 9). Evidently proximity had some effect in hastening degeneracy, as the check lots (line j) which had been grown in a separate part of the same dry land plat and the new stock from the original field (line k) both outyielded the formerly normal stock (T13) by a margin of approximately 100 bushels per acre. There was some difference in the relationship of the 2 degenerate strains to the normal strain, as the T13 lots adjoining the 580 lots (Table 18, line (1) ) did not deteriorate as much in yield or type as those adjacent to the more in - ferior 560 lots. Fig. 22. — Tubers produced by normal and run-out tubers when plants were alternated in same row. First and third from left, from nor - mal tuber. Note extreme elongation and small size of "run-out" stock, also somewhat elongated shape of tubers from healthy tubers, indicating transmission of degeneracy. Scotts B'uff (11), 1921. (See Table 18.) For plant characteristics see figure 20 A and D. The 1922 yield from all strains produced on dry land in 1921 was considerably greater than from the lots produced on irrigated land. (Possible reasons for this are discussed later.) The yields from these dry land lots, however, aver - aged almost 100 bushels per acre less than the check lots, from isolated seed plats (n), (j), (k). It will be noted that all T13 lots in 1922 gave a yield of 156.3 bushels (line p) and all 580 and 560 lots (line g) a yield of 141.2 bushels. The 252.7 bushel yield in 1922 of the check lots (line j, column 8) is approximately 100 bushels greater than that of the same stock grown in proximity the previous year to the degenerate strains (line p). Thus there was a decrease of 41.7 per cent in yield of T13, which can be attributed only to being grown adjacent to degenerate plants the previous year. </seg>
            <seg id="p052">52 Nebraska Experiment Station, Research Bul. 24 The check lot (line j, column 8) was not materially affected in 1921, as shown by the fact that it yielded prac - tically as well as fresh stock grown in the original field in 1921 (line k, column 8). A study of the field history of some of the lots in the Morrill plats (Tables 13, 14, and 15) shows that almost in - variably when a lot degenerated to an unusually great extent in any one season it had been in an adjacent row to a very degenerate lot the previous year. It has been noted from extensive observations in connection with the seed potato certification work that in regions where potato fields are scarce and commercial potato culture relatively new, there is less of this type of degeneracy than in regions wnere potato growing is more intensively developed. It has been shown in general that fresh dry land seed shows less degeneracy than seed from the same original source but grown under irrigation. This superiority of dry land seed may be due largely to the elimination of the weak strains by the adverse conditions for growth under such cul - ture. On the other hand, the favorable growing conditions afforded by irrigation undoubtedly allow sufficient develop - ment of tubers on degenerate plants, so that they are in many instances saved for seed. Another possible explanation of why irrigated conditions are more conducive to the devel - opment of degeneracy may be that the rapid, vigorous growth of the plants actually makes them more susceptible. No carefully controlled checks have been run, to date, to de - termine to what extent insects may act as carriers of this degeneracy. It has been shown, however, that spindling tuber-like mosaic is transmitted from one plant to another by plant lice (Schultz and Folsom, 1923; Folsom, 1923). Since plant lice are very scarce in western Nebraska, they therefore can be only a minor factor in the transmission of this trouble. Any type of field transmission would be more easily accomplished under irrigation because of the close proximity of plants due to thicker planting and larger vine growth. APPLICATION OF RESULTS TO SEED PRODUCTION Productive seed potatoes are produced only under condi - tions where the mean soil temperature during the growing season is relatively low. Such a soil temperature is secured in northern latitudes, in high altitudes, under a mulch, or by producing the seed crop late in the season. Late or fall </seg>
            <seg id="p053">Seed Potato Investigations 53 crop potatoes are used as seed to some extent in all parts of the South, but the total amount so used is small compared with the annual demands for northern stock (Stuart, 1922). Growing seed potatoes under a mulch is a practice which is limited largely to farm production for home use in the Corn-Belt states. The high altitude of western Nebraska makes the growing conditions in that region comparable to those of the more northern states, so far as length of grow - ing season and mean soil temperature are concerned. Vigorous seed from western Nebraska has given satis - factory yields when compared with seed stock from other sources. A critical examination, however, of the condition of western Nebraska potatoes has revealed the fact that some lots are uniformly vigorous, some uniformly unpro - ductive, and others contain both weak and strong strains. It is evident from the foregoing experiments that the lack of vigor in some lots from this region is due largely to the presence of the spindling tuber type of degeneracy described Iabij: 1!&gt; — Effect of tuber type on oiyor and yield.

            <seg id="p055">Seed Potato Investigations 55 (page 24). The elimination or the control of this degeneracy is therefore one of the limiting factors in the production of good seed in western Nebraska. It has been shown that this type of degeneracy (spindling tuber) affects the shape and other characteristics of the tuber. When this trouble is present the selection of the best type tubers will result in some slight improvement but at best it is only a makeshift method (as shown by Table 19). Many tubers may carry the condition without showing the symptoms distinctly and the trouble will still continue to increase to a serious extent. Hill selection is of but little value when degenerate plants are present, especially if they constitute more than about 5 per cent of the plants. This was clearly shown in a number of the experiments and is quite clearly brought out in figure 23. The high yield of the selected hills of 1919 was no guarantee that the 1920 yield would be high, for the field contained many degenerate plants which served as sources of infection. When degenerate plants are not present in a field, hill selection is of value to isolate early or late strains or possibly to isolate strains with regard to other characters. The most practical field method of control is to secure foundation stock from a vigorous strain of seed that contains very little or no "run-out" stock, as determined by field and bin inspection. This stock should be planted in an isolated field plat (isolated by about 300 feet or more from any other potato field ) , on land that has not grown a crop or potatoes for at least two or three years, to guard against other diseases and against occasional volunteer plants. This seed plat should be kept free from weeds, since some weeds may possibly be hosts for this trouble, as has been found to be the case for mosaic. This seed plat should be inspected frequently, at which times all plants showing symptoms of this or any other trouble or disease should be removed. If tubers have already "set" on any such plants they should also be removed. The potatoes grown in this plat should be used for the main planting the following year. A more careful method that will more certainly yield distinctly improved seed stock is the "tuber index" method (Perry, 1922). The tubers selected are indexed with a num - ber, one seed piece to be removed from each tuber for trial in a greenhouse during mid-winter. All tubers that are shown to be in the least undesirable for seed purposes are discarded. The selected tubers are planted as units in a seed plat, where </seg>
            <seg id="p056">56 Nebraska Experiment Station, Research Bul. 24 further selection and roguing take place. As this method requires a greenhouse, it is unavailable to practical growers. However, any grower can grow the stock in the seed plat by the hill unit method. This will enable him to rogue out undesirable stock more thoroly than when mass selection is followed. From the standpoint of improving the quality of a large quantity of seed grown in a number of counties, this Station is resorting to the practice of growing a small quantity of po - tatoes from a hundred or more growers, in comparative trial plats. One of these is located in a Southern State (Louisiana) , where readings can be made before the northern planting season; another is located in western Nebraska on dry land, where early and late plantings are made; and still another is made in the western irrigated district (Scotts Bluff County). By this means it is possible to advise growers at an early date concerning the quality of their seed stock. Also it enables one person to inspect a large number of lots of potatoes under identical growing conditions. Sometimes facts concerning lots are revealed in these trial plats which are not as apparent in the grower's own field. This applies to th&lt; control of mosaic and similar diseases as well as to .Hpimll. tab* </seg>
