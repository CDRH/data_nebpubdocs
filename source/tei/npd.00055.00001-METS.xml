            <seg id="p005">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL State of Nebraska, Legal Department. Lincoln, Nebraska, January 8, 1925. Governor Charles W. Bryan, State of Nebraska. Your Excellency : Pursuant to the requirements of law, I have the honor to submit my report for the biennium ending January 8, 1925. A survey of the work of this department during the last biennium shows the increasing activities of the state legal department in the natural expansion and industrial development of the state. So broad and varied is the field of our endeavor that space forbids presenting more than a brief outline of the more important work of the depart - ment and only a limited but important number of the hundreds of decisions rendered. The report contains a list of cases pending and decided' by the supreme court and final disposition of the respective cases in each case. It also contains a list of the cases and proceedings in which the state legal department took an active part in the several district courts, state supreme court, federal courts — district, circuit and supreme — railway commission, inter - state commerce commission, and cases handled by the guaranty fund commission under the supervision of this department, an inventory of the state's personal property </seg>
            <seg id="p006">6 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL in possession of this department, a table of cases and index. For convenience sake we have added a new feature by way of a supplemental index citing statutes and con - stitutional provisions referred to or construed by this department during the last biennium. Banking In addition to the usual work of the department the state department of justice associated with the respective departments of justice of a number of other states appeared as a friend of the court in an action brought by the state of Missouri to sustain and enforce a law prohibiting the establishment of branch banks. Few cases in recent years have been more rigorously prosecuted in the courts, but after an able presentation of the different phases of the case, the supreme court of the United States recently sustained the law in a decision the value of which is apparent to all interested in legitimate and fair banking and enterprise. As always since its enactment, the main - tenance of the integrity of the bank guaranty fund of the state has demanded unceasing vigilance and active defense. We have been called upon to oppose claims against the guaranty fund of the state aggregating hundreds of thou - sands of dollars and this was successfully done. In this case, however, the most gratifying result has been the resistance of the state bank guaranty law of Nebraska to the attack of those opposed to it. In many states similar bank guaranty fund laws went down under the attack of opponents of such measures, and the final storm and stress consequent upon the period of readjustment. A continued supervision and administration of this law by the state legal department in close co-operation with the department of trade and commerce and the bank guaranty </seg>
            <seg id="p007">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 7 fund commission would insure the maintenance of a healthy banking condition throughout, the state. The vigorous prosecution for violation of the banking laws, both by the respective county attorneys and the legal department of the state has done much to safeguard the state banking system, and the increasing co-operation on the part of the state banking fraternity has indicated the desire to eliminate from the banking system any tendency to lawless speculation and illegal dealing. This department has vigorously assisted the railway commission in securing from the differenf railroads the maintenance of proper health and life safeguards for the stock shippers of Nebraska, By peremptory mandamus this department has caused the court to compel the railroads to restore to schedule six regular trains where those trains had been cancelled or annulled without authority, as pro - vided by the law of Nebraska and the rules of the railway commission. Transportation and Utility Regulation Duties of the attorney general's office pertaining to the work of the state railway commission are extensive and varied. Questions involving service, operation and rates of railroads are constantly raised; telephones, telegraph and electric transmission lines present many legal difficul - ties. Bate cases frequently deal with large sums; the recent express rate case before a federal court in which the state railway commission was represented by this department, with success, involved as Nebraska's portion, nearly a half million dollars annually.' The growing importance of the electrical industry constantly broadens the field of the railway commission's work and with it the duties of this department are enlarged. The commission's </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 control of the issues of securities of public utilities, its administration of the public grain warehouse law, the control of rates of certain public utilities besides common carriers, and the regulation of public motor vehicles are all productive of legal questions requiring solution. They result in considerable litigation, both civil and criminal. This department is also frequently called upon to assist in presenting rate cases before the interstate com - merce commission and all of the applications to that body to issue securities by railroads operating in Nebraska are investigated by this dejwirtnient and appearances therein are occasionally made. The physical valuation of railroads now being carried on by the interstate commerce commission, in which proceeding the state railway com - mission appears, requires considerable time of this depart- Anti-Trust It gives me pleasure to report that I was the sole representative of Nebraska in the successful fight for the elimination of the iniquitous system known as "Pittsburgh Plus,'' which compelled each fanner and purchaser of farm machinery or of steel products to pay unfair toll and exorbitant rates to the steel trust. Co-operation among attorneys general of middle western states undoubtedly made the success of the fight assured, and the measure means the actual saving of many millions of dollars to the people of Nebraska. Similarly the doors of the Omaha Grain Exchange were thrown open to the farmers of the state through the activities of the state's attorney general. For years past there has been a struggle between the opponents of co-operative dealing, and those who operated grain ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p009">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 9 changes as private concerns. The state laws made grain exchanges public markets and specifically provided for the admission of co-operative organizations on a par with private enterprises. After several demands and refusals the presentation of a demand backed by a petition in quo warranto and supported by a recent holding of the United States Supreme Court, the Omaha Grain Exchange finally opened its doors to a company owned and operated in fact by The Farmers Union. Combinations in Restraint of Trade During the last biennium we have given much time, attention and effort to the enforcement of laws curbing combinations in restraint of trade within the state. In these days the policy of the so-called anti-trust laws upon the statute books of the nation and the state has offered a point of attack to great combinations of capital impatient of all governmental restrictions. In the agricultural middle west and in Nebraska in particular, there never has been a waiver on the part of the people in their deter - mination to exercise the police {&gt;ower of the state, and to protect the public from the evils of monopoly. For yeare successive legislatures have applied themselves and at times with much earnestness to the improvement of laws designed to protect the public from the evils of monopoly and competition within the state. During the last bien - nium Nebraska's was the first state department of justice within the Union to challenge the trusts and combines of the oil industry. The condition prevalent in the oil industry is known to the public. Prices are fixed and maintained, and only those who agreed to sell to the public at the uniform or agreed price appear to be able to purchase gasoline from the large jobbers and large oil combinations. Evidence of such practice was gathered by </seg>
            <seg id="p010">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. 10 this department over a period of a year, and from all sections of the state. Suit was filed by this department against an alleged combination of oil companies. It sought to prevent one of the city commissioners of Omaha from selling gasoline to the inhabitants of Omaha at a price lower than the uniform agreed price charged In Omaha by all other companies then operating there. A different price was charged for gasoline at Omaha and in Lincoln, where it was admitted freely by the company charging the price that there was no difference as to the cost of the product or the freight rates at that time. In that case this department moved immediately for a tem - porary injunction based upon the affidavits filed and the wrong that this department contended was done to the public. The companies contended that the prices charged by them — uniform, agreed or cut to meet the price of the so-called price cutters — were prices made for the purpose of meeting competition and not for eliminating competi - tion. The trial court denied the temporary injunction, apparently sustaining the contention that the defendants enjoyed sufficient defense for their conduct when they asserted their intention in lowering prices to meet price - cutting was in fact for the purpose of competition and not for the elimination of price cutters. In other words the statute or presumption raised by the bare difference in price as set forth in Section 3432, Compiled Statutes for 1922, was successfully rebutted by a denial of the attempt to combine for the purpose of eliminating competition. This case is still pending, and because it has not been tried on its meritR, we refrain from further discussion of it in this report, except to state that the suit resulted in the city commissioner obtaining a supply of gasoline un - til the combine was broken in Omaha and lower prices fol - lowed throughout the state. However, we have urged upon </seg>
            <seg id="p011">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 11 the legislature certain amendments to Section 3432, so that Nebraska, like other states in the middle west, may have a workable anti-trust law providing that the only defense to price discrimination shall be a difference in freight rates or in the quality of the commodity in general purchased or sold. Such a law will not only apply to oil combinations, but will reach price discrimination by creameries operated throughout the state and successfully defending themselves in the words of the very law intended lo curb their nefarious practices. Prohibition This department has insisted at all times upon the enforcement of the prohibitory law in the same manner as all other laws throughout the state. It has actively and vigorously enforced the prohibitory law and has sup - plied legal assistance when necessary to the several counties of the state calling for aid in the enforcement of this and other laws. Breweries operating under governmental per - mits and using illegal processes of beer making have been enjoined and closed. In this as in other subjects of mutual interest the state's legal department has co-operated with the federal department at Washington. We co-operated with the several county attorneys in the preparation of briefs and arguments in prohibitory cases. Excheats During the biennium the department has endeavored » to create renewed interest in protecting the rights of the State of Nebraska in estates belonging to persons dying without heirs and without a will. The experience of the department inclines me to the belief that more care should be taken in protecting property of estates escheat - ing under the law to the people of Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Co-operation It gives me great pleasure to report that during the biennium there has increased a greater co-operation lx&gt;tween the different law enforcement bodies of the state and national governments. Certain banking, insurance and fraud cases are reached more efficiently under federal law than under the state law, where the acts complained of have been committed. Acting on the suggestion of the attorney general of the United States this department has made use of the co-operation extended by the depart - ment of justice of the United States, and information of law violations affecting the above subjects have often been turned over to the United States Department of Justice for action. The result has been that the federal govern - ment prosecuted the individuals without cost to the state of Nebraska. Similarly complaints of certain trade prac - tices have been laid before the federal trade commission. lu this connection permit me to cite a meeting of the National Association of Attorneys General in Minneapolis in August, 1923, where the national association by resolu - tion requested and gave me authority to call a conference of attorneys general for the purpose of considering com - binations in restraint of trade effecting petroleum and its products in the fixing of prices and control of the indus - try. I called this conference in Chicago, Illinois, at the Old Colony Club, on October 15 to 17 inclusive, 1923. It was the first conference of its kind ever called in the United States. At this conference twenty-six states were represented by their attorneys general and several brought assistants with them. Examination and discussion of the methods and practices of oil trusts and combinations in the United States was the order of this meeting. As a result resolutions were forwarded to the President of the United </seg>
            <seg id="p013">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 13 States, to the Federal Trade Commission and the Depart - ment of Justice at Washington, requesting immediate action by the federal government. The President In response directed an order to the Federal Trade Commis - sion, which within sixty days presented a report, which with other evidence gathered by the United States Depart - ment of Justice under Attorney General Harlan Fiske Stone resulted in the filing at Chicago of a federal anti - trust case against a combination of oil companies. There is no question that the co-operation between the different attorneys general of the states participating in the confer - ence referred to exercised the greatest influence, not only in securing the active assistance of the federal government to restrain the encroachment of monopoly, but for many months insured to the people of the country the saving of many millions of dollars in the purchase of gasoline. I regard it as an honor to Nebraska that I was calletf upon to preside over a conference of attorneys general or the different states. At the conclusion of its work the conference honored me with the chairmanship of a perma - nent executive committee of the conference. Attorney General George M. Napier of Georgia was made secretary. Remaining members of the committee, which the conference gave me power to name, are as follows : Clifford L. Hilton, Attorney General, Minneapolis, Minn. Herman L. Ekern, Attorney General, Madison, Wis. J. L. Benton, Attorney General, Boston, Mass. A. V. Coco, Attorney General, Baton Rouge, La. H. H. Cluff, Attorney General, Salt Lake City, Utah. B. J. Gibson, Attorney General, Des Moines, la. George F. Short, Attorney General, Oklahoma City,Okla. May I suggest that because of the activities of this department on behalf of the plain j&gt;eople, Nebraska's </seg>
            <seg id="p014">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 14 Erney general was named a member of the executive mittee of the International Association of Attorneys era I. which was organized in London last August. I cannot emphasize too strongly- the need of certain amendments to the anti-trust laws. The section of our Jaw dealing with public markets particularly with grain exchanges is an example which I commend to succeeding legislatures for clearly expressed legislation and intent, and I take pleasure in informing Your Excellency that through this particular law I was able to secure the admission of farmers to the Omaha Grain Exchange, after that body had repeatedly denied permission to the farmer or affiliated companies of the Farmers Union. Several of the sections of our anti-trust laws have been amended in such wise as to suggest the efficient activities of lobbyists engaged to nullify the will of the public. Whatever may be notwithstanding the efforts of selfish interests and petty leaders to nullify the anti-trust laws enacted to protect the people against the evils of monopoly, there remains for the chief law officer of the state the daily duty of protect - ing the public against the evils of monopoly under the anti-trust laws as they are written. The results are not obtained in a day. The legislature may write laws, but courts must interpret them. Steadily this department has pursued its way under the constitution and according to the laws as written. Long since the English courts declared monopoly inconsistent to the welfare of the public; repeatedly merited court* have sounded the same doctrine, moving from one vantage ground to another; great combinations of wealth seeking the returns of mon - opoly have opposed this fundamental principle with all the wealth at demand and the ablest minds of the time. Steadily in the national and state governments the law </seg>
            <seg id="p015">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 15 officers of the different institutions have enforced the laws as written by the people. This department will continue to follow that sacred policy until relief is perma - nently secured. I could not conclude this report without paying a tribute to the county attorneys of the state with whom I have labored with friendly co-operation during the last biennium. Upright, courageous and efficient, oftentimes underpaid they, with few exceptions, indeed, have carried their part of the law enforcement duty of the state. In closing my official report as attorney general I take occasion to emphasize the efficient and loyal support of my assistants, Messrs. George W. Ayres, Lloyd Dort, Hugh Lamaster, Lee Basye, T. J. McGuire and Harry Silverman. Also the stenographers in the office, Frieda C Bayerlein and Caroline L. Ayer, have added to the success of our efforts and the efficiency of the department. Respectfully submitted, O. 8. SPILLMAN, Attorney General. </seg>

            <seg id="p062">62 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS— SEALS. Officers with a seal may refuse to take an acknowledgement for good reason, or if dissatisfied with the showing. Mr. Alfred L. Shamblin, County Superintendent, Brevcster, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether there are any conditions under which a Notary Public, Justice of the Peace, Clerk of the District Court or any officer who has a seal can refuse to acknowledge an instrument when presented to them, and whether such officers have authority to inquire into details before giving their acknowledgement, and whether or not the officers are liable on their bonds. You ask so many questions without giving the facts surrounding each one that we are unable to give you intelligent answers. We will say that there are conditions under which they might legally refuse to acknowledge an instrument pre - sented to them. As to Justice of the Peace and Clerk of the District Court or other lawfully elected officers it would probably be a different application of the law than to a Notary Public. Officers are liable on their bonds given for the proper performance of their duties, if the conditions of the bond have been violated. If you will give us the facts and circumstances we may be able to give you some advice in the matter, if it is a matter of an official opinion. We would suggest first, however, that you go to your county attorney and if he is unable to advise you that you write a letter to the State Superintendent, who will call upon us for our advice if he needs our services.

Hon. Grant Shumicay, Deputy Secretary of Agriculture, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In reply to your oral inquiry submitted to me for an opinion, as to whether or not the Bureau of Markets and Marketing has authority to use 50c out of the $4.00 inspection fee obtained for the inspection of potatoes, which fee has been recently appropriated for the use of the Bureau of Markets and Marketing, for the purjjose of securing a federal inspection and grading in the disposi - tion of carload shipments of potatoes, i&gt;ermit us to direct your attention to Section 7294 of the Compiled Statutes of 1922, which provides: "The Department of Agriculture shall have power: "1. To encourage and promote, in every practicable manner, the interests of agriculture, including horticulture, the live stock industry, dairying, cheese making, poultry, bee keeping, forestry, fishing, th« production of wool, and all other allied industries; "2. To promote methods of conducting these several industries with a view to increasing the production and facilitate the distribution thereof at the least cost; "3. To collect and publish statistics relating to crop production, marketing and farm economies, the production and marketing of beef, pork, poultry, fish, mutton, wool, butter, cheese and other agricultural products so far as such statistical information may be of value to the agricultural and allied interests of the state; to co-operate with the federal government in the matter of collecting such statistical infor - mation. Such department shall include in its publications the reports of agricultural, horticultural and like societies, and of live stock asso - ciations. Such published statistics shall be the official agricultural statistics of the state." Further directing your attention to the appropriation made by the last Legislature concerning your department, </seg>
            <seg id="p064">64 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL to-wit, Section IS, Page 12G of the Session Laws for the year 192.'{, which provides: "For the use of the Bureau of Food, Drugs and Oil, and the Bureau of Markets and Marketing, all moneys collected by said bureau of the Department of Agriculture during the biennium ending June 30, 1925, or so much thereof as may be needed for the mainte - nance and support of said Bureaus together with any unexpended balance on hand June 30, 1923." In the cam of Providence Washington Insurance Co. vs. Weston, (!.&gt; Nebr. "til, it w;is held : "Under the provisions of Section 22, Article 3, of the Constitution, no money can be drawn from the treasury except in pursuance of a specific appropriation made by law." Again in the case of Weston vs. Herdnian, &lt;»4 Nebr. 24, the court held : "Section 22, of Article 3, of the Constitution prohibits the drawing of money from the treasury 'except in pursuance of a specific appro - priation made by law.' Under our state government an appropriation 'made by law' must emanate from an act of the Legislature, or from the primary source of power, the Constitution itself." We arc of the opinion that where fees have been appro - priated by the Legislature for the use of a department that such a s|H"cific appropriation "made by law," as described in the Constitution may Ik- used for the use of such department under such restrictions, as are provided by law. We are further of the opinion that if the Mfflifjif of l&gt;otatoes, as provided by Section 7018, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1!)22, and the additional certification of a federal grade of inserting and grading ]&gt;otatoes, as pro - vided by the United States Department of Agriculture would encourage and promote in a practical manner the interests of agriculture in Nebraska, that it would be projter for the Iiureau of Markets and Marketing to usw ihe sum of 50c out of the fee of $4.00 collected for the insjKH'tion of ]&gt;otatoes, and appropriated for the use of the Bureau of Markets and Marketing, as provided by Section 7621, Compiled Statutes, 1922, and that the Department or Agriculture has the authority under Section 7616, Com piled Statutes, 1922, to adopt an additional standard and </seg>

In order that a county board may make a levy for the purpose of raising funds for a farm bureau it is necessary that a proper petition for the organization of such bureau should be filed with the county board in the manner provided by statute, and such item for the appropriation of the expense for the maintenance of such farm bureau should be included in the estimate of such county board. lion. J. H. SteutenUU County Attorney, Bridgeport, Xebntsha Deal- Sir: We are in receipt of your favor of the third instant making the following inquiries: "Under Section 69, of Article XI, of the Compiled Statutes, 1922, how long a time does the farm bureau have in which they may file a petition signed by three hundred or more farmers in order to have their budget allowed by the commissioners; also, will you please advise whether they are required to file this petition anew every year, or rather to file a new petition every year, or does the filing of a petition one year allow them to require the commissioners their appropriation as requested for several succeeding years." July 2, 1923. </seg>
            <seg id="p066">66 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL We call your attention to Section »»!), Art. XI, Chapter I, Compiled Statutes, \i)'2'2. which provides : "When in any county not less than three hundred bonafide resi - dents of the county who are engaged in farming * * * shall have organized themselves into a farm bureau, shall petition tlie rounty beard to appropriate a sum of money out of the general fund for the purpose of promoting improvement in agricultural methods, the production and more economic distribution of the results thereof, and for the purpose of employing and maintaining or assisting in employ - ing and maintaining a county agricultural agent in said county to aid therein, ihe county board shall set aside annually, from the county general fund, puch sum? of money for its u?e in accordance with this act." We wish ;ilso to call your attention to subdivision six of Section N."&gt;t t Chapter L3, Article IV, Compiled Statutes. l'.)22, which provides that it shall he the duty of the county board : "At their regular meeting in January of each year to prepare tn estimate of the necessary' expenses of ihe county during the ensuing year, the total of which shall in no instance exceed the .-.mount of taxes authorized by law to be levied during the year, including the amount nece.-sary to meet outstanding indebtedness a? evidenced by bords, coupons or warrants legally issued; and such estimate, containing the items constituting the amount, shall be entered at large upon iheir records and publi-hed four consecutive weeks before the levy for that year in some newspaper published and of general circulation in the county, • * * And no levy of taxes shall be made for any other purpose or amounts than are specified in such estimate as published." We wish further to call your attention to the case of IlrwUc r. ti« u wli rs, 104 Hch. 427 (177 X. W. 781)), in which it was held that county boards have no authority to levy a tax in excess of the amount provided in the Consti - tution: and which also holds that the board of county coinmissionei-s has exclusive jurisdiction to distribute the levy made to the various county funds. It also holds that '•statutes in pari inateria must be construed together." It is therefore our opinion that a farm bureau as &lt;le- C"bed in Section &lt;&gt;!), supra, should file its |&gt;etiti&lt;;n before time provided by law for the county board to make its </seg>
            <seg id="p067">67 OPINIONS estimate, and that the county board should not make a lc*J for the inii|K&gt;se of raising funds for a farm bureau unless saiin- is included in their estimate. In construing said Section »&gt;!), we hold that it must l&gt;e construed with sub - division six of Section 854. And, although Section &lt;;t) seems to Ik- mandatory upon the board of county commis - sioners to make the appropriation for a farm bureau when the proper application has l&gt;een made, yet the l&gt;oard ol county commissioners is prohibited from making a levy greater than that provided by the Constitution. We also hold that in making up its estimate the l&gt;oard of county commissioners should include in its estimate for - the amounts payable out of the general fund the amount necessary for carrying on the work of the farm bureau, provided it does not exceed the limit intj&gt;osed by the Constitution. It is also our opinion that when the farm bureau is organized and application made for the funds provided therefor it is not necessary to annually renew the appli - cation, and that Ihe l&gt;oni-d of county commissioners should annually include in its estimate the necessary funds for carrying on the work of the farm bureau insofar as the amount levied for that pvpOHe shall come within the limitations provided by the Constitution.

Dear Sir: You inquire whether under the provisions of Chapter I, Session Laws of the State of Nebraska, 1923, petitions' for and remonst ranees against the continuance of Farm Bureaus in this state may be signed by women. In answer to the question, which you propound, I will say that in my opinion if a woman is actively engaged in the business of agriculture in her own behalf, and has the other requisite qualifications of a signer, I do not think the matter of sex bars her from signing. Where, however, a husband, father or brother is active manager of the farm property, and the woman's part in </seg>
            <seg id="p071">OPINIONS 71 agriculture is merely the part taken ordinarily by house wives or by the (laughters of farmers, I am of the opinion that the Legislature did not contemplate that women so engaged should sign either a petition or remonstrance under the provisions of said Chapter I.

But the Department of Agriculture has no authority to require such inspection beyond the territorial limits of the state. In reply to the second part of your inquiry stating that i carload of potatoes contains a few sacks of cabbage other agricultural products, if this condition would init a shipper to ship potatoes without the inspection required by Nebraska statutes for the reason that the lot would not be so classified as a car of potatoes and s avoid the requirement for inspection, you are informed t the section above quoted provides that it is necessary a certificate of inspection or a permit for shipment be led before the car is released for shipment, and we are of opinion that where a car is loaded with potatoes that h car cannot be released for shipment by reason of a ■ sacks of other agricultural products being placed in car for the purjKJse of avoiding the provision of the law uiring an inspection of carlot shipments, and where the pector finds such a condition he may refuse to certify car and release the same for shipment.

In answer to the question which you proi&gt;ound I will gay that, in my opinion, tho 8i&gt;ecific appropriation of $10,000 for salaries and wages implies that money for salaries should not be taken out of other funds, and that the appropriation for institutional libraries should be used in the future, as I undei-stand such appropriation has been used in tho past, for tho purchase of books and periodicals for use in the several institutional libraries.

            <seg id="p081">81 In answer to your inquiry I refer you to Section 7, of Article IV, of the Constitution of Nebraska, on the subject of budget, which, among other things, provides as follows : "No appropriations shall be made in excess of the recommendation contained in such budget unless by three-fifths vote of each House of the Legislature and such excess so approved by a three-fifths vote shall not be subject to veto by the Governor." Section 7269 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides as follows: "Provided, however, that in case of change of administration, the out-going Governor shall deliver the budget to the Legislature previous to the close of his term, and the incoming Governor shall have fifteen days in which to review the budget as prepared and delivered by his predecessor and may send to the Legislature a supplementary budget message making suggestions of any changes which he deems wise, and the constitutional requirement for a three-fifths vote to increase the items and recommendations contained in the budget shall relate to the supplementary message of the Governor." From the foregoing it is our opinion that appropria - tions in excess of those recommended by the Governor are not subject to veto by the Governor provided they are approved by a three-fifths vote or more of each House of the Legislature.

Section 7, of Anicle IV, of the Con - stitution provides that the Governor shall {five by message to the Legislature a "Complete itemized budget of the financial requirements of all departments, institutions and agencies of the state for the ensuing biennium."

The bill as it comes from the Committee of the Whole is likely to include a number of sections which raise the recommendations of the Governor, and require a three - fifths vote before lKH-oming a law. It would seem that the al&gt;ove section contemplates that items in the bill which require a three-fifths vote mifjht be considered separately.

Physical defects of a person assaulted may tend to aggravate the offense insofar as affecting the amount of fine assessed or the amount of damages recovered. Mr. Ed Whims, Can Trmrrlen Home. ol'i Xorfolk Arenue, Norfolk, Xebraska. l&gt;ear Sir: Answering your inquiry of recent tlnte will state that Section !)."&gt;r&gt;4 of the Compiled Statutes for 1922 provides, as follows : "Whoever unlawfully assaults, or threatens another in a menacing manner, or unlawfully strikes or wounds another, shall, upon convic - tion thereof, be fined in any sum not exceeding one hundred dollars, or be imprisoned in the jail of the county not exceeding three months, and shall, moreover, be liable to the suit of the party injured." The ;il&gt;ove section applies to ordinary cases of assault and battery. Section 95i&gt;(&gt;, which applies to assault with intent to inflict great lnxlily injury is, as follows: "Whoever assaults another with intent to inflict a great bodily injury, shall be punished, on conviction thereof, by imprisonment in the penitentiary for not less than one year nor more than five years." If one has Iki-ii axsaulted without just cause or provo - cation, and has received lnxlily injury, an action in dam - ages will also lie against the ]&gt;erson guilty of such assault. The fact that a man has one eye, or is wearing glasses might tend to aggravate the offense, insofar as affecting the amount of the fine assessed by the court or might influence the jury in the amount of damages recov - ered, esj&gt;ecially if the injury is aggragavated because of one's face being cut bar the lenses, or he is otherwise in- </seg>

In answer to your question, i&gt;erinit me to say that in my opinion they are not eligible to hold the office fore more than two consecutive terms if their right to do so is directly attacked by proceedings in quo warranto.

Re: Incorporation — Wahoo Mutual Loan and Build - ing Association Dear Sir: You call the attention of this department to a letter received by you under date of October 22 ,1923 from B. E.

In answer to the question, which you propound, I will say that prior to the year 1911 the articles of incor - poration of building and loan associations were not re - quired to be filed with the Secretary of State. I am of the opinion that where a building and loan association was incorporated and doing business at the time of the passage of the act in question, it was not re - quired to file its articles of incorporation with the Secre - tary of State by virtue of that act. The general rule is that the laws are not retro-active unless the intention to make them so is clearly expressed in the statute itself. In the statute under consideration that was not done. It is probable, however, that most corporations of that character will find it expedient to have their articles of incorpora - tion recorded in the office of the Secretary of State even though in strict law they are not required to do so because of having been organized prior to the aforesaid change in the law in 1911. The cost of such recording will not be great in any instance. </seg>

Strictly speaking, the term 'bank' implies a place for the deposit of money, as that is the most obvious purpose of such an institution. Originally the business of banking consisted only in receiving deposits, such as bullion, plate and the like, for safe keeping until the depositor should see fit to draw it out for use, but the business, in the progress of events, was extended, and bankers assumed to discount bills and notes and to loan money upon mortgage, pawn or other security, and at a still later period to issue r.otes of their own intended as a circulating currency and a medium of exchange instead of gold and silver. Modern bankers frequently exercise any two or even all three of those functions, but it U still true that an institution prohibited from exercising any more than one of those functions is an bank in the strictest commercial sense, and unless such a bank is brought within the proviso under consideration, is equally subject to taxation as if authorized to make discounts and issue circulation as well as to receive deposits."

In answer to your question, I will say that although in tin* alienee of a. court decision the matter is not entirely free from doubt, in my opinion it may if the other pre - requisites exist. In other words, I do not think the fact rhat the aggregate of the pMpoeed assessment and prior assessments lawfully made exceeds 100 per cent of the par value of the capital stock, is controlling.

When these certificates lx&gt;canie due they were renewed, and when the renewal certificates became due they were ■gate renewed. The last certificates, however, bearing but 59&amp;, and no bonus !&gt;eing paid. You inquire whether under these circumstances these last certificates were a valid charge against the Bank Guaranty Fund. In my opinion they are not, if they are in the hands of the parties to whom the original cer - tificates were given, or of any parties who have had the lienefit of an exress payment of interest on them. If, however, the present holders are innocent purchasers, and have received no interest in excess of 5%, I am of the opinion that the certificates are properly payable out of the Bank Guaranty Fund, if as I assume the facts are the assets of the hank are insufficient to pay them. In answer to your second inquiry, In which you say: "If a chief officer of a bank solicits placing money in his bank, regardless of rate of interest, does this solicita - tion give it the character of a loan, and take away the character of guarantee under the guaranty law?" I will say that unless the rate of interest is in excess of the rate permitted by law to be paid on bank deposits, I do not think that such deposits lose the protection fur - nished by the Hank Guaranty Law. I assume that prac - tically all banks either expressly or impliedly are soliciting deposits, and I find nothing in the statute or in the equities of the case, which deprives a depositor of the protection furnished by the Bank Guaranty Fund, merely l*ecause in compliance with the request of an officer of the bank, he has deposited his funds in the bank.

Dear Sir: In your letter of inquiry of the sixth instant you say : "A state bank desires to cancel its charter to become a national bank. This state bank has outstanding certificates of deposit not coming due for ten years, and some of its owners cannot be located. As a consequence the books of such proposed national bank will show outstanding deposits unbeknown to such depositors. "Supposing this national bank fails,— can said depositors have a claim against the depositors guaranty fund of the state of Ne - braska? If so what course should this department pursue before this state bank becomes a national bank in order to protect the said guaranty fund?" In answer to the questions which you propound I will say: 1. Depositors only have a claim against the do positors guaranty fund after the state bank in which they have their money deposited has become insolvent and does </seg>

This being true, if the insolvency does not occur until after the state bank has been changed into a national bank ai has ceased to make payments to the bank guaranty fund. I doubt if the depositors can be paid out of the bank guaranty fund. 2. If the department will insist upon a state bank which proposes to change to a national bank making vol - untary liquidation by paying all its depositors in full and paying to the state treasurer all moneys held by it as its quota of the guaranty fund at or before the time ii changed from a state bank to a national bank, it will have done all that it is possible to do to prevent depositors from \mng misled as to their deposits being protected by the state bank guaranty fund.

We understand that you have an appropriation for the Norfolk Asylum in the nature of a cash fund and also another fund called general fund, to be used in maintaining such institution, and that you are in a position to use money out of these funds for the |&gt;ayment of this judg - ment without great public inconvenience or impair the normal operation of such institution. </seg>

I assume that when the Hoard of Control transfers a prisoner from the reformatory to the i&gt;enitentiary it is for incorrijribility and is done under the provisions of Section 7023, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1122, which reads as follows: "The board of control may cause to be removed to the peniten - tiary any prisoner in said reformatory appearing to be incorrigible.

Are you nor in error as to the date of this act and do you not rater to the law of 1870? * I Under the provisions of Section 396, Compiled Stat - es. UBS, which refers back to the law of 1879, it is pro - ed that it shall be the duty of the county board to pre - it the prayer of the petttkm therein mentioned to the i -tors of the county, and under the provisions of See - n .&gt;!)7, Compiled Statutes, 1922. provides that if the ina - ity of the votes cast at the election are in favor of the mty the same shall 1m- in effect after ninety days fol - &gt;"in«j the election. Under the provision of the law it uld therefore seem if the electors voted for the adoption the bounty the same would be in effect ninety days after ■ election. It also seems that your county board has isidered the election as valid and for many years has ■n paying the bounty. </seg>
            <seg id="p137">137 If it is desired to no longer pay bounties we believe that there would have to be a revocation of the former act and that it would have to be revoked in the manner provided in Section 396, Compiled Statutes, 1922, and that until revocation the bounty would be in force. Inas - much as the amendment to the law increased the payment for bounties, some j»erson might attempt to restrain pay - ment of the bounty by injunction proceedings. We do not believe such action would be successful and until it is taken the board is justified in ]&gt;aying bounties. Very truly yours Attorney General. By LLOYD DORT, ixxixtHitt Attorney General.

The state law i»rovides that only corporations having been in existence at least one year may l&gt;e issued licenses.

You particularly call our attention to the St. Mihiel Post Xo. 247 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Lee Forby Camp of Spanish War Veterans, which you say have submitted evidence, proving that they have charters fir m National Associations of the same name, which has organized the subsidiary or auxiliary bodies at Omaha. Section 504, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, is a statute which provides that all state, grand, supreme, national, seci-et. fraternal, l)enevolent or charitable orders, lodges, organisations, societies or other bodies issuing char - ters to and having subordinate or auxiliary orders, etc., within this statute, and naming a great many of them, are made and declaitd coriH&gt;rations in the state. If these orders have Im'cu in existence for the requisite time, and come within the provisions of this section by being subsidiary or auxiliary bodies of orders as defined by this section it will be a corponition within the purview of the boxing law in our opinion.

Very truly jours, Deduction of the State Tax on boxing from receipts is governed by the conditions under which the matter is conducted. Mr. M. R. Shrader, Roxinrj Commissioner, Lincoln, Xebraxkti. Dear Sir: You inquire whether or not the state tax of five per cent on boxing shows shall be applied on the total gross receipts, and whether or not the five per cent shall be based upon the federal government tax collected at the time of the sale of the tickets, and whether or not this tax for the federal government is considered a part of the total gross receipts upon which the state tax should be based. We would say that this matter is unsettled. If the promoters of the show charge a fixed sum per ticket and ■0PM to personally pay the federal tax, we would feel inclined to say that the gross receipts would consist of the amount realized from the sale of the tickets, the tax to be paid not out of sales of tickets but by the promoters. If, on the other hand, the promoters collect in addition </seg>
            <seg id="p145">145 to the ticket charge the federal tax, we would say that the collection of the additional amount for tax ia no part of the gross receipts. It is merely collected in addition to the fixed charge in order to pay the government tax. The five per cent collected by the state should be con - fined to the charge made for the ticket. In other words, the assumption of the payment of the federal tax by the promoters out of the fixed charge for the ticket might permit the collection of the five per cent tax by the state, 'but the collection of the federal tax by the promoters in addition to the fixed charge for the ticket would not en - title the state to collect the five per cent tax except on the fixed charge for the ticket exclusive of the federal tax.

Dear Sir: You inquire what the law is relative to the moving of a body in a cemetery from one lot to another? It appears that a son-in-law is now objecting to the removal. Section 9862, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, makes it unlawful for any person to disinter or remove a body, with certain exceptions. Among the exceptions which possibly apply to your case are that this law does not apply to and is not to be construed to prevent the officers of any lawfully constituted cemetery, while act - ing under the direction of its board of trustees, from re - moving the bodies or the remains thereof, from one place of burial to another, and also that it shall not apply to </seg>

While the matter is not free from doubt, and some trouble might be caused if the son-in-law owns the lot upon which the body is placed, and objects to trespassing upon the lot, yet, if the cemetery association consents to the removal, if I were the relatives, I think I would take a chance on prosecution being instituted. If the son-in - law objects, if I were a party to the matter, I might be inclined to procure a restraining order for the removal of the body after the consent of the cemetery association was obtained.

"The cost of main sewers in excess of special benefits can only be paid for by means of general taxation." In that cast* there was an objection to the assessment as made. I take it from your statement that no objec - tions to the assessment were made, or if made, no appeal was taken to the district court.

Her. F. A. Hifk, Stnt ( Sii/h -rintemlent, Anti-Saloon League of Nebraska, Lincoln, Xehraxka. Dmt Mr. High: You inquire if a police judge in a liquor prosecution must proceed under the state statute instead of under an oi&lt;l ina nee, which provides a lesser penalty than the state statute, and where the city council has failed to enact or - dinances in compliance with the liquor law, as required by Section M2S7. Compiled Statutes for 1922. In reply will state that I find no authority, which prevents the prosecuting attorney from filing his complaint under either the statute or the ordinance, and the court would proceed accordingly. It is my opinion, however, that a prosecution and conviction under the city ordinance does not bar a prosecution under the statute. To hold that it did bar such prosecution might result in virtually nullifying the statute, where the penalty pro - vided by the city ordinance is merely a nominal fine or small ;is compared with the penalty of the statute. Jn support of this opinion, I refer you to Koch rs. State, 53 Ohio State Reports 49S, wherein the court said: "A former conviction before a mayor for the violation of an ordinance is not a bar to the prosecution of an information charging the same act as a violation of a statute."

I do not believe any warrants should be drawn against the appropriation for 1925 to pay expenses incur - red in 1924, unless the language of the appropriation shows that it was intended to be used to defray ex}K&gt;nses for prior years, or it clearly appeal's there is enough money in the appropriation to pay all claims for the current year properly payable out of same in addition to the amount of the warrant allowed to defray expenses incurred during a prior year. 5. Whether or not after the estimate of expenses is made for 1925, but before the tax levy is actually made for that year, warrants can legally be drawn in anticipation of the levy to defray expenses incurred during 1925 is not entirely free from doubt.

However, the amendment does not expressly piovid'.* that the claim shall not be presented and take the usual course, unless it be deemed that the coroner is given powers to draw war - rants against the general fund without interference of the county lmard or county clerk.

We Itelieve that the Legislature intended that practical - ly the same procedure should apply to members of the coroner's jury. We do not believe that it is intended to upset the usual orderly procedure of the matter of handling claims. This matter, however, is not free from doubt and for that reason we believe that it would be safer to present the claim with certificate as proof for allowance of claim and payment by warrant.

            <seg id="p168">168 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL CORONER'S INQUEST— FEES Witness fees for attendance at coroner's inquest. Mr. Wells C. Jones, County Attorney, North Platte, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire what is the proper fee and mileage for witnesses at a coroner's inquest. Moore v. Box BxUte County, 78 Nebr. 561, 111 N. W. 469, indicates that witnesses and jurors serving on a coroner's jury are entitled to compensation. The Statute does not expressly provide, so far as we are able to find, for compensation to be paid by witnesses in attendance at an inquest. We are therefore left to the examination of the Statutes pertaining to witness fees. Section 1109, Compiled Statutes Nebraska, 1922, provide that witness fees in matters where the State is a party, shall be the same as in civil actions in District Court. Section 2405, Compiled Statutes Nebraska, 1922, fixes the compensation of witnesses in the District Court at Two (?2) Dollars per day and Five (5c) Cents per mile. Neither this sec - tion or other sections seem to cover the case. Since we are unable to find any express statutory authority for the payment of witness fees in attendance at a coroner's inquest, we would not feel that we should advise the county board to pay such fees in the absence of a court decision. We are advised that certain counties of the state do not pay witness fees, although they do pay Two (|2) Dollars a day to the jurors. Wo believe the Two (|2) Dollars a day provided by Chapter 109, Session Laws of Nebraska 1923 does not include mileage and that the Two ($2) Dollars per day is the only con&gt; pensation to be paid jurors for services on the coroner's jury. We would like to see this matter tested in court, but we believe that the matter should be taken up by someone </seg>
            <seg id="p169">169 who thinks they are entitled to witness fees and that the board should not run the risk of being held personally liable for paying moneys of the county where not ex pressly authorized. In an opinion dated March 10, 1924 directed to D. G.

We do not believe that ordinarily an assignment in advance of monies unearned should be accepted. It is ;he duty of the bonding company to protect itself by means acceptable to itself or take its own chance when it furnishes the bond.

In thtg par - ticular case there is not only an assignment but ;; ]H&gt;\ver of attorney, which authorizes the lmnding company to collect, and we therefore are of the opinion that under the authority therein granted, payments may he made to the bonding company and receipts therefor given by that company in the name of the contractor.

CORl'ORATK STOCK— DIVIDENDS Dividends on corporate stock not to be declared unless there are earn - ings available for the payment thereof. Hon. ThoriK A.

Under the circumstances the action of the 1km nl in de - claring dividends was illegal. As pointed out in my iimiiiio - randuni, heretofore filed in this connection, dividends are to l&gt;e declared and paid only out of the net profits. The declaration of dividends is a necessary corporate ait pre - ceding the actual payment and in the absence of anything to the contrary it must !&gt;e presumed that the dividends declared will be immediately paid in cash. In the case of Dcuuix r. Joxlin Mfy. Co. (R. 1. 1 :}»&gt; All. Rep. ll»!), the court said : ■ "The declaration of a dividend is one of the most important act.« a corporation. It is an assignment of its property. It clearly (&gt;. S. SI'ILLMAX. </seg>
            <seg id="p173">OPINIONS 173 "implies corporate action to that effect. It is action of such a char - acter that it ought to appear upon the books of the company." The declaration has the lejial effect of appropriating the net. profits of the concern to the jmyment of the divi - dends declared and creates a liability on the part of the cor]&gt;oration to pay them as declared. Cook on Corjmiations 1 7th Ed. ), Sec. ."&gt;42, states the law- as follows: "The debt which the corporation owes its stockholders, when a dividend is declared and the day of payment arrives, is one which may be collected by the usual action at law. A suit to compel the declara - tion of a dividend must be in equity; but when the dividend is not paid after it has been regularly declared the stockholder's action is at law, and he may sue in assumpsit for the amount due him by the resolution declaring the dividend; under certain circumstances he may file a bill in equity for an accounting." See also Thompson on Corp., 2nd Ed., Sec. o-5lill. It will be olwerved that under Section ."&gt;, of Article X. of the Constitution of Nebraska, no dividends shall lie declared or distributed except out of net earnings. It is clear that the declaration of a dividend is as much pro - hibited under the icrmsof the Constitution as the ]»aynient. The directors of the Wehn Telephone Company had no right to increase the liabilities of the company by declaring dividends anil thus lay the company liable to suits and to weivership. Dividends that are not declared out of net earnings, but impair the capital of the eori&gt;oratioii. may be enjoined. 14 C. J., p. 82J). '-Corporation*."

            <seg id="p175">OPINIONS 175 and, second, that the issue shall be in such manner as may l»e provided by law. The manner provided by law is contained in the stocks and bonds act, sections »&gt;7&lt;i-»i7S, Compiled Statutes, IU'2'2. The constitution also provides, Article 12, Section 1. as follows : "The legislature shall provide by general law for the organization, regulation, supervision and general control of all corporations, and for the organization, supervision and general control of mutual and co - operative companies and associations, and by such legislation shall in - the mutuality and co-operative features and functions thereof. Foreign corporations transacting or seking to transact business in this state shall be subject, under general law, to regulation, supervision and general control, and shall not be given a greater rights or privileges than are given domestic corporations of a similar character." Nothing can l&gt;e more obvious than that in the section just quoted there is a provision for the regulation of both foreign corporations and domestic corporations, and nothing can be more obvious than that there is intended to lx&gt; complete equality of treatment. That the legislature intended to include all corpora - tions, both foreign and domestic, within the terms of the stocks and Itonds act is demonstrated by a comparison of the act as it stood before the amendment of 1923 with its present form. It formerly read (Sec. 7."&gt;8. Revised Statutes, l!&gt;i:{&gt; : "A common carrier or public sen-ice corporation, organized and incorporated, or hereafter incorporated, under and by virtue of the laws of the State of Nebraska, may issue stocks," etc. The present law reads: "A common carrier or public service corporation doing business in the State of Nebraska, may issue stocks," etc. ''Privilege'' is defined as: "A particular and peculiar benefit or advantage enjoyed by a person, company, or class, beyond the common advantags of other citizens. An exceptional or extraordinary power or exemption. A </seg>
            <seg id="p176">176 right, power, franchise, or immunity held by a person or class, against or beyond the course of the law." "Privilege is an exemption from some burden or attendance, with which certain persons are indulged, ♦ ♦ ♦** (Black's Law Dictionary. 2nd Ed.) The requirement that sixty days' public notice must be given is a burden. In the present case the applicant says it is a vexatious burden. No one disputes the fact that a domestic corporation must bear this burden. The meaning of the Constitution iR that the same burden must be borne by each corporation. Where is there language to contervail such provision of the Constitution? The requirement of sixty days' notice may be ill-advised. It seems uselessly long, yet that consideration cannot be given the slightest weight. Both the letter and the spirit of the Constitution require equality and the provision must be applied to corporations, regardless of the place of organization. It may be truly said that the Constitution and lawa of Nebraska have no extra-territorial effect. While it is plain that the State of Nebraska cannot regulate the internal affairs of corporations, organized elsewhere, it is equally clear that the state can make such requirements as it pleases for the admission of foreign corporations, not performing a service in interstate commerce, to do business in Nebraska. The failure to give the sixty days' notice would not effect the validity of an issue of stock of foreign corporations, but it would immediately affect the right of t-h corporations to do business in Nebraska. A failure comply with the requirements of law in this state would 1k» ground for an ouster proceeding. Nor can it be said that the language of the Constitu - is merely directory. Black Const. Law says, (p. 78, 3rd Ed.): "The provisions of a constitution are almost invariably mandatory; it is only in extremely plain cases, or under the pressure of necessity that they can be construed as merely directory." C00W* Comt. Limitations (7th Ed. p. 114) says: </seg>
            <seg id="p177">OPINIONS 177 "But the courts tread upon very dangerous ground when they venture to apply the rules which distinguish directory and mandatory statutes to the provisions of a constitution.

It has, however, been held in a series of cases that where a corporation is formed in some state or country other than California, for the purpose of doing business in this state, the stock - holders are, so far as concerns business transacted in California, to be held liable in accordance with the California statutes. Pinney v. Nelson, -supra; Peck v. Noee, 154 Cal. 351, 97 Pac. 865; Thomas v. Wentworth Hotel Co., 158 Cal. 275, 110 Pac. 942, 139 Am. St. Rep. 120; Thomas v. Matthiessen, 232 U. S. 221, 34 Sup.

Nelson, and the ground of that decision, as of those following it, is that the stockholders, in forming a corpora - tion for the purpose of doing business in a particular state (e. g. California), must be deemed to have contracted with reference to the laws of that state, and will, so far as concerns business transacted therein, be held to the liabilities which those laws impose upon the transaction of such business. In Pinney v. Nelson, the corporation in question was organized in the State of Colorado under articles which declared that the principal plant and operations of the company beyond the limits of the state of Colorado should be in Los Angeles county, State of California. In Peck v.

If there be no &gt;uch creditor competent and willing to lake administration, the same may be committed to -uch other person or persons a.- the judge of probate may think proper.' We cannot doubt that the persons named in this section of the statute, who might, under different conditions, l»e appointed as administrators, were intended by the Cramers of this act to be real and not artificial per - sons. It is required by Section lfKJ of this same chapter that an administrator mu.-t return undpr oath within three months a true inventory of the estate. Section 2S2 requires an administrator to oi.ter an account of his doings in the estate and 'that such account -I'all ha\e annexed thereto the oath of the executor or administrator." There are numerous other duties required of an administrator under the decedent act that could not, in their very nature, be performed by other than a natural person.

The above mentioned statute provides lor the organization of a trust company within the state of Nebraska, and specifically provides that such trust com - pany, acting through its duly authorized officer, may act as executor or administrator of estates. We do not feel ihal ihis section of the statute applies to non-resident, foreign corporations. The county court is provided by law with much discretion in appoiatiaf admin - istrators of estates and there is a rather jjeiieial under - standing that corporation* should not be ap|&gt;ointed as .idministrators, ami that a non-resident person by reason o! his befog outside the jurisdiction of the court is not a desirable ap|&gt;ointee.

            <seg id="p195">195 CORPORATIONS— BUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS Building and loan associations must pay incorporation fees in propor - tion to the stated authorized capital stock. Hon. Charles W. Pool, Secretary of State, Lincoln, Xebraska, Dear Sir You have submitted to this department a typewritten statement made by the Board of Directors of the Globe Savings and Loan Association, of Columbus, Nebraska, and directed to you as Secretary of State. The question involved is whether or not this company is required to pay the tax imposed upon corporations as filing fees to be paid to the Secretary of State when the articles are filed. The section in question is Section 2364, Compiled Statutes, 1922. It is to be noted that this section provides that the fees for filing articles of association, incor - poration or consolidation, domestic or foreign, shall be based on "the authorized capital stock" and that all fees provided for shall be paid in advance to the Secretary of State and by him paid to the State Treasurer. The company mentioned is contending that the capital stock of the association for the purpose of paying filing fees is based upon the provisions of Section 8084, Compiled Statutes, 1922, which provides: "The capital stock of every such association shall consist of the accumulated payments made by its members and dividends credited thereon, and shall be represented by shares." It is apparent that this company has failed to distin - guish between "capital stock" and "authorized capital </seg>

The capital stock referred to in Section 8084, Compiled Statutes. ItZS, is the working or actual capital stock of a company as paid up and refers to paid up capital stock. Authorized capital stock is referred to in Section 2364. Compiled Statutes, 1922, for the purpose of ascertaining the filing fees, and refers to the amount of capital stock mentioned in the articles of association, which means tha' the corporation is authorized to issue the amount of capital stock not to exceed the limit mentioned in the articles. It is proposed that amended articles of the association might l»e filed, stating verbatim the language of Section 8084, Compiled Statutes, 1922, in reference to the capital stock of the association. We do not believe that this would comply with the corporation laws of this state. It is necessary to limit the capital stock of the company, and particularly in view of the other sections of the law pertaining to corporations. Building and loan associations it seems are excused from the payment of an occupation tax. They are corpor - ations organized for profit and we find no exception which excuses them from payment of incorporation fees. It is therefore our opinion that building and loan associations should pay incorporation fees in proportion to the amoun of their authorized capital stock as stated in their articles of association.

Whereas a corporation is organized under the general incorporation law with a fixed capital to be divided into shares of a fixed par value, it is a condition precedent of the commencement of the business of such corporation, that it shall have subscribed the full amount of its capital stock, unless the articles of incorpora - tion authorized it to commence business upon the subscription of a certain percentage of its capital stock. Mr. R. ('. Pui-koii*. Examiner, Ifureau of Securitikx Lincoln, Xcbragku. Dear Sir: In reply to your request for an opinion of the Attor - ney (icncnil, U]khi the subject of the amount of capital .stock necessary to Ik- subscribed by a corporation organised under the laws of Nebraska, before such corporatiOH may commence business or proceed with the accomplishments of the main design for which such cor]M&gt;rafion is organized will say: \. CENERAL RILE We direct your attention to Section 4(51, Compiled Statutes, 1 Olili, which in part provides: "Every cor]K&gt;ra - tion, previous to the commencement of any business, except its own organization, where the same is not formed by legislative enactment, must adopt articles of incor]K&gt;ration, and have them filed in the office of the Secretary of State, and recorded in a book kept for that purpose, and domestic corporations must also file with the countv clerk in the county where their headquarters air located." Section 4ti»&gt;, Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides : -Any corj&gt;oration formed without lejrislative enactment may commence business as soon as its articles of incor|toration are filed by the county clerks of the counties, as required by this article, and shall l&gt;e valid, if a copy of its articles be filed in the office of the secretary of state, and the </seg>
            <seg id="p198">198 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL notice required Ik* published within four mouths from the lime of filiuji such articles in the clerk's office." These sections of our statutes were interpreted by our supreme court in the early case of Lirxi 1/ r. Onmhii Hotel Com pain/, ."1 Xebr. Pajie 50, 7"_\ wherein it was said: "But it is more earnestly contended that sections 12(» and l.'!2 j&gt;rant the right of proceeding with the '•main and ultimate object" of the company, regardless of the fact whether all or ;iiiy of the capital required by the charter has Ik-cii first subscrilwd. Section HM» provides that "every corporation previous to commencement of any business, • * * must adopt articles of incorporation and have them recorded in the office of the county clerk of the county, or counties. in which the business is to be transacted:" and section 132 provides that the corporation '-may commence business as soon as its articles of incorporation are filed by the county clerk, as required by this sub-division, and shall be valid, if a copy of its articles l&gt;e filed in the office of the secretary of state, and the notice required be published within four months from the time of flltag sn.ch articles in the clerk's office." The latter section modifies the fonner by what may be considered as an explanatory clause. providing' that the cor] »oration "may commence business as soon as tlie articles of incorporation are filed in the county clerk's office." instead of waiting until they are recorded, and by making the validity of the corporation depend on filing a copy of the articles with the secretary of state, and upon publication of the notice re - quired. These two sections point to the same subject mat - ter, and must be considered together as one. If is true that the words, "may commence business." taken in a literal sense by themselves, would seem to indicate a de]&gt;ai-ture from the general rule of law in regard to the necessary qualifi - cations of a cor] (oration to enable it to commence business in its coi]K)rate capacity. But in the interpretation of the pener-.il hmrperation act, it must be borne in mind that the sole object of the statute was to provide a system for the incori torn t ion of companies, without the granting of chart- </seg>
            <seg id="p199">OPINIONS 199 era by sj&gt;ecial legislation, and not to unsettle well estab - lished principles of law in regard to the qualifications of corporations to enable them to commence business. The rule is "Srirc legcx non hoc eat vnba carum tenere, xed vim ac potextutem, and the reason and intention of the law giver will control the strict letter of the law, when the latter would lead to palpable injustice, contradiction and absur - dity." 1 Kent Com., 510. Now, in the organization of n company to enter upon an enterprise involving large ex - pense and various business transactions, it will hardly lie supposed that the legislature intended to make the mere fil - ling of the articles of incorporation a sufficient qualifica - tion to proceed in the execution of its main design, to enter into contracts for that purpose, to create debts an&lt;l transact business generally. On the contrary, the legis - lative intention surely must have been to simply fix the time when the company may commence business, when otherwise qualified; and this interpretation of the law, is supported by the fact that the section does not define any of the qualifications necessary to put the corporation into operation, except the filing of the articles. There is no ex - press provision in the law authorizing it to enter upon the execution of its main object without the performance of a condition precedent contained in its charter; and no such authority is to be inferred from the words "commence busi - ness". The members of the company are not prohibited from defining what shall be the qualifications of the eorpor ation to enable it to go into operation, and therefore, when the contract is that a fixed amount of capital divided into shares of a certain amount each, shall be a necessary quali - fication, such requisite is a condition precedent, and a fund - amental law of the corporation. The general statute and the articles are considered in the nature of a grant from the state and taken together constitute the charter. Again, at the time the act was passed, it was the settled rule of law that a corporation having a fixed amount of cap - ital, divided into shares of a certain amount each, could not proceed with the execution of its main object, until all </seg>
            <seg id="p200">200 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL its capital was Bubscribed, unless it was clearly provided that it might do so with a less subscription than the amount of capital fixed by the charter. The presumption is that the legislature had in their minds the common law doctrine then so well established and understood, and that they intended to leave the determination of all the necessary qualifications to enable the corporation to go into operation except the filing of the articles, to be provided by the char - ter, and to be governed by the principles of the common law in force. The conclusion is, that the incorporation act •M not intended to nullify the settled rules of law in res - pect to the qualifications of a corporation, to enable it to commence business, and therefore does not dispense with a subscription of all the capital stock, when the charter makes such subscription a condition precedent to be per - formed l&gt;efore proceeding with the accomplishment of its main design."

Hi'2'2 provides : ''The persons named in the certificate of incoriM)iation, or a majority of them, shall be commissioners to open the books for the subscription to the capital stock of said company, and at such times and places as they shall d«"em proper, and the said company is authorized to com - mence operations upon the subscription of 10% of said stock. In the case of Meyer-Cord Com/Mini/ r. If ill, S4 Xebr.. our supreme court in construing the law applicable to the incorporation of all manufacturing companies quoted from the former case of Holt on r. Xcbnixku ('hickory Company, &lt;»!) Xel). 681, held as follows: "The statute here in question was obviously designed to encourage the promotion of manufacturing enterprises of all kinds, in the widest sense, by relaxing the rules as to organization. There is every reason for giving it a liberal construction, and no fraud can result from so doing." </seg>
            <seg id="p201">OPINIONS 201 CONCLUSION It is therefore the opinion of the attorney general that where a corporation is organized under the general incor - poration laws with a certain fixed capital to lx- divided into shares of a fixed par value, it is a condition precedent to I lie commencement of the business of such corporation to jiccomplish the main design for which such corporation was arpwiaed, that it shall have — fciiHini the full amount of its capital stock, unless the articles of incorjioration authorize such corporation to commence business upon the subscription of ;i certain percentage of its capital stock and it is a condition precedent that such corj&gt;oration fchall have subscrihed such percentage of its capital stock so authorized. It is farther the ophrioa of the attorney general that if such corporation is organized as a manufacturing com - pany under Article HI of Chapter ll\ Compiled Statutes IKS, that such company may commence the business for which such cor|M&gt;ration was organized when it shall have subscribed ten per cent of its capital stock.

This section of the statute was construed in the case of Kemper, et ul i\ I)orehext( r Farmer* Ob Opermiin Grain and Livestock Company, et til, 102 Neb. B&amp; law was enacted by the 1915 session of the lejris - re and originally appears as Chapter 174 of the 101-1 ion Laws and in discussing the constitutionality of provision of the Act the court said : "If public policy requires some restriction on the right to vote by stockholders who own stock in two or more competing corporation.-:, the legislature might without doubt, by proper enactment, prevent such practices, and while the purpose of such legislation should be made plainly to appear in the title to the Act and in the Act itself, we do not find it necesary to determine in this case whether such regulation might be made by proviso to the Act intended to comply with the constitutional requirements in regard to cumulative voting. </seg>
            <seg id="p203">OPINIONS 203 If it is conceded that this proviso, not being mentioned in the title to the Act, and for other reasons is invalid, the question still is whether the unconstitutionality of this proviso would render the whole Act void as in conflict with the constitution. It is ars;vH at lar&gt;:e in the briefs that this proviso must be considered as an inducement to the passage of the Act. That is to say, that t:ie unavoMrMc conclusion from the language of the Act itself am! of its title must be that the legislature would not have enacted tho statute if it w.-.s not to apply to stockholders holding stock in competing corporations. Even if this is true and we consider the Act as a whole, it appears beyond question that the purpose and intention of the legislature was to grant the right of cumulative voting to all stockholders not owning stock in competing corporations. That is, the legislature has com - plied with the constitutional provision in part and if it has not gone as far as it should have gone in obedience to the requirements of the constitution, we are for that reason compelled to invalidate legisla - tion that was clearly within the duty imposed upon the legislature by the constitution. If additional legislation is necessary in order to fully comply with the constitution, that duty will devolve upon subsequent legislatures.** This lnw 'was marled in pursuance of tin* terms of t It.* former constitution. This constitution;)) provision which formerly appeared as section ."», article XII), constitution of 1S7.~&gt;, now appears as section ."&gt;. article XII of the amended constitution of 1!&gt;UO. Since the legislature has indicated that this proviso is unconstitutional by reason of the fart that the legislature failed to incorporate in the title to the Act a proviso for the limiting of cumulative voting to stockholders as do not own stock in competing corporations, that th.M-e is no law authorizing such a limitation and a cor poration organized under the laws of the state of Xeirraska would nor have the right to fix such a limitation in their articles of incorporation or by-laws.

            <seg id="p205">OPINIONS 205 Secretary of State, and discussing this proposition, Mr. Commissioner Oldham in the opinion upon rehearing in part said: "The question then arises, does the failure of a domestic corpora - tion, organized under the general laws of the state, to file its articles of incorporation with the secretary of state, when it has filed them in the office of the clerk of the county in which its place of business is situated, render its proceedings a nullity for the purpose of tran - sacting business other than its own organization? Section 126, chap - ter 16, Compiled Statutes (Annotated Statutes, 4119), which is quoted in the original opinion, provides in substance that every corpora - tion, when the same is not formed by legislative enactment, shall adopt articles of incorporation and have them filed in the office nf the secretary of state, and it also provides that domestic corporations must also file them with the county clerk in the county where their head - quarters are located. This section of the statute was adopted in 1897, as an amendment to section 126, Chapter 25, Revised Statutes, 1866, which only provided for the recording of the articles with the county clerk in the county in which the business of the corporation is to be transacted. Section 132, chapter 25 of the Revised Statutes of 1866, however, has never been amended or repealed by direct enact - ment and remains as section 132, chapter 16, Compiled Statutes (An - notated Statutes, 4124), and this section provides that any corpora - tion formed without legislative enactment may commence business as soon as its articles of incorporation are filed with the county clerk of the county, as required by this subdivision, and shall be valid if a copy of its articles be filed in the office of the secretary of state, etc. This latter section of the statute is now in full force and effect un - less repealed by implication by the enactment of section 126, SUPRA, and if repealed by implication it must be because of a clear and irrecon - cilable conflict between the two sections. If the question of the con - flict of these sections of the statute and the consequent repeal of section 132 by the adoption of section 126 had been raised in a direct attack by a quo warranto proceeding, instituted by the state to prevent the corporation from transacting business, other than its organization, without filing its articles with both the county clerk and the secre - tary of state, we would consider the question one worthy of grave con - sideration, for in such proceeding the corporation would be compelled to show its right tie jure to transact business, but when collaterally attacked, as in the case at bar, it is only necessary to show a de facto existence. Prior to the amendment of 1897 it was held by this court that the filing of articles with the county clerk is a condition precedent </seg>

Omaha Smelting &amp; Refining Co., 4 Neb., 416; Cappa ft McCreary v. Hastings Prospecting Co., 40 Neb. 477. These cases go to the question that the mere adoption of articles of incorpora - tion, without filing the same as required by statute, gives no right as even a de facto corporation to transact business; but in the case of Haas v. Bank of Commerce, 41 Neb. 754, where the right of a cor - poration was collaterally attacked, Irvine C, speaking for the court ' 'Where the law authorizes a corporation, and there has been an attempt in good faith to organize, and corporate functions are thereafter exercised, there exists a corporation de facto, the legal existence of which can not ordinarily be called in question collater - ally. It would be intolerable to permit in any civil action, to which such a body was a party, an inquiry into the legal right to ex - ercise corporate functions, a right which it is for the state alone to question in appropriate proceedings for that purpose. On this there is a substantial unanimity in the authorities. Among other cases may be cited, Williamson v. Kokomo Building &amp; Loan Fund Ass'n, 89 Ind., 389; Pape v. Capitol Bank, 20 Kan. 440; Lessee of Frost v. Frost - barg Coal Co., 24 How. (U. S.)278; Society Perum v. Cleveland, 43 Ohio St. 481. The evidence shows that articles of incorporation were adopted acknowledged and filed for record in the office of the county clerk, and that the bank acted under such articles and conducted business thereunder for some years. This was sufficient evidence of a corporate existence. Abbott v. Omaha Smelting &amp; Refining Co., 4 Neb. 416; Merchants Nat. Bank v. Glendon Co., 120 Mass. 97.'" Prior to the filing of the articles of incorporation with the Secretary of State the applicant was a corporation de facto, but since filing the articles with the Secretary of State we are of the opinion that the applicant is now a corporation de jure, and if otherwise qualified it is proper for the Bureau of Securities to issue an authoriza - tion order to said applicant to issue its stock to the sub - scriber therefor.

            <seg id="p207">OPINIONS 207 CORPORATIONS— EXPIRATION OF CHARTER Where the duration of the corporation is expressly limited, the cor - porate existence terminates ipso facto on the expiration of the time without action upon the part of those in charge of its busi - ness affairs, but where the corporation continues to exercise its franchise beyond the period for which it was organized the state alone can complain. Hon. K. C. Kiuulxon Lie put if Secretary, I lh part mi nt of Trade &amp; Commerce, State Houxe, Lincoln, Xclrraxka. Dear Sir You say: "We have a bank that has been operating since 1898 without ever having had their Articles of Incorporation filed with the Secretary of State, but several amendments have been filed with the said Secretary of State. This bank has now taken over another bank and desires to be an absolutely legal corporation, and the question now arises — Can this bank file its 1898 adopted Articles of Incorporation for a period of twenty years, and be a legally organized corporation?" And add that the original articles of incorporation as well as several amendments thereto were approved by your Department and that the original articles of incorporation were filed in the office of the county clerk of the county in which the bank is located. In answer to the question which you propound I will say that I note the time for which the bank was originally incorporated has expired and I assume none of the amend - ments spoken of have attempted to extend the term of its existence. This could have been done if the amendment had been prior to November 15, 1923, at which time the bank existence terminated according to its charter, but, "It is the general rule that where the duration of the corpora- </seg>

(Thompson on Corporations, Sec. 267.) This renders it doubtful whether as a matter of strict law a corporation which in the eye of the law has ceased to exist can be resurrected by an amendment to its orijr - inal articles of incorporation. It has been held, however, that I "Where a corporation exercises its franchise beyond the period which it was organized, the state alone can complain." (Thomp - on Corporations, Section 190.) I am of the opinion therefore that if all the stock - holders agree, every one of them, that the amendments ex - tending the existence of the bank for a period of twenty years shall lie made, and the State acting through you' - department accepts said amendment as a valid extension of the period of the bank's existence, the bank will be jus - tified in proceeding upon the theory that the period of its existence has been extended by the amendment.

CORPORATIONS— ORGANIZATION Incorporators must be composed of natural persons in absence of a statutory provision to the contrary. Bureau of Securities, State House, Lincoln, Xehraxka. Gentlemen : In reply to your inquiry concerning the right of one corporation to hold stock in another corporation, we direct your attention as follows: In 14 C. .1., page 105, Section 81, the author says: "A corporation need not necessarily be composed of natural persons or of natural persons only. If authorized by statute it may be composed either wholly of other corporations or of natural persons and corporations; and one private corporation may, either </seg>
            <seg id="p222">222 by original subscription or by purchase, become a stockholder and member of another corporation, with all the rights and liberties attaching to such relation, either when it is expressly authorized by its charter to do so, or when such subscription or purchase . is within its implied powers as a necessary or proper means of exercis - ing the other powers conferred on it. But it cannot lawfully do so when not expressly authorized by its charter, and when such a trans - action is foreign to the purposes of its creation. Nor can a cor - poration become one of the original incorporators of another cor - poration where the statute expressly or inpliedly requires them to be natural persons." In Vol. 14A C. J., page 290, Section 2138, the author farther says: t"One corporation, may, when authorized by statute, purchase &gt;ntrolling interest in the stock of another corporation and exercise 1 control. But in the absence of an express permission it is not lin the general powers of a corporation to purchase the stock other corporations for the purpose of controlling their manage - it It is obvious that a corporation cannot hold shares of an - ;r corporation where to do so would be the creation of unlawful topoly or combination in restraint of trade." In Vol. II, page 2067, Section 1117, Fletcher's En - cyclopedia of Corporations, the author states the rule as follows: "In the United States there are some cases to the same effect as the English rule, but they are opposed to the decided weight of authority both in the federal and state courts. The prevailing doc - trine is that a corporation has no power either to subscribe for or purchase shares of stock in another corporation, unless such power is expressly conferred upon it by its charter or other statute, or unless the circumstances are such that the transaction is a neces - sary or reasonable means of carrying out or accomplishing the objects for which it was created. Moreover, purchases of stock of other corporations have been held to be contrary to public policy, in addition to being beyond the power of the corporation. • » • Where a corporation has no power to subscribe for or purchase stock in another corporation, it cannot do so indirectly through a trustee or agent 'To hold otherwise would be to sustain a trans - action illegal in its character, accomplished by indirection, when it could not be done if the methods were direct' " </seg>
            <seg id="p223">223 At Section 1121, the author further says: "On the other hand, a corporation may take stock in another company without express authority, provided there is no express prohibition, whenever the circumstances are such as to render the transaction a necessary or proper means of accomplishing the objects of its creation. 'Whether the purchase of stock in one corporation by another is ultra vires or not,' it was said in an Indiana case, 'must depend upon the purpose for which the purchase was made, and whether such purchase was under all the circumstances, a necessary or reasonable means of carrying out the object for which the corporation was created, or one which under the statute it might accomplish.' * * « • "Although some of the decisions already cited in this Section tend to establish a contrary rule, it would seem to be the bettet rule that a corporation may purchase stock in a corporation in aid of its business where it would have the power to buy all the pro - duct of such corporation. Thus, in a recent Missouri decision, it is held that a railroad company may acquire stock in coal and elevator companies when the purpose is to facilitate its business, and that it is immaterial that the company purchases a majority or prac - tically all the shares of stock of such companies; and the court said: 'If the railroad company could do that business with its own means, why could it not secure itself in the matter of obtaining coal for fuel or a convenience in handling grain by acquiring stock in a coal or elevator company, if it would be more convenient, and if the public was not injured thereby?' So in a later case in Miss - ouri, it was held that a railroad company may own the stock of an express company organized as a carrier of express freight, and also the stock of a refrigerator car company which owns cars devised and used for the transportation of products which require refrigera - tion while in transit, on the theory that 'both companies are engaged in business which the railroad company would carry on itself; and if it could do so directly it may do so indirectly by owning the stock of the companies engaged directly in the business.' Likewise it ww held in a federal case that a corporation created to manfacture, bleach and dye cottons had power to exchange part of its stock for stock in a dyeing corporation formed by its consulting chemist, where the formulas of the chemist were his own discovery and secret, and were used by the manufacturing company only." At Section 1122, the author says: 'The general rule that a corporation cannot subscribe for or </seg>
            <seg id="p224">224 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL purchase stock in another corporation is based upon the groun.I that such a transaction is generally foreign to the objects of its creation, and not upon any notion that the nature of a corporation renders it incapable of taking and holding stock in other corpora - tions. A corporation therefore, may take and hold stock in another corporation whenever it is expressly authorized to do so." I In the case of Nebraska Shirt Company vs. Ho-rton, Neb. Unof. 888, in the opinion by Mr. Commissioner und it is said: "Corporations have quite enough power without allowing them to incorporate themselves in new companies. Unless authorized by statute a corporation has no power to subscribe to the capital stock of another corporation, and such a subscription is not binding." tin that case the Nebraska Shirt Company had sub - ibed to some of the capital stock of the Trans-Mississ - i Exposition Company, which was a business not with - the objects for which the Nebraska Shirt Company was incorported. kin the latter case of State, ex rel, Terrill vs Lincoln rtion Company, 90 Neb. 535, our court quoted with roval the aiiove portion of the former opinion. kin the recent case of Twamley, Souk &amp; Company in. oif/o (Ircat Western Railroad Company, ....Neb...., N.

Defendant asserts that the hold - a membership in the Omaha Grain Exchange is ultra vires; that holding of such membership confers no rights upon the defen - it and entails no obligations. We are unwilling to concede the ndness of this contention. While the railroad company may not </seg>

Carriers may, and do, own grain elevators for the purpose of storage and to enable them to obtain and handle grain for transportation. We think they are authorized to do anything that is lawful and necessarily incident to carrying on the business of a carrier. By holding &lt;i membeisi'ip in the exchange, a carrier is enabled to ascertain when grain is to be transported ta other markets, to come in contract with shippers, and to solicit the consignments of grain over its line i.f railway. We are of the opinion that the holding of such member - ship, under the circumstances, was not prohibited by its articles of incorporation ami was not unlawful; that it was proper and legiti - mate and in furtherance of its lawful business." , In die cist' oi Hill. &lt;t nl r. \i*l»t. &lt;t nl. loo I ml.

Whether the purchase of s'.ock in one corporation by another is ultra vires or not, must depend upon the purpose for which the purchase was made, and whether such purchase was, under all the circumstances, a necessary or reasonable means of carrying out the object for which the corporation was created, or one which under the statute it might accomplish." In the fuse of IIoIihis &amp;. Grigga Mmmmf«r1»rim§ Com - lidini v. llolmix k Wrmel Metal Vmmptmg, 1-7 N. V.

            <seg id="p226">226 "It is equally true, however, that it may do whatever may be necessary in the exercise of its corporate franchises." In the case of People v.

E. 768 (773), it is said: I "The question as to the right of one corporation to hold stock another corporation was before this court in People v. Chicago i Trn»t Co., 130 111. 268, 22 N. E. 798, 8 L. R. A. 497, 17 Am. Rep. 319. * * * In passing upon that question the court said: rporations can only exercise such powers as may be conferred the legislative body creating them, either in express terms or by essary implication, and the implied powers are presumed to exist enable such bodies to carry out the express powers granted ami accomplish the purposes of their creation.' * • • » After referr - to the authorities, the court said: 'It has been held in many es that "In the United States corporations can not purchase or 1 or deal in the stocks of other corporations unless expressly horized to do so by law," and that "one corporation can not become owner of any portion of the capital stock or another eorpoia - i unless authority to become such is clearly conferred by statute." Iln the case of Hort r. Leicis, 71 Neb. 365 (368), 98 W. 1046; 103 N. W. 460, our court says: I "We take it that there is no better settled principle of law, this country, than that a grant of express power includes within implied authority to do any and all things necessary and conven - ient for the carrying of them into execution." It is therefore our opinion, in view of the above cited authorities, that one corporation cannot hold or own stock in another corporation unless there is express statutory authority therefor, or unless the circumstances are such that the transaction is a necessary or reasonable means of carrying out or accomplishing the objects for which the corporation was created. It is further our opinion that a corporation may pur - chase stock in another corporation in aid of its business where it would have the power to buy all the product of such corporation where the purchase and holding of such </seg>

Section 1 of chapter 56, Gen. Stat., provides that 'any number of persons may associate themselves together and be - come incorporated for the transaction of any lawful business, except banking and insurance, and tor the construction of railroads, but such incorporation shall confer no powers or privileges not possessed by natural persons, except as hereinafter provided.' It is, we think, manifest the Legislature never intended to permit one person to con - duct his ordinary business in the name of a corporation so as to exempt him from personal liability, or his property, not embrace"! by or used in his corporate business, from the payment of a debt, lor no other reason than its being a debt of the corporation. The purpose of the statute was to enable two or more persons possessed of a capital or skill to associate themselves in business, and to limit their liability as against the improvident acts of each other, or the act of the corporation, in the event of pecuniary loss in the legiti - mate and proper conduct of its business. It invites the investment of the capital stock of one to be placed in the same business with the skill ot another, or a combination of capital that encourages trade, the burden of which mere individual enterprise would be unwilling to assume, and it could not have been the legislative in - tent that any one man could form a corporation of which he is the creator and sole stockholder, so as to limit his liability for debt* contracted, and from which he has derived the benefit, to the extent only of what he might designate his corporate estate. He owns the entire property belonging to the corporation; it is his.

He could make a gift of the entire cor - porate estate, and dispense with all corporate forms; and to say, when exercising such unlimited control, he is not personally re - sponsible for every debt he contracts, would be to prevert the plain purpose of the statute.

The author says: "As a general rule, however, special acts creating corporation? requires more than one member, and the general laws authorizing the formation of corporations usually specify a minimum number who may unite for this purpose, and where the statute thus fixes the minimum number, the minimum is mandatory and a less number cannot form or become a corporation."

It was argued that where the period of the existence of the cor - poration was limited by statute or charter that the estate acquire! could not extend beyond the period of the corporate existence; that accordingly such a corporation at most could only acquire an estate for years, not exceeding such period of its existence. But this doctrine never obtained a respectable foothold. The objection was disposed of in the early New York cases, where the court says: 'But it is objected that because, by the act of incorporation, there was. given to it only a term of existence of fifty years, therefore the grant shall be deemed to have conveyed an estate for years, and not in fee. The unsoundness of that position is easily shown. It was never yet held, that a grant of a fee in express terms could be restricted by the fact that the grantee had but a limited term of existence. If it were so, a grant could never be made to an individual in fee, because, in his earthly existence, he is not immortal. Under such a rule, a man could never buy a greater interest in a farm than a life estate. It would follow that all estates would be life estates, except those held by perpetual corporations. The intent of parties, fully expressed in a deed, would avail nothing, but all grants would be measured by the mortality of the grantee. It is. needless to follow out the proposition further to show its ab - surdity.' The doctrine of this case was expressly approved in more recent cases in the same state." Section 458 of the Compiled Statutes of 1922 provides: "Any number of persons may be associated and incorporated for the transaction of any lawful business," etc. Vol. 2, Fletcher on Corporations, page 2040, Sec. 1086 states the general rule as follows: "The general rule is that a corporation, in the absence of re - strictions in its charter or the general law, has the implied power to acquire real property, by purchase or otherwise, and hold same, </seg>

Dear Sirs: kin reply to your inquiry as to the right of a corpor - n to repurchase or retire its capital stock, we direct r attention to the following authorities: Cook on Corporations, 8th Ed. Vol. 2, Section 311, the author states the rule as follows : tRule in the United States. In this country there has been a ence of opinion as to whether a corporation may purchase &gt; of its own stock. In Illinois, Massachusetts, and other such a purchase is legal and allowable. And, indeed, if there </seg>
            <seg id="p239">OPINIONS 239 is no statutory liability on stock, and if stock holders do not object, there is no reason why the net profits of a corporation should not be applied to purchase its stock, instead of being used for a dividend. The Federal court has said: 'It is a mooted question in this country as to whether a corporation may purchase shares of its own stock. Many states forbid it. In the absence of a charter prohibition or a statute forbidding it there is no reason why the stock should not be purchased, at least with the profits derived from the business of the corporation, where all the stock holders assent thereto.' The cases which appear to uphold a contrary rule are found, upon class examination to be outside of the rule given above." In the case of Atlanta d Walworth Butter d Cheese Association v. Smith, 123 N. W. 106, 32 L. R. A. n. s. 137, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin held: "By a long line of decisions here ,m the absence of a plain statutory prohibition to the contrary, and we have none, or such prohibition in the articles of the organization of the corporation, a corporation may, in general, so long as it acts in good faith by authorization of its governing body, lawfully purchase its own stock, either as to stockholders or persons or future creditors, and without such authorization its officers may, acting in good faith, do so as regards consenting stock holders or such creditors. The court spoke decisively on the subject in Shoemaker, et al., t. Wash - burn Lumber Company, 97 Wis. 594, 73 N. W. 333." In the case of Allen v. Francisco Sugar Company, 193 Fed. 825, 114 C. C. A. 453, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for New Jersey held: "A corporation in the absence of constitutional or statutory pro - hibition, has an inherent right, has a bona fide purpose to retire by purchase its capital stock." This case was followed in the subsequent case of San ford r. The First National Bank of Marysville, Kansas, 238 Fed. page 298. In the case of Singhaus v. Piper, 103 Neb. 493, 17- N.

Ami court appears to have adopted that view: 'A corporation, when prohibited by its articles or by statute, may buy anil sell its 1 &gt;tc(k, ami hold, reissue or retire the same, provided such act done in entire pood faith and in no manner injures the rights its creditors or its stockholders.' Fremont Carriage Mfg. Co. v. &gt;m»son, &lt;i"&gt; Neb. 370. It is necessary that the law should be well settled and thoroughly understood upon such a question, and we do not consider it ad - visable to re-examine the question now, after 18 years. The return of &gt;t(K-k by shareholders to the corporation in consideration of property of the corporation must, however, be 'in entire good faith ami no manner injure the rights of its creditors or its stockholders.'

Concerning the right of one corporation to hold stock in another corjwration, the author, in Volume 14 Corpus Juris, Page 105, Sec. 81 announces the rule to l»e as fol - lows : "A corporation need not necessarily be composed of natural per - sons or of natural persons only. If authorized by statute it may be composed either wholly of other corporations or of natural persons and corporations; and one private corporation may, either by original subscription or by purchase, become a stockholder and member of an - other corporation, with all the rights and liabilities attaching to such relation, either when it is expressly authorized by its charter to do so, or when such subscription or purchase is within its implied powers as a necessary or proper means of exercising the other powers conferred on it. But it cannot lawfully do so when not ex - pressly authorized by its charter, and when such transaction is for - eign to the purposes of its creation. Nor can a corporation become one of the original incorporators of another corporation where the statute expressly or impliedly requires them to be natural persons." </seg>
            <seg id="p242">242 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL In Volume 14A Corpus Juris, Page 284, Sec. 2129 the author further says: "The rule supported by the great weight of authority is that a corporation cannot take and hold stock in another corporation unless such power has been expressly granted to it or is conferred by neces - sary implication." In the ease of Hyms vs. Old Dominion Company, 113 Me., Page 294, M Atl". 747, (751), it is said: "It is settled law generally that one corporation cannot hold capital stock of another corporation without legislative authority." Again in the case of People vs. Union &lt;5as &amp; Electric Company, 254 111. 395, 98 Me. 708, Ann. Cases 191fi B.

It is often employed to designate powers which corporations are not authorized to exercise or contracts which they are not authorized to make — or, in other words, such acts, powers, and contracts as are ultra vires. Neither a foreign nor a domestic corporation can lawfully become a stockholder in another corporation unless such power is expressly given or necessarily implied, and especially is this true where the object is to obtain the control ol such other corporation. There is no provision of our general incor - poration law authorizing one corporation to purchase and hold shares of stock in other corporations, and there is no implied power to -o purchase stock in other corporations except where it is necessary to carry into effect the objects for which such corporation was formea The purchase of a controlling interest in the Kellogg Company by the American Company cannot be sustained on the ground of im - plied power. As a general proposition, all contracts and agreements of every kind and character, made and entered into by those engaged in an employment or business impressed with a public character, which tend to prevent competition between those engaged in like employment, are opposed to the public policy of this state and are therefore unlawful. All agreements and contracts tending to create monopolies and prevent proper competition are by the common law illegal and void. People v. Chicago Gas Trust Co., 130 111. 268, 22 N. E. 798, 8 L. R. A. 497, 17 Am. St. Rep. 319. The public policy •if the state on any question is to be sought for in the Constitution and legislation as interpreted and expounded by the courts. Section 22 of article 4 of the Constitution of 1870 provides that the Genera: Assemply shall pass no local or special law for 'granting to any cor - poration, association or individual any special or exclusive privilege, immunity or franchise whatever.' This is a clear declaration that the public policy of this state is opposed to all exclusive and monopolistic franchises and powers, of whatever kind or character." Article 12, Sec. 1, Constitution of Nebraska provides: "The legislature shall provide by general law for the organization regulation, supervision and general control of all corporations, and for the organization, supervision and general control of mutual and co-oper - ative companies and associations, and by such legislation shall insure the mutuality and co-operative powers and functions thereof. Foreign corporations transacting or seeking to transact business in this state shall be subject, under general law, to regulation, supervision and general control, and shall not be given greater rights or privileges than are given domestic corporations of similar character.

Volume 3, Neb. (Unof.) Rep., Page 888 in the case of Nebraska Shirt Company vs. Horton our supreme court commission in an opinion written by Commissioner Pound said: "Corporations have quite enough power without allowing them to incorporate themselves in new companies. Unless authorized by statute, a corporation has no power to subscribe to the capital . tock of another corporation and such a subscription is not binding." In State ex. rel. Tyrrell vs. Lincoln Traction Company, 90 Neb. 535, ( 547 ) our supreme court said : "In Nebraska Shirt Company vs. Horton, 3 Neb. (Unof.) 888, we held that, unless authorized by statute a corporation has no- power to subscribe to the capita! stock of another corporation." In view of the above cited authorities, we are of the opinion that according to the public policy of the State of Nebraska as reflected by our constitution and the decisions - of our supreme court it is unlawful for one cori»oration to hold stock in another corjtoration in Nebraska, and that such holding by any cori&gt;oration, either domestic or foreign is ultra vires. It apj&gt;ears from the application of the applicant com - pany that a large part of the stock of the applicant com - pany would be held and owned by a foreign corporation, and even though the foreign corporation has the right under the laws in the state wherein it is organized to hold stock in other corporations, yet it could not lawfully hold stock in Nebraska cor) Mirations inasmuch as the same is contrary to the public jMilicy of this state. However, it ap] tears from the application that such foreign corporation is not doing a competitive business with the domestic company, and if the Department of </seg>

In reply to the question pertaining to the objects for which a wpwation may become incorporated, Si-ction 45A Compiled Statutes 1922, in part provides: "Any number of persons may be associated and incorporate I for the transaction of any lawful business, * ♦ *." In Volume 14, Corpus Juris, Pago 121), Sec. 120, the author states the general rule as follows : "If a statute, as is sometimes the case, authorizes the formation of corporations 'for the purpose of engaging in any lawful enter - prise, business, purpose or occupation," or generally for mutual profit or benefit not inconsistent with the constitution and laws of the state, there is no restriction as to the purposes for which a corporation may be lawfully formed except that it must not be unlawful or in - consistent with the constitution or laws of the state, and the courts must give the statute the broad construction required by its terms; and this construction has generally been placed upon statutes authorising the formation of corporations for certain specified purposes 'or for any lawful business' except as therein stated, and on other similar stat - utes. In other jurisdictions, however, the general rule of construc - tion that general words in a statute extend only to thing.* of a kin - dred nature to those specifically mentioned has been applied to these latter statutes, and it has been held that corporations for purpo.-es not of a like nature to those previously mentioned, although not un - lawful, are not authorized. Of course if the purpose comes within the exceptions in such a statute it is unauthorized; and the general language of a statute providing for the incorporation of companies for the transaction of any lawful business not otherwise specifically </seg>
            <seg id="p246">246 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL provided for is not to be construed to include the conduct of any busi - ness for the incorporation of which the legislature has otherwise specifically provided." In Volume 1, Fletcher Cyclopedia on Corporations, Page 198. Section 117, the author states the rule as follows: "It is essential, of course, that a corporation shall be formed for some purpose, and statutes authorizing the formation of corporations generally provide that corporations may be organized for certain speci - fied purposes. A question naturally arise? as to whether such stat - ute restricts the corporations organized thereunder to one purpose or permits it to be formed for more than one purpose. This depends upon the verbiage of the statute and the construction to be placed thereon. A statute stating the purposes for which corporations may be formed may be so worded that corporations formed thereunder are restricted to one purpose, or may be so worded that corporations may assume diversified powers, and may have more than one cor - porate object, and may carry on two or more and independ - ent lines of business. "It is held that a statute authorizing the formation of corpora - tions 'for any lawful purpose excepting banking, insurance, real estate brokerage, the operation of railroads, and the business of loaning money,' permits the creation of corporations having more than one object. If several purposes are enumerated in separate subdivisions of the statute a single corporation cannot be organized for purposes specified in more than one of such subdivisions, unless the statute expressly so provides. "A corporation cannot be organized for two or more incompatible purposes.'' W« sire therefore of the opinion that a oor]x&gt;ration may set forth in its articles of incorj&gt;oration more than one l»ui]K&gt;se as the object of the iticoij&gt;oiators providing such additional purpose or pur]K&gt;ses are not incompatible with the direct object for which such organization was incorpor - ated and not for some illegal or unlawful pur)K&gt;se.

            <seg id="p249">249 CORPORATIONS— RESTRICTIONS UPON TRAN8- FERABILITY OF STOCK In the absence of an expressed authority of statute a corporation cannot restrict the transferability of its stock. J. L. Kizer, Examiner, Bureau, of Securities, Department of Trade d Commerce, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In reply to your favor requesting an opinion of the attorney general upon the right of incorporators incor - porating under the laws of Nebraska to make a restric - tion upon the transfer of stock in a corporation, we direct, your attention as follows : In Volume 14 Corpus Juris, page 665, Sec. 1035, the author says : "Any restriction on a stockholder's right to dispose of his shares must be construed strictly; and any attempt to restrain a transfer of shares is regarded as being in restraint of trade, in the absence of a valid lien upon its shares, and except to the extent that valid restrictive regulations and agreements exist and are applicable. Sub - ject only to such restrictions, a stockholder cannot be controlled in or restrained from exercising his right to transfer by the corpora - tion or its officers, or by other stockholders, even though the sale is to a competitor of the company, or to an insolvent person, or even though a controlling interest is sold to one purchaser." In Section 1037 the author further says : "The legislature may impose such conditions upon the transfer of stock as will render it inalienable without a further compliance with the conditions; and when authorized by statute, reasonable re - strictions upon the right to transfer may be expressed in the articles of incorporation or by laws. If the restriction is imposed in direct terms by the legislative charter, so as to imply no transfer unless the restriction is conformed to, then, even, between the seller and buyer, there will be no change of property without such conformity; but if it is prescribed only by a by-law or rule adopted by the corporation, whether under a general charter to that effect or otherwise, a complete and valid transfer as between seller and </seg>
            <seg id="p250">250 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. buyer may be effected by any of the methods which will suffice, under the general law, for the transmission of ownership in per - sonal property. 1. VALIDITY OF BY-LAW OR REGULATION When the restrictions are imposed by a by-law or other cor - porate regulation, they must be such as are authorized by legislative enactment, otherwise the by-law or regulation is ultra vires, and the restrictions are regarded as impositions in restraint of trade and are not binding either on the stockholders or on those purchasing from them, even though the by-law or regulation is endorsed on the cer - tificate of stock. A general statutory power to regulate transfers of stock merely includes authority to make reasonable regulations, or to prescribe the formalities to be observed in making transfers; and under such power the corporation may enact such by-laws regulating or restraining the transfer of shares as are not unreasonable and are necessary and proper for the protection of the corporation. Such statutory power, however, does not include authority to control the transferability of stock by prescribing to whom the owner may sell, and to whom not or on what terms; and a by-law or other regulation which undertakes to prohibit a stockholder from freely transferring his shares, or which prescribes regulations which amount to an unreasonable restriction upon the right of transfer, is void as being in restraint of trade and against common right. 2. OPTION TO COMPANY OR TO STOCKHOLDERS TO PURCHASE It is generally held that a restriction is valid where it is prop - erly imposed, which requires that, before stock is offered to out - siders, an opportunity to purchase the stock on certain terms shall be given for a stated period to the corporation or board of directors, or to the corporation or other stockholders. But on the other hand it has been held that such a restriction is an invalid restraint on alienation and that a by-law containing such a restriction is invalid where it is not authorized by statute. It has been held, however, that if the by-law is invalid as a by-law it may be binding as an agree - ment on the stockholders who unanimously adopt it, and that such a by-law may be void, a stockholder may enter into a contract with the corporation whereby he will be bound by conditions re - quiring him to offer his shares to the corporation before he shall have the right to sell them to another, and the fact that the con - ditions are contained in an invalid by-law will not render his agreement void." </seg>
            <seg id="p251">251 In Fletcher Cyclopedia on Corporations, Volume I, page 1075), Section 513 the author says: "Shares of stock are very generally regarded as personal prop - erty and transferable as such vithout interference by the corpor - ation (66). The legislature may of course place such restrictions on their transfer as it chooses (67) or may authorize the corpora - tion to act in the matter (68). A delegation of power of this char - acter to the corporation, however, will not ordinarily be implied, but must be made in express terms (69). Thus a corporation has no implied power to prohibit transfers or either directly or indirectly make their validity dependent on the approval and consent of It* officers, directors or other stockholders, and by-laws attempting .-o to do are void not only as violative of the rights of the stockholders but also as contrary to public policy as an unreasonable restraint on the alienation of property, (70) and it has been held that the fact that a stockholder consents to such a by-law does not render it binding on him, since, it being contrary to public policy, the con - sent of all of the stockholders cannot give it validity. (71) More - over, the express provision necessary to the existence in the cor - poration of the power to adopt by-laws restricting the transfer of its stock must be specific in character. That it might possibly be construed as giving such power will not be sufficient. Thus, a corporation will not be permitted to restrict the alienation of its .-tock, by a by-law, merely because it has the power under the statute or its charter to "regulate" the transfer thereof, the legisla - ture being regarded as having intended no more than that the corporation might prescribe the formalities which as to it, itself, are to be observed in the making of transfers. (72) As to whether a corporation may adopt a by-law providing that before a stockholder shall sell his stock to a third person, he shall offer it to the corporation and other stockholders and give them an opportunity to purchase it, the courts would seem to differ, it having been declared, on the one hand, that such a by-law is invalid, (73), and on the other, that it is not against public policy, at least as between the transferee of the stock and the corpora - tion, (74) but is consistent with common sense and practical busi - ness. (75)." In the case of Miller r. Farmers Milling &lt;£ Elevator Com pa hi). Vol. 78, Nebraska Reports, pap 442, our Su - preme court held : "The question presented by the appeal is whether a corpora - tion organized under the laws of this state can, by its by-laws, limit </seg>
            <seg id="p252">252 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. the number of shares of its stock a person may hold at one time, ami prevent a transfer of stock by a stockholder to a non-stockholder without the consent of the directors of the corporation? If it can, the decree of the district court is wrong and should be reversed, otherwise it should be affirmed. The power to make by-laws not inconsistent with the law of the land, is one of the common law in - cidents to a corporate existence (Angell and Ames, Corporations (11th ed.), sec. 325), and is expressly conferred by statute. Section 124, ch. 16, Comp. St. 1905. The transfer of stock has been uniformly re - garded as a legitimate subject of corporate legislation, to enable the company to know who are stockholders, to whom dividends are to be paid, who are entitled to vote, and, where the company has a lien on the stock for debts due to it from the stockholders, to enable it to prevent a transfer in derogation of its own rights. But such legislation will not be enforced beyond what is necessary to serve those purposes, where its enforcement would operate as an infringement on the property rights of others, or as an unreasonable restraint upon the disposition of property in the stock of the cor - poration. Farmers &amp; Merchants Bank v. Wasson, 48 la. 336. As is said in Boone, Corporations, sec. 122: 'The right of transfer is in - cidental to the ownership of shares in the stock of joint-stock com - panies and corporations, formed in pursuance of legislative author - ity; and a by-law which unreasonably interfers with the free exer - cise of its right is void, as being in restraint of trade.' See, also, 2 Thompson, Commentaries, Law of Corporations, sec. 2300; Angell and Ames, Corporations, (11th ed.), sec. 353, 354; 1 Cook, Stock and Stockholders, sees. 331, 332; 2 Cook, Corporations, sec. 621a. The correlative right to purchase rests on similar grounds. 2 Thompson, Commentaries, Law of Corporations, supra. In re Klaus, 29 K, W. 582, 67 Wis. 401, the court said: 'A by-law of a corpora - tion which prohibits the transfer of stock by a stockholder without the consent of all the stockholders is against public policy and void. No exception can be made in the application of this rule on the ground that the stockholders of the corporation are few, and were originally copartners, and the one against whom the by-law is in - voked consented to and voted for it.' In Herring v. Ruskin C. Ass'n., 52 S. W. (Tenn. Ch.) 327, the court held that a by-law pro - hibiting the transfer of stock except to the corporation, though in - dorsed on the certificate of stock, was void. In Chouteau Spring Co. v. Harris, 20 Mo. 383, the court held that the power to regulate the transfer of stock did not include the power to restrain trans - fers or to prescribe to whom they might be made, but merely to prescribe the formalities to be observed in making them, and that the company could not prevent a party from selling his stock, even to an insolvent person. In Bloede v. Bloede, 84 Md. 129, 34 Atl. </seg>

In Ireland v. Globe Milling Co., 21 R. I. 9, 41 Atl. 258, the Court held that a statute authorizing corporations to make by-laws consistent with the laws of the state did not authorize a by-law requiring stockholders, be - fore selling their stock, to first offer it to the corporation, and that the assignee of shares was not bound by a corporate by-law passed without authority of statute, even though his assignor had assented thereto. See, also, Morgan v. Struthers, 131 U. S. 246; McNulta v. Corn Belt Bank, 164 111. 427, 45 N. E. 954; Moore v. Bank of Com - merce, 52 Mo. 377. The by-laws under consideration, tested by the authorities cited, operate as an unreasonable restriction upon the transfer of stock and are void as an unlawful restraint upon the transfer of property."

It can never defeat the rights of other parties, and, in all cases, must be regarded as a reasonable requirement. This, if it were not, as it is, in accord with an express provision of the statute of the State, would demand that it be upheld by the courts. But the same things are not true of the other restriction. While it may be lawfully enforced to protect rights of the corporation, it cannot, in other cases, be exercised without limitation so as to defeat the rights of others. If the corporation has no rights to be protected by its exercise, and other parties would be deprived of their property thereby, it cannot be enforced in such cases. Its enforcement would operate as an infringement upon the property rights of others, which the law will not permit.

Making such contracts, and furnishing the services of qualified and licensed physicians thereunder, is not a violation if section 7, chapter 55, Compiled Statutes 1903, '(Sec 81(i7 Comp.

CORPORATIONS— KKJHT OF STOCKHOLDERS TO VOTE The owners of preferred stock in a corporation have a right to vote for directors or managers of a corporation. Hon. Okmrim W. 1'ooi, Secretary of Matt, Lincoln, Xebraxka. Dear sir: You sav : "A corporation organized in 1917 and the Articles of Incorpora - tion and by-laws do not permit the Preferred Stock to vote on of - ficers and directors.

            <seg id="p257">OPINIONS 257 In answer to your question, I will say that in my opinion the owners of preferred stock have a right to vote. At the time the oori&gt;oration was organized in 1917, the constitution of this state provided: "The legislature shall provide by law that in all elections for directors or managers of incorporated companies, every stockholder shall (have) the right to vote in person or proxy, for the number of shares of stock owned by him, for as many persons as there are di - rectors or managers to be elected, or to cumulate said shares and give one candidate as many votes as the number of directors multi - plied by the number of his shares of stock, shall equal, or to dis - tribute them upon the same principle among as many candidates aa he shall think fit, and such directors or managers shall not be elected in any other manner." "Where the constitution of the state provides that each share of stock shall have one vote, a statute authorizing the issue of stock with such voting powers as may be expressed in the certificate of in - corporation does not sustain the withholding of a vote by the pre - ferred stock, even though the certificate of incorporation so provides."

Hull d- Youn&lt;), Omaha Xational Hank Uhly., aha, Xeltraxka. Gentlemen In re: Western Fuel Co., your file 9342 !We have your favor of the !&gt;th instant in regard to above-entitled company wherein you state your theory the securities law, which is commonly referred to as "blue sky" law, and inasmuch as there is a difference opinion concerning the construction of this part of the tutes, between your office and this Department, wh ire to state to you our theory of the law. This theory law as herein announced by this Department was held our predecessors, Messrs. TouVelle and Jacobson, and therefore, feel obligated to follow the same until a rt shall hold otherwise. Section 8114 of the Compiled Statutes 19l&gt;2, defines securities and defines shares as "treasury shares, bonds," etc. It further defines the term " 'person' 'shall include every corporation, partnership, joint stock company, declar - ation of trust association, and every other character of association, and every individual," etc. t Subdivision (j ) of section 8115 provides that the er of securities may dispose of his own property for own account exclusively, provided he is not the maker, er or underwriter of such stock or securities. L Substituting the word "corporation" for the word rson" in section 8116, it would read: I "No corporation" » • • "shall issue, assign, transfer" * * • securities" (shares, treasury shares) "not specifically exempte 1 i the provisions of this article and within this state, until there shall have been filed with the department of trade and commerce </seg>

The reasoning advanced in support of this construc - tion of the statute is that since the law provides that an individual may under certain circumstances dispose of his own stock for his own l&gt;enefit, each of the incorpora - tors of the corjwration could, therefore, dispose of his own stock and if the stock was of no value, that the purchaser would, therefore, l&gt;e defrauded and in order to prohibit the sale of worthless stock the legislature intended that no stock should l&gt;e issued to the incorporators of any cor - poration until an order had been made to a corporation authorizing it to issue stock to its incorporatore. The case of the Nebraska State Railicay Commission r. Alfalfa Butter Co., 104 Neb. 797, 17S X. XV. 7««, cited by you was a construction of the former Act which was repealed by the 1921 session of the legislature and which legislature enacted the present law.

            <seg id="p261">OPINIONS 261 CORPORATIONS— STOCK IN OTHER It is unlawful for a corporation to hold or own stock in another cor - poration unless there is express statutory authority therefor, or circumstances are such that the transaction is a necessary or reasonable means of carrying out or accomplishing the objects for which the corporation was created. Bureau of Securities, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska Gentlemen : In reply to your inquiry concerning the right of one corporation to hold stock in another corporation, we dirti-r your attention as follows : In 14 C. J., page 105, Section 81, the author says: "A corporation need not necessarily be composed of natural per - sons or of natural persons only. If authorized by statute it may be composed either wholly of other corporations or of natural persons and corporations; ami one private corporation may, either by original subscription or by purchase, become a stockholder and member of another corporation, with all the rights and liberties attaching to such relation, either when it is expressly authorized by its charter to do so, or when such subscription of purchase is within its implied powers as a necessary or proper means of exercising the other powers conferred on it. But it cannot lawfully do so when not expressly authorized by its charter, and when such a transaction is foreign to the purposes of its creation. Nor can a corporation become one of the original incorporators of another corporation where the statute ex - pressly or impliciedly requires them to be natural persons. In Vol. 14A C. J., page 290, Section 2138, the author further says : "One corporation, may, when authorized by statute, purchase a controlling interest in the stock of another corporation and exercise such control. But in the absence of an express permission it is not within the general powers of a corporation to purchase the stock of other corporations for the purpose of controlling their management. It is obvious that a corporation cannot hold shares of another cor - poration where to do so would be the creation of unlawful monopoly or combination in restraint of trade." </seg>
            <seg id="p262">262 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. Iii Vol. II, page U0(»7, Section 1117, Fletcher's Encyclo - pedia of Corporations, the author states the rule as follows: "In the United States there are some cases to the same effect as the English rule, but they are opposed to the decided weight of author - ity both in the federal and state courts. The prevailing dostrine is that a corporation has no power either to subscribe for or purchase shares of stock in another corporation, unless such power is expressly con - ferred upon it by its charter or other statute, or unless the circum - stances are such that the transaction is a necessary or reasonable means of carrying out or accomplishing the objects for which it was created. Moreover, purchases of stock of other corporations have been held to be contrary to public policy, in addition to being beyond the power of the corporation. * * * * Where a corporation has no power to subscribe for or purchase stock in another corporation, it can - not do so indirectly through a trustee or agent. 'To hold otherwise would be to sustain a transaction illegal in its character, accomplished by indirection, when it could not be clone if the methods were direct.' " At Section 1121, the author further sa.vs: "On the other hand, a corporation may take stock in another company without express authority, provided there is no express por - hibition, whenever the ciruumstances are such as to render the trans - action a necessary or proper means of accomplishing the objects of its creation. 'Whether the purchase of stock in one corporation by another is ultra vires or not,' it was said in an Indiana case, 'must depend upon the purpose for which the purchase was made, and whether such purchase was under all the circumstances, a necessary or reason - able means of carrying out the object for which the corporation was created, or one which under the statute it might accomplish.' » * • •* Although some of the decisions already cited in this Section tend to establish a contrary' rule, it would seem to be the better rule that a corporation may purchase stock in a corporation in aid of its busi - ness where it would have the power to buy all the product of such corporation. Thus, in a recent Missouri decision, it is held that a railroad company may acquire stock in coal and elevator companies when the purpose is to facilitate its business, and that it is imma - terial that the company purchases a majority or practically all the shares of stock of such companies; and the court said: 'If the rail - road company could do that business with its own means, why could it not secure itself in the matter of obtaining coal for fuel or a con - venience in handling grain by acquiring stock in a coal or elevator company, if it would be a more convenient, and if the public was not injured thereby?' So in a later case in Missouri, it was held that a </seg>
            <seg id="p263">OPINION'S 263 railroad company may own the stock of an express company organized as a carrier of express freight, and also the stock of a refrigerator car company which owns cars devised and used for the transportation of products which requires refrigeration while in transit, on the theory that 'both companies are engaged in business which the railroad com - pany would carry on itself: and if it could do so directly it may do so indirectly by owning the stock of the companies engaged directly in the business.' Likewise it was held in a federal case that a corpora - tion created to manufacture, bleach and dye cottons had power to ex - change part of its stock for stock in a dyeing corporation formed by its consulting chemist, where the formulas of the chemist was his own discovery and secret, and were used by the manufacturing company only." At Section 1122, the author savs: "The general rule that a corporation cannot subscribe for or pur - chase stock in another corporation is based upon the ground that such a transaction is generally foreign to the objects of its creation, and not upon any notion that the nature of a corporation renders it inca - pable of taking and holding stock in other corporations. A corpora - tion therefore, may take and hold stock in another corporation when - ever it is expressly authorized to do so." In the case of .V&lt; braska Shirt 0MifMMf rs. Iforton, :5 Neb. ( Cnof. ) S8.S, in the opinion of Mr. Commissioner l'oiind it is said : "Corporations have quite enough power without allowing them to incorporate themselves in new companies. Unless authorized by statute a corporation has no power to subscribe to the capital stock of another corporation, and such a subscription is not binding." Ill I hat case the Nebraska Shirt Company had sub - scribed to some of the capital stock of the Trans-Mississippi Exposition Company, which was a business not within the objects for which the Nebraska Shirt Company was incor - porated : In the latter case of State, ex nl, Tyrrell rx. Lincoln Traction Company, !M) Neb. S&amp;t, our court quoted with ap - proval the above portion of the former opinion. In the recent case of Tirnmlcy, Son* &amp; Company vs. Chicago Great Wentern Railroad Company, 111 Neb. 311, l!»ti N. W. 319 (320), it was held: </seg>
            <seg id="p264">264 "While defendant admits that it has held a membership in the Omaha Grain Exchange since its organization, and that members who are engaged in the grain business on such exchange are required to take notice of the rules thereof, it contends that, because it is not dealing in grain, either buying or selling, and because the holding of such a membership is in violation of the articles of incorporation of defendant, it is not required, as a matter of law, to take notice of the rules of the exchange. Defendant asserts that the holding of a membership in the Omaha Grain Exchange is ultra vires; that the holding of such membership confers no rights upon the defendant and entails no obligations. We are unwilling to concede the soundness of this contention. While the railroad company may not be authorized by its articles of incorporation to engage in the buying and selling of grain, it does not follow that it may not hold a membership in an exchange for the purpose of facilitating and aiding it in carrying on the business of a carrier. Carriers may, and do, own grain elevators for the purpose of storage and to enable them to obtain and handle grain for transportation. We think they are authorized to do any - thing that is lawful and necessarily incident to carrying on the busi - ness of a carrier. By holding a membership in the exchange, a car - rier is enabled to ascertain when grain is to be transported to other markets, to come in contact with shippers, and to solicit the con - signments of grain over its line of railway. We are of the opinion that the holding of such membership, under the circumstances, was not prohibited by its articles of incorporation and was not unlawful; that it was proper and legitimate and in furtherance of its lawful In the case of Hill, et al vs. Nisbct, et nl, 100 Ind. 341 (S4t), the court said: t'The proposition is stated broadly in many cases, that one cor - ation cannot, without express statutory authority become the owner any portion of the stock of another corporation. • • * • » !"It is said that if this were not so, a banking corporation could ome the operator of a railroad or a railroad corporation might en - re in banking business.

COSTS— COLLECTION OF— CRIMINAL CASE. Mr. John 1 hi vey.

You state that a bond was furnished but that thereafter his bondsmen surrendered </seg>
            <seg id="p271">OPINIONS 271 ihe defendant to the sheriff and that the chattel mort - gage given by the defendant to his liondsnien for their security is therefore now invalid. You further state ihat writ of error has Ikhmi obtained from the Supreme Court staying execution of the judgment, and you in - quire whether or not execution may be issued for the collection of these costs. The first question that arises is whether or not the bond, being we suppose in the usual form and an obliga - tion to pay the coats, has l&gt;een entirely released as to the liability for payment of the costs by the bondsmen u|&gt;on their surrender of the defendant to the sheriff. It would seem to us that the state refrained from issuing execution localise of the giving of the bond and that therefore the bondsmen may not be able to escajte liability ujton this part of the ltond merely by surrender of the defendant as this does not dispose of the liability for costs. Section 101N4. Compiled Statutes. 1922. provides that no writ of error shall be allowed except on payment of the costs, except in eases where poverty affidavit is filed. Section 1020.]. Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides that a fine and costs or the costs alone can l&gt;e replevied by the giving of a recognizance by the defendant. L'i&gt;on first reading these last two sections one would have the impression that failure to replevy the costs would permit the immediate issuance of an execution. Just what constitutes a writ of error is not clearly defined by our statutes, and we presume it would Ik* a matter which under our statutes is imjnwsible of definition. The dif - ferent sections of our statutes pertaining to this proposi - tion are so confusing that it is almost impossible to give an intelligent answer to your inquiry. We are of the opinion, however, that inasmuch as there was a bond given in this case there is some question as to whether or not the liability thereon has ceased, but in this particular case it is likely that the right to </seg>
            <seg id="p272">272 issue execution has been suspended on account of the review of the case in the supreme court. Very truly yours, O. 8. SPILLMAX, Attorney General.

Costs in misdemeanor cases which cannot be collected from the defendant are payable out of the county general fund providing the prosecutions have been instituted with the consent of the county attorney or approved by him in writing after they have been instituted. Charle* R. Wnrren &lt;£ Co., Xat. Bank of Commerce Bldg., Lincoln, Xcbraxka.

In both cases the board have refused payment although the actions were either brought by the County Attorney, or approved by him." LYou ask for an opinion from this department uj&gt;on questions involved under the above statement of facts. tThe payment of costs in misdemeanor cases is provided by Section 10274, Compiled Statutes, which reads as ws: </seg>

At the first meeting of the county board in each county, in the months of April and October of each year, said board shall appropriate from the general fund a sum sufficient to pay all such bills, or parts thereof, as may be found to be lawful and jusl, and thereupon said board shall audit all such bills in the manner required by law: PROVIDED, no costs shall be allowed in any case unless said suit shall have been instituted with the consent of the county attorney, or, after being brought, he shall approve of such action in writing." The payment by the county of the witnesses for the defense in felony cases is governed by the provisions of Section 1012(1, Compiled Statutes, which reads as follows: "Any person accused of crime amounting to felony shall have compulsory process to enforce the attendance of witnesses in hts behalf and they shall be paid for their mileage and per diem the same fees as are now, or may hereafter be allowed by law, to wit - nesses for the state in the prosecution of such accused person, and in case such accused person is convicted and is unable to pay such mileage and per diem to his witnesses, they shall be paid out of the county treasury of the county wherein such crime was committed; and in case such accused person is acquitted upon his trial, the fees of his witnesses shall be likewise paid out of such county treasury: PROVIDED, however, in no case shall the fees of any such witnesses be so paid, unless before the trial of such accusations such accused person shall make and file his affidavit stating the names of his witnesses, and that he has made a statement to his counsel of the facts he expects to prove by such witnesses, and has been advised by such counsel that their testimony is material on the trial of such accusation, and shall also file an affidavit of such counsel that he deems the testimony of such witnesses necessary and material on behalf of such accused perr-on, whereupon the court or judge shall make an order directing that such witnesses, not exceeding fifteen in number, be paid out of the county treasury of the county in which accusations shall be made."

Liability of County Board: A permanently employed Assistant County Attorney is not provided for by statute in all counties. Mr. C. A. Bcmin, Scirard, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Answering your inquiry of April 20 wherein you state that the county board of your county, against the protest of youm'lf and another member of the board, passed a resolution allowing f(i5.00 ]&gt;er month for clerk hire for your county attorney: The sections of our law psrtaWag to this situation iire as follows: Section 2372, Compiled Statutes, 1922, sets forth the salary which is allowed the county attorneys in the several counties of the state, and in addition to the salary, a county attorney in some instances is allowed the reason - able, necessary traveling and hotel expenses, but no pro - vision is made for clerk hire. Section 4915, Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides that the county attorney shall without fee or reward Jpm opinions and advice to the Itoard of county commissioners and other civil officers of the county. And also provides that in all counties of this state the county board maj employ such additional counsel in civil matters as they may deem necessary when requested so to do by a ]ietition of ten freeholders of the county not members of the lioard. In such event such counsel shall receive such reasonable compensation as the board and counsel may agree u]M&gt;n. This section, however, does not seem to contemplate the regular employment of an assistant at ;i stated salary. Section 191(i. Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides that the county attorney may appoint deputies who shall act without any compensation from the county, except in cases of felony their assistance may be procured under the </seg>
            <seg id="p275">275 OPINION* direction of the district court, and such special prosecutors are paid by the county board, and provides also that in counties of greater population than Reward county, certain deputies may be api&gt;ointed. Section 4917, Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides that in the absence, sickness or disability of the county attorney, the court before whom it is his duty to appear, may appoint an attorney to act as county attorney, but who shall receive no compensation except as provided for under the provisions of Section 4916. If there are any other sections which pertain to the county attorney's office in counties of your population we are not aware of them. The j&gt;ersonal liability of members of the county l&gt;oard seems to Ih&gt; fixed by Section N&lt;»4, Compiled Statutes, 1922, which provides that if the county board shall draw ■ warrant where more than 8."&gt;% of the funds have been paid out of the fund against which the warrant Is drawn, the warrant shall l&gt;e a charge against the mem - bers of the hoard and not against the county. This same section says recovery may be had against any member of the board. But even in the face of this wording of the section it hardly seems probable to us that a court would hold a meml&gt;cr of the ltoard liable who protested and voted against such an appropriation or pa\ mi'iii. We would not l&gt;e able to advise you as to the liability, as this would be a question which would )»e up to the court, ruder our laws it would therefore seem that if any assistants could l»e apftointed it would 1m&gt; only under the provisions of Section 4915, which does not however seem to contemplate the employment of a regular assistant such as is referred to in the resolu - tion passed by your county IkmuiI.

A vacancy occurring in the office of County Attorney more than thirty days prior to a general election should be filled at that election. Mr. P. E. Romig, County Attorney, Alliance, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to the question proi&gt;ounded in your letter of the 2nd inst., permit me to say that, although in the absence of a court decision the matter is not entirely free from doubt, yet I have rather reluctantly come to the conclusion that the office of County Attorney for the unexpired term of Mr. Basye should be filled in your county at the next general election. In making this statement I am not unmindful of the ■MM State r. Rank-in, 33 Neb. 2Gfi and State v. County Conunwxioiierx, GO Neb. 274, in which it was held that the County Attorney ajtjtointed to fill a vacancy held for the full unexpired term of his predecessor. The law providing for the election of a county attorney and also for the filling of a vacancy in that office was a special law separate and distinct from the general election law. Now the saline section of statute which provides for the election of a county attorney and fixes the length of hiss term, also provides for the election of the various other county officers and fixes the term of each. In like manner there is now no special statutory provision for the filling of vacancies in the office of county attorney. Hence I am of the opinion that the general provisions of Statute as found in Sections 2245 and 2247 relative to the filling of vacancies in county offices and the length of term of apiK&gt;intees to such offices govern in the case of a county attorney just as they do in the case of other county officers and where a vacancy occurred and had been filled by appointment, the Supreme Court of this state held : </seg>

You ask whether or not, on account of the fact that the assessor was not eligible under the law. the party receiving the next highest vote would be entitled to the office. Our answer is "no." You next inquire whether or not the county com - missioners would have the authority to apj&gt;oint an assessor, or whether some preliminary work would have to be done.

This, however, would probably not affect his case, as the ]K&gt;int involved would be whether or not the present incumbent of the office had in fact been elected, involving the question of his ineligibility alone, and whether or not this would constitute a vacancy. It seems to us that the best way to get at it would be for the present incumbent to resign, or if he wants to do so that the county attorney may issue quo warranto proceedings to oust him from his office.

In view of the statute above cited, we are of the opinion that it is the duty of the county Ixiard to select a patrolman to Maintain the public roads within the county, and a majoritv of the county board would have the right to select such patrolman.

Section Sfi4, Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides: "Any warrants drawn after 85^ of the amount levied for the year is exhausted, and where there are no funds in the treasury for the payment of the same, shall not be chargeable as against the county but may be collected by civil action from the county board making the same, or any member thereof." In the case of Austin Man u fart urinff Co. r. Tiroirn County, Cm Xeb. 00, it was held that it was not unlawful for a county lK&gt;ard. after estimate made and prior to its meeting as u l&gt;oard of equalization, to anticipate the levy for the current year, and contract an indebtedness upon n particular fund within the estimate, although there is al the time no money in the treasury to the credit of such fund for the payment of the indebtedness, if in contract - ing such indebtedness the lniard remains within the limits prescribed by the constitution and the statutes. </seg>
            <seg id="p287">OPINIONS 287 Tn view of the above mentioned authorities we are of Ihe opinion that the county hoanl doe* not have authority to draw any warrant upon any fun.l after the M% statii - lory limit has been pai.l out, unless there is money Ixlon^iiifr to that fund in the treasury of the county We are further of the opinion that it is unlawful and illegal for a county board to direct the county clerk to draw warrants upon any fund until after a levy has been made by the board of equalization in the manner provided by law and the W% of such levy has not been drawn upon by the county, and that if a county board draws a warrant upon a fund prior to the levy made by the board of equalization in the manner provided by law and there is no money in the treasury for the payment of the warrant, such warrant is void. We are of the opinion that the county board has author - ity to contract an indebtedness, after estimate has l&gt;een made and prior to the meeting of the board of equitation to anticipate the levy for the current year, but that no payment should be made upon such indebtedness con - iractcd for until after the board of equalization has mad.' the levy in the manner provided by law.

Jfaxtini/x, Xibrattka. Dear Sir The rule in the case of l-'onl v. lioi/d Count n. No. 33109, in the Supreme Court, indicates that the Clerk of the county court was allowed £7211.00 per year by the counly hoard, whereas the limit for a county the size of Royd was $1,000.00 per annum. The opinion does not expressly state that a clerk of the county court shall not have the maximum amount fixed by the statute. l»u' on the other hand it does not say that the hoard must allow the maximum amount. Inasmuch as the statute seems to permit the hoard to determine what salary shall Ik- paid to the assistant in the county judge's office, «•■ would he incline] to think that tile courts would hold that the hoard shall fix the salary, otherwise there would he no statutory provisions absolutely fixing the salary of the clerk of the court. I There is. however, in the case of Ford r. lioi/tl Count)/. ie grounds for your conclusion that your clerk should eive $1,250.00, as the court in that opinion states thai proviso in regard to the clerk of the court const i - es an exception to the statute.

Vacancy is filled as stated. Secretory, Chumber of Coin turret Jirwitliniter, Xebraska. Dear Sir: You state that one of the commissioners of your county may remove from the district in which he lives to The county seat, or il is ]K&gt;sible that he may remove from (he county. You ask whether or not lie would l»e dis - qualified from holding office if he moves to the county seat. If he should remove permanently from the county we U'lieve this would make a vacancy in the office, subject to l&gt;e filled by appointment in the next general election as provided by law. If he merely removes to the county seat we believe that there would still be a vacancy in his office. This is undoubtedly true if the county is under township organization. Section itlS, Compiled Statutes of Xebraska, 1922, recites that the commissioners are elected in and for the districts of the county. If the county is not under township organization. Section NT!).

This section further states "that of the two persons elected in such districts,'' thus indicating that the commissioners' duties are in connection with their districts as well as the county at large. It is true that the section provides that the commissioners shall be elected by the voters of the county at large, but the section indicates that they are elected for their respective districts. In our opinion therefore, a vacancy would result by removal from the commissioners' district. This conclusion is supported by the case of State v. Shining, 19 Neb. 497. Your second inquiry relates to the method of filling vacancies. If the county is under township organization it would seem that the vacancy would be filled under the provisions of Section 893, Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska, 1922, and the decision in 62 Neb. 461, which t' Where a vacancy occurs in a board of supervisors in a county r township organization, the remaining members of the board itute the proper authority to fill such vacancy." If the county is not under township organization, we believe the vacancy would be filled by the provisions of Section 2244, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, which provides that a vacancy in a membership should be filled by the county clerk, county attorney and county treasurer.

"The Keck bill was approved April 21st Another bill dealing with primary elections was approved April 26th in which reference is made to the election of the delegates to the county conventions and it seems to be assumed that Section 2165 had not been repealed.

Answering your first inquiry, it is my opinion that House Roll 482," Chapter 78, pages 216-217, of the Laws of 1923, known as the Keck bill, does rej&gt;eal Section 2165 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922.

We will answer them in the order tl. "Under the new law for county aid for fairs, is the amount rmined on the total valuation of the county, or on one-fifth valua - viz: % mill total valuation, or otherwise?" t Section 6, Compiled Statutes, 1922, was re-enacted 1921, at page &lt;&gt;&lt;&gt; of the 1921 Session Laws. This act (viilcs that the county board shall at the time other essinents and levies are made levy a tax not to exceed '-fourth mill or so much thereof each year as is neees - ■y to raise the maximum amount provided for in this on each dollar of the assessed valuation. The limita - ii of the amount de|)ends of course upon the population the county.

"Our fair has been in continuous operation for two years, and during this time has received aid from the county amounting to $200 per annum. Does this constitute recognition as a county fair, there being no other fair in the county?" Your statement indicates that your county fair associa - tion has been recognized as a county fair of your county. If your association complied with the law it is undoubtedly entitled to the legal status as a county agricultural society. 3. "We have the required number of members, and approximately $100 in the treasury. Is this sufficient on the point of membership?" The requirements for a legal agricultural society are set forth in the Compiled Statures of Nebraska, beginning with Section (i. This section provides that whenever twenty or more persons, resident of the county, shall have organ - ized for the improvement of agriculture in the county and shall have adopted a constitution and by-laws, and the society shall raise and pay into the treasury by voluntary subscription or by fee not less than |50 each year, and whenever the president shall certify to the county clerk the amount thus paid, it then becomes the duty of the county board to make the assessment of the one-fourth mill lew. 4. "We have approximately twenty acres of ground under fifteen years lease. Is this sufficient to force recognition from the county, or will it be necessary to acquire title to the grounds?" Your fourth question is answered by Section 10, Compiled Statutes, 1922, which requires the county agricul - tural society to procure the title in fee simple free from In - cumbrance of land for fair grounds not less than ten acres in extent before the county board may appropriate money for use in fixing up the fair grounds.

In answer to your second question I will say that I know of no provision of statute which requires a county judge to keej) trust funds and securities in his official capacity instead of in his name individually. I am of the opinion, however, that in all cases he should keep trust funds separate and apart from his own funds in a bank or in any other institution in which he places them. I do not mean of course that his own securities and trust funds may not be kept in the same box, but I do mean they should be so kept that it will 1k» easy in an emergency to determine which are his funds and which are funds lie is merely handling as trustee.

Dear Sir: In your letter of the 4th instant you inquire: "Have the commissioners a right to appoint a county judge that has two years yet to serve?" Section 224."). Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides that "Vacancies occurring in the office of county judge or justice of the peace shall be filled by election, but when the unexpired term does not exceed one year, the vacancy shall be filled by appointment." In construing the above quoted provision of the stat ute, the Supreme Court, in the case of State v.

Whether it may be filled by appointment provisionally until the time for a general election, quaere." In that case, Irvine, C. who wrote the opinion, said, ''there is so far as we can find, no provision for a special election in such case." At that time elections were held annually, now general elections are held, as you know, bi - ennially.

Ernest 8. Schiefelbein, Esq., County, Attorney, Waboo, XeLniska. Dear Sir: You ask for an opinion from this office: "In relation to increasing salaries of county officials, where the population warrants the same." In answer to your question, we call your attention to Section 19 of Article III of the Constitution, which reads as follows: "The legislature shall never grant any extra compensation to any public officer, agent, or servant after the services have been rendered nor to any contractor after the contract has been entered into, nor shall the compensation of any public officer, including any officer whose compensation is fixed by the legislature subsequent to the adoption hereof be increased or diminished during his term of office."

This does seem, to be an inadequate salary, but the matter is within the dis - cretion of your county board. Sec! ion -2:\K2. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, states that in counties of not MR than 10,000 ]&gt;opulation the sheriff may l&gt;e allowed a salary not to exceed $1,200 per annum, in the discretion of the county board.

            <seg id="p312">312 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Section 2381, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, sets forth the fees to be allowed the county sheriffs. The same section requires a report to the county board of all fees collected, except mileage. The case of State v. Miller, 98 Neb. 179, holds that the sheriff is required to report all fees which are not excepted from his report by statute and to pay the same to the county treasurer. The sheriffs are paid a regular salary as we have stated, instead of being paid by a fee system as once was the case. We, therefore, have held that the sheriff is required to report commissions received from property sold at sheriff's sale, and that the only compensation he is entitled to retain in addition to the fixed salary is the mileage fees earned by him and which are excepted from his report by the provisions of Section 2381.

In the event the statute provides a special fee, such special statute would control over the general statute. The fee allowed a sheriff for collection of taxes under dis - tress warrant, is fixed at five cents per mile.

It is our opinion that if it is necessary, the county board may purchase an automobile for their use and the use of the county engineer for the exclusive use of the county's business. The county board is vested with discretion in Its management of the county's affairs and in the absence of abuse of such discretion, the discretion exercised by auch board cannot be interfered with.

Dear Sir: Section MM; Compiled Statutes, 1922, fixes the com - pensation of county treasurers in counties of 6,500 popula - tion or less at fl.SOO per annum. Sub-division "b"' of this section provides that the county treasurer shall, out of commissions collected, retain an amount necessary to pay the condensation provided. The same section provides that the treasurer may not draw more than one-twelfth of this amount any one month. In our opinion, the intention of the legislature was that the treasurer may collect from the fees the entire amount of his annual salary during the year if the commissions total that amount, but that he may not draw more than the monthly portion of the salary in any one month. However, we believe that if he has not collected the previous month's salary in full, if the money is in the treasury collected from commissions, he may in a subsequent month make up this deficiency so long as he does not collect anything in advance. &lt;&gt;.

It follows that under the plain reading of the statute the county treasurer is entitled to a commission on motor vehicle registration fees collected by him even though it lie admitted that the words, "on all moneys collected by him," refer solely to such taxes as he has collected from the taxpayers, for the statute designates such regis - tration fees as an occupation tax and the fact that it is turned into the highway fund shows it to be a tax. </seg>

COURTS — JURISDICTION TO VACATE OR ALTER DECREE.

Dear Sir: In regard to the inquiry submitted by you concerning the authority of a county judge who has committed a girl over the age of sixteen years to the State Industrial School for Girls at Geneva, to afterwards make a further order releasing such jiermm from such institution, we direct your attention to Volume 15 C. J., page MS* section 139, wherein the author in discussing the jurisdiction of a NOt, Kays: "A court, having obtained jurisdiction, retains it until final disposition of the cause; but after final judgment has been rendered ami the parties dismissed, and the term of court has closed, the juris - diction of the court is exhausted." • • • In the recent case of Cohen r.

In its legal sense it includes everything done contrary to justice, honesty, modesty or good morals. Black's Law- Diet. Bouvier's Law Diet. The word 'moral" which so often precedes the word 'turpitude' does not seem to add anything to the meaning of the term, other than that emphasis which often results from a tautological expression." It is therefore the opinion of the Attorney General that the Department of -Public Welfare may revoke a license issued to a physician where such physician has lK»en convicted of any crime which "includes everything done contrary to justice, honesty, modesty or good morals" on the ground that such conviction of crime is one involv - ing "moral turpitude."

The clerk of the district court may refuse to file any pleadings by any party to a suit without first obtaining a statutory fee in payment for filing such pleading. Mrs. Ethel (Joaianl Bixtton. Clerk of the District Court, Columbus, Nebraska. Dear Madam : We have your fa\or of the 16th instant inquiring if a clerk of the district court is required by law to account to the county for all fees earned by the office or whether such clerk is required to account only for the fees collected, and further inquiring if, when an amended pleading is filed and indorsed as an original, you should charge the fee required for filing original papers or the fee allowed for filing amended pleadings. In reply we direct your attention to the decision of our supreme court in the case of State v. Several Parcels of Land, etc., 82 Neb. 51, wherein Barnes, C J., said: "In addition to the salary or compensation provided by Section 9434, the clerk of the district court of that county is by Section 9435 allowed an additional salary of $1,000 to be paid out of the general fund of the county, which is to be entered on his fee book and accounted for in the same manner and subject to the same limitation as other fees. Section 9434, supra, provides for and describes the fees, together with the amounts thereof which may be charged by the clerk of the district court. Construing the provisions of that section, it was said in Boettcher v. Lancaster County, 74 Neb. 148, that the clerk of the district court must account for the fees earned in performing the duties of his office, and pay the same over to the county treasurer, whether collected by him or not, and that ordi - narily the clerk extends credit at his peril. The same rule was announced in State v. Haxlett, 41 Neb. 257, and in Sheibley v. Dixon County, 61 Neb. 409. Construing all of the provisions of the statutes on this subject together, and considering them in the light of the foregoing decisions, we are con.-trained to hold that it is the duty of the clerk of the district court, where the statute provides a fee for any service required of him, to collect the same in advance. This duty he owes to the county, which has an interest therein, and to himself as a protection against enforced payment to the county treas- </seg>
            <seg id="p342">REPORT OF Tit ATTORNEY GENERAL 342 urer of fees earned by him, but not collected; for it is well settlec that ordinarily he is responsible for such payment. It has been suggested by appellees that the measure of the clerk's responsibility is only due diligence; that he is not an insurer of the collection of his fees; and that, in case he fails to make such collection, he is not accountable to the .county therefor. We are not required to deter - mine this question in any of these cases, and we therefore decline to do so. It is possible, as suggested in Boettcher v. Lancaster County, supra, that special circumstances may excuse the clerk for a failure to collect his fees, but no such circumstances are shown, and, in fact, no excuse is presented in any of these cases for a failure of the party requesting the services to pay, and the appellant to collect the fees in question. * • • "It is urged by counsel for appellees that permitting the clerk to refuse to perform the services required by him by law, unless his fees therefore are paid in advance, will result in much delay and confusion, will deprive the court of the power to conduct its business in an orderly and dignified manner, and will result in some cases in a denial of justice. We think the^e objections are without substantial merit. It is clearly within the power of the court to require the plaintiff in a civil action before commencing his suit to make a deposit of a reasonable and substantial sum of money with the clerk, suffi - cient, at least, to insure the payment of the fees for which he may be primarily liable. It is also true that the clerk, in the absence of such rule, may require a party for whom he may be requested to perform services to pay the fees therefor ir advance or secure their payment. It is a well known rule of our federal courts to require the plaintiff at the commencement of his action to make a substantial ueposit to secure the payment of his costs, and upon the appearance of a defendant he is al.-o required to advance a sum sufficient to cover the costs which it is estimated will be incurred by him during che progress of the litigation; and this rule is strictly enforced. No complaint appears to have ever been made of the rule, and it has never been suggested that its enforcement has in any way delayed, hindered or impeded the administration of justice. It would seem to be the duty of our district courts to protect their officers, and assist them in collecting or securing the collection of their fees; and it may not be out of place for us to suggest that it would be for the l&gt;est interests of all concerned for those courts to adopt a rule requir - ing the plaintiff in all civil cases, at the commencement of his action, to deposit with the clerk a sufficient sum of money to secure the payment of his costs therein. In answer to the contention that such a course might, in certain eases, amount to a denial of justice, it may be suggested that in case a litigant should be unable to pay or secure the payment of his costs in advance, or make such a deposit </seg>
            <seg id="p343">OPINIONS 343 on account of poverty, or other reasonable rauso, he should be neld to he within an exception to ?uch rule. In anv event, however, it Is our opinion that the distrcr court is not authorized to compel '.he clerk to perform services tor which he is entitled to crar^e ami collect liis fee.-- in advance, i ikI for which he nias-t account to the county, without tuch fees are thus paid or thei/ pajment is secured." Again in the caw of Douyln* County r. \inxoithaler, 82 Neb. 810, it was hold that it must appear that the officer wilfully omitted to charge or collect the fee pro - vided by statute in order to hold such official liable upon his official bond. We are therefore of the opinion that you should report to the county such fees ;is earned and such fees as collected by you, but that you are only liable tftm the fees collected by you if you have been diligent in endeavoring to collect all fees earned by the office. We are further of the opinion, in view of the above quoted authorities, that it is your duty to require a l^uty bringing a suit to make a dej&gt;osit of a reasonable sum with you before filing any pleadings: and that you are justified in refusing to file any pleadings by any jwirty to a suit without first obtaining the payment of the statutory fee for the filing of such pleading. In reply to the second part of your inquiry we direct your attention to Section 2."M»9, Compiled Statutes. 1922, which provides in part : "Filing amended or substituted pleading, .'emurrer, motion, affi - davit, tra'iscript for appeal or other paper not otherwise provided for * * * each, fifty cents." We are of the opinion that you are only entitled to charge for each amended pleading the statutory fee of fifty cents, but we would sugg«st that you require any one ottering to file an&gt;' amended pleading that such plead - ing should be indorsed as an amended pleading in order that no controversy may arise in regard to the fees earned </seg>

By LEE BASYE, Ansistant Attorney General. October 17, 1923 DIVORCE— INSANITY. Idiocy or insanity must exist at the time of marriage in order to render it a ground for annulment of marriage. Mr*. Edith Wiiidh, tiali in, yebraaka. Dear Madam : In answer to your letter of inquiry, I will say that there is no law in this state, which makes insanity a ground for divorce. There is a statutory provision : "A bill to annul a marriage on the ground of insanity or idiocy may be exhibited by any person admitted by the court to prosecute as the next friend to such idiot or lunatic." Section 1546, C. S. of Neb., 1922. As you will observe the above stated provision gives permission for some friend of the idiot or insane person to bring an action to have the marriage declared annulled, but makes no provision for the same party to make application to have the marriage with the insane person annulled. The supreme court of this state has held that: "The courts of this state are not authorized to decree a marriage contract void on the ground of insanity or idiocy of one of the parties except for such want of understanding in such party as to render him or her incapable of assenting thereto." Adams v. State, 93 Neb. 587-8. </seg>

A candidate of one party may be the candidate of another party where he received the largest number of votes if a certificate of nomination has been issued to him and no objections were filed within three days to the issuance of such certificate of nomination. Mr. William C. Mounts, Clerk of the District Court, Alliance, Nebraska. My Dear Mr. Mountz We have your favor of the 29th ultimo in which you state that you was the candidate for the office of Clerk of the District Court of Box Butte County on the repub - lican party bit Hot at the primary election. You further state that you received a number of votes upon the ballot of the democratic jwrty at such primary, and the county clerk issued to you certificates of nomination for the republican party and the democratic party, and you state that you filed your acceptance of such nomination as the candidate for the republican party and also as such candi - date for the democratic party. You state that no objec - tion was filed with the county clerk within three days objecting to you being granted a certificate of nomination as candidate for the democratic party, and you inquire if the county central committee of the democratic party now has the right to name some other person as candidate of the democratic party for such office. Your county attorney, Mr. Romig, submitted to this department an inquiry evidently pertaining to the same matter but did not state in his inquiry that you had accepted the nomination. Assistant Attorney General Ayres cited to Mr. Bomig the case of State v. Wells, 92 Neb. 337, wherein it was held that where a candidate of the republican party received a large number of votes on the democratic primary ballot where no candidate had filed for such office as a democratic candidate and where such republican candidate did not file an acceptance of the nomination, the county central committee of such party had authority to fill such vacancy. </seg>
            <seg id="p350">350 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Your case is somewhat different in that you filed your acceptance of such nomination and we believe the division in the case of State r. Wells would not be fully applicable to your case. Section 2094, Com] tiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides : "The provisions of the statutes now in force in relation to the holding of elections, the solicitation of voters at the polls, the challenging of voters, the manner of conducting elections, of counting the ballots ami making returns thereof, and all other kindred sub - jects, except contests, shall apply to all primaries in so far as they are consistent with this article; the intent of this article being to place ihe primary elections under the regulation and protection of the laws now in force as to elections." Section 2130, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides in part : "The method of voting at primary elections shall be by ballot, and all ballots voted shall be printed as herein provided. * * * The official primary ballot shall be printed substantially as is required by law for official ballots used at November elections, except that names of candidates where there are more than one candidate for the same office shall be rotated." * * • Section 1945, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides that in the preparation of official ballots in general elections: "In each division, and beneath all candidates placed there by nomination or petition, a blank space shall be provided, into whicn electors may write the names of any person for whom they wish to vote and whose name is not printed upon the ballot." Section 2152, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides : "The person receiving the greatest number of votes at a primary election as the candidate of a party for an office shall be the candidate of that party for such office, and his name as such candidate shall be placed on the official ballot at the following election." Section 2154, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, in part provides: </seg>
            <seg id="p351">OPINIONS 351 "The county clerk, or other officer charged with the duty of can - vassing the result of such primary, shall, within three day.s after such result is ascertained, mail by registered letter notice of said nomina - tion to each candidate nominated by any party at such primary, and such candidate shall, within ten days thereafter, file his acceptance or such nomination so received with the proper officer, or his name shall be omitted from ilie official ballot as to the candidate of such party." » • * Section 2119, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, in part provides : "All certificates of nomination or nomination statements, which are in apparent conformity with the provisions of this article, shall be deemed to be valid, unless objections thereto shall be duly made In writing within three Jays after the filing of the same." * * • In the case of State v. Waite, 92 Neb. :J14, our supreme court held that where it apjtears that acts or events have occurred rendering an office vacant, the authority having the i tower to fill such vacancy may treat the office as vacant and proceed to elect or apftoint, according to the form of law, another to fill it. In that case the court held that the office of presi - dential elector for one party was incompatible with the office of presidential elector for another party, and we are of the opinion that this rule of law would not be applicable in your case. In the later ca.se of State ex rel Maupin r. Ama - berry, 104 Neb. 550, where a mandamus action was brought to comjtel the Secretary of State to omit the name of John H. Morehead as candidate for governor, our supreme court held : "No objection was made to the filling within the prescribed three day period, and we are of the opinion that the action of the Secretary of State therefore became final. The law favors the diligent, especially in such matters as concern political rights. Needless confusion and uncertainty would probably result if the legality of nominations was permitted to be questioned when the time for the necessary steps in the preparation of the ballot and its distribution to the polls would be inadequate. The provision limiting the time for objections is reasonable and a proper exercise of legislative power." </seg>
            <seg id="p352">352 REIt&gt;RT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL the question may not be free from doubt, it is our opinion, however, that inasmuch as you received the largest number of votes on the democratic ballot for candidate as Clerk of the District Court, and the county clerk issued to you a certificate of nomination and yon, in due time, filed your acceptance of such nomination, and no objections were filed with the county clerk within the period of three days as provided by law, that you are the candidate of the democratic party for the office of Clerk of the District Court, and there being no vacancy in such office the county central committee would not have authority to certify to the county clerk the name of some other person as the democratic candi - date for such office. ELECTION— COUNTING BALLOTS. The counting: of ballots should continue until finished without adjourn - ment. However it is a mere irregularity unless fraud is shown. Ruxhvillc Recorder, Rush ville, Nebraska. Gentlemen : You inquire whether or not an election board has any authority to stop counting the votes of the precinct at 10 :30 p. m., and before the completion of the count and to postpone the counting until morning. Sections 2020 and 2021, Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska, 1922, in our opinion contemplate that the count - ing should continue until the same is finished and the board should not have adjourned until the count was </seg>
            <seg id="p353">OPINIONS 353 finished. We base this conclusion upon the fact that the statute says: "When the poll is closed the judges shall immediately proceed to CANVASS and ASCERTAIN the result of the election, except in such precincts as are required by law to have a counting election board." In the latter precincts the law provides how the votes shall l&gt;e counted. We l&gt;elieve, however, that the action of the election board in failing to complete tht&gt; count without adjournment would be a mere irregularity. nnd would not invalidate the election so long as u&lt;&lt; fraud whs porpct rated. 20 C J. 191 holds: "In the absence of any showing of fraud, however, an adjournment or postponement of the count will not of itself be sufficient to vitiace the return, especially where there is good cause for the delay." We do not approve of such irregularities as you mention, and the count should have continued until fin - ished as it might sometime result in frauds being per - jietratcd if this was not done.

In case the proposition carries the bonds are signed by the chniriuan of the county board and by the county clerk. In the case of Stein r.

Dear Sir: You impure whether or not a majority of votes - cast at the general election, or a majority of the vote? cast upon the question is necessary to the decision of the matter of the retention of a county ngent.

A person defeated at the primary may not be a lawful candidate by petition at the election for the office of county superintendent. Mr. li. M. HanU nbrook, County Attorney, Ord f Nebraska. Dear Sir: You state that two candidates were nominated in your county for the office of county superintendent of schools, and that one of the successful nominees has now declined the nomination. You also state that a third ]&gt;erson, who was defeated at the primary now files a petition asking that she be placed on the non-political ballot. You ask whether this can lawfully be done. Section 2168, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides that if a vacancy shall occur as to any person duly nominated on a non-]&gt;olitical county ticket, the same may be filled by petition filed with the county clerk for at least ten per cent of the number of voters who voted for governor at the preceding general election, if such vacancy be as to a nominee for either county judge or county super - intendent. This is the mode provided by law as to filling vacancies as to these two non-political offices. </seg>
            <seg id="p358">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 358 You will note that the section does not say when this petition shall be filed. Inasmuch as it is not a nomination, but the filling of a vacancy ujKm the ballot it would be our conclusion that the petition might be filed at any time before the ballots are to 1m? printed as required by law. You will note that this same section provides that in all other respects the general laws in force in this state res]K&gt;cring the holding, conducting and declaring the results of any such general election shall apply so far as the same arc applicable and not inconsistent with the provisions of this act. The question of whether or not the person defeated at the primary may be a candidate for the office at the general election is a more serious question. W« find nothing in the non-political act which jK'rmits a ]&gt;erson defeated as a candidate at the primary to become a candi - date by ]&gt;etition at the general election. It would therefore seem that the general election law pertaining to this proposition would apply. Section 2098, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides that no person who has l&gt;een a candidate for any office at a primary shall be a candidate by petition or cer - tificate of nomination for the office for which he was defeated, at the next general election. Inasmuch as we Had nothing inconsistent with this provision of the law in the non-j)olitical act. it would l&gt;e our opinion that Holmes could not lawfully become a candidate for the office of county su]&gt;erintendent because she had l)oen a candidate at the primary and had been defeated.

Pear Sir: You inquire whether or not in school districts organ - ized under Article VI of the school laws, a member who is elected and fails to file an acceptance within ten days has forfeited his office. Section O.'UO, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1 !):.':&gt;. provides thsit within ten days after the election such trustees in Article VI shall file with the director a written acceptance of the office. You will note that it does not expressly state that an office shall be forfeited or vacated if they do not file this acceptance. We have very little guidance through the supreme court in answering this inquiry. In the case of Franz v. Youiu/, ;$0 Neb. :$&lt;&gt;0, referring to a moderator of a rural school district who failed to accept in writing the office lo which he had Im-cii elected, it was held that inasmuch as he had been performing the duties of the office he was itn officer de facto, and entitled to hold office. The court in the latter part of the opinion in that case calls attention to the fact that the section of the law considered therein, and which required an acceptance of the office, contained noi provision that the office should become vacant if the acceptance was not filed. We presume that the case which you have in mind is one where no acceptance of any kind was made, although probably the officer entered upon the performance of his duties. In the case of State r.

            <seg id="p361">OPINIONS 361 Section 202, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, fixes the justice of the peace districts for the various counties. Madison county is designated as District No. 21 and the justice of the j&gt;eace district is designated as the territory within Madison county. In the case of State r. Shropshire, 4 Neb. 411, it was held that the justice of peace must hold office in the pre - cinct where he is elected. In the case of State v. Magney, 52 Neb. 508, it is held that the territorial jurisdiction of the justices of the i&gt;eace must be uniform. We find nothing in the statutes which says where the justices of the j&gt;eace must reside. We presume, therefore, that it would be held by the courts that the justices of the peace would be elected within the justice of the peace districts as defined by Section 202, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922. While the statute is not very clear and the matter is not free from doubt, it seems to us that the intention of the legislature was that each city and village having more than five hundred inhabitants, except where other - wise provided by law, is to have a justice of the peace residing within the city or village, and that the territory outside and within the precinct should have a justice of the ]&gt;eace resident within the precinct. This is rather a broad interpretation but it is our belief that it is the intention of the legislature, and that the person to be qualified for the office of justice of the jteace should be a resident of the precinct at large and in cases of the justice of the peace of the city should be a resident of the city or village.

Where the provisions of the constitution and the provisions of the statute conflict in regard to the conduct of elections and the printing of ballots, the provisions of the constitution prevails. State Journal Company, Attention: Mr. CaUUreU. Lincoln, Xcbraxka. Gentlemen : In answer to yonr letter of inquiry of the 17th instant I»ennit me to say that, in my opinion, the provisions of Section 1940, Compiled Statutes, 1922, providing that initiative and referendum proposals and constitutional amendments shall be submitted on a separate ballot, pre - vail over apparently conflicting provisions in Sections 1941, 1S61, 19."&gt;4 and 19*»9, Compiled Statutes, 1922. Section 1940, Compiled Statutes, 1922. was amended in 1921 to it?ad as it does now. The last amendment to Section 1941 was ] Kissed in 1915: to Section 1954 in 1903, and to Section 19G9 in 1917. It is a rule of statutory' construc - tion that: "The last expression of the legislative will is the law in case of conflicting provisions in the same statute or in different statutes." (36 Cyc. 1130.) Section 1951, Compiled Statutes, 1922, was last amend - ed in 1921, at the same time Section 1940 was amended. In that respect the two sections are on a parity, but the pro - visions in Section 1951 to which you call attention as conflicting with the provisions of Section 1940, also con - flict with the provisions of Section 4, Article III of the Constitution, wherein it is provided : "All propositions submitted in pursuance hereof shall be sub - jnitted in a nonpartisan manner and without any indication or sug - gestion on the ballot that they have been approved or indorsed by any political party or organization." They also conflict with the provisions of Section 1, Article XVI of the Constitution, which provides with </seg>
            <seg id="p363">OPINIONS 363 reference to the submission to the electors of amendments to the Constitution proposed by the legislature : "Said amendments shall be submitted to the electors for approval or rejection upon a ballot separate from that upon which the names of candidates appear." There is no w flirt, in my opinion, between the pro - visions of Section 4, Article III, and Section 1, Article XVI, of the Constitution. Section 4, Article III expressly states : "The method of submitting and adopting amendments to the constitution, provided by this section, shall be supplementary to the method prescribed in the article of this constitution, entitled amend - ments, and the latter shall in no case be construed to conflict here - with." All provisions in any sections of the election laws which indicate in any way that one who has merely declared his intention to l&gt;eeonie a citizen is entitled to vote, should l&gt;e considered as inoj»erative and of no effect since the amendment to the Constitution makes citizenship one of the essential qualifications of an elector.

Objections to the nomination have been filed by a Mr. Swallow represented by his attorney, Dale P. Stough. The objections raised are that no legal conven - tion was held by the progressive party in 1924; that it has no legally constituted state committee, and other allegations to the effect that the nomination is insufficient and illegal. We are unable to advise you until the Secretary of State passes u]&gt;on the proj&gt;osition whether or not this nomination will l&gt;e held legal and whether or not the ballot will cany the name of the progressive candidate for governor. Your last question is difficult to answer. You inquire whether or not if there is no candidate for governor on the progressive ticket if the progressive party then loses its legal standing in the state. We have gone through the statutes and find very little on this question. We do find, however, that Section 2121, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1022, provides that in order that the candidates of any ]»olitical party may have their names appear on the primary ballot that such party must have polled at least one j&gt;er cent of the votes cast in the state or any political sulMlivision thereof for the candidate for the i(-s]&gt;ective office for which the nomination is to be made. This rather indicates that the party would lose its stand - ing unless it ]&gt;olled at least one |&gt;er cent of the votes &lt;-;.*r in the state. This matter, however, is not free from doubt and it might require a court decision. Very truly yours, O. S. SPILLMAN, Attorney General. By LLOYD DORT, Ax&amp;i*tant Attorney General.

To our minds this indicates that each vacancy upon the board is to be filled separately. For example, in some districts there might be a vacancy of one year, two years or three years, and in another some other number of years of one of these three classes. Evidently the intention of the legislature was that the places should be filled by candidates for each separate place named in the caucus who should run against each other for the place designated.

He inquires if the bonds will be regigtered, providing the council by resolution fixed the time for which the bonds shall run and the rate of interest they shall Itear, and places both such matters within the statutory limitation imposed by law. In answer to his question, ]&gt;erniit me to say that it would have been better to have the propositions submitted to the electors contain a statement of the time they are to run, and also the rate of interest they are to bear. Tn a similar case the Supreme Court of Montana has held in State ex rcl Stanford r. School District Xo. 1 of Cascade County et ui, 38 Pac. 402: "Under Corap. St. Sec. 1950, as amended by Act of February 14, 1893, providing that the school board may, on a majority vote, submit to the electors of the district whether it shall issue bonds for school-building purposes, and forbidding the issuance of bonds beyond a certain fixed sum, bearing interest not exceeding six per cent., and payable ami redeemable at a certain time, a notice of elec - tion which does not state the rate of interest of the time when the bonds were to become payable and redeemable is insufficient, and the issuance of bonds pursuant to the election held thereunder should be restrained."

Form of petitions discussed. Signers have a right to withdraw upon conditions stated. Mr. Lloyd H. Jordan, Attorney at Iaik, Gordon, Nebraska. Dear Sir Your letter of ■qptonber 2.~)th contains several in - quiries : 1. How long before general election must a petition be filed nominating a person for county office? Ill an opinion dated October 6th, 1922, this depart - ment held that the statute did not expressly cover this situation. This opinion also held that twenty days was a reasonable time within which the nomination petition should be filed before the general election. In that opinion, Sections 1948 and 1932, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, referring to the preparation of a ballot, are referred to. It is evident that the officials should have sufficient time within which to prepare the ballot, and that all nominations should lx» made within a reasonable time prior thereto. Section 2098, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, does not expressly sj&gt;ecify the time within which the ]&gt;etition shall be filed. Section 2122, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. 1922, provides that party committees may fill vacancies within twenty days before the election. Section 2122 also refers ta a twenty (lays' limitation. Section 2118, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, requires the declination of a nomination of fifteen days l&gt;efore the election. This is under the primary law, and inasmuch under the primary law, where nominated at the primary, a candidate has five days to accept the nomina - tion, we would be inclined to think that a twenty- days' </seg>

It would therefore be our opinion that a i&gt;etition for nomination would be filed not more than twenty days prior to the election. 2. You ask whether a nomination petition is fatally defective which fails to set out the business, residence, etc., of the signers. In this same question you ask whether ditto marks for the business and residence in some cases are sufficient. The case of Harris r. King, 109 X. W. 644, a South Dakota case holds that where the statute provides for a |»etitio!i to Ik- signed by twenty electors, that each elector shall attach to his signature his place of residence, business and ix&gt;stoffice address. A petition is insufficient when of the twenty-four persons who signed it only fifteen added to their rignatures the places of residence. This indicates that the statutory requirements are more than director* and should l»e complied with. In the case of State r. Burncll, 110 V. W. 177, a Wisconsin case holds that the statute has been substan - tially compiled with even though ditto marks are used for the designation of business, residence, etc. 3. You ask whether or not persons who have signed a nominating petition may withdraw their names from the nominating petition. We have not time to hunt up decisions on this point but there are decisions which hold that a jiemon who signs a petition of this nature may withdraw his name from the petition at any time before it leaves the hands of the circulators presenting it at the place it should l&gt;e filed. We believe that you will have no difficulty in finding authorities in supjtort of this statement. Verv trulv vours O. 8. BPILLMAH, Attorney General. By LLOYD DORT. Assistant Attorney General.

When a vacancy occurs in an office where a person nominated on a non-political county ticket, such vacancy rnay be filled by a peti - tion filed with the county clerk for at least ten per cent of the number of voters who voted for governor at the present generat election. There is no provision of statute for nominating a person to fill a vacancy upon a non-political ballot other than county offices. Mr. D. C. Xorrix, Clerk of the District Court Bmrxter, Xebraxka. Dear Sir: inquiries you are informed as In reply to your recent follows : First — If only one ]&gt;erson has filed for the office of county judge, which is on the non-political ballot, and the voters at the primary write in the name of another person as candidate for such office, and such person does not receive at lea.st ten ]K&gt;r cent of the total vote cast for gover - nor in said county at the preceding general election, such ]*erson whose name has been written upon such non - l&gt;olitical ballot is not elected as one of the candidates for such office. Section 2168, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, in part provides: "When at least two persons shall not file an affidavit to have their names placed upon the primary ballot for the nomination or such position to be filled and the name of a person is written in ana voted for as a candidate for any of such positions, who did not file as aforesaid as a candidate for such nomination, such person shall not be entitled to a certificate of nomination at such primary election nor have his name placed on the general election ballot unless he shall have received at least the second highest number of votes cast in such nomination and unless such a number of votes received shall be at least ten per cent of the total vote cast for governor in said county at the preceding general election."

If the electors of such party write in the name of a ]&gt;er8on as candidate and such person whose name is written in would receive the highest num - ber of votes at such primary election, then such person would be such party's candidate for such office at the general election. Section 2152, Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska, provides: "The person receiving the greatest number of votes at a primary as the candidate of a party for an office shall be the candidate or that party for such office, and his name as such candidate shall be placed on the official ballot at the following election." Third — -In reply to your third inquiry as to whether a candidate may be filed by j»etition on the non-political bal - lot for the office of county judge, you are informed that Section i»l &lt;&gt;8, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, in l&gt;art provides: "If a vacancy shall occur as to any person duly nominated on a non-political county ticket, the same may be filled by petition fileo with the county clerk for at least ten per cent of the number or voters who voted for governor at the preceding general election, !r such vacancy be as to a nominee for either county judge or county superintendent." You will note that, the above- quoted part of the Rtatute provides for the filling of a vacancy where a person has been nominated as a candidate for the office of county judge or county superintendent on the non-|&gt;olitical county ticket. We are of the opinion that such provision of the statute does not provide for the nominating of a candidate for the office of either county judge or county superin - tendent where only one ]&gt;erson has been nominated for such office and the person nominated is a candidate for such office, but that it only applies where a ]&gt;erson has l&gt;een nominated as one of the candidates for such office, and afterwards such a vacancy occurs to one of the persons dulv nominated. </seg>

You state that it is your belief that the judges of the election had no right to require you to state your ]K&gt;litical affiliation, and that such requirement invades the right of the voter to cast his ballot in secret, etc. We would say that the statute requires the voters to call for the ballot of their political jwrty when voting at a primary election. This requirement does not apply to general election.

Many persons criticized the old convention method of nominations and the primary law was thereupon enacted. It is not, strictly shaking, an election but a nomination of candidates. If you do not affiliate with any one of the i&gt;olitical parties it would seem that you would have no interest in who might be selected by any particular party. If you are interested in any ]&gt;articular political party the law gives you a right to vote at the primary of your party and to vote for a candidate for the nomination by that party for the various jK)litical offices. At the time the candidates are voted upon for the office you would of course have the right to vote for any j&gt;erson named upon the ballot, which includes candidates of all political parties, or if none of these candidates are satisfactory to you, you would have the right to write in the name of any candi - date for whom you desired to vote, placing opposite the written name your cross (X), thus indicating your choice for that office. We do not believe that any attack made through the courts would be successful in setting aside the provision of the primary law requiring the voter to call for the ballot of his ]&gt;olitical party. We believe that you must have had an erroneous im - pression of the purpose of the primary election for it is in no sense an election of candidates to office, but is a merr nomination process.

Dear Sir: You refer to the grandmother of five orphan children of school age, who is the sole support of said children, and who for seven years by her lal&gt;or, has been supporting and educating them.

If it be suggested that rhe Nineteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution effects the question, let me sug - gest that it provides that the right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex. Section 6271 does not deny or abridge rhe right of cither sex, as is plainly seen from the first few lines of same, and it surely does not present a case of taxation without I am mindful of the wording of Section 1S9'?, Com piled Statutes for 1922, but that section appears to be more general in its terms and follows the provisions of the Constitution, while Sections 0271, 0272 and 6273 are special statutes applicable merely to school districts. Men may justly differ as to whether there is a conflict between the general provisions in Section 1893, and the special provisions of Sections 6271, 6272 and 6273, but since the provisions of the latter sections are specific and not general, and are presumed to be constitutional, it is mj opinion that ordinary caution should cause us to respect such sections unless and until our court reverses its jtosition in the case of State ex rel Crosby v.

Notice of said caucus shall be given by the school officers by posting public notice." There is no provision whatsoever for the adoption of a party circle iii school elections, and it is our opinion that where voters voted only in the party circle in the recent election in your school district those ballots should not have ln-en counted. The ballot should have contained only the names of the jtersons nominated at the caucus and had a blank line or two following that for space to write in the name of any one a voter desired to. If any one desired to become a candidate for the school board after the time expired for the caucus, such a ]&gt;erson should have l&gt;een nominated by ]»etition in order to have his name placed upon the ballot, and after his name on the ballot should have l&gt;een printed the words "by j&gt;eti - tion.* Xs other votes should have lieen counted by the election officers.

By adopting this rule for the nomination of your candidates I believe it was proper, where the results of the formal ballot taken showed that only three jtersons received a majority of the votes, that a second vote should have been taken for the nominating of the fourth candidate and that that procedure was not contrary to that part, of the statutes above quoted. </seg>

This does not extend to the office of district judge or judge of the supreme court. This question was in a measure decided by the supreme court in the case entitled, State ex rcl ()l*en r.

In this same case it was held that mandamus will no* lie to compel a ministerial officer to place upon the official non-partisan judiciary ballot blank spaces, so the elector* might write in the names of candidates for this office. That jK)int is distinguishable from the case under con - sideration for the reason that the court held rhat no election to fill lhat vacancy in the office was in order. In the case under consideration, there is to be an election to fill the office with the provision for one name to appear on the ballot and with no provision to supply thts vacancy left by the removal of the name of the other can - didate.

Section 1952 provides for publication of the offici.il ballot not more than ten and not less than three days before the election day. This would indicate that Hie official ballot must be prepared and ready for publica - tion within that period of time. Another section provides thai the ballot shall be printed and in the hands of the county clerk or municipal clerk five days before election.

            <seg id="p396">396 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL EXECUTIVE STATE OFFICERS— COMPENSATION. The legislature having fixed by appropriation in 1921, the salaries of the several executive state officers of the amounts named m Section 3 of Article XVII of the State Constitution, had no power to change such amounts at its next session. Hon. E. A. Smith, Chairman of Committee oh Salaries and Feet, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether the Legislature has j&gt;ower at this time to change the salaries to be paid the Governor and other state officers mentioned in Article IV of the Con - stitution. In answer to your question 1 will say that in my opinion it does not have" such power. Section 25 of Article IV of the Constitution provides that the officers mentioned in the article: "Shall receive such salaries as may be provided by law, but the salary of no officer shall be changed more than once in eight years." Section R of Article XVII of the Constitution fixed, "until otherwise provided by law," the salary of the Gover - nor at f7,500 and the salary of each of the other executive state officers except Lieutenant Governor at $5,000 ]&gt;er annum. The Legislature of 1921 appropriated for the payment of the salaries of such office™ the amounts pro - vided for under Section 3 of Article XVII of the Constitu - tion. This amounted to a fixing of the salary by the Leg - islature, If the view Ik- taken that it had not already been fixed for a jx-riod of eight years by the Constitution itself. In the case of U. 8. r. Mitchell, reported in 109 U. S. Reporter, at page 146 thereof, it was held that an appro - priation of a certain sum to pay the salary of an officer for the biennium fixed the salary at the amount appropri - ated.

It follows that the salaries as they now exist are not subject to change by the Legislature at this time and will not be subject to such change for the ensuing six years. This is true whether we regard them as fixed by the Constitution or by legisla - tive enactment. EXTRADITION— COSTS. Where in an extradition case the agent of the state sent to return the party extradited to this state fails without fault on his part to find the accused and return him to the state, he is entitled to be paid for reasonable expenses incurred in making the trip.

VComirll, (Jountji Attorn' i/. Harrison, Xcbntxl.a. Dear Sir: In reply to your favor of the 13th instant wherein you ask for an opinion from this office whether or not a part of the highway which has not been uwd for the statutory period becomes abandoned if the main highway has been used in part continuously, you are informed that it is stated in I'!) (\ .1., Section 251, page 584, &gt;us follows: "It seems to be well established by the weight of authority that nonuse will not operate to discontinue a legally established highway, unless coupled with affirmative evidence of an intent to abandon. Especially is this so where there is no use of the premises adverse to the right in the public." Ill KJ R. C. L., Section 56, \Kige 62, it is stated "The rule relative to the discontinuance of a highway is 'once a highway, always a highway" unless it is abandoned or vacated in due course of law; and the burden of showing a discontinuance, vacation or abandonment is on the party who asserts it. When the statute prescribes the method, a highway may be discontinued only in the manner so prescribed." Iu the recent case of Donovan v. Union P. R. Co., 104 Xeb. oG4, the court said : "It appears that 14 years had elapsed at the time of bringing this action since the road had been used for highway purposes ana it is urged that this operated as a statute of limitations against botn the public and the plaintiff. We are of opinion that the evidence does not show that the public ever voluntarily abandoned the roao as a public highway. The evidence indicates that at one time the public authorities constructed culverts in the highway. • • • The statute provides a way in which a public highway, needless or expensive, may be vacated. Rev. St. 1913, Sec. 2856, 2857. This statute was not followed. A highway, once established, becomes the property of the public. The county acts as the agent of the public, and is not a necessary party to the action. The statute of limita- </seg>

A highway obtained by pre - tion or dedication does not need to be 66 feet wide, the widtn xibed by the statute for laying out a highway." {From your statement of facts we understand that in IN a highway was established in your county, commonly led the .John Lacy road. In l!)04, duplicate proceeding s had to again lay out the road, and this wax commonly led the Pat Lacy road, and that l&gt;oth of these roads were lerally lined by the public, with the exception of a strip land through a part of the Northwest quarter of Section Township :',2, North of Range 56. From the above quoted authorities it is our opinion that where a road has been properly established the same can Ik- vacated only in the manner prescribed by law, and thai Ihe failure of the public to use a part of an estab - lished highway does not of itself vacate the part not used. Maintenance of roads is a duty of the county. Individuals must provide their own means of access to public roads.

It seems that certain culverts after having l)een installed must be re - paired or replaced. Under the provisions of Section 8336. Compiled Statutes, UtL'2, the burden of maintaining the state highway after January 1, 1920, is placed upon the county within which the highway is situated. This section also provides that such maintenance shall include improve - ments to the existing surface of such highway, to bridges, culverts and other structures thereon. Some other phases of this situation have arisen and have lieen submitted to this department, but they do not seem to ]&gt;ertaiu to your inquiry, although you may be interested in them. This department ruled concerning th&lt;&gt; construction of culverts on county roads to provide access to the state highway, and if the township desired to build such culverts, the township would have to build them itself. This, of course, does not apply to culverts on the main part of the highway, but to those culverts which must be installed in order to connect the cross roads to the state highway. In another opinion this department also ruled that if the adjoining landowners Avish to connect their roads with the highway they would have to provide crossings for their own benefit over the roadside ditches. In the same opinion this department ruled that the county hoard could con struct such culverts if they so desired, but there was no law com|telling either the landowner or the county board io build them.

No duty rests upon a county board to return water to original channel where the channel changes as the result of an extraordinary flocl. Mr. 0. K. Staxoikii Cou I- tn Attorney. Fru iiklin, Xdtrn xkii . Dear Sir: The Republican river on account of the extraordinary floods has changed its course, and it may leave a county bridge high and dry and may necessitate the hiiildiag of a new bridge aci-oss the stream, according to the information contained in your letter of June 1,'tth. Your first question is whether or not the county lM&gt;ard is comjK'lled to divert the river back into it* foiincr channel. We know of no provision of law requiring wuch art ion ii]ion the part of the county lnmrd. The art aoidl - nary floods are the act of God for which the county is no way resj&gt;onsible. You inquire whether or not the county l&gt;oiid may cut a new channel through the land of two or th ee land owners a mile or two above the bridge in order to for-e the water to stay within the old channel. We know of no provision of law authorizing this action. Cerrai'ly the pr&lt;)|«'i - ty of private owners could not thus 1k&gt; taken without some proceedings at law.

This action, however, under the circumstances, seems not to Im- required, but Ihe necessity is to keep the waters within the old channel. Inasmuch as we find no statutory authority for such action, we cannot advise you that the countT lion rd has such |K»wers.

HIGHWAYS— IMPROVEMENT. Road improvement districts may be lawfully organized. The matter of taxation for improvements therein is governed by the limitations of the Constitution and statutes. Mr. H. A.

Dear Sir: You a8k for an interpretation of Chapter 128, Laws of Xebraska, 1923, which provides for the establishment of Road Improvement Districts, and that 25 per cent of the cost thereof, after making deductions for federal aid, etc , xhall be apjmrtioned to the county. In our opinion this law is probably constitutional, as the county receives a general benefit from the improvement of its highways, and the immediate abutting property owners receive special benefits over that received by the county generally. This law probably will operate without </seg>
            <seg id="p423">OPINIONS 423 trouble where the county is in such {Mtiition financially as not to bring in question the jK)s.sihiIity of exceeding the constitntionul limit. We have very |MVf doubt, however, as to the right of the Legislature, in view of Sections 5 and 6 of Article 8, of the Constitution, to (dace a burden ui&gt;on the county which would require the mixing of money by taxation in excess of the constitutional limit, without a vote of the people authorizing the taxation in excess of the limit. It will, of coui-se, be argued that this is for sjKfial ltenefits, but you will note, by the provisions of Section 15 of the Constitution, that the Legislature is vested with |K&gt;wer to vest in the, corporate authorities of cities, towns and villages, that power to make local improvements by special assessments, or by s|KviuI taxation of the pro|»erty bene - fited. This does not seem to extend to counties. It is true that the law in question, places upon the county a burden of paying a certain \wv cent of the cost of the improve - ment, regardless of what rhe actual benefits received may Ik 1 , as ordinarily fixed by engincei-s. appraisers or other - wise. This disregards also the fact that the entire lienefits, or nearly so, may accrue to the abutting property owners in some instances. On account of the arbitrary fixing of this per cent, and the nature of the improvement, we believe that the courts would l&gt;e inclined to construe the assessment upon ihe county as a general lax. and that this should not lie imposed u|k&gt;ii the county in excess of the constitutional limit, except ii|x&gt;n vote of the people.

Bitchof, County Clerk, Nebraska City, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You ask for an interpretation of Section 4084, Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922. You particularly in - quire as to the classification of these persons who may sign and file written objections against the proposed paving. In interpreting such a statute it is impotrant to ascer - tain the intent of the Legislature as it is generally held that the intent of the Legislature will govern. (1 C. J. 376, Note 66.) In Section 4084, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, it ap]&gt;ears that the paving district is organized to include j&gt;ortions of different streets or portions of alleys, provided they abut. We believe that the word "abut" is used in this connection for the purpose of organizing the bene - fit district and for no other purpose, and is not intended in any manner to limit or restrict the actual streets which are to be paved. About the middle of this same section it is provided : "If the owners of the record title representing a majority of (he abutting property owners in a district shall file with the said clerk," This refers to abutting property owners in the district, and seems to recognize abutting property owners, and other property owners in the district would be affected only so far as their property is affected or damaged, and seems to make a distinction for the purpose of remon - strance. This distinction is not necessary although it is recognized by the Legislature as we have indicated. We find nothing in this section which indicates that the Legislature intended to use the term "abutting property </seg>
            <seg id="p425">OPINIONS 425 owner" in any other sense than it has been generally recog - nized and defined. The term "abutting property" has been defined by judicial decisions: "The term 'abutting property' as used in statutes providing -.'or assessments against abutting property for stieet improvements, means that between which and the improvement there is no intervening land."

In the case of City of Springfield v. Green, 120 111. 209, 11 N. E. 261, a lot, no part of which touched the street involved, was held not to be abutting property. The above cases seem to state the general rule. We find noth - ing in the statute which indicates to us that the Legisla - ture intended to use the terra "abutting property owners" in a restricted or limited sense and we are therefore of the belief that the signers of the remonstrance would be restricted to those actually having property abutting on the street to be paved as described in the district and as provided by this section.

Matxon, Count)/ Attorney, Lincoln, Xcbruxka. Dear Sir: You state that the county county adopted a resolution commissioners of Lancaster creating a paving district approximately one-half mile in length and connected up with the city paving at one end of the {taring only. The road pro|&gt;osed to be pared is outside the limits of the city of Lincoln but the proi&gt;erty abutting on the west side of the paving is within the city limits. The commissioners proi&gt;ose to pay 95 j&gt;er cent of the cost of the paving, the balance to l&gt;e charged against the abutting proi&gt;erty. Your inquiries an- as follows: 1. May the commissioners order the work done and the improvements made ujton a petition of the owners of 55 per cent of the property computed on the zone basis as provided in Chapter 45, Session Laws of Nebraska, 1923? We iM'lieve that this is the only way in which the com - missioners would Ik' authorized to organize this district and construct this improvement. The reason for our con - clusion is that the commissioners can create such district without jtetition only in the event the road to be improveit does not exceed one-half mile in length, and where it con - nects at each end with paving already constructed or pro - vided for. Since the projH&gt;sed paving connects with only one end it is evident that this proviso does not apply and that a petition would be necessary. Your next inquiry is a little more difficult to answer. You inquire whether or not in our judgment the county commissioners may create the district and construct the improvement inasmuch as the property on the one side of the road lies entirely within the city of Lincoln, although </seg>

We find no provision in Chapter 4"&gt;, Session Laws of Nebraska. 1!(23, pi-ohibiting the commissioners from organ - izing the district and constructing the improvement where the road lies entirely outside the corporate limits. This chapter does provide that where a portion of the road lies within the city or village, ;ind the remaining outside of the corporation, that then the county board may create the district and construct the improvement only when the pav - ing, repaving, etc. of that partial of tin- road within the city limits has 1kh-u provided for by the city or village or otherwise than by the county. It would not no* that this part of the statute would apply inasmuch as the road ami the entire improvement lies outside the cor|&gt;orate limits. The answer to your inquiry would seem to depend entirely u|k»ii the other provisions of the statute, where the road lies entirely outside the cor|K&gt;ration. inasmuch as provision is made for the organization of districts without the excep - tions where the road lies entirely outside the cor|K&gt;rate limits. We would be of the opinion that the board of com - missioners in the exercise of sound discretion and upon proper petition provided by this smtute conld create the district and construct the improvement. While the Itoard is given discretion, we further U-lieve that the statin. ■ con - templates that it shall be reasonable discretion, and that it was not the inteniion of the Legislature that the county should pay for the entire expense or an unreasonable pro - portion of the expense to a degm* that the property iHMiefitcd would not pay its proportionate reasonable part of the exjiense of the construction. If the county board, therefore, organized the district and constructed the im - provement it seems that they should use a reasonable dis - cretion to see that the property benefited pays its propor - tionate cost of the improvement in proportion to the benefits received.

The road dragging fund, however, by the provisions of Section 833!), Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, seems to be a H|MH*ial fund.

Permit me to say in answer to the question iiropoaaded that the word '"along" in the above quoted provision of statute is to l&gt;e construed as synonymus witli the word "upon". To give it a construction forbidding the placing of advertising signs within three hundred feet of a railroad crossing or of the intersection of any two crossroads of the public highway at grade, regardless of whether or not the signs so placed were upon the public highway, would plaot - a construction upon the aci making it broader than its title.

The word "along" you will observe does not occur in the title to the act. In a somewhat similar case the Supreme &lt;\&gt;urt of He* York held : "Section 2 declares that no side paths shall be constructed upon or along any regularly constructed or maintained sidewalk except upon vhe content of the persons owning the abutting lands.

HIGHWAYS— TOWNSHIP MAINTENANCE In counties under township organization the duty of maintaining the public highways (except bridges over streams) which have not been declared to be state or county highways devolves upon the townships. Mr. Donald T. Ayres, County Attorney, Ponea, Nebraxka. Dear Sir : You say in your letter of the 13th instant that about thirty years ago a road was duly established and opened by the County Board of Dixon County, that the road has been traveled for more than twenty years but that along its en - tire length it has been obstructed more or less by fences of adjoining owners, trees, orchards etc., planted after the road was established. You say further, there is nothing in he order establishing the road which states in express terms </seg>
            <seg id="p433">OPINIONS 433 that it is any certain width and you assume in the absence of any such statement that the road was sixty-six feet wide. You inquire for an opinion from this Department as to whose duty it is to keep such a road open and as to the proper course to pursue in case it is now desired to have the &lt;»t)st ructions removed and the road opened to its full width. Permit me to say at the outset in answering your letter that I agree with you in the view that so long as nothing was said as to the width of the road in the establishment proceedings that it was established as a sixty-six foot road. In answer to the questions which you propound I will say that in my opinion the maintaining of this road (except bridges over treams if any there be thereon), if it has not been declared a state or county road, devolves upon the township in which it is situated. The duty of maintaining the public highway in qiies tion, except as to bridges over streams and provided it has not been declared to be a state or county highway, devolves primarily upon the township in which it is situated. "Counties governed by vhe township organization aci of 189.") are relieved from the duty and liability to construct highways and cul - verts. Such duties and liabilities are imposed upon the townships in the counties so governed." (Goes v. Gage County, 37 Neb. '516.) Section 2795 Compiled Statutes expressly provides "All township road and culvert work shall be under the general supervision of the iownsnip board, except as hereinafter provided." the exception being the highways within the corporate limits of cities and villages. "Where a highway has been legally established, mandamus will lie to compel the proper authorities to open it, although not where the location is indefinite or there is a question as to its legality, * * * or the officers would be subjected to an action of damages or tne officer has no means with which to act."

Before the township board can be compelled by man - damus to remove obstructions in a public highway it occurs to me it must be shown that it has the funds necessary to do the work at its disposal, that such funds are not needed for highway work elsewhere in the township, and that the ob - structions are not such as are permitted to be placed in the highways under the provisions of law last above quoted. II am of the opinion that as practical a way as any get the road cleared of obstructions in the case to which a refer is to have the township board direct the road over - x of the road district in which the road is siluated *o re - ive or have removed the obstructions in question, pro - led they were not lawfully placed on the public highway virtue of the authority conferred by Section 2780 Corn - ed Statutes, above quoted, then let the road overseer er due notice to the owner or owners of such obstructions, same are not removed, remove them himself and charge ? expense or removal to such owner or owners.

Dear Sir : You inquire under date of February 14th whether the County and State can, without compensation to the abut - ting property owner, use thirty-three feet from the center line of the traveled road on either side regardless of where the fences have been for the preceding ten years. We presume your reference is to a state highway. If this is true we believe that the public would have a right to use only that portion of the road which has been proper - ly dedicated to the public use or that part which has been taken under emminent domain proceedings or upon which the Statute of Limitation* has iiui Inn-anse of user for more than ten years. Sections 25t&gt;4 and 2.*)&lt;ir&gt;, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, ID'2'2, sot forth the width of the roads and define public roads. The decisions cited under these sections refer to the fact that the public may gain the right to use the road by prescription. We, therefore, believe that a location of the fences would have considerable to do with this matter unless a state highway has been laid out along this road as pro - vided by law. If a state highway has not been laid out it is probable that it would l&gt;e governed by the rule laid down in Chapter 23, Article 1. In the event that the road in ques - tion is a state highway we presume that it was laid out under the laws applicable and under the system established. Section HH* Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, provides for alterations of State highways and states the manner of making assessments of l&gt;enefits.

Your letter of August 4th has just been received and in answer thereto will say that the inheritance tax law of this state is set forth in the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska! 1922, l&gt;eginning with Section 6153. This section provides: "All property, real, personal and mixed, which shall pass by fill or by intestate laws of this state from any person who m:ty die seized or possessed of the same while a resident of this state, cr, if decedent was not a resident of this state at the time of his death, which property or any part thereof shall l&gt;e within thi* state, or any interest therein or income therefrom, which shall be transferred by deed, grant, sale or gift made in conten.plation of the death it </seg>

            <seg id="p443">OPINIONS 443 INSURANCE COMPANY— AGENTS An insurance company may lawfully refuse to employ anyone as its agent, who is acting as agent for some other and competing com - pany. Dear Sir. In your letter of the first instant you say: "There are approximately 175 insurance companies known as 'Union Companies.' These companies are admittedly affiliated and in the territory which includes Nebraska are known as 'Western Union Companies'. There is also a group of companies in this territory of something over one hundred which are known as 'Bureau Com - panies'. There are also between fifty and seventy-five more or less prominent non-affiliated insuran.ce companies. The traveling agents and field men of the various Union Companies from time to time are making requirements on agents that they exclude from their general insurance agency all 'Bureau' and 'Non-offiliated' Companies. Re - peatedly various agents in the state have been told that they would have to represent all Union Companies or the Union Companies would take up their supplies and refuse to continue their agency." Yon inquire whether the Union Companies may law - fully refuse to employ any one as their agent upon the ground alone that he is acting as agent for Bureau and Non - offiliated Companies, and call the attention of this depart - ment particularly to the third subdivision of Section 3420. and also to Section 3425, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922 edition. Among the things declared to be trusts and unlawful by Section 3420, Compiled Statutes are comtdna - tions: "To prevent competition in insurance, either life, fire, accident or any other kind, or in manufacture, making, constructing, transpor - tation, sale or purchase of merchandise, produce or commodities;" Section 3425 ,Compiled Statutes, provides: "Any combination or agreement made or entered into by or be - tween two or more fire insurance companies insuring property against oasualtes from the elements, transacting business within this state, or between the officers, agents, or employees of any such companies.

I aiii of the opinion that tin- fact that an insurance company refuses to retain in its employ as agents jiereons, who are also acting as the agents of its competitors, does not necessarily show that it is violating the provisions of either of the sections of statute above quoted. The fact that the same person is not allowed to act as agent for two or more competing companies certainly does not tend in any way to stifle competition lietween such companies. Where several companies enter into an agreement by which they bind themselves not to employ as an agent any one, who acts as agent for certain other companies, a somewhat different situation is presented, but in that, case I do not believe that such an agreement is, in itself, a violation of either of the provisions of statute above quoted, although it might Ik* taken as some evidence, when considered with other things, that an unlawful com - bination has been formed to prevent competition in in - surance.

            <seg id="p458">458 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL with the offense of unlawfully having in their possession intoxicating liquor. At the trial the defendants requested that the jury be instructed as follows: "You are further instructed that, even though you should be con - vinced beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendants did, at the time and place set forth in the information, have in their possession intoxicating liquor, yet I instruct you that if you believe that said de - fendants came into lawful possession of said liquor during the time when, under the laws of this state, it was lawful to have possession of intoxicating liquor, or you should have a reasonable doubt as to such facts, then you must acquit the defendants. "This instruction the court refused, and the second error is predi - cated thereon. But the question suggested does not require extended discussion. It was before this court in the case of State v. Giaudrone, 109 Wash. 397, 86 Pac. 870, where we determined, in harmony with the view here taken by the trial court, that the manner of the acqui - sition of intoxicating liquor did not affect the question of rightfulness of possession." Agsiin, in the case of State r. Montgomery, 209 Pac. 199, where the defendant was convicted of having unlawful possession of intoxicating liquor, the supreme court of Washington said : "On his appeal here the defendant contends that the laws of the state with respect to traffic in and possession of intoxicating liquors as a beverage are abrogated and superseded by the National Prohibi - tion Act (41 Stat. 305), and since the latter does not prohibit pos - session of such liquor, section 17h of the state law (Rem. Comp. Stat, sec. 7328) making its possession unlawful is in conflict with the national act and void. This is not an open question in this jurisdic - tion. It was first decided contrary to appellant's views in State v. Turner, 115 Wash. 170, 196 Pac. 638. In the later case of State v. Jewett (Wash.) 207 Pac. 3, after quoting from the Turner case, we said: "We have no doubt that the several states now have a right to enact and enforce any laws, or enforce any previously enacted laws, on the subject of intoxicating liquors, which tend to carry into effect the purposes and objects of the Eighteenth Amendment and the Volstead Act, and that the only privilege of which they have been de - prived by the amendment is that they may not enact or enforce laws which would be inimical to or tend to defeat, the amendment, or acts of Congress passed by virtue of it. Not only may they enact any laws on this subject which are not inconsistent with the congres- </seg>
            <seg id="p459">OPINIONS 459 sional acts or the Eighteenth Amendment, but it is conceivable that they may enact any laws so long as they do not undertake to declare that lawful which the amendment or congressional act declares un - lawful, or seek to legalize that which the amendment has declared illegal.' We now make the last sentence quoted a positive statement and adopt it and the other part quoted as the law of this case. Our view is fully supported by a recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States in the case of Vigliotti v. Pennsylvania, 258 U. S. , 42 Sup. Ct. 330, 66 L. Ed. 389." In the recent case of Yifjliotti v. Pennsylvania, supra, the supreme court of the United States said: "In case of an indictment for selling without a license, a sale is presumed to be unlawful, and the burden is on the defendant tr show the authority on which he acted." We are therefore of the opinion that, under the pro - visions of Chapter 94, Laws 1923, that possession of intoxi - cating liquor in and of itself, including raw whiskey, com - monly called moonshine, in a private dwelling house by the person against whom the violation of the act is charged is prima facie evidence that such liquor was kept by such person with the purpose of unlawful sale, use or disposition in violation of law, and it is immaterial when - soever or howsoever said liquor was obtained. And in case of an indictment the burden is on the defendant to show that the iiossession of such liquor was for some lawful purpose as provided by statute. Respectfully submitted, O. S.

The question which you ask is not entirely free from doubt in the absence of a court decision on the subject. T am inclined to the opinion, however, that a magistrate may grant a defendant, upon request, a jury trial in such cases. I do not think, however, that he is required to do so. Section 9991, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides that in the prosecution of minor offenses: "After the plea of the defendant has been entered, if he plead not guilty, the defendant, or complainant, or the county attorney, if he be present, may demand a jury, but if no jury be demanded, the cause may be tried by the magistrate." I am of the opinion that the provision of statute first above quoted merely mollifies the provision of statute last above quoted to the extent of providing that in the prosecution of liquor cases where the punishment can not exceed a fine of One Hundred Dollars (fl 00.00) or im - prisonment for three months the magistrate may refuse to allow a jury trial if he sees fit to do so.

            <seg id="p469">OPINIONS 469 Answering your inquiry, I would call your attention to the case of Champion Iron Company r. City of South Omaha, 139 N. \V. JUS, where an election wax held for (he purpose of making a levy for a new city hall. The requirements for building a city hall are similar to those for building a court house, in that thei-e must lie a vote of the eleetorx, etc. In this case the building of a jail was not submitted to the voters. The city council, how - ever, felt that a jail should 1m- included in the building, and they proceeded to install cells in a part of the building. A controversy arose over the payment for that part of the structure, and a similar question arose to the one which you present. Judge Letton in writing the opinion of the court among other things stated: "The installation of cells in a 'City Hall' to be used in connec - tion with a police court held in the building, is incidental to, and not inconsistent with, the general purpose for which such building may be erected." The court further said : "It is impossible to lay down an exact definition of the term 'City Hall'. If separate buildings for different departments of city admin - istration are erected upon the same site, so related to each other and to the main structure as to form practically a part of the same general plan, each of the buildings would be authorized by a vote conferring power to issue bonds 'to purchase a site and erect a city hall thereon. ' " The court further held "The erection of cells in the police court building should be con - sidered as forming a part of the general plan for a city hall, and that the cost thereof is properly payable out of the money appro - priated by the vote upon the issuance of bonds for the purchase of a site, and erection of a city hall thereon."

A county board has discretion to furnish justices of the peace of the county with official dockets. Buffalo, Nebrattku. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of the 20th instant I will say that in this, Lancaster county, the county board sees that the justices of the peace are furnished with dockets, and 1 think in many of the counties they are provided with copies of the statutes. I find no law which in express terms says this must be done by the county. But it is probable that it is discretionary with the county board to furnish the docket at least, for Section 9486, Compiled Statutes, 1922. provides that a justice of the ]teare, ujion the expiration of his term, shall deposit with his successor his official docket. It would seem unreasonable to require him to turn over to his successor a record hook that he had purchased at his own exj&gt;ense. In the cawe of Bcrryman v. Schahlander, 85 Xeb. 281» 122 N. W. 990, it is said: "A county board or board of county commissioners are clothed, not only with the powers expressly conferred upon them by statutes, but they also possess such powers as are requisite to enable them to discharge the official duties devolved upon them by law. tThe matter of allowing a sum to the county attorney to cover I necessary expenses incurred while investigating and prose- I criminal cases and defending cases brought against the coun- Mr. R.

            <seg id="p471">471 ty is within the sound discretion of said board, and said board may, in the exercise of such discretion, lawfully allow and reimburse the county attorney for such expenditures." If the county board had discretion, as was held in that case, to pay traveling expenses of the county attorney, it ■would seem that by a parity of reasoning it could in its discretion furnish a justice of the peace with a docket. I may add that in this county, as I am informed, the justices themselves furnish the ordinary legal blanks, such aa sum - mons. sub|&gt;oenas, etc., at their own ex])en»e.

The Governor should notify member ■ against whom complaint is filed and provide opportunity for answer and hearing. To Hi* Excellency, Clwrlrx W. Bryan, Governor. Sir: Answering your oral inquiry of today with respect to your authority to remove any officer, which you may apj&gt;oint, I beg leave to advise that Section 1'2, of Article IV, of the Constitution of Nebraska, provides: "The Governor shall have power to remove any officer, whom he may appoint, in case of incompetency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office, and he may declare his office vacant, and fill the same as herein provided in other cases of vacancy." You state that a few months ago a iH-tition was filed with you, duly ratified and accompanied by affidavits in HUpjtort thereof, asking for the removal of a member of the State Normal Board, and charging him under said section with neglect of duty and malfeasance in office. It is my opinion that before action is taken upon the petition, that the member of the board should be notified that said jtetition is liled. and given an oppor - tunity to file iin answer, if he so desires, and that a date be set for hearing, and at said hearing the party com - plained against should 1m&gt; allowed to offer such evidence, as he may have to meet the charges of said complaint or jietitiou. and the evidence offered in connection therewith. tlf the evidence on the hearing satisfies the Governor t said officer is either incompetent to occupy his position, wilfully neglects his duty, or is guilty of malfeasance in ice, then it is my opinion that the Governor is not only halted but justified in removing said officer. </seg>
            <seg id="p475">475 "Malfeasance is the unjust performance of some act, which the party had no right, or which he had contracted not to do." "While to convict an officer of the felony denounced by Comp. Laws 1907, Par. 4083, punishing every person who with intent to de - fraud, presents for allowance and payment a fraudulent claim, the proof must show that he presented the claim with intent to defraud, yet such proof is not essential to sustain a conviction for malfea - sance in a proceeding for his removal under Section 4565; the term 'malfeasance' meaning the commission of an act which is positively unlawful. Law v. Smith, 98 Pac. 300, 307, 34 Utah, 394." "While 'malfeasance in office* is defined generally to be wrong - ful or unjust doing of some official act, which the doer has no right to perform, or which he has stipulated by contract not to do, it is essential that an evil intent or motive must accompany the act, or that it must have been done with such gross negligence as to be equivalent to fraud. Commonwealth v. Wood, 76 S. W. 842, 843, 116 Ky. 748 (citing Bisrop's New Cr. Law, Pars, 972, 834)" "Malfeasance is the doing of an act which is positively unlawful or wrongful which one ought not to do at all. It is an act wholly wrongful and unlawful." (3 Words and Phrases 220.) If one wilfully and intentionally removes property from an institution over which he may have charge, or over which he may have supervision, and he intentionally appropriate said property to his own use, or if he willfully und intentionally uses the labor, when said labor was him by the state for the institution over which he may have supervision or partial suj&gt;ervision, for his own use and to his own ]&gt;ersonal advantage, it is my opinion he is guilty of malfeasance. Whether such party is guilty of the charge is more readily determined in the light of all the circumstances and facts obtained from a hearing where evi - dence is presented pro and con. While it apj&gt;ears that there is nothing to prevent the Chief Executive from dismissing the petition in a matter of this kind without hearing, if he feels that a hearing is not justified, still if there be indications the complaint is just, T do not believe the Chief Executive would be justified in acting upon said matter unless and until the party complained against has been notified, and both sides have </seg>

However, if the fair grounds by statute be under the control of the county agricultural society, it is difficult to see how the municipality would have any right to exercise jurisdiction over the fair grounds. It is also difficult to conceive of any substantial legal grounds upon which a municipality might exercise ]&gt;owers outside of its corporate limits which would apply to carnival companies so long as said companies are obeying the law. A carnival conv jwny is not per se a nuisance and could hardly be con - strued to be such an amusement as would come within the police jtower of a city to suppress immoral amusements. </seg>
            <seg id="p477">OPINIONS 477 We therefore are of the opinion that the city, under the circumstance*, would have no right to pass ordinances designed to take effect l&gt;eyond the corporate limits. LEGISLATIVE MEMBER— IXELIGIBILITY TO CIVIL APPOINTMENT. Under the constitution a state senator is ineligible to appointment as a county treasurer examiner. Hon. George W. Marsh, St-ate Auditor, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Marsh : Replying to your inquiry of recent date, as to whether a pna holding the office of state senator, is eligible to the appointment of examiner of county treasurers, will state that it is my opinion he is not eligible to such ap - l&gt;ointment under the present Constitution. Section 13, of Article III, of the Constitution, origin - ally read, as follows: "No person elected to the Legislature shall receive any civil ap - pointment within this state from the Governor and Senate during the term for which he has been elected." • • • Under the section, as it then existed, such appointment was clearly within the law. Section 1(5, of Article III, of the present Consitution, which is an amendment of Section 13, of Article III, of the old Constitution, provides: </seg>
            <seg id="p478">478 "No person elected or appointed to the Legislature shall receive any civil appointment to a state office during the term for which he has been elected or appointed, and all such appointments shall be void; nor shall any member of the Legislature, or any state officer be in - terested, either directly or indirectly in any contract, with the state or any county or municipality thereof, authorized by any law enacted during the term for which he shall have been elected or appointed, or within one year after the expiration of such term." As to the question of the examiner being a. state officer, will state that since his duties would take him into any county in the state, and since he receives remunera - tion for his services from the state, and {jives a bond to the state, it is my opinion that he is a state officer, especially in view of the fact that Section 4979 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, and which Mtm 1© said examiner, reads as follows : "Such accountant before entering upon the duties of his OFFICE shall execute to the people of the State of Nebraska for the benefit of any county injured a bond, with good and sufficient sureties to be approved by the governor in the penal sum of ten thousand dollars, conditioned that he will faithfully and impartially perform the duties of his OFFICE." In State v. Burn*, 21 So. 290, the court said " 'State Officers', in a general sense, are officers whose duties and powers are co-extensive with the territorial limits of the state • • * whether an officer, unprovided for by the Constitution, be created solely by legislative enactment is to be regarded as a state or county officer must depend in a large measure upon the terri - torial scope of his jurisdiction and upon the nature and character of t powers and duties. If the jurisdiction for the exercise of his &gt;rs and duties is co-extensive with the limits of the state then i a state officer." This rule seems to be followed in People r. A'ijtoh, 158 N. Y. 221; People v. Curley, 5 Colo. 419; People v. Gonover, 17 N. Y. 614, and State ex rei Milwaukee Medical Collepe v. Chittemlen, 107 N. W. 500. In view of the ability and worthiness of the Benator that you seek to appoint, and the fact that he no doubt would render valuable service to the state, I regret to </seg>
            <seg id="p479">479 say that while this question may not be entirely free from doubt still it is my opinion that the present Con - stitution precludes such appointment.

Appointment of a member of the legislature to the position of munici - pal judge in the city of Omaha is contrary to the spirit, if not the letter, of Section 16, Article III of the State Constitution. The majority of decisions hold that such judge is a state officer. To His Excellency, Clmrles W. Bryan, Governor. Sir: You inquire if under the present Constitution you may appoint a member of the Legislature, judge of a municipal court at Omaha. In reply thereto would sug - gest that Section lti, of Article III, of the Constitution provides, as follows: "No person elected or appointed to the Legislature shall receive any civil appointment to a state office during the term for which he has been elected or appointed, and all such appointments shall be void; nor shall any member of the Legislature, or any state officer be in - terested, either directly or indirectly in any contract, with the state or any county or municipality thereof, authorized by any law enacted during the term for which he shall have been elected or appointed, or within one year after the expiration of such term." The main question &lt;it issue appears to Ik- whether or not such office is a state office within the meaning of the Constitution. There are two lines of decisions holding directly contrary to each other on this subject. Typical among the cases indicating that such office is not a state office is the case of Cook County r. Sennutt, 136 </seg>
            <seg id="p480">480 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 111. 314. A leading case holding to the contrary is State t\ Fleming, 127 N. W. 47:5, and in this case the Bupreme • ourt of Minnesota held under a section of the Minnesota constitution providing: "That the judicial power of the state shall be vested in a Su - preme Court, district courts, courts of probate, justices of peace, and such other courts, inferior to the Supreme Court, as the Legislature may, from time to time, establish, etc." that a municipal court in the city of Virginia established by the legislature was a state court and the judges state off ken. Since the adoption of our new Constitution, the nearest the court has come to the question was in the case of Slate c.r rcl City of Omaha ct al r. Hoard of Commissioners of Dougim* Count// ct al, 189 X. W. C&gt;:&gt;0, in which the court said : "The municipal courts of the City of Omaha are a branch of the judicial system of the state. People v. Cobb, 133 Cal., 74, 65 Pac. 325; Barton County v. Walser, 47 Mo. 189; State v. Wofford, 121 Mo. 61, 25 S. W. 851. Their function is governmental, and the service they render is a public service. It cannot be said that they serve alone the citizens of Omaha. Though their jurisdiction of the person is limited to the boundaries of Omaha, many persons throughout the county have opportunity to use these courts. They are courts which are instrumental in the enforcement of the criminal laws through - out the county, and have jurisdiction in amounts, in civil cases, up to $1,000. No doubt the Legislature considered that the service rendered by the municipal courts in civil cases lightened the work of the district and county courts; also that it would be of benefit to have the several courts accessible in one building." Since our court holds that such municipal courts are a branch of the general judicial system and part of the law enforcing machinery of the state, such holding appar - ently leans toward the Minnesota theory, that such courts are state courts, and the judges state officers. I am reluc - tant to so hold without a further and more specific decision from our court. However, in view of the fact that the makers of the Constitution were evidently trying to prevent legislators from legislating themselves into office, and were further endeavoring to discourage, if not </seg>

LEGISLATURE— COMPENSATION. r State is not liable for double compensation for a seat in the Legislature. The member appointed to succeed one who has resigned is entitled to pay proportionate to the time served. Hon. A. B. Thatcher, Chairman, Committee on Account*. Etc., lAncoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You presented to this department the following state of facts : A niemiier of the Legislature resigned ; a week after his resignation the newly apjtointed member took office and began his attendance in the session : the member, </seg>
            <seg id="p483">483 who resigned had been paid $250.00 and mileage, which purports to be about his pro rata compensation on the basis of $800.00 for the usual session; and the newly appointed member claims that he is entitled to the full compensation of $800.00 for the session together with the mileage. Section 7, of Article III, of the Constitution, provides "Senators and representatives shall each receive the sum of eight hundred dollars for attendance at each regular biennial session of the Legislature and ten cents per mile for each mile traveled in once going to and returning from the session." It is a well settled proposition of law that the salary ie attached to the office and apparent that the newly appointed member would not be entitled to any compensa - tion from the nource claimed except by virtue of his being a member of the Legislature. He was not appointed until Home time after the Legislature had been in session and hence could not be paid for attendance at the entire ses - sion, as was contemplated by this section of the Constitu - tion. It has been held in Coughlin r. McElroy, 74 Conn. .;97 : 50 Atl. 1025 : "Where an officer is entitled to compensation only for a part of a year and he makes a demand for the entire year, it has been held that his demand is good for the portion to which he is entitled." This would indicate that the officer would be entitled to a proj)ortionate part of the salary for the time for which Le has served. Inasmuch as the salary is appropriated for each seat in the legislature, as representing one office, it would seem that the legislature would have a right to make an appropriation of only $800.00 and mileage for each office or each seat in the Legislature. It cannot be supposed that it was ever intended that two salaries should be paid to the occupants of one seat in the Legislature, merely because one member has resigned his office during the session. It is also apparent that </seg>
            <seg id="p484">484 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL E member is entitled to compensation only for that por - a of the term which ho has actually served. We are refore of the opinion that whatever balance of the salary compensation for this seat, which remains unearned or •aid would jro to the newly appointed member. I It is probably true that the exact amount to which original member is entitled could not be ascertained a pro mta basis until the adjournment of the session of Legislature. At this time only could the number of the ;s of the session be ascertained and a true computation de. Inasmuch as the first member has been jmid a tain amount and mileage, we are of the opinion that any itroversy concerning this part of the compensation is not ore the Legislature, but must lte settled by the two ■sons, who have at different times held this office. If first member has I teen overpaid, it is possible that the ond member has the right to recover from him the ex - «. In no event, however, can we say that the state is L&gt;le twice for this compensation. Very truly yours, O. S. SPILLMAN, Attorney General. By LLOYD DORT, February 2.'», 1923.

            <seg id="p485">485 county attorneys in Douglas County, Nebraska, instead of six as apj&gt;ears by the record of Senate File No. 124, you are informed that I have made an examination of the en - grossed bill and the enrolled bill and also the House and Senate Journals. I find that there was evidently an error made in copying the enrolled bill. The original engrossed 1 bill, 8. P. 124, provides for eight deputy county attorneys. This bill after being passed by the Senate was sent to the House and the House amended Senate File No. 124 to provide for six deputy county attorneys, and after passing Senate File No. 124, ax amended, returned the same to the Senate. The Senate refused to concur in the amendment of the House and the bill was then referred to a joint committee. The joint committee reported that the House should recede from the amendment. The House receded from the amend - ment and passed the bill as originally provided for by the Senate. The enrolled bill, which was certified to by the officers of each branch of the Legislature, provided for six deputy county attorneys. The question now arises whether Douglas County should have six deputy county attorneys, eight deputy county attorneys, or whether the law which wax passed is without force and effect and Douglas county would be confined to the provisions of the former 'statute. Our supreme court has on numerous occasions held that the enrolled bill, authenticated by proj&gt;er officers of the House and approved by the Governor and filed with the Secretary of State, and the journals of the Houses are the official records of the proceedings of the Legislature relative to the enactment of the laws, and are the only comjietent evidence in a controversy in regard to the due passage of the bill, or in respect to alleged material errors in its substance.

Moore, 37 Neb. 13, where the general appropriation bill carrying an item of |15,000 for a sjiecific purjxwe was duly passed by both Houses of the Legislature, but by a clerical error of an enrolling clerk the $ 15,000 was changed to f 25,000, and the bill in this condition was presented to and signed by the presiding officers of the two Houses and approved by the Governor, the supreme court held: "It i.- now settled that this court will look into the record* and journals of the two houses of the Legislature to ascertain if they have complied with the constitutional provisions of the state with reference to the enactment of a law. When this is done, It becomes evident that the Senate did not at any time, nor did the House of Representatives upon the final considration of the bill, agree to an appropriation of $25,000, so that the act cannot be con - strued as an appropriation of this sum for want of concurrence of all the law-making branches. (State ex rel Marley v. Liedtke, 9 Neb. 462.) It is equally clear that both houses did concur in the appro - priation of $15,000. This appropriation must also fail, unless approved by the Governor, or by the bill's becoming: a law in one of the ways provided by the Constitution without his approval. The Governor, by signing the bill as enrolled, expressed his approval of an appro - priation of $25,000. We think that this sum being one greater than that provided by the Legislature, his approval thereof included an approval of the lesser sum. "In State ex rel Huff v. McLelland, supra, it was held that a bill creating the office of register of deeds for counties having not less than 15,000 inhabitants did not become a law because the enrolled bill as signed by the Governor expressed the number of inhabitants as 1,500 instead of 15,000. The error here was in a matter ol description, one essential to the merits of the bill, and the enrolled bill as signed was different in character from that passed by the Legislature. In this case, the error related to no matter of descrip - tion, and could not have influenced the Governor to approve the bill, when a correct enrollment would lead him to veto it. By giving the law this interpretation, we enforce the clearly expressed will of the people as manifested by their legislative officers. Any other conclu - sion would permit such clearly expressed will to be thwarted by the carelessness or dishonesty of a clerk in the enrolling room. It was to avoid this danger that this court adopted the doctrine that the enrolled act is only prima facie evidence of the enactment of a The al&gt;ove quoted case discusses a question similar to that presented by yon. </seg>
            <seg id="p487">487 The House Journals in regard to Semite File No. 124 affirmatively show that the bill, as originally ]&gt;assed by the Senate, was finally duly ]&gt;assed by the House, but that when the engrossed bill was enrolled an error was made wherein the enrolled bill provided for six deputy county attorneys instead of eight. The enrolled bill was pre - sented to and approved by the Governor. The Governor has given his approval to the law providing for six deputy county attorneys for Ikmglas county, but no more. We are Therefore of the opinion that, in view of the decisions of our supreme court upon this subject, the pro - vision of the statute as appears by the enrolled bill and approved by the Governor, limits the numlter of deputy county attorneys for your county to six, as provided for in the enrolled bill, instead of eight as was provided for in the engrossed bill, for the reason that the Governor never approved a law providing for a greater number than six.

            <seg id="p496">496 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. MOTOR VEHICLE— LENS. The Automobile Lens law does not act retroactively. Department of Public Works, Jiroirnell Building, Lincoln, Nebraska Gentlemen : You ask for a construction of that part of the motor vehicle law which requires lawful lenses ujkmi automobiles which pertains to the exception in the statute. The exception mentioned is that the owner of any automobile now in use in this state where the lens complied with the law prior to the enactment of the new law is not now re - quired to change the lens to conform to the new regula - tions so long as the automobile is in use in this state. I'lnm July 12th and July 26th, 1921, this department rendered two opinions concerning this question. In the opinion of July 12th, given to H. C. Williamson, Police Judge, Crete, Nebraska, the department ruled that the new law provided that the owner of any .automobile now in use in the state "shall not be required to change the lens thereon to conform to new regulations under this act, so long as the automobile is in use in the state, where the lens now complies with the present laws of the state.'' You will note this opinion was given before the new law went into effect and is in conformity with the wording of the law. Doubtless this exception in the statute causes more or less confusion, but this should be laid to the door of the Legislature and not to the construction of the law. Very truly yours, O. S.

If, however, the vehicle is converted into a truck the charge would 1m&gt; made in accordance with the statute, and would l&gt;e a minimum fee of Ten Dollars ($10.00) plus fifty cents additional for each one hundred pounds in excess of 2.000 pounds, baaed upon the weight of the truck or the car, if it is more than a seven passengei- r.

Any such bank located in the county may apply for the privilege of keeping such moneys, or any part there - of, upon the following conditions: All such deposits shall be subject to payment when demanded by the city treasurer on his check, and all banks receiving and holding such deposits shall pay interest thereon at a rate previously agreed upon as herein provided; and such deposits shall be subject to all regulation imposed by law or adopted by the city council for the receiving and holding thereof."

Dear Sh- in reply to your request for an opinion from thiR department uj&gt;on the construction of Section 44C&gt;9, Com - piled Statutes, 1922, which provides that cities may levy a sj)ecial tax of not more than li/o mills each year on the taxable pro|M&gt;rty to l&gt;e used only for the purjxwe of purchasing equipment for a fire department, you are informed that it is our opinion that this section of the statutes is directory and not mandatory. The language of the statute, "shall have jtower and authority to levy," indicates that the city may make the levy therein provided, but it is not required to make such a levy unless the city council would 1m&gt; inclined to include this levy within their estimate. Section 4144, Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides that u city council shall make an estimsite for the expenses necessary for the year, and Section 4142, Compiled Stat - utes, 1922. provides the amount of a general tax levy that may Ik* made in any one year. When such a tax is levied as provided in said Section 4469, it is the property of the city, held by the city treasurer and may only l»e used for the purpose of purchasing equipment or install - ing a fire alarm, or for the jwiyment of l&gt;onds which a city may issue for the purjwse of equipping a fire department, and could not be used by the city for any other purpose.

The latter part of this statute which provides for the approval of the city council wan evidently included in that section for the purpose of giving the city council the righr to determine whether or not the claim approved by the chief is for the maintenance and l&gt;enefit of such fire department.

This section formerly provided "within the corporate limits or within five miles," but in 1919 the law was amended by omitting the provisions (&gt;ertaininj: to the five - mile limit. In the case of Kmcstnr r. Chicago, li. d- (,&gt;. K. Co. 91 Neb. MM, IM X.

But that case was based ui&gt;on a statute giving the municipal authorities jurisdiction over an area extending the distance of one-fourth mile beyond the cor - jtorate limits. In the absence of statutory provisions therefor it is our opinion that a municipal corjioration has no power to regulate or abate any such nuisance situated beyond the corporate limits of such municipality, and that it is the duty of the county attorney to prosecute the necessary action or actions to abate such nuisance as exists outside of the corporate limits of such municipality. We are further of the opinion that any neighboring projterty owner j»eculiarly affected by a public nuisance may maintain an action for its abatenmet and that his right is not destroyed by a statute eni|»owering public prosecutors to institute actions for the abatement of a public nuisance. In .7 I'ouh mi/'* Equity Jui\xp&gt;u&lt;hiH( . page 42!)4, Section 1892, it is stated, in part: "It is a familiar principle of law that an individual cannot main - tain a suit to abate or to recover damages for a public nuisance unless he suffers some special damage different and other from that suffered by the rest of the community. Hence it follows that equity will not enjoin a public nuisance at the suit of an individual unless he has suffered or is likely to suffer such damage as would entitle him to maintain an action at law. 'Where the injury resulting from the nui - sance is, in its nature, irreparable, as when loss of health, loss of trade or destruction of the means of subsistence, or permanent ruin to property will ensue from the wrongful act or erection, courts of equity will interfere by injunction, in furtherance of justice and the violated rights of property.' " The case of Johnson v. V. D. Reduction Co. 164 Pac.

The latter part of this provision of the law is identical with the original Section 4409, under which the present magistrate was elected and qualified as such magistrate. Section BIS, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922. as amended, Session Laws, 1923, page 153, provides: "Vacancies occurring in the office of any police magistrate in cities where the unexpired term does not exceed one year shall be filled by appointment, but vacancies occurring in such office less than thirty days prior to any city election, and where the unexpired term exceeds two years, shall be filled by special election.

This statute does not authorize the county, however, to turn over to the Red Cross Association the funds for the employment of such nurse. She is employed by the county itself.

The occupation tax of domes - tic corporations is fixed by the amount of their capital stock, and the law requires foreign corporations to pay the same amount of occupation tax as required of domestic cor]&gt;orations. As a basis for computation of the tax, the tax is fixed proi&gt;ortionaU'ly uj»on the amount of capital stock o the coiqtoration. Even though assets of the corporation in this state are less in amount than the total capital stuck the corporation has back of it the entire capital stock Some basis is required ujkhi which to compute the occupa tion tax. The method designated has lieen selected by the Legislature and must rule as the method for computing the tax. It is an occupation tax and is in no sense a proj&gt;erty tax ui&gt;on the capital stock as such. This occupation tax is not designed to cover companies engaged solely in inter state commerce, but coven the right to do intrastate busl ness in this state. We recognize the fact that companies such as railroad companies having but a small i»ortion of mileage in this state, and doing intrastate commerce might not be required to pay a tax ii{&gt;on their entire capital stock. This position is tenable upon the ground of public jiolicy and an unreas - onable burdensome exercise of the taxation power in re - striction of interstate commerce.

We have examined your ordinance and find that Sec - tion 5 thereof provides for a criminal prosecution for the neglect and failure to pay such tax. It also provides that a civil suit may be had for the collection of the tax. In the case of Gennan-Ahirncan Fire Inn. Co. r. City of Miiuhtt. || Neb. 870, our supreme court held that the payment of such a tax could not l&gt;e required as a condi - tion precedent to doing business, nor can payment of a tax be enforced by punishing, criminally, jtersons who do busi - ness without first paying the tax : and further held that a city ordinance ini]&gt;osing such a tax cannot collect the same by means of a criminal action. In view of thut decision and subsequent decisions upon that ]M&gt;int of law, we are of the opinion that where the statute provides for the collection of such a tax it can be collected only in a civil suit.

A duly licensed physician or surgeon may employ the services of an assistant or attendant, provided the services of such assistant or attendant does not constitute the practice of medicine. At. G.

Dear Doctor : We have your recent favor inquiring if a duly licensed physician and surgeon has a '"right to use any oi-dinary person who haw not had medical training or who is no) registered as a nurse in this state or a licensed practitioner to assist him in major surgical oj»erations, or to give anaes - thetics when regular registered men are available," and in reply we direct your attention to Section 8161. Compiled Statutes of Xehraska for 1922, which provides: "No person shall practice medicine, surgery or obstetrics or any branch thereof in this state without first having applied for and ob - tained from the Department of Public Welfare, a license so to do." In the case of State Electro Medical Inxtitute r. State of XebrtiHka, 74 Neb. 4(1, the court defines the practice of medicine as follows : "The practice of medicine may be said to consist of three things; first, in judging the nature, character and symptoms of the disease; second, in determining a proper remedy for the disease; third, in giving or prescribing the application of the remedy to the disease." The court further said : "The qualification of a medical practitioner is personal to himself. The intention of the law is that one who undertakes to judge the nature of a disease or to determine the proper remedy therefor, or to apply the remedy must have certain personal qualifications, and if he does these things without having complied with the law he is subject to its penalties." In the case of State Electro Medical 1 iixtitute » Plainer, 74 Neb. 23, the court said: "The person who practices medicine, that is, who undertakes to judge the nature of disease, or to determine the proper remedy there - for, or to apply the remedy must have the necessary qualifications am) </seg>

A hospital which is controlled by a cor - poration and which receives patients and contracts to care for them, and to furnish them with medicinal attendance, does not by so doing practise medicine within the meaning of this act." In discussing the case of State r. Paul, 5(5 Neb. 369, the court said: "Dr. Bedell, who was the principal and presumably the one with whom the contract for treatment was entered into, was qualified and duly licensed under the statute. The defendant Paul was an assistant of Dr. Bedell, and, being not qualified and licensed to practice, he as - sumed to perform surgical operations and administer remedies to the sick and infirm. It was held that he was not protected by the qualifications and license of Dr. Bedell, although he acted as his assis - tant under his directions. The principle established by this decision is that the qualifications of one who practiced medicine are personal qualifications and that it is the one who actually performed the surgi - cal operation or administers the remedy that must be qualified and licensed under the statute." In view of the al&gt;ove quoted authorities, it is our opinion that a duly licensed physician may have the assistance of an attendant while ]terforniing a surgical operation provided that the attendant does not attempt to judge the nature, character and symptoms of the disease; second, to determine the pro]&gt;er remedy for the disease: third, attempt to prescril&gt;e or apply the remedy for the disease, hut that if such assistant or attendant undertakes io judge the nature of the disease, or to determine the proj&gt;er remedy therefor, or to apply the remedy, that the same constitutes, practice of medicine within the purview of Section 81(51, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 19122, and such p«m must have secured a license to practise medicine as provided by law, and if he does these things without having complied with the law, he is subject to its ] tenuities.

Hon. H. G. Taylor, Chairman, Xcbrrtxha Stutc Railway Commission. Lincoln, Nebr. Dear Sir: Your favor of the 17th instant, inquiring as to whether or not the jurisdiction of the State Railway Commission, as provided in Section 5406, Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska for 1922, authorizes the commission to prescribe the sizes of railway bridges over irrigation ditches, duly received. </seg>
            <seg id="p551">551 Section 5405, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, is ;ts follows: "Every railroad corporation shall maintain and keep in good repair all bridges, with their abutements, which such corporation shall con - struct for the purpose of enabling their road to pass over or under any turnpike, road, canal, water course or other way.' 1 This section is port of the Revised Statutes of 1866, and of course untedutes most irrigation works in thin state. It seems to cover bridges of all kinds. Section r&gt;40(i of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides as follows: '"It is hereby made the duty of every person, company or cor - poration operating a railroad in the State of Nebraska to so construct all bridges on its line of railway that every bridge over a running stream in this state shall have an opening below high water line whose area is sufficient to allow the free and unobstructed passage of the water of such running stream at extreme high water stage: Provided, if in the case of any given bridge satisfactory proof be made to the state railway commission that the dimensions herein prescribed are greater than are necessary to permit the unimpeded passage of the water under such bridge at high water, the commission may by order authorize the construction of such bridge with dimensions less than those prescribed in this section." It was enacted in 1911 after most irrigation project* now existing in Nebraska had been undertaken. The pur - pose of the sections seems to lx' to require railroad com - panies to provide adequate waterways over streams that ■M likely to overflow. It does not appear to apply to irrigation ditches, which, generally sjteiiking. are not the cause of damaging overflows. The language of the section separates those bridges over running streams from bridge* in general and puts those over running streams within the jurisdiction of the commission. This view of the purpose and meaning of the statute is borne out not only by the verbiage of the section itself, but aiso by other sections of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. Section 2739 provides that bridges over streams on roads on county lines shall be paid for equally by the two counties con - cerned. The supreme court has considered several times </seg>
            <seg id="p552">552 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL the meaning o fthe last mentioned section. In County of Dodge r. County of Sounders, 70 Neb. 442, it said, (pp. 452- "The word 'stream' which occurs in the statute has two distinct uses. The first and most important meaning of this word is 'A course of running water, a river, rivulet, or brook'. Century Dictionary. It is there also stated in connection with that definition, 'All rivers and brooks are streams and have currents'. Another and more techni - cal use of the word 'stream' is to distinguish the volume of water of a river, rivulet or brook, from the banks and bed; thus, as suggested in the former opinion herein, a river is said to consist of three parts: the bed, the bank and the stream." * * • It was, we think, rather in - tended that the statute should apply to bridges over rivers and, also, to bridges over smaller water courses that did not carry a sufficient volume of water to cause them to be denominated rivers. In this sta - tute, then, the legislature used the word in the sense of 'a course of running water, a river, rivulet or brook'; and if, as is well pointed out in the former opinion, the bank of a stream used in this sense is as much a part of the stream itself as is the bed of the volume of water which it carries, then the stream divides counties, since the boun - dary line lies in a part of the river." See also: Dmdge Comity r. Sounders County, 77 Neb. 787 Kirk t. State lion ni of Inif/ntioii, 90 Nob. 01 Jhurxon r. 1'helpx County, 94 Neb. 112 State ex rel r. Eichoff, ct &lt;?/, 98 Neb. 7:if) Wcxtern Pacific Ky. Co. r. Western Pacific Co. 151 Fed. 376 In all of these cases the word "stream" is treated :is describing ■ natural water course and in most of them aa synonymous with "water course." In Section N427, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, it is provided that the Department of Public Works shall measure the quantity of water flowing in the several stream* and make a record thereof for use in the considera- En of applications for- water appropriations. The section, course, would be meaningless if irrigation ditches were hided within the significance of the word "stream.'' ler sections of the statutes relating to irrigation and fer lights jMiint to the same conclusion. The distinction </seg>
            <seg id="p553">OPINIONS 553 between a "stream," and an "'irrigation ditch," or ••canal," seems to be fully determined by Sections 8412 and 8413. They read as follows: "Any canal constructed for the purpose of developing water power, or any other useful purpose, and from which water can be taken for irrigation, is hereby declared to be an 'irrigation canal' and all laws relating to irrigation canals shall be deemed applicable thereto." "The water appropriated from a river or stream shall not be turned or permitted to run into the waters or channel of any other river or stream than that from which it is taken or appropriated, unless such stream exceeds in width one hundred feet, in which event not more than seventy-five per cent of the regular flow shall be taken." A consideration of the authorities cited above coniiteLs ihe conclusion that the word "stream," as used in Section ,")40(i, does not include irrigation ditches or canals, that the Railway Commission is without jurisdiction to determine the sizes of the oj&gt;enings to l»e left beneath bridges over such ditches or canals, and that the complainant referred to in your letter will have to resort to the courts for the protection of his rights. It should not l&gt;e understood that the Railway Commis - sion is without jurisdiction where a bridge crosses such a ditch or canal if the service of the carrier to the public is affected. In such case the Railway Commission has juris - diction to protect the service. -^ Very truly yours, O. S. SPILLMAX. Attorney General. By HUGH LA MASTER, ■ixsixtant Attorney General.

Namldll, (}ommi**ioHer, Xebraxkii State Railiray Conunixxion, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your inquiry as to what kind of a fence a railroad coiujxiny is required to build along its lines, I have this to say. The fence must l»e of such construc - tion M to In* suitable and amply sufficient to prevent cattle, horses, sheep and hop* from getting on such rail - road, except at public crossings and within the limits of municipalities. The matter is regulated by Section 5396, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1{)£2. being Article (5, of Chapter 50, on Railroads which reads as follows: "Every railroad corporation, whose lines of road or any part there - of are open for use, and every railroad company formed or to be formed, but whose lines are not now open for use, shall, within six months after the lines of such railroad or any part thereof are open, erect and thereafter maintain fences on the sides of their railroad, or the part thereof so open for use, suitable and amply sufficient to prevent cattle, horses, sheep and hogs from getting on such railroad, except at the crossings of public roads and highways, and within the limits of towns, cities and villages, with opens, gates or bars at all the farm crossings of such railroads for the use of the proprietors of the lands adjoining such railroad. They shall also construct, where the same has not already been done, and hereafter maintain, at all road crossings now existing or hereafter established, cattle guards suitable and suf - ficient to prevent cattle, horses, sheep and hogs from getting onto such railroad. So long &lt;"= such fences and cattle guards shall not be made after the time hereinbefore prescribed for making the same shall have elapsed, and when such fences and guards, or any part thereof, are not in sufficiently good repair to accomplish the objects for which the same as herein prescribed are intended, such railroad corporation and its agents shall be liable for any and all damages which shall be done by the agents, engines or trains of any such corporation, or by the locomotives, engines, or trains of any other corporations permitted and running over or upon their said railroad, to any cattle, horses, sheep or hogs thereon. When such fences and guards have been fully and duly made, and shall be kept in good and sufficient repair, such rail - road corporation shall not be liable for any such damages, unless neg- </seg>
            <seg id="p555">555 Hgently or wilfully done: Provided, however, any person, company, or corporation, owning land adjoining the right of way of any railroad company in this state, and not within the limits of any town, village or city, and intending to enclose his or their land, or any part thereof that adjoins such right of way or railroad, with a fence, or the secretary of such company, or corporation, by direction thereof, may notify in writing such railroad company of such intention, and request such railroad company to build a lawful fence as described in this section on the line between their railroad and the land intended to be en - closed. Such notice shall definitely specify two points on such line between which points such fence is requested to be erected, and des - cribe the field intended to be enclosed. The railroad company shall, within six months after receiving such notice, cause to be erected the fence required by such notice, and in case of a failure so to do, the party so giving notice as aforesaid may cause such fence to be erected at a reasonable cost, and collect the amount thereof from the railroad company so neglecting to erect the fence." (See C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. v. James, 26 Neb. 188; C. B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co. v. Lyon, 50 Neb. 640 Degraw v. C. B. &amp; Q; 101 Neb. 724 which interpret the foregoing section.) The parry writing you in regard to this matter seem* to wish the company to build a woven wire fence sufficient to prevent the classes of animals sjtecified, from going on the track. 1 think that that cannot be required, but doubt - less woven wire of sufficient height to prevent hogs and sheep from going on the track might be required or in lieu thereof, barb wire or other material of such height, with barb wire placed still higher to prevent cattle and horses from getting on to the railroad 1 . I note that the railroad company asks that the land owner agree to keep up the fence j&gt;erpetually and to waive ell claims for damages that may accrue hereafter. The company can make no such requirements and he ought not sign such an agreement. The State Railway Commission has no jurisdiction to prescribe the kind of fence that shall be built nor of other matters connected with the building thereof. Very truly yours, Attorney General.

Curt ins, Secretary, Xcbraxka State Railiruy Commixxion Lincoln, Xcbraxku. I)eiir Sir: 1 have examined the question submitted by you, at the instance of the State Railway Commission, involving the jurisdiction of the commission to hear the complaint of the North River Irrigation District against the Union Pacific Railroad Company. The complaint alleges, in brief, that the defendant railroad company has built its lines in such a May as to obstruct the canals and ditches of the irrigation district. It prays thait the defendant may l&gt;e required to construct and maintain canals and laterals across its tracks and right-of-way at such places as the same previously existed and to cease and desist from obstructing the flow of water through such canals and laterals. No question of service is involved, nor is there any question of the suffi - ciency of the track of the defendant coni]&gt;any for the ]&gt;er - fonnance of its duties as a common carrier. The defendant objects to the jurisdiction of the commission. A brief was filed by each jmrty. Jurisdiction of the State Railway Commission over irrigation works is granted by Section 8477, Compiled Stat - utes of Nebraska for 1922, which is as follows: "Irrigation works constructed under the laws of this state are hereby declared to be common carriers. The owner or operator of any works for the storage, carriage or diversion of water, except irriga - tion districts, shall deliver all water legally appropriated to the parties entitled thereto, at a reasonable rate, to be fixed by the state railway commission." And by Sections 16 and 17, Division 1, Article V, Chapter 100. Laws of 1919, (being substantially the same </seg>
            <seg id="p557">557 as Sections 3:iS4 ami XiSTt of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for IMS) which ir a.* follows: "Every person managing, owning or controlling any irrigation works for the storage, carriage or diversion of water, except irriga - tion districts, shall keep its headgate.s, diversion dams, canals and laterals in reasonable and pioper repair for the delivery and divers-ion of water to the appropriators under its canal, and the regulation there - of shall be under the control and direction of the state railway com- ion. "The penalties provided for the violation of the rules, regulation. - r.nd orders of the state railway commission in matters relating to com - mon carriers, shall be in force as the rules and regulations with ref - erence to this article." It lias been determined that under the constitutional provision alone the power of the Railway Commission may not lie invoked when the question involves the duties of a railroad company not conneeted with its services as u common carrier. In the case of Ttm &lt;'., /»'. /. »(• /'. A'y- Co. r. XebniMkti State Railwttf Connnisxioii, 88 Neb. 'S.IU, and (on motion for rehearing I 88 Nel&gt;. N."&gt;:l, the lowers of the commission were held to We limited to matters involving unties of common curriers as such. Therefore, if the commission has jurisdiction to deter - line questions covering the rights of individuals to rail- road companies the authority must necessarily he found in the statutory provisions. Section N477 provide* nothing farther than that the Railway Commission shall fix the rates for irrigation votka, It dot's not MBtBoriac the commission 10 enter any order concerning the maintenance of irrigation works. Section X\Si of hi' laws of l!tl!». cited above, reads as follows: "Every corporation or person managing, owning or controllintr any irrigation works for the storage, carriage or diversion of water, except irrigation districts, shall keep its headgates, diversion dams, canals and laterals in reasonable and proper repair for the delivery an i diversion of water to the appropriators under its canal, and the regu - lation thereof shall be under the control and direction of the state rail - way commission." </seg>
            <seg id="p558">558 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL T'uder that section it is made the duty of the Railway* f 'oiniiiission to determine the conditions of the irrigation works and provide suitable orders for proper maintenance. There is nothing that would justify the commission in mak - ing any order concerning a tres[&gt;asser. This view is strengthened by the fact that in Ml, Chapter 258) Laws of ItSl, the Legislature repealed the former law, which gave the State Railway &lt; 'oniniissioii power to regulate the rates, service and general control of all irrigation works constructed and operated under the laws of this state except the work of irrigation districts. The section just referred to appeared as Section :\'.\$'2, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for IMS. It must, therefore. In* considered as settled that the State Railway Commission does not exer - cise jurisdiction over matters involving trespassing on irrigation works. The authorities cited by the complainant have also lieen examined. Several setcions of the statute are cited, but none of them seems to affect the force of the statutory provisions quoted altove. The cases of Sherman County I inflation. Etc. Co. r. Ihukt, vt al, 65 Neb. (&gt;!)», and Fremont E. d- M. V. It. Co. r. fiat/ton, 67 Neb. _*&lt;&gt;:?, are relied upon. In the former case it appeared that the Slier man County Irrigation Company owned an irrigation project in that county, which was used during the years IBM and 1S!I7. In the latter year, owing *o very heavy rains, it was heavily damaged and later it became filled with sand ami overgrown with weeds. It as claimed that there was an abandonment of the project. In UM the defendant Drake recovered a judgment at lav against the company and levied execution thereunder upon a flume and a part of the right-of-way upon which it was situated. The company thereupon instituted the action to enjoin enforcement of the execution. The trial court found that the company was insolvent, that it had abandoned the intention of completing its canal over that part of its right-of-way levied upon and dismissed the case. The supreme court reversed the decision upon the ground that </seg>
            <seg id="p559">OPINIONS 559 it was improper to levy an execution upon the property of a public service corporation. Then- appears to be nothing in the case at all related 10 the present controversy; certainly nothing would indi - cate that the Railway Commission would have jurisdiction in such matters. In the second case cited above the facts briefly stated were these: The Sioux City &amp; Pacific Railway company owned certain land under grant from the federal govern - ment. It constructed a railroad over the land in so doing built an embankment, dug certain ditches and put in bridges and culverts. After constructing the railroad it conveyed the land to the Union Pacific Railroad Company, reserving a right-of-way across that ]H&gt;rtion of the land occupied by its road. Subsequently, the Union Pacific conveyed the land to Gayton, lessor of the plaintiff, sub - ject to said right-of-way. Thereafter, the Fremont, Elkhorn and Missouri Valley Railroad company operated the road. Surface water, collected in ditches along the track, was discharged through the ditches in such manner as to injure the crops of the plaintiff. Plaintiff claimed that the bridges, embankment and ditches were so negligently con - structed that quantities of surface water were collected and discharged on his field in a body. The defendants ] (leaded that there had been no change in conditions since The road was first constructed. At the trial an instruction was requested to the effect that if at the time the road was built and the embankment, bridges, ditches, etc., were constructed the Sioux City &amp; Pacific Railroad Compan,-. - was the owner of the whole track and that if such bridges, etc., were in the same condition in 1908, at the time of the destruction of plaintiffs crop, as when they were built and constructed and at the time the land was conveyed to plaintiffs lessor, then he could not recover. The refusal of this instruction was held by the supreme court to 1* error and the discussion of the court turns entirely upon i hat question. There is nothing in the decision or in the </seg>

Both of the above cases were decided before the adop - tion of the amendment creating the State Railway Commis - sion, and, of course, cannot relate to its jtowers.

Curlixx, Secretary, \ebraxka Stale Kaihruy Coinmixxion, Lincoln, Xebraxka. Dear Sir: I have given attention to your inquiry of November 28, in regard to the complaint of Mr. .1. C. Rauth and Mr. J. Herman Rauth against the Murdock Municipal Light Com - pany of M unlock, Nebraska. The complaint filed with the Railway Commission is very brief, containing no statement of facts on which it is based, but the complainants apj&gt;eared personally and made oral statements, the principal facts as detailed by them l»eing as follows: Complainants are fanners, living near Murdock, but outside the village, having land adjoining a public highway, </seg>
            <seg id="p561">OPINIONS 561 on which there is an electric transmission line owned by the village. They applied to the village for connection with the transmission line and for the supplying of electricity to them. A verbal contract was entered into between the complainants and the village, whereby it agreed to make connection and install the necessary transformer, wiring, etc., with which to furnish complainants service, for about f(SOO. The sum agreed ujkhi was duly paid by complainants and installation was made. Nothing was said at the time the contract was entered into about maintenance. The complainants live only a short distance •part so that one transformer answers for Inith their resi dences. The lines were in use for some time during which a few minor repairs were necessary, which the village made without charge. Several months ago the transformer was injured by lightning so that repairs are now necessary, which will cost about ?7."&gt;. No current has liei*n furnished since the transformer was damaged. The complainants asked the village to make the necessary repairs and restore service, which it declined to do. It also declined to make payment in case the complainants should have the transformer repaired. No application for the fixing of rates, charges, etc., was made either by the village or by the complainants as might have been done under Section 1, Chapter 170, Laws of Nebraska for 1!)2;&gt;, page 403. The complaint presents two questions under the law just mentioned. 1. Has the Nebraska State Railway Commission authority to adjudicate controversies arising out of past transactions? 2. Is the village of Murdock liable for the expense of making repairs? Both questions should l&gt;e answered negatively. 1. Section 1 of the act rebating to transmission line* alx)ve cited is as follows: </seg>
            <seg id="p562">562 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL "All persons, associations, companies and corporations engaged in the generating and transmitting of electric current for sale in the state for power or other purposes, where the said person, association, com - pany or corporation operates an electric transmission line outside of the limits of incorporated cities or villages in this state, and between incorporated cities and villages in this state shall, under rates, charges, rules, regulations, permits, conditions and authority to be made, pre - scribed and granted by the Nebraska State Railway Commission, fur - nish facilities, accomodations and service upon application for physical connection to: (a) Any individual or any person who may reside along or im - mediately adjacent to such an electric transmission line who may apply for physical connection and service. (b) Any association or corporation which may be formed for the purpose of building its own line with facilities and equipment and which may apply for physical connection and service from such high powered electric transmission line and thereby transmit electric cur - rent for its own use or general purchase and sale. (c) Any municipal corporation which may construct or acquire its own lines which may apply for such physical connection and ser - vice from such electric transmission line, which may be constructed to or pass by or through said city or village. (d) Any such other person, association or corporation possessing by ownership or lease lines equipped for the transmission of elec - trict current for its own use or general purchase or sale which may apply for physical connection and service." The section appear* to contemplate application by the owner of the transmission line to the coninriwdon, to secure the fixation of rates and chsuges and the making of rules and regulations, prior to rendering service; indicating that Ihe functions of the commission are purely legislative. The subject is not free front doubt, but the Legislature apparently intended to invest the coninuission with legisla - tive power rather than with judicial power. In the absence of a statute authorizing the commission to award reparations it has, of course, no |&gt;ower to determine such matters. The statute giving the commission authority to si ward reparations as passed by the Legislature of 1921, l&gt;eing Chapter 229. Laws of Nebraska 1919-1921, page S20. refers only to railroads and express companies. </seg>
            <seg id="p563">OPINIONS 563 It seems, thi-efore. that the commission ha* no jtower :&gt;&gt; determine who is liable, under the contract, to maiit - taia the ]&gt;ro]K'rtv. 2. Section 2 of tin* act is as follows: "Sec 2. That whenever any customer or applicant of any of th» classes hereinbefore named shall make application for such physical connection and service, the customer shall provide himself with ami bear the expense of necessary line, poles, transformers and other equipment required to make such physical connection and receive such service. Provided, that if the said electric transmission or power company and the customer cannot agree upon what may be just and equitable as the fee for making the said physical connection with said line, or the customer shall allege that the said electric transmission or power company is not treating all persons, associations or corporations fairly and equally and without discrimination or favoritism, or if such per - son, association or corporation shall feel dissatisfied with or aggrieved by reason of the amount required to be paid or contributed for making the said physical connection and receipt of such service, said person, association or corporation may file his or its application with the Ne - braska State Railway Commission which shall proceed to make inves - tigation ami to hold any necessary hearings and make a finding and order as to what would be the proper, just and equitable fee for making such physical connection with said electric transmission line." This section requires the customer not only to pay the cost of installation, lmt also to provide the equipment to "receive such service." The obligation api&gt;ears to 1m- a continuing one. This view is consistent with the latter part of the section which enumerates the kinds of jrriev - ances the commission may he called on to decide, lmt is silent as to maintenance ex]*»nses. The e.\]&gt;enditures for installation vary M greatly that it would l&gt;e unfair to make a flat installation charge. The outlays for maintenance vary pro|&gt;ortionately so that the same reason obtains for requiring the customer to pay the latter as to pay the former. Tt is thi-iefore concluded that the complainants cannot comjH'l the village to repair the transformer.

            <seg id="p565">OPINIONS 565 The language of the Act of 1915 is general and might l&gt;e taken to include Transmission linen within incorjH&gt;rated villages, particularly as metropolitan cities and cities of the first or second class are excepted, while tillages are not excepted.

RE-APPOINTMENT— COURT REPORTER A court reporter is such a public officer as to hold his office after the death of the judge of the division of the district court in which he is appointed. His right to the office continues until removed </seg>
            <seg id="p568">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 568 by act of the appointing power or his successor is appointed by law and qualifies. As the incumbent he is entitled to the com - pensation of the office. Hon. (icoryc \V. Marsh, Stale Auditor, Lincoln, Xcbraska. Dear Sir: You inquire of us whether or not Mr. Minor Bacon, court reporter of the district court of Lancaster County, Nebraska, in the division of the late Judge Morning is en - titled to compensation for the period of time after Judge Morning's assassination to the time that he is reappointed by the succeeding judge. In considering this proposition we find that Mr. Bacon was appointed pursuant to the order of the court as it appears in court journal 83, page 277, as follows: "In re Appointment of Minor S. Bacon, court reporter. KNOW ALL MEN BY THESE PRESENTS: That I, Wm. M. Morning, Judge of the District Court in and for Lancaster County do hereby appoint Minor S. Bacon for the term of four years, beginning January 6th, A. D. 1921, to do and perform the duties of my official stenographic reporter; imposed upon such officer by law. Dated at Lincoln, Nebraska, this 30th day of Dec. A. D. 1920. (Signed) Wm. M. Morning, Judge of the District Court, Third Judicial District of Nebraska." Mr. Bacon has been acting under said appointment ever since same was made. He was appointed by virtue of the authority of the law as provided by Section 1119, Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, which provides that a sten - ographic reporter shall l&gt;e appointed for each of the judicial districts of this state, and that such reporter shall not be al - lowed to practice law in the district court and that he may have a deputy. Section 1120, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, pro - vides that the reporter Rhall take the oath required to bo </seg>
            <seg id="p569">OPINIONS 569 taken by judicial officers, shall hold his office during the pleasure of the district judge and shall receive an annual salary to l&gt;e paid by the state as the salary of other officers is paid. It is to be noted that he is referred to as an officer and that he is required to take an oath of office. Section 1122, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, re - quires him to keep and maintain an office in the district and to keep in his custody all stenographic reports made hy him, which shall be the property of the state, and upon the termination of his office, the said reporter shall deliver the same to his successor in office. Section 112.3, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1022, indicates that his service extends beyond the mere taking of testimony in the trial of cases. He is acting in his official capacity in transcribing his notes, in preparation of Bills of Exceptions, etc. He is subject to the call of the district court of Lancaster County, Nebraska, during his term of office. We do not know but we take it for granted thar Mr. Hacon has been performing all the duties pertaining to his official position since Judge Morning's death until the time he has l&gt;een re-appointed by Judge Frost. We do not find anywhere in the statutes a provision 'hat there shall l&gt;e any vacancy in the office of stenographic reporter on account of the death of the judge. In fact the appointment is for the term of the office of the judge who makes the appointment, unless for cause the reporter is sooner removed at the pleasure of the judge. Mr. Bacon has at no time been removed from the office by the act of any judge or any acts of the court of Lancaster County, Nebras - ka, and we believe that once being lawfully appointed he would hold his official position until removed. When the successor to Judge Morning was appointed and assumed his office we presume that such successor would have the right to terminate the appointment of Mr. Bacon and appoint any one he saw fit as his successor. It also seems that the Legis - lature has appropriated the salary for the full term. It is a well settled proposition of law that the incumbent of an office is entitled to the salary where same has been ap- </seg>
            <seg id="p570">570 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL propitiated. We believe this is applicable to the present ease, and ho long as Mr. Bacon was the incumbent of the office that he would lae entitled to the compensation. The employment is not one per diem, but his salary is payable in the same manner as that paid by the state to other officers. We believe the statutes are sufficient to settle the status of this matter, but in addition thereto we call your attention to 11 Cyc. 720, where it is stated: "Such stenographer is an official of the court and must act under its directions, and is subject to its control." Also 11 Cyc. 721, states: "And the statutory compensation will rule whether it will be a per diem allowance to be fixed by the court or an annual salary." We also call your attention to 15 C. J. 871, where it holds : •"The Legislature may provide for ministerial offices with power to perform ministerial duties necessary in the administration of the law, and it is proper that the power to appoint such officers should be dele - gated to the courts. * * * The resignation of the judge does not, however, arrest the ministerial proceedings of subordinate court offi - cers, but such officer may continue to perform their legal duties until a successor is appointed." (Citing Maskell v. Horner, 10 La. Ann. 641.) We, therefore, conclude that under the wording of our statutes Mr. Bacon is an officer appointed for a definite term, for which term he would hold office unless sooner removed by the district judge. He has not caused any vacancy to occur in his office and he has not been removed. The Legislature has fixed his salary as an annual salary, payable as the salary of other officers. He is the incumbent of the office and in our opinion is entitled to recover the full amount of the salary appropriated for that office during the period of time which he has occupied the same and dur - ing the future time within which he shall be the incumbent of the office.

Section 2244, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides that the county boaiil may fill the vacancy, but does not state for how long the appointment may continue. There is no conflict l»etween these two sections, as the term of office of the new ap]K&gt;intee is limited by Section 2245.

Sir: We have examined the constitutional provisions and sections of the statute ]&gt;ertaininj; to the jrrantiiifj of re - prieves, and have come to the conclusion that Your Excel - lency in exercising the duties of your office is empowered to grunt a reprieve to the next meeting of the Hoard of Pardons, but at no time for a ]&gt;eriod exceeding thirty days. Tt is further our opinion that Your Excellency can gram reprieves except in cases of treason. We have particularly considered Section i:{ of Article IV, of the Constitution, together with 20 R. C. L. 527, 528. The latter authority states : "The power to respite necessarily carries with it the power to fix another and later day for the execution of the death sentence, since the respite is nothing more than a suspension of the sentence until its own expiration. The subsequent execution takes place, not by vir - tue of a new sentence, but by reason of the expiration of the tempor - ary suspension of the original sentence which was caused by the respite. Therefore where the execution of the sentence is respited by the governor until a particular day, it is the duty of the sheriff to (&gt;. S. KIMLLMAX. </seg>

In accordance with the foregoing, we have prepared and submit herewith for such action as you may desire under the showing made a form of reprieve directed to the Warden of the State Penitentiary.

A road district is a subdivision made by the County 15onrd for the pui*]K&gt;se of keeping up the roads of the county. Strictly speaking we do not lx&gt;lieve the road district comes within the definition of a precinct, town - ship, city or village, which would have a right to vote bonds or make a levy by way of a sj»ecial election to take care of the Matter you mention. Section .'BO, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides that a precinct or township may issue ImhkIs for internal improvements to an amount not exceeding ten per cent of the assessed value, this Hind to l»e limited for improving the highways. This does not seem to include a road district as such, and inasmuch as we find no provision for a road district to lake the action you suggest, we l»elieve that it cannot be done.

The salary to which you are entitled as deputy clerk of the dis - trict court is covered by the provisions of Section 2369, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922. Toward the end of this section one of the provisions states that the clerk is en - titled to compensation in the sum of $3,000 in counties of less than 16,000 inhabitants, and if the fees exceed $2,000 in counties having more than 16,000 and less than 18,000. These provisions are in case the fees of the clerk exceed $2, - 000, and this indicates that the compensation will reach $2,000 only in the event the office earns that much or more in fees. The part of the section pertaining to the deputy pro - vides that if the clerk of the district court thinks necessary, O. g. SPILLMAN </seg>

Inasmuch as no sum is fixed for a deputy, it would be our opinion that the compensation would be entirely a matter of contract, and if it is agreed to receive less compensation lhan one-half the salary of the clerk, that such agreement would be binding, and that the deputy could recover no more than the agreed compensation, and in no event to re - ceive more than the maximum fixed by the statute.

It is also apparent the board would have a right to expend the money of the district for legal notices which are required in the business of the district and so required by law. If the officers should expend the money of the district for pur] tones other than school fmtftmm so that the money would Ite lost to the district, it would Ik' very probable they would be held guilty of the crime of einltezzlement under the law applicable to this crime.

Dear Sir: , i In reply to your favor of the 25th instant inquiring if a school board should furnish school l&gt;ooks for your chil - dren while attending a j&gt;arochial school, you are informed that Section &lt;»4!W, Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides: "District school boards and boards of trustees of high school dis - tricts, and boards of education in cities of the first and second class • * * are hereby empowered and it is made their duty to furnish all text books necessary for the schools of such district." * • • And Section 650(5, provides: "All books purchased by district boards, as hereinbefore men - tioned, shall be held as the property of the district and loaned to pupils of the school district while pursuing a course of study therein free of charge, but the district boards shall hold such pupils respon - sible for any damage to, loss of, or failure to return such books at the time and to the person that may be designated by the board of such district." We are of the opinion that the officers of a school district, as' such, has no authority to furnish school books to pupils attending any schools, except the school of which such officers constitutes the school board. As a resident and tax payer of your school district you have the right and privilege of sending your children to the public school and it is imperative that such school boai-d furnish your children with the necessary school books while they attend the public school.

It provides that the Board of Educa - tion of every school district in which is included a city or village may in its discretion permit the use of public school buildings for public assemblages under such rules and regu - lations as it may adopt. It also provides that the electors at any annual meeting in any rural school district may by resolution adopt rules and regulations for the use of the school building. In case no rules or regulations are adopted at the annual meeting the rules and regulations are then prescribed by the district board. The board of education may fix the rental unless such rental has been fixed by reso - lution at the annual school meeting.

You state thai they are not exacting to advertise for bids on these contracts, and you inquire whether or not the school board should advertise for letting of the contracts on material iind labor. Our Supreme Court in the case of Mizent r.

In this case the building com mittee wa-s instructed to advertise for bids for building the school house. The question involved in the case, however, was the t»xtent of the authority of the building committee, but we merely desire to call to your attention that in this case the bids were let by advertising. Section &lt;»284, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, pro - vides for raising of funds for building a school house, and in part of the section it is provided as follows: "The provisions of Sections 75, 76, 77 and 78 of Chapter 8 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, relating to special funds for erection of court houses shall apply as far as practicable to the procedure under this section, the school board or district trustees having power to con - tract for the erection of the proposed building under the same restrictions as the county board in the case of the erection of a court house and any residue of such tax going into the school district gen - eral fund."

We believe that the only safe plan is to advertise for bids and give the school district the bene - fit of such procedure. While we cannot say there is any special provisional law requiring it, yet this seems to be the proper thing to do. This would not of course apply if the school district intends to do the work itself through the dis - trict board and supervise the work so that no independent i-ontractor is making a profit upon the contract itself, but E profits derived by others than those on the board or ors of the district, are derived merely from the labor ormed and material furnished.

Dear Miss Marsh: You state that the moderator and treasurer of .7 school district employed a teacher, and it was afterwards learned that this teacher is related to the Moderator of flu - school district within the fourth dejrive, and you inquire if the school district may legally pay the salary of sucli school teacher. Section 014, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 102:1, provides : "The director, with the consent and advice of the moderator and treasurer or one of them, or under their direction, if he shall not con - cur, shall contract with and hire qualified teachers for and in the name of the school district, which contract shall be in writing an-I shall have the consent of the moderator and treasurer, or one of them, endorsed thereon and shall specify the wages per week or month as agreed by the parties, and the duplicate thereof shall be filed in his office; • * * No money belonging to the district shall be paid for teaching to any but legally qualified teachers. • • PROVIDED, O.

It appears from said section that the director of a school district board with the consent and advice of another member of such school district board may employ a school teacher, who is related in the fourth degree to the third number of such school district board, and that any two members of a school district board may employ a teacher related within the fourth degree to the third niein - l&gt;er of such board, who is not a member nor a i»arty to the contract of employment of such school teacher. From the above section and after an examination of similar statutes of other states on the subject, while th&lt; question is not entirely free from doubt, it is my opinion that the moderator and treasurer of a school district boart cannot legally employ a school teacher related withii the fourth degree to either the moderator or treasurer, or to pay said teacher money belonging to the district unless and until such contract of employment is agreed to by the other member of said l&gt;oard or by two niemlirrs of such board, who are not related in the fourth degree to such teacher. Should the member, who has not agreed to the said contract, agree to same, even after said teacher ha* started to teach, and should the district pay her wages after said ratification, it is my opinion that a court would sustain the payment of wages under such circumstance* In the case of Gaientine v. District Tp. of Washington, Carroll County, 82 &gt;\ W. 993, the court said: "Where a teacher was employed by a subdirector of a sub-district of a township, with knowledge by both the teacher and subdirector that the township board of directors had by resolution refused to employ her, she cannot recover against the township for her services." The general rule seems to be set forth in 24 R. C. L., page 72, in which it was said : "Where a statute regulates the method of approving and making the contract, it must be followed, or the resulting contract will be il- </seg>

But where a contract is informally made with a teacher with - a board meeting, the board may later ratify such constract, and the ratification is equivalent to a full compliance with the necessary formalities, and when so done renders the contract valid from its in - ception. The silent acquiescence by the board in the performance of the contract by the teacher and the payment of compensation in accor - dance therewith has been held to constitute ratification."

I niifjht add that if it is not turned into the general fund at the expiration, of any one year, but is mingled with the free high school fund for the succeeding year, no great injustice will be done, for at the end of that year, the amount remaining after all claims against the fund are paid will l»e turned into the general fund and the final result will be practically the same.

"Whether it is prudent of politic to permit Bible reading in the public schools is a question for the school authorities, but whether the practice of Bible reading has taken the form of sectarian instruction is a question for the courts to determine upon evidence." In the same case the court held that : "Exercises by a teacher in a public school in a school building, in school hours, and in the presence of the pupils, consisting of the reading of passages from the Bible, and in the singing of songs and hymns, and offering prayer to the Deity in accordance with the doc - trines, beliefs, customs or usages of sectarian churches or religious or - ganizations, is forbidden by the constitution of this state."

The supreme court of Kansas has held : "A public-school teacher, who for the purpose of quieting the pupils and preparing them for their regular studies, repeats the Lord's Prayer and the Twenty-third Psalm as a morning exercises, without comment or remark, in which the pupils are not required to partici - pate, is not conducting a form of religious worship or teaching sec - tarian or religious doctrine." (Billiard v. Board of Education, 69 Kalis 68.) Similarly the supreme court of Kentucky has held that the use of the Bible * * * "when used merely by reading in the common schools, without eor comment by teachers, is not sectarian instruction, nor does use of the Bible make the schoolhou.se a house of religious wor - " (Hackett v.

Dear Sir: You inquire whether Section 4, of Chapter 63, Session Laws of Nebraska, 1923, which amends Section 6241, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, applies to other dis - tricts rather than rural districts. The writer has no recollection of having given an opinion ujton this subject as mentioned in your recent letter. Neither Mr. Ayres or Mr. Basyc recall having given an opinion on this subject. However, we find that Section 6241, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, has been carried through the statutes as a statute applying to school districts in general, and applying to changes in boundaries in all school districts. Section (5241 was called in question in the case of Proudfit r. School District So. .[!&gt;, 190 N. W. 874. The district involved in this &lt;ase was a district comprising the district of Orchard and Ihe school district lying adjacent thereto.

            <seg id="p619">OPINIONS 619 inquiry is whether or not the change of the boundaries, taking in certain contiguous territory of another district, ipso facto makes the annexed territory a part of the school district of Dakota City, or whether some other action is required. We are assuming that the annexation proceedings were in accord with law and that the territory was legally an - nexed. Ui»on this assumption, we call to your attention Section 6582, Compiled Statutes. l!)l'l ( , which provides: "The territory embraced within the corporate limits of each incor - porated city or village in the state of Nebraska, or those hereafter in - corporated as such (together with such additional territory and addi - tions to such city or village as may be added thereto), as declared by ordinances to be boundaries of such city or village, having a population of more than one thousand inhabitants, including such adjacent terri - tory as now is or hereafter may be attached for school purposes, shall constitute one school district, etc." This section of itself indicates that the annexation ipm facto makes the annexed territory a part of the city district, without further action. The legislature undoubt - edly intended that if there was any objection raised to the annexation proceedings for school purjtoses or otherwise, much objection should l&gt;e taken MM of in the proceeding* relative to annexation. We are further convinced of the correctness of our position by a recital in the seventh sulMlivision of Section 0241, Compiled Statutes, ld'2'2, which provides: "When a district is reduced in size by the annexation of a part of its territory to a city district, as provided by law, or when a portion of a district is cut off from school privileges by a river changing its channel, so that such part remaining after such annexation or the portion so cut off by change of a river channel shall contain less than two sections of land and fewer than twenty persons of school age, the county superintendent shall have authority and it shall be his duty to attach such remainder or portion to adjoining districts." This contemplates that a jiortion of the territory of the district may be lost by annexation to a city district.

The district to which he was transferred has voted an eight mill levy after the transfer to establish a fund with which to erect a high school building. At the election to vote the tax he was not ]termitted to vote. He finds now that the eight mill tax has liecn entered against his real estate. The question is whether or not his property is liable for this tax. In answer to your question, 1 will say that Section 6524 provides among other things: "When such transfer shall have been made, the children continue to have school privileges in the adjoining district until their parents or guardians shall ,in writing, notify the county superintendent of their ilesire to be again transferred to the district of their residence or shall remove from said real estate: in either event, the county superintendent shall notify the county clerk of such re-trans - fer, and the taxes of the parent or guardian and the real estate shall again be placed in the district of their residence PROVIDED, further, the parents or guardians of the pupils so transferred shall have the right to vote in the district to which such pupils are transferred on all school matters except that of issuing bonds." It seems from the above quotation that according to the strict reading of the law, the pn&gt;i&gt;erty of this jtarty Is chargeable with the building fund tax and if also ap|&gt;ears (hat he should have been permitted to vote at the meeting at which the tax wa,s voted. In the absence of any court decision or of a ruling by the State Superintendent to the contrary, it is the opinion of this department that the tax against his pnpMtj is valid. It will be observed that under the law as above quoted, the transfer having been made, his children will continue to enjoy school privileges in the district to which he was transferred so long as he resides therein unless he is retransferred at his own request Very truly yours, O.

Matzen, State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You sulmiii for the consideration of this de]Mrtnient a letter received by you from County Superintendent Yoss, of Dakota City, in which lie says : "I have a case of a bank's wishing to receive some bond funds on deposit under this new law in connection with a school board's order to the county treasurer to invest its bond fund in time certificates of de - posit. It is found, however, that the bank has all of the county's funds that it may have under the bank guarantee law. The question is: May - it accept funds for deposit under Section 377 under the circumstances?" Permit me to say that in my opinion the funds of a school district are not county funds in any sense of the rd and the law which forbids the deposit of county funds excess of a certain percentage of a bank's capital is not applicable in the case of a de|&gt;osit of funds lielonging 10 a school district. This Wing true, as 1 view it, the bank may accept funds for dc|&gt;osit belonging to a school district and issue rime certificates of deposit therefor, funds will not be dcjtosited under Section 377, lpiled Statutes, 1922 edition. That section provides for the investment of school district funds in redeeming its own bonds or in the purchase of registered bonds of the county in which the district is situated or ltonds of the Cte of Nebraska or bonds of the United States.

The purchase of such land by said school district, county, church or cemetery association or corporation having control of a cemetery or church, may be made by </seg>

In making this statement I am not unmindful that Section 8, of Article VIII, of the Constitution of Nebraska, as amended in 1920 provides: "No lands now owned or hereafter acquired by the state for educational purposes shall be sold except at public auction under such conditions as the Legislature shall provide..' The object and pui]&gt;ose of the Bforemid provision in, of course, to insure that such lands will be sold for the l&gt;est price obtainable and the ]&gt;ermanent school fund of the state protected and conserved. I do not think that the electors of the state who adopted the Constitution intended by the above quoted provision to bar the public from obtaining title to so much of the school lands n.s might l»e necessary for road purjM&gt;s.°s or to make the obtaining of such title unnecessarily onerous, burdensome or e.\|&gt;ensive, and it is hardly con - ceivable that a narrow strip of land such as is used for public highways would bring more than its appraised value plus the costs of its advertisement and sale at public auc - tion, so that in no event will the school fund l&gt;e depleted by making a deed to so much school land as may lie needed for road puri&gt;oses in conformity with the altove quoted provisions of statute.

He is entitled to his salary as sheriff and in addition thereto his compensation as jailer. Mr. Hugo J. Bu&lt;kendahl , Count ii Clerk, Pierce, Nebraska.

Section 1100$, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. 1922, provides : "The jailer or keeper of the jail shall, unless the sheriff elect to act as jailer in person, be a deputy appointed by the sheriff, and such jailer shall take the necessary oath before entering upon the duties of his office:" etc. The case of Ihudtd r. Hall Count//, M Neb. 58S, LSI N. W. 973. luilds: That if the sheriff arts as jailer he receives the fee for services a.s jailer, and if the deputy acts, the deputy received the fee. Md'uildcn v. Cedar Count//, 95 Neb. :]18, 143 X. W. &lt;&gt;39, holds that when the deputy acts as jailer, the sheriff is not entitled to fees as jailer. The latest opinion ujtou this subject is the case of Svott v. Scottsblulf Count/), 10(i Neb. Wt, wherein it is held that under the statute a duly ap]&gt;ointed and qualified, deputy sheriff who has been selected by his principal to perform the duties of jailer is entitled to $1.50 ]»er day for his services "where there are prisoners confined in the county jail." The same case holds that where there is a contract In-tween him ajid the board of county commission - era by which he agrees to ]&gt;erforni the duties of jailer for a different condensation than that fixed by law that such agreement is against public jtolicy and is void. Section 2981, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, sets forth the fee schedule for the services of the sheriff. This section provides that where there are prisoners con - fined in the county jail, $1.50 shall be allowed the sheriff as jailer. This same section requires the sheriff to make a rejxirt to the county board showing the different items of fees, except mileage collected or earned, and then provides that he" shall pay all fees earned to the county treasurer. This would indicate that if the sheriff elects to perform the duties of jailer that he must account to the county board for the fees. It seems, however, that he may delegate the </seg>

Scott nblu-ff County, holds that a claim may lie filed against the county with the county board for the deputy for his services as jailer, and the cases hold that the fees are directly payable to the deputy sheriff and not to the sheriff. This would lte an indica - tion that the deputy sheriff would lie entitled to recover inasmuch as the $1.50 per day is the fixed conqiensation, which cannot Ik* changed by contract even though his compensation as deputy sheriff may lie fixed by contract with the county board. If the sheriff acts as jailer a different situation would seem to arise on account of the fact that the statute by Section '2'.iH'2 fixes the salary of the sheriff at a sum certain, dependent u]ion the population of the county. By the decision of Stntc r. Miller, W Neb. 17!), l."iL' X. \V. .526, it is held that the sheriff is required to rejiort all fees which are not exempted from his report. This excludes Mileage alone. The case of Dunkel r. Hall Comity, 89 Neb. T&gt;83, holds thiit there is a distinction lietween the duties of the office of sheriff and those of the position of Jailer, ami gives the sheriff the election to act as jailer in per - son, or that the deputy may act. This same act holds that if the sheriff ]&gt;erforms the duties of the jailer, in addition to his duties as sheriff, he is entitled, not to extra ( (imjiensation for the jierfoiinance of Jiis duties as sheriff, but to the compensation provided for the ]ierformance of the other duties as jailer. On account of the foregoing we are therefore of the opinion that the duties of the sheriff as sheriff, and his duties as jailer are distinct, and that he is entitled to his salary- as sheriff, and in addition thereto his compen - sation as jailer based upon fl.ftO ]&gt;er day "when there arr prisoners confined in the county jail."

Where a person has been sentenced to imprisonment in the county jail upon conviction for a crime, the sheriff or jailer has no auth - ority to keep such prisoner elsewhere or to allow or extend liberties to any such prisoner, but it is the duty of such officer to keep such prisoner confined in the county jail except on special orders of a court of competent jurisdiction.

In reply to your first inquiry you are informed that Section 101(59, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides : "When any court or magistrate shall sentence any convict to im - prisonment in the jail of the county as a punishment for the offense committed, the judgment and sentence shall require that the convict be imprisoned in the cell of the jail of the county, or that he be kept at hard labor in the jail; and when the imprisonment is to be without labor, the sentence may require the convict to be fed on bread and water only, the whole or any part of the term of imprisonment'* Chap. 13, Art. VI. Sec. 986, et seq., provides that the court may sentence prisoners to the county workhouse for labor, but this is done in pursuance to such a sentence. Section 101 63, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides : "Wherever a fine shall be the whole or part of a sentence, the court may order that the person sentences shall remain confined in the county jail until the amount of such fine and costs are paid." </seg>

Section 4981\ Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922. provides : "He shall have charge and custody of the jail, and the prisoners of the same, and is required to receive those lawfully committed, and to keep them himself, or by his deputy jailer, until discharged by law."

We take advantage of this occasion to say to the sheriffs of Oklahoma that the law has provided county jails as the places of confinement for prisoners committed to their cus - tody, and that they have no right to keep them anywhere else, or allow them to be at liberty, except on special order of a court of competent jurisdiction. Any sheriff who does not obey the law in this respect should be removed from office, and should also be visited severe penal - ties. The man who is not willing to obey the law should not hold the office of sheriff, or any other public office. He has no right to have pets or favorites, or extend any liberties or privileges to one prisoner which the law does not extend to all prisoners; and we suggest to the various trial judges and county attorneys of Oklahoma that they ad - monish their several sheriffs as to this matter, and, if they find any carelessness of this sort, that they shall take such action as will se - cure respect for an obedience to law, for in this manner only can the interests of society be protected." It is therefore NT opinion that where a pMMB has lieen sentenced to imprisonment in, the county jail u]k»u conviction of a crime, that the sheriff has no authority to keep such prisoner elsewhere, or to allow or extend lil&gt;erties to any such prisoner, but that it is the duty of Mich officer to keep such prisoner confined in the county jail, except on special order of the court of coni]&gt;etent juris- </seg>

Dear Sir: Your letter of December 27th contains several ques - tions, which we Avill endeavor to answer in the order they arc asked. "1. How are the judges of your inferior state courts chosen and for how long?" In this State we have inferior courts as follows : District Court, County Court, Justice of Peace Court, Municipal Court and 1'olice Court. .Judges of the District Court are elected for a term of four years by the electors of the respective districts. Judges of the County Court are elected by the electors of the county for a term of four yeans. The term was fixed at two yean* by the Constitution of 1875, but by the Constitution of 1920 has been changed to four years. Justices of the Peace are elected for a term of two years by the electors of the respective districts. Municipal courts have been established in metropolitan cities and cities of the first class having an excess of §000 population. Municipal Judges are elected at the ieral election for a term of four years, and of course ■ir jurisdiction is limited to the municipality. Police Court Magistrates are elected for a term of two years. "2. How are judges of your state supreme court (or court of highest resort) chosen, and for how long a term?" The Supreme Court constitutes our highest tribunal. The number of judges has l&gt;een increased by the Constitu - tion of 1920 to seven judges, one of which is the Chief Justice. The Chief Justice is elected by electors of the State at large. The other judges are elected by the respec- </seg>

The judges ;ire all elected for a term of six years. Our Constitution also provides that the Supreme Court may call in District Judges to assist in the work of the Supreme Court, and to sit as members of the court when so called. "3. "If either are elected, when was elective method established?" Judges of all of our courts are elected. The elective method has been in vogue ever since the State was organ - ized. Of MM prior to the organization of the State, laws pertaining to territories applied. "4. Were judges once elected and now appointed, or vice versa, and when did the change take place?"

If a District Judge sentences a man to this Institution who has previously served out a sentence here, shall we receive such offender?" We will answer the above questions in the order in which they .are asked. (a) The court has no statutory authority to sentence any one more than thirty years of age to the state reforma - tory instead of the penitentiary. The hoai-d, however, may transfer from the penitentiary to the reformatory «» prisoner over thirty years of age who is serving his first term for a felony. This being true I see no objection to the bawd permitting such prisoners to l&gt;e received at iIip reformatory if it is willing to do so and there is room for them there and they have not previously been convicted of a felony. The board may at any time order such prisoners transferred to the itenitentiary if they ||»W to be incor - rigible. (Section 702."), Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, I!t^2 edition.) That a prisoner over thirty years of ■§■ who is serving his first sentence for a felony is not absolutely barred from the state reformatory is shown by the provisions of Section 702(&gt;, Compiled Statutes which IK-rmits the transfer of such a prisoner, regardless of his a:je from the penitentiary to the refonnatory. (b) A district judge has no .statutory authority to sentence one to the state refonnatory who has previously nerved a sentence there for a felony. Perhaps the letter way to handle such a case will be for the Itoanl to permit i he prisoner to l&gt;c received at the reformatory and then transfer him to the penitentiary as incorrigible.

In determining the value of bank stock the assessor has the right to take into account among other things the surplus and undivided profits of the bank and the market value of its capital stock. Mr. R, P. Kepler, County Attorney, Sidney, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You say : "One of the banks capitalized at $25,000.00 is the owner of real estate of the assessed valuation of $26,000.00, and under the provision of Section 5887 of the Compiled Statutes of 1922, seeks to have the assessed valuation of their real estate deducted from the assessed val - uation of their capital stock, for the purpose of taxation. Your opinion is solicited as to whether or not this can be done." Your question is answered I think by the provisions ot Section 5887, Compiled Statutes, which reads in part, as follows: "Whenever any such bank, association or company shall have ac - quired real estate or other tangible property which is assessed separ - ately, the assessed value of such real estate or tangible property shall be deducted from the valuation of the capital stock of the association or company." I do not think that under the provisions of said Section 5887 chattel mortgages l&gt;elonging to a bank can be taxed to the bank. They may represent money deposited in the bank, ami not the bank's own money. The shares of stock in banks are assessed in another way. You will note, however, that in determining the value of bank stock, the assessor has a right among other Things to take into account the surplus and undivided profits and its market value.

            <seg id="p663">OPINIONS 663 TAXATION— BANK FURNITURE. Bank furniture is tangible property and if it belongs to a state bank, it is taxed at the same rate as other tangible property. Furniture belonging to a national bank cannot be taxed at all by the State. t}eo. W. Wertz, Esq., County Attorney, Schuyler, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 2nd instant relative to the taxation of bank stock, I will Bay it is the opinion of this dei&gt;artnient : 1. That hank furniture is tangible property 2. That bank furniture of a national bank although tangible property is not taxable under any state law. 3. That the furniture of a state bank is taxable to I he bank under state law as tangible property. 4. That in determining the value of the capital stock of any bank, either state or national, for taxation purposes in this sfcite. the value of the real estate and other tangible property of the bank which is assessed separately is de - ducted from the total value of the capital stock of the bank and the residue only is asses.*»ed as capital stock. I supjK)se no one will seriously contend that furniture, whether l»elonging to a bank, or to someone else. Is not tangible property. But it does not follow that because bank furniture l&gt;elonging to a national bank is tangible property it can be taxed by virtue of the state law. The Supreme Court of the United States has held : "A state is wholly without power to levy any tax, either direct or indirect, upon national banks, their property, assets or franchises, except when permitted so to do by the legislation of congress." Section 5219 of the Revised Statutes is the measure of the power of states to tax national banks, their property or their franchises ; that power being confined to a taxation </seg>
            <seg id="p664">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 664 of the shares of stock in the names of the slum-holder*, and to an assessment of the real estate of the hank. It follows that inasmuch as bank furniture iK'lonjtinj: to a national hank is not teal estate it cannot be taxed to the hank. There is no inhihition, however, upon taxing to a slate hank any such pro|ierty bekmgtaf to it. In tact both the stale constitution and the statute law require that such property lie taxed according to valuation ju.&gt;t •* other tangible property is taxed. The constitutional pro - vision is: "Taxes shall be levied by valuation uniformly ami proportionately upon all tangible property and franchises.' (Section 1 of Article Vlli of Constitution of Nebraska.) The opinion in the case of Ututt Hank of OiixiIiu i . End rex, \'.V2 X. \V. '.i'2'2, is not in conflict with the views herein expressed for in tiiat case the question under consideration was the taxation of intangible property, viz: the capital stock of banks and the court held that to per - in it the capital slock of srate banks to l&gt;e as.ses.sed ii]&gt;oii a different basis as to valuation than the capital stock of national banks would lie inimical to that part of the state const itution, which provides: "Taxes uniform as to class may be levied upon all other property.' (Section 1 of Article VIII of Constitution of Nebraska.) The word "other" in the constitutional provision last above quoted refers evidently to taxes upon property that is not tangible, that is to my, to taxes upon intanjiiblr urojK'ily.

            <seg id="p665">665 TAXATION— BANK STOCK. The assessed value of real estate owned in fee simple by a bank and of its tangible personal property, should be deducted from the gros4 value of its capital in determining the value of its capital stock for the purpose of assessment as capital stock. Dear Sir: In answer to tow inquiry of the 18th instant in !•&gt; assessment of liiinks 1 will say that, in my opinion the assessed value of real estate or other tangible property &lt;.f a hank which is assessed separately, should be deducted from the total valuation of the capital stock of the bank in ordu- to arrive at the just valuation to place upon ihe capital stock as intangible property. The law provides: "Whenever any such bank, association or company shall have ac - quired real estate or other tangible property which is assessed separ - ately, the assessed value of such real estate or tangible property shall be deducted from the valuation of the capital stock of the association or company." (Comp. St. 1922, sec. 5887.) The alMive quotation is followed by a provision that mortgagee, trust deeds and other liens or interest in i&lt;al estate less than a fee title and held as security for loans shall not lie deducted from the capital, surplus or undivided profits. If it l&gt;e a fact that after deducting the assessed value of real estate and other intangible p ropery from the total value of the capital stock of a bank there is nothing lyft to assess as intangible property, the assessor should make no assessment of intangible property. In answer to your second question I will say that, as I view the law, the assessor need not be concerned particularly with the deduction of expense from 'the surplus fund or any other fund. That is a question in which he is only incidentally interested. The real question at issue is what is the actual value of the capital stock of the bank. Mr. h'reilrrlvk S. Hrrri/ i'on at if A ttornri/, Wmpne, Nebrnxka. </seg>
            <seg id="p666">666 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL In determining that question he may of course take into account the excuse account of the hank, hut only as one of the elements that enter into the cash value of the stock. The actual value of the capital stock may ix* greater or less, as the case may 1k\ than the amount of its capital and surplus and undivided profits as shown 1ry its l»ooks. The law recognizes this fact for it nays that the treasurer "shall take into consideration the market value of such stock, if any, and the surplus and undivided profits." but in any event and in all cases the funda - mental question to determine is what is the actual value of the stock.

The property seized must be the property of the person taxed when it was seized, and it need not be the property in respect to which the tax was assessed. * * * It has been held that nothing can be taker, under a distress but tangible property capable of seizure and sale, and that intangible property, such as shares of stock in corporations, or a judgment atrainst a third party, cannot lawfully be taken on dis tress. Distress is limited to personal property." Kertion !Ml.:s. Compiled Statutes.

Dear Sir: In answer to the question asked in your letter of the !)th instant, I will say that while I find no derision of our supreme court upon the i&gt;articular point involved, and the matter may be said for that reason to be somewhat in doubt, I am of the opinion that the city of Scottsbluff Is only entitled to half the money raised for road tax within the corporate limits of the city by the county levy made by the county board for road purposes. Section 2630, Compiled Statutes, 1922 edition, provides among other things : "The board may levy the same rate of road tax upon the property within the cities of the metropolitan class, cities of the first and second class and villages as is levied upon the property in the several road districts, and one-half of such tax when collected shall go to the coun - ty road fund, the other half when collected, to be paid to the city or village where levied:" • * • Said Section 2630, Compiled Statutes was last, amended It is true that Section 4148, Compiled Statutes provides : "All money arising from the levying of road tax against or upon property in said city shall belong to the city and shall be expended upon the streets and grades in such city."

Dear Sir: You submit to this department a letter of Mr. M.

You ask for an opinion from this department in regard to this matter. In compliance with your request, I will say that Section 5884, Compiled Statutes, to which Mr. Soiumerville refers, and which provides in a general way for the taxing of intangible property including the capital stock of corjKirations is not applicable to quite all corj (orations, as is apparent from the language used. It is made applicable by its terms except as herein otherwise provided.

A taxpayer who voluntarily and without protest pays taxes assessed against him can not recover ;ame in absence of statute. Dear Sir: You state in your letter of August 14th that the owni-r of a half section ol laud adjacent to Orr school district and which was situated in another school district had his land assessed tor taxation purposes iu the Ord district whereas at least one quarter section of the half section, if indeed both quarter sections, should have been assessed in the original or home district. You inquire whether or not, where this land has Iteen taxed for several years in this erroneous manner on account of errors of the county officials and the taxes paid by the owner of the land, the landowner or school district has any remedy to recover the taxes thus assessed. It is possible that it will require a decision of the court to entirely dispose of this question. However, we have given the matter some study and call your attention to Section 6018, Compiled Statutes, 11)22, and following Mr. llancy Park*, Member of School Hoard, Ord, Xcbraxka*. </seg>
            <seg id="p690">690 sections, which Bet forth the remedies afforded taxpayers to protect their rights so that they may recover taxes unjustly paid. Under the provisions of this section, we do not l&gt;elieve that the taxpayer could recover his money. In this connection we refer you to the case cited by Mr. Ayres in a recent opinion involving the right of hanks to recover a void assessment against bank stock. The case cited is ])arr r. Dawsoit County, \:\[) N. W. 852, in which case •Judge Kedgwick, giving the opinion of the court, said: "In such case, the tax would be void, and might be enjoined; but it could not be paid under protest and recovered again. A voluntary payment of taxes cannot be recovered in the absence of a statute au - thorizing such payment and recovery." It seems that this taxpayer paid the taxes voluntarily, without protest and without notice to the collectors that he demanded the taxes: hence we believe he is without remedy. If he had proceeds by injunction he might have restrained the collection of the taxes, but inasmuch as he has ]&gt;aid them voluntarily, we know of no statutory remedy jiermitting him to recover the payments made. Section 590.5, Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides the manner of making corrections in the tax list ln'fore the taxes are paid, in case of clerical error. The taxes, how - ever, have l&gt;een ]wid in this case and we do not l&gt;elieve there is authority to correct the record, by the provisions of this section, vested in either the county asttetwor or the county clerk. In addition to the case cited applying to the right to restrain the collection of taxes paid, we cite the case of Hem pie r. City of Hatting*, 7!t Neb. 723, where it was "The levy of city taxes upon property outside its boundaries is without authority and such taxes are illegal and void as to such prop - erty and where collected may be restrained by injunction." The trouble in applying this case, however, is that the taxes have been jmid and it is now too late for injunctive </seg>
            <seg id="p691">691 relief, and the statute*) seem to afford no remedy against the payment of such taxes. The right of the one school district to recover against the other, or the right of the taxpayer to recover directly against the school district, are questions which we believe could be answered only ujk&gt;ii presentation of the matter to the court. So far as the taxpayer is concerned, it is prob - able that he is estopi»ed from in any manner attacking the validity of the tax or the distribution of the tax. It is probable the court would say, the taxes having been col - lected in this manner for several years, that at least tacitly it would seem that the taxpayer had consented to the property being taxed in the Ord district. The same theory might apply to the other district, inasmuch as no action was taken to correct the error which wan of record and could easily have l&gt;een ascertained. In answering his inquiry we are not unaware o I he fact that the provisions of the Constitution and the statutes, in referring to payment of taxes, do not seem ti expressly intention school districts. However, the subject o taxation is pretty well covered by the statutes and it is the intention of the legislature that, *&gt;o far as applicable all statutes |*&gt;rtaining to taxation should act uniform I \ iu all sultdivisions of the state and lnxlies receiving the tMMiefitH of taxation. As a matter of law, we would also Ite of the opinion that the money of the school district could be expended only for purixmes for which levied, and there are probably no funds in the district available for the puri&gt;oHe of repay - ing to the taxjtayer or the other district any part of the amount claimed. We very much doubt if the school district would Ite justified in paying such a claim until the same has l»een reduced to judgment, under the circum - stances of this case.

The statute gives her a lien for such taxes until the redemption is made. Of course in the event I deed is secured all taxes would be merged in the obtaining of the title. We call your attention to Section 6005, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, which provides for the lien. We also call your attention to Chapter 105, Session Laws 192.J, where it is required that all taxes referred to in the certificate of purchase, together with all subsequent taxes paid by the holder of certificate must first be paid liefore redemption be had. In this connection we call your attention to cases of Meuhnxl r. Council, 57 Xeb. 10, Toy r. McHwfk, H Xcfc. 120. We believe this fully answers your inquiry. Very truly yours, Attorney General.

            <seg id="p710">710 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL It appears that no assessment has been nuule against the deceased during his life time for more taxes than he has failed to pay. In other words, there are no out - standing unpaid taxes against the deceased. It therefore seems that lx&gt;fore taxes could be collected against him they would first have to be assessed against him, and in the event of raising his schedule he would be entitled to notice and an opportunity to be heard. No such notice &lt;an now lie given to the deceased and in all probability no person could be found to testify as to what conditions were so many years ago. It must also be remembered that r debts would be deductible and conditions might have entirely different at the time the schedule was made. In any event we believe it would be an impossibility to prove what a correct return was at any particular April first of these preceding yearn, allowing proper deduction for debts. There is also the propoedtion that the board of equal - ization has met and adjourned each year after affording the opportunity to taxpayers to make complaints. It would iherefore lie very doubtful if a court would entertain a complaint where no opportunity had been given to the jierson against whom taxes would have been collectible. It is also apparent that such taxes would not be nuade a lien against the property itself. Upon the death of. the lieraon in question his property vested in his heirs subject only to the payment of his just debts. There is no debt or i axes in this particular instance which can be proved against his estate. It seems to us that the time for making ntwessment has gone by. On the other hand, ]&gt;aragraph 308, on the subject of taxation, 26 R. C. L. 351. considers the question of assess - ment of omitted projierty. This section seems to contem - plate, however, that there should have been a provision by the legislature by which such action should have been established and authorized. We are not aware of any action of our legislature which directly prescribes such a remedy or method of procedure so that after an individual </seg>
            <seg id="p711">711 has made his return an«l presumes his taxes to have been paid it might be possible many years later to resurrect the entire matter. It is very clear that such an assessment cannot now be made against his heirs and we do not lielieve it could be made against the administrator. Our chief reason for this conclusion is that a taxpayer has the same right to notice and opjtortunity to be heard upon the question of assessing him for omitted property as he had in the ease of an original assessment. Inasmuch, therefore, as complaint was not made in the manner specified by statute, we lielieve that your case might not lie successful in court if prosecuted. We do not wish you, however, to refrain from taking .such action, as the matter is one that is doubtful. As taxes are not debts we believe you would have a pretty hard time in laying the foundation for the collection of such taxes at this time. It is possible that the court might say, upon a meeting of the board of equalization and notice to the administrator, that assessment would be made upon the omitted property for all these years, and U]K)n assessment lieing duly made, collection of the taxes so assessed and so extended might ]&gt;ossibly be held valid.

Mr. (leu. F. Furxh, Count// Axxexxov, Wuhoo, Xebmxka. Dear Sir: Your letter of the 23d instant addressed to Hon. William H. Smith, tax commissioner, has been referred by him to me for answer. You say : "In 1918 and 1919, the Farmers Union Co-Operative Company of Mead, Nebr., was assessed for improvements on leased land, and also assessed with the same improvements on the real estate book on lots which they owned adjoining the elevator. The County Board instructed me to take the matter up with your Department and get a ruling from the Attorney General's office. We feel this is simply a double tax and want to rectify same if there is any way it can be done." I rejrret to sjiv that 1 know of no provision of statute which entitles these parties to a refund at this time of I he double assessment made on these improvements, if the faxes have already been paid, as I assume they have. The company should have pursued the method outlined in Section &lt;K)1N. Compiled Statutes, W'2'2 edition, to entitle it legally to a refund of these taxes. The law provides : "No county or town board, city council or village trustees shall have power to release, discharge, remit or commute any portion of the taxes assessed or levied against any person or property within their respective jurisdictions for any reason whatever. Any taxes so dis - charged, released, remitted or commuted, may be recovered by civil action from members of any such board, council or trustees, and the sureties on their official bonds at the suit of any citizen of the coun - ty, township, city or village, as the case may be, and when collected shall be paid into the proper treasury. Nothing in this section con - tained shall be construed to prevent the proper authority from refund - ing taxes paid, as provided in the two next preceding sections, nor </seg>
            <seg id="p713">OPINIONS 713 to interfere with the powers of any officers or board sitting as a board for the equalization of taxes." It is, however, true that the company should not have been assessed twice on the same improvements in the same year, and it may be the county board, taking into consideration the equities of the case, will Ik&gt; willing to vote a refund and take its chances ujion being cailled upon to reimburse the county. It is to be borne in mind in this connection that not. all the excess tax paid was county tax. Some of it was school tax, and possibly a jiart was village tax. 1 think that in some instances under similar circum - stances taxes have been refunded with the understanding that the party to whom the refund was made would in - demnify the members of the county board in case they .-liuulil be called uj&gt;on to make good to the county the amount of the tax refunded.

Mr. W. D. Funk, County Attorney, Center, Ncbnutku. Dear Sir: We have carefully considered the contents of your letter of February 2d in which you inquire whether or not the county superintendent can make a levy of 12 mills on a one-fifth valuation of the projx'rty of the August 27, 1923. </seg>
            <seg id="p714">714 REPOHT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL school district, where the district has neglected to make provision for its school at the annual meeting. The county superintendent has this power, and the levy is made by the county clerk upon the county superinten - dent's estimate, as provided by Section 6289, Compiled Statutes, 1922, so long as he does not exceed 35 mills. More than 35 mills levy would have to be authorized by a vote of the district. Our conclusion in this matter is based upon the fact that Section 1, Art. XII, Laws 1921, provides that 20 c /&lt; of the maximum rates of levy authorized by statutes in force on the date that the act l&gt;ecanie effective should apply, except as different rates of levy shall have been authorized by the legislature in the year 1921, either in specific- sums or by ]&gt;ercentage levies where the act state* the levy is to be based on actual value. By Chapter 66, page 253, Laws 1921, it is provided that the aggregate school tax levied for general school purposes in district organized under Articles III and VI, Chapter 71, Revised Statutes, 1913, shall in no event exceed 35 mills on the dollar of the assessed valuation of such dis - tricts. This was a re-enactment of the old provision of (he law, and the new provision, Chapter (»6, went into effect under an emergency clause on April 4, 1921. It would therefore seem that this being an act of the legisla - ture of 1921. it would 1m' governed by the provisions of Chapter (&gt;(i. and that a levy up to 35 mills might l&gt;e made, under the estimate of the county superintendent, based upon one-fifth valuation or seven mills u]&gt;on full valuation, as provided by Section 5 of Chapter 66.

            <seg id="p715">OPINIONS 715 TAXES— SPECIAL Taxes for special improvements resulting in corresponding benefits are a lien subsequent only to general taxes. Mr. C. C. Frazier, Attorney at Law, Aurora, Nebraska, Dear Sir: Your inquiry of May 2d contains two questions. Fir»t, does a special assessment for paving take precedence over a prior mortgage? The writer had some personal experience with a similar problem in the nature of a mortgage in Richardson county. The taxes involved in that case were drainage taxes. The district court held that the drainage taxes would be a lieu prior to the mortgage, but subsequent to general taxes as provided by Section 5826, Compiled Statutes, 1922. You can see that this seems to be a logical conclusion upon the theory that all special taxes increase the value of the property. This would seem particularly true of paving where the assessment cannot be made unless there is a cor - responding benefit. (Snyder v. Plumb, 8C Neb. 132.) It would therefore seem that the mortgage, at least in theory and in the application of the law, is not injured by having the special taxes made a prior lien. Your second inquiry is as to whether or not the city may purchase certain property covered with tax liens and a mortgage where the land is not needed for municipal pur - poses but would be rented or used for the ordinary purposes of such property. We know of no right in the municipality to purchase or hold lands other than for municipal pur - poses, and would therefore be inclined to the opinion that the only manner in which the city might purchase sucn property would be under proceedings for tax foreclosure. Very truly yours, O. S. SPILLMAN, Attorney General. By LLOYD DORT, May 3, 1923. Assistant Attorney General. </seg>
            <seg id="p716">716 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TAX CERTIFICATES— INTEREST Tax sale certificates bear the rate of interest that was payable there - on at the time they were issued. Hon. flfeft, IT. Marsh, State Auditor, Lincoln, Xcbraxka. Dear Sir: You inquire as to the rate of interest to which pur - chasers at tax sale are entitled where the sale took place prior to the 2nd day of April, 1923, when the new law went into effect, changing the rate of interest in such cases from 15 par cent to 12 j»er cent per annum. In answer to your question, I will say that in my opin - ion the purchaser at tax sale prior to April 2, 1923, is en - titled on redemption by the owner to receive interest at the rate of 15 per cent per annum not only on the amount of his original payment, but also on all subsequent taxes paid by him on such tax sale. The rule is: "The law in force at the time a tax sale is made becomes a part of the purchaser's contract, and any subsequent statute which attempts to deprive him of any substantial right secured to him by the existing law is void, as impairing the obligation of contracts. Thus a statute is void which attempts * * * to reduce the amount to be paid the pur - chaser on redemption." (12 C. J. 1002.) Prior to the passage of the recent statute reducing the amount of interest to be paid the purchaser at tax sale, it was incumbent upon the purchaser, as it is now to see that subsequent taxes were paid in order to protect his lien. (See Section (&gt;0(i!). Compiled Statutes, 1922 Ed.) This the purchaser was presumed to know at the time he made the purchase, but he also knew that under the law as it then stood, if he did pay such subsequent taxes, he would be entitled to interest at the rate of 15 per cent per annum thereon in case the owner redeemed the premises. It may well be that such knowledge was the deciding factor </seg>
            <seg id="p717">OPINIONS 717 in inducing the purchaser to make the purchase, but be that as it may, it seems clear on principle that the rate of inter - est which the purchaser was entitled to receive under the law in force at the time he made the purchase upon subse - nuent taxes paid by him cannot be lowered so long as the law still makes it incumbent upon him to pay subsequent taxes in order to protect his purchase, without impairing the obligation of contract so far as he is concerned. This being true, it follows, that the purchaser is en - titled to receive, if redemption from tax sale is made, the same interest that he would have l&gt;een entitled to receive if the law had not l&gt;een. changed after he made the purchase. TAX CERTIFICATES— REDEMPTION'— CANCELLATION. 1. One who has no interest in real estate cannot redeem from a tax sale. 2.

Is one holding a tax sale certificate more than five years old bat who gave legal notice of his intention to apply for a tax deed before the five years had expired, a right to apply for and receive a tax deed more than five years after the tax sale certificate was issued ?" I will endeavor to answer the above questions in tin - order in which they are asked. (a) One who has no legal or equitable interest in real estate has no right strictly s]&gt;eaking to mleem sueh real estate from tax sale*. (b) Yes, unless proceedings to foreclose it ltefore the five years had expired are gliding. "If the owner of any tax sale certificate shall fail or neglect to demand a deed thereon, or to commence an action for the foreclosure of the same within five years from the date of the sale, such tax sale certificate shall cease to be valid • * • and the real estate covered thereby shall be forever released and discharged from the lien of all taxes for which the same was sold." (Section 6097, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922.) The provision relative to the release from the lien of taxes does not apply to tax sales to counties or other inuni - ci]&gt;al corporations where no money has actually l&gt;een paid on the taxes. (c) If the owner of a tax sale certificate fails to demand a deed until more than five years after the date of the certificate, he loses his right to a deed. You also inquire in another letter of the same date, whether you may pay off paving bonds issued by the county but not yet due, out of county money now in your hands provided the owners of such bonds are willing to accept payment now.

You also, in another letter of the same date, inquire with reference to the refunding and cancelling of taxes. In answer to the questions you ask in this letter, I will say that I know of no statutory authority that either yon or the county board have to remit the interest due on delinquent faxes in any case. Neither do I recall any statutory authority for cancelling pflfMMl taxes which have become delinquent since 1910. You further inquire in another letter of the same date as to the proper method of marking payments of taxes on the tax list. In answer to this question I will say that in my opinion where Mr. Jones, acting for Mr. Smith, jkivs you cash on Mr. Smith's taxes the name of Mr. Smith should appear in the column where payment is marked. Of course, it is proper to show that the payment lor Mr. Smith was by Mr. Jones. The mileage allowed as sheriff for serving a distress warrant is five cents under the provisions of Section 6012.

TAX LISTS— PUBLICATION FEES The fees for the publication of the tax list are twenty cents for each description of land other than town lots, and ten cents for e»ch town lot. Mr. Ole Buck, In answer to your letter of the 15th instant, I will say that this department adheres to its opinion heretofore -ex - pressed in regard to the amount of fees allowed for the publication of a notice of delinquent tax lists. In 1913 the general provision of statute regarding the fees allowed for the publication of legal notices, read as fol - lows : "There shall be allowed for printing and publishing legal advertise - ments in newspapers, as follows: Each square of ten lines, for the first insertion, one dollar. Each subsequent insertion, for each square of ten lines, fifty cents. Each legal advertisement under ten lines shall be deemed a square, and each fractional part of a sqaare shall be counted as a full square. For publishing list of lands upon which taxes are delinquent, each description twenty cents. For publishing, each description ten cents". (Section 2466, R. S. 1918.) Harvard, ycbraxka. Dear Sir: </seg>
            <seg id="p722">722 tAt that time the special provision of statute providing the allowance of fees for the publication of tax lists, as follows : "The county treasurer shall cause the list and accompanying notice to be published once a week for three consecutive weeks prior to the date of sale, commencing the first week in October, in a newspaper published in such county, having a general circulation therein, which newspaper shall be designated by the county board and if there be published in such county, newspapers printed in the German, Swedish or Bohemian languages, having been regularly published in said county for ten successive years or more, and having a daily, semi-weekly or weekly circulation among regular bona fide subscribers of fifteen hundred copies or more, the notice shall also be published in a newspa - per in each of said languages, to be designated by the board of coun - ty commissioners: Provided, however, if the total cost of such publica - tions in all of such newspapers shall exceed the total amount herein provided to be taxed against the lands and lots so advertised then the publication shall be made only in the newspaper printed in the English language. He shall also cause to be posted up in some conspicuous place in his office, a copy of the list and notice. The Treasurer shall add to each description of land so advertised, other than town lots, the sum of twenty cents, and for each town lot the sum of ten cents, to defray the expenses of advertising, which sum shall be added to the amount due on such land or town lot for taxes and collected in the same manner as taxes." (Section 6524, R. S. 1913.) Iln lftl'l the general provisions of statute repardinp the onnt of fe«'s for publication of notices was amended to (1 a* follows : I "The legal rate for the publication of all legal notices shall be ten its a line, single column, standard newspaper measurement for the it insertion and shall be eight cents a line, single column, standard i-spaper measurement for each subsequent insertion.

(Section 6052, C. S. 1922.) You will observe that in 1921 the provision relative to the publication of notice of delinquent taxes was left out of the section of statute, which fixed the fees for legal publi - cations generally.

TAX LIST— IRRIGATION The fact that the amount of an irrigation tax levied against land is not entered on the tax list until after the other tax on the land has been paid does not operate to relieve the land from the lien of 'the irrigation tax. Mr. /'. li. Srhmidt Count i/ Tnasurt r, (Irrhifi, Xebninka. DM* Sir: In answer to the questions propounded in your letter of the 15th instant, I will say: (1) That an irrigation tax is a real estate tax, ami Section 2ST5, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922 Edition, while it does provide that the secretary of the irrigation dis- </seg>
            <seg id="p724">724 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL trict shall certify to the county clerk of the county in which the land in the district is situated the amount of taxes in each fund levied upon each tract of land in the district and lying in the county, and that such county clerk shall enter the amount of each fund in separate columns on the tax list of his county, does not provide when the secretary of the irrigation district shall certify to the county clerk the amount of such levy. Section 2877, 1922 Edition of the Compiled Statutes provides that all assessments of irriga - tion tax on real property are a lien against the property from ;i?nl after the first day of October in the year in which it is assessed. The assessment you will observe is made by the ltourd of directors of the irrigation district. (See Sec - tion L',sT4. C. 8. of Neb., It22 Edition.) Construing these various provisions of the statute to - gether I am of the opinion that if the county clerk does cuter on the tax list the amount of irrigation tax after the other tax on the land has lieen paid, the fact that the entry &lt;»u the tax list was not made before will not operate to re - lieve the land from the lien of the irrigation tax. \'1\ I iim inclined to adhere to the ruling of this department heretofore made, that in determining the amount of public money, which a county treasurer may law - fully deposit in a bank, the surplus which the bank holds over and aliovc its capital stock is not taken into considera - tion in naking the deposit. ( :{ i This department does not desire to be placed in the attitude of advising a deposit of county funds in any hank in excess of the amount permitted by law. If a deposit in excess of that amount is made, I will add however, that in my opinion it will be well to have the bond specifically waive any defense that the amount deposited is in excess of the amount authorized by law.

Dear Mr. Marsh : You call 1 1 1 v attention to the following inquiry from (he county treasurer of Frontier county: "Our County Commissioners are now making order that we write, in name of Frontier County, private tax sales on the delinquent lands ami lots and we are now asking that you please tell us how we should handle these sales. "Should we write tax receipts in cash book, distribute the money, pay the state and county their share and carry the sales as cash items? "We understand Section 6058 of 1922 statutes to mean that we are not to account to the state or anyone, for amount of taxes, until after a treasurer's deed has been issued. Are we right?" In answer to the first inquiry, I should say %&gt; Xo. I would answer the second inquiry in Ike affirmative. Section 6147, Compiled Statutes, llfc&gt;2 edition, reads as follows : "Whenever lands or lots have been purchased by the State of Neb - raska or by any county or municipal corporation, under the provisions of this article, and the period of redemption has expired without an assignment of such sale, the state, county or municipal corporation may elect to take a deed to such property by serving final notice upon the owner and occupants, as provided in this article, at any time during the year following, during which time the real estate shall be subject to redemption as in other cases, or it may at any time after the period of redemption, surrender and cancel its certificate of tax sale, in which case all taxes and assessments included in the sale shall stand as though no degree had been entered, and such taxes and assessments shall be included in the petition of the State of Nebraska in the tax suit next following. When the state or any municipal subdivision shall secure a deed under any tax sale, it shall pay to the county treas - urer all taxes and assessments, other than its own, included in the decree." </seg>
            <seg id="p727">OPINIONS 727 In view of the above mentioned section, and the hold - ing of our court iu the cane of County of Yullry r.

The court in the case said among other things : "The steps necessary to be taken and the rights acquired by a county at tax sale differ very materially from the Steps taken and the rights acquired by a private purchaser. The county is not a competi - tive bidder, and can only purchase when the property has remained un - sold for want of bidders. Again, the county is not required to pay the purchase price, and neither is it entitled to a twenty per cent interest on the purchase price, nor the allowance of attorneys' fees in case of foreclosure. All of these questions seem to be settled by the -tatute or the prior decisions of this court. The distinctions between a purchase by the county and by an individual, as such, are so apparent, it must be held that a different rule applies to a purchase made by a county and one made by an individual." Again the court savs in ■Jolmxon r. t'inhi/. ."»4 Neh. 7H : "The county, therefore, does not in any way waive its lien by a purchase at tax sale; it simply takes advantage of one of the provi - sions of the statute, to enable it to procure a judicial sale of the property that will devest the title of the delinquent owner, and thus obtain the amount of taxes due. The lien for taxes is perpetual, and tan only be devested by payment. When an individual purchases, lie is compelled to pay the taxes, and the state, county and other municipal subdivisions receive and thereafter retain the money, and the law maintain.-, the lien in force, for a stipulate;! number of years, to enable the purchaser to get his money with interest. But it was probably never contemplated that the county should ultimately become the owner in fee of the land, by purchase at judicial sale." Very truly yours, o. s. spillman. Attorney General.

Mr. Clyde B. Dean, County Treasurer, FuUerton, Xebraska. Dear Sir: Under date of October 2Gth you wrote, this office and asked the following questions: "1. Can the county board through me compete with individual bid - ders at the regular sale of land for taxes? "2. If so what is the lowest fraction of a piece of land that we can pay the taxes on? "3. In case we should buy in some of this land for taxes out of the general fund would we distribute the money taken out of the general fund to the various sub-divisions of the County, the State their share and so forth or would we keep that money apart until the land was redeemed by the owner and then distribute it crediting the interest fund with the interest?" In answer to the questions which you have pro|&gt;ounded jn'nuit me to say : la) I am of the opinion that the county board has no legal right to bid on taxes in competition with indi - vidual bidder* at the regular sale of land for taxes. Sec - tion G057, Compiled Statutes, 1922 edition, provides, among other things : "At all sales provided by law the county board may purchase for the use and benefit, and in the name of the county, any real estate ad - vertised and offered for sale when the same remains unsold for want of bidders." You will observe that the county is only authorized under the above quoted provision of statute to buy lands at tax sale when the same remain unsold for want of bidders. (b) I am of the opinion that when a county pur - chases real estate for taxes it should purchase the entire </seg>
            <seg id="p729">OPINIONS 729 interest in such real estate on which the taxes are delin - quent. (c) It is not my understanding that a county need take money out of its general fund when it purchases land for taxes. In fact I very much doubt the propriety of its doing so. In the case of County of Valley v. Mil font, reported in 70 Neb., you will find in the body of the opinion this state - ment: "The county is not a competitive bidder, and can only purchase when the property has remained unsold for want of bidders. The county is not required to pay the purchase price." Section 6124, Compiled Statutes, which is a part of Article 20, Chapter 61, Compiled Statutes, 1922 edition, provides, among other things: "The state, city or county purchasing at any sale of real estate under this article, shall hold the certificate of sale as trustee for itself and all other political sub-divisions in whose favor the decree was ren - dered, and no money need be paid or deposited with the treasurer on such sales." Section 6147, Compiled Statutes, provides, among other ihings, that where the state or any county or municipal corporation has purchased lands or lots for taxes : "It may at any time after the period of redemption, surrender and cancel its certificate of tax sale, in which case all taxes and aiwi ments included in the sale shall stand as though no decree had been entered, and such taxes and assessments shall be included in the peti - tion of the state of Nebraska in the tax suit next following." It is clear, I think, from the provision of statute above quoted that the law does not contemplate that a county or other municipality shall pay the amount due on a tax sale in cash. When the municipality purchasing the tax sale makes an assignment of such tax sale certificate it should, of course, receive the cash and at that time the </seg>

Hear Sir: You call my attention to Section 6430, Compiled Stat - utes of Nebraska, 1922 edition, which provides: "Each holder of a teacher's certificate of any grade or class shall, before he begins to teach, register the same in the office of the county superintendent of the county in which he shall teach. No certificate shall be valid in any county until so registered. Such registration shall be without fee." aiul inquire whether in my opinion said section is applicable to city certificates issued under Articles XXVI and XXVII of Chapter 63, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska. In answer to your question, I will say that said Section &lt;&gt;43(l forms a part of an act passed in 1919, which was an act. to repeal certain sections of the Revised Statutes for !!&gt;13, and to provide for the issuance of county and state certificates, and to make provisions for their validity, re - newal and conversion into professional certificates. Th«- iict does not purjKdt to change, amend or modify in any way the prior act, which authorized the issuance of city certificates. This being true, I am of the opinion that rhe provision for the registration of teacher's certificates is only applicable to the kind of certificates provided for by the act, of which it is a part, that is to say, county and state certificates, and that it is not applicable to city certi - ficates issued in conformity with the provisions of Articles XXVI and XXVII of the school law, although the language </seg>

Dear Sir: In reply to your favor of the 20th instant concerning the question of nclling cigars and tobacco at a church picnic to be held by your church in the early part of June, and inquiring if it is necessary to obtain a license, you are informed that Section 9848, Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides as follows: "Whoever shall sell, give, or furnish in any way any tobacco in nny form whatever, or any cigarettes, or cigarette paper, to any minor under eighteen years of age, shall be fined, for each offense, not less than twenty dollars nor more than fifty dollars or be imprisoned for nut less than ten nor more than thirty days." Section 985(1, Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides that licenses for the sale of cigars, tobacco, cigarettes and cigarette material to ]»ersons over the age of twenty-one years may l»e secured by the clerk of any town or village for the sale of such materials within the town or village, and for the sale outside the town such license may be secured from the countv clerk. ■re.

Since the law provides no exceptions, it would therefore seem to be applicable to all persons, and the fact that you are conducting such sale solely for the convenience of your ]ieople present at the picnic would not relieve you from the obligation of securing a license.

Section !&gt;S55, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, IKS, says that the moneys collected for license fees shall be paid over to the treasurer of the school fund for the particular town, city, village or county, as the case may be. This depends ujmhi whether the place of business is located in a niunici|&gt;iility or some place outside of a municipality. It is very doubtful, therefoiv, if the jterson you have in mind would have the right to sell tobacco at all unless he secures a license for each place of business.

Dear Sir: Section 9850, and following sections, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides that the license to sell tobacco shall be secured from the clerk of the city, town or village where the business is to be conducted, and if the business is to be conducted outside of the city, town or village the license shall be' procured from the clerk of county. The respective clerks should collect the license money at the time the application is made. It is the duty of the clerks to require the payment of the money at the time of issuing the license, which under the provisions of the sections of the statute referred to is for the period of one year.

Mr. L. E. Gunderson, Finance Secretary, University of Nebraska IAncoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In compliance with your request for an opinion from (his office of the meaning of the word "cost" as used in Section 6728, Compiled Statutes, 1922, which reads as fol - lows : "The regents shall procure all text books to be used in the Uni - versity, and shall furnish them to students at cost." you are informed that the term "cost" is a word of equivocal meaning. In the case of Goodwin v. United States, 1 0 Fed. Cases, 625, the court said : "The term 'cost' is certainly of an equivocal meaning. Thus the actual 'cost' of a bale of goods purchased at Liverpool is composed of the price paid for it, or, in other words, the prime cost and charges, including commissions on the purchase, the package, if any, and if the goods were purchased at the manufactory, then it includes not only the prime cost and all charges attending them to the place of exportation, but also the charges before mentioned, and perhaps many others." In the case of Hygenio Chemical Co. v. Provident Chem - ical Works, 176 Fed. 525, the court said, " ' costs' may be considered as synonymous with 'expense'." It is our opinion that the legislature intended that books should be furnished to the students of the University without expense to the state of Nebraska.

UNIVERSITY REGENTS— VACANCY A regent of the state university who was elected by the electors of the entire state does not vacate his office merely by removing from the district in which he resided when elected to some other place in the state. Hon. Thotnas C. Osborne, State Setuitor, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether the office of regent of the State University is vacated when the regent removes from the dis - trict by which he was elected. In answer to your question, I will nay "Yes." If a regent who is elected from a certain district and by the electors of that district, removes permanently from the dis - trict in which he resided at the time he wan elected and for which he was elected, his office by that act of removal be - conips vacant. But, a regent who was elected by the state at large, as regents were elected prior to the amendment of the Constitution in 1920, does not vacate his office by such removal. Section 10, Art. VII, Constitution of Nebraska, con - tains the proviso: "That the regents elected before the adoption of this Constitution shall serve out their respective terms and that the successors of those whose terms expire in January, 1923, shall be elected from districts </seg>

Prior to the amendment of the Constitution, in 1920, the section providing for the government of the University by regents, read as follows: "The general government of the University of Nebraska shall, under the direction of the Legislature, be vested in a board of six regents to be styled the Board of Regents of the University of Nebraska, who shall be elected by the electors of the state at large, and their term of office, except those chosen at the first election a3 hereinafter provided, shall be six years."

Dear Sir: You ask our opinion as to the conflict between Sec - tions 4220 and 4368, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, which fixes the fiscal year for villages, in the one case as the last Tuesday in April, and in the other case as the first Tuesday in May. The history of the legislation reveals that both of these sections originated in the Act of 1879. Section 4226 in the original Act had no provision in it that the last Tuesday in April should be the beginning of the muni - cipal year. The Act of 1879 did contain the provision that the fiscal year should l&gt;egin on the first Tuesday in May. The original Act was carried forward and incorporated in Cobby 's Annotated Statutes of 1911. Section 8884 of Cobby's Laws of 1911, was amended by the Session Laws of 1913, page 646, to provide as Section 4226, Compiled (). S. SPILLMAX, </seg>

The old provision of the 1879 laws that the municipal year should begin on the first Tuesday in May does not seem to have been expressly repealed. The courts do not favor rei&gt;eals by implication if a later Act can be reconciled by the former Act. It seems, however, that these two inconsistent provisions are so un - reconcilable that we must conclude that the last expression of the Legislature will govern and that the municipal year begins as provided by the provisions of Section 4226, the last Tuesday in April.

            <seg id="p743">743 1922. Your particular inquiry is to the manner of the joint election of employers and employees not included in those named by the statute as governed by the employers liability law. As stated in your letter, our law permits an employer not named in the act to take advantage of the act by filing a joint election of the employer and employee with the com pensation commissioner of this state. If you have examined the compensation law you will notice that all of those named in the act as bound thereby are considered bound unless they file an election not to be bound by the act. An employee may elect not to l&gt;e ImhuuI by the act l&gt;y ho advising the em - ployer and the compensation commissioner. This same procedure is followed largely in permitting one not named in the act to take advantage thereof. The compensation commissioner requires a financial statement of the ability of the person or corporation to carry its own risks as an employer. Upon filing this with the compensa - tion commissioner and notice of election to foe bound by the act, the employer is so bound. The employer should then post notice in the place of business and notify the employ - ees of his action, in the same manner as provided in other cases, as set forth by Sections :&gt;O.'i.*t and :»U-'»&lt;&gt;. Compiled Statutes, lttt. If an employee, after having lieen notified, desires not to be bound by the act, he should notify both his employer and the compensation commissioner. We believe this answers your inquiry and gives you an idea of the procedure to be followed. For your further in formation we enclose blank financial statement as si form of statement to be submitted to the compensation com inissioner. Very truly yours. Attorney (ienerul.

Kepler, Count}/ Attorney, Sidney, Xebntxka Dear Sir : Your letter of April 17th was duly received. Under the provision* of Section 8C2, Compiled Statutes, 1922, you will note that the board cannot issue a warrant for any amount exceeding 85% of the amount levied for the current year unless there he money in the treasury to the credit of the proper fund. This is some indication that warrants might be drawn up to 85% of the levy for the year. On the other (). S. KI'ILLMAN, </seg>
            <seg id="p747">747 hand, we find. Section 864, Compiled Statutes, 1922, which provides that after 85% of the amount levied for the year is exhausted and there is no fund in the treasury for the payment of claims, they are not chargeable against the county but may be collected by civil action from the county board drawing nuch warrants. This indicates there might be some degree of danger if the county board should draw warrants for salaries earned and which should have been paid by the previous levy. If this previous levy is insuffi - cient it would seem that the county board could not be com - pelled to issue a warrant for more than 85% if the previous fund was exhausted and no funds in the treasury. Likewise, it would seem that while future contracts may be entered into in anticipation of the levy, the salaries are under a previous contract so far as the present year is concerned, and that the future levy was intended for the salaries to be paid under that levy. In this connection would cite you to the case of Patter - son r. State, 2 (Unof.) Neb. 7G5, wherein the court aaid that the mandamus proceeding could not be maintained. The court further stated on page 767, that if the money was not in the hands of the treasurer no warrant could tie legally drawn against it. It seems in your case that the fund upon which these warrants would l&gt;e drawn is exhausted. Until that fund is replenished it would therefore seem their might be some danger in drawing warrants against it in anticipation of the new levy for the present salaries. Very truly yours, O. S.

It is the opinion of this department that the warrants in question should be paid out of the taxes levied for the year 1922, and cannot properly be paid out of the taxes levied for 1923, unless a part of the tax levied for the year was avowedly levied for the purpose of taking care of de - ficiencies arising in 1922, so long as any claims properly payable out of the general fund levy for 1923 remain unpaid.

There is no suggestion in the letter of any authority 10 draw warrants in an unlimited amount or upon funds which have not been voted or provided for in sonic way. The writer is of the opinion that in strict law the township officers do not have the legal right to draw war - rants u|N&gt;n a fund which is not in existence and which i« contingent upon the favorable action of the electors at the annual town meeting next year. I may add that, in my opinion, township warrants mm not negotiable instru - ments and the township, even though they have been sold to an innocent purchaser, may inter]&gt;ose any defense against their payment which it could have interposed against the original holder of the warrant. It has l&gt;een so held as to county and school district warrants and I see no reason why there should not be a like holding in the case of township warrants.

If the warrants are issued in violation of the law they are void as against the county. Section 864, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 19±2. provides: "Any warrant drawn after eighty-five per cent of the amount levied for the year is exhausted, and where there are no funds in the treasury for the payment of the same, shall not be chargeable as against the county, but may be collected by civil action from the county board making the same, or any member thereof." Section MS, &lt;\&gt;mpiled Statutes of Nebraska. 1 if-'-, provides that it is unlawful for the county l&gt;oard to issne warrants for my amount exceeding the aggregate of eighty - five per cent of the amount levied bv tax for the current year, except there l&gt;e money in the treasury to the credit of the pMpar fund for the payment of the same. Warrants </seg>

Oauxs Co., 66 Neb. 191. ) It is probable that if the warrant is drawn against some specific fund, in which fund there is money to meet the warrant, that the warrant would bo valid, but the warrants must not be drawn in violation of the sections referred to. WATER roWER— EXTEX8IOX OF TIME. The department of public works has power in the event of abnormal conditions to extend the time within which the diversion works must be completed. Hon. R. L. Cochran, State Engineer, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In response to your oral request for an opinion from this department, aN to what measures should l&gt;e taken to dear your records of what air apparently overlapping appropriations of water from the Loup River for power purposes, and to determine who has the prior right to such water, I will nay I understand the parties interested in Application No. 709, have failed to comply with the provisions of statute in the matter of making reports to your de|mi-tinent. also that the extension of time hereto - fore granted by the dejKtrtinent for the completion of the work called lor by tlu» terms of the grant of the appropria - tion expired lonji ago, while the work has not l&gt;een com - pleted, and in fact is apparently no nearer completion than it was five years ago. </seg>
            <seg id="p753">OPINIONS 753 I further understand that the Water Power District of Omaha, which it was proposed to form for the purpose of using the water of the Loup River for water power pur - poses, and in whose behalf Application No. 1548 was made, lias never been organized. In view Of these fact*, permit me to suggest that yon fix a day for a hearing to determine whether said appropriations should be cancelled, and give due notice of the time of such hearing to all parties interested therein. On the question of the right of the detriment to extend the time given to appropriatora to complete their work, I call your attention to the second paragraph of the syllabus In re Babaon, reported in 180 Northwestern, at page 562 thereof, which reads as follows: "The department of public works in event of abnormal conditions, such as these created by the World War, has discretion to extend the time within which the work of diverting water for power purposes, under a permit previously given, may be completed."

            <seg id="p754">754 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL does not forbid women serving on the election board more than nine hours a day or between the hours of 10 :00 P. M. and 6 :00 A. M. at the general city election held in the City of Omaha. The only classes of females to whom the law refers are those employed in manufacturing, mechanical and mercan - tile establishments, in laundries, hotels and restaurants, in offices and by public service corporations, and even the female employees of public service corporations may work between the hours of 10 :00 P. M. and 6 :00 A. M. Members •of the election board do not belong to any one of the above enumerated classes. Lin the case of State v. Crounse, reported in 181 N. W. page 562, it was held that the World-Herald Publishing mpany was not within the Act prohibiting employment of female labor between the hours of 10:00 P. M. and 6:00 A. M. or for more than nine hours a day in cities of the metropolitan and first class. In the instant case all the reasons exist that determin - ed the holding in that case and in addition thereto one other. The members of the various election boards are not employees strictly speaking — they are public officers. They take an oath of office and their compensation is fixed and their duties defined by statute. Very truly yours, O. S. SPILLMAN, Attorney General By GEO. W. AYRES, Assistant Attorney General </seg>

(2) That the employment of female telephone opera - tors by hotels and department stores between the hours of 10 p. m. and K a. m. in any city of the nietrojtolitan class or first class in this state is forbidden by statute.

            <seg id="p757">OPINIONS 757 WOMEN— LABOR LAW— NEWSPAPER. A newspaper publishing company engaged exclusively in printing and publishing a daily newspaper is not a manufacturing nor a mechan - ical establishment as such terms are used in the statute regulating the hours of labor for women. Deputy Secretary of Labor, IAncoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You submit to this department for its opinion upon the matters therein discussed a letter received by you under date of February 14, 1924, from the Norfolk Daily News. I note the letter says : "Will you please give us your opinion of the application of the Child Labor Law of Nebraska in the case of the employment of car - rier boys for newspapers under the following conditions?" In answer to the question asked by the "'News," I will say that assuming the public schools close at 4 p. in., I do not l&gt;elieve there is any violation of law in the employment of boys under fourteen years of age to deliver ]&gt;apers under the circumstances outlined in the letter. The occupations in which the employment of children under fourteen years of age is prohibited are set forth in Section 76fi9, Compiled Statutes, 1922 edition, which reads as follows: "No child under fourteen years of age shall be employed, permitted or suffered to work in, or in connection with any theatre, concert hall, or place of amusement, or in any mercantile institution, store, office, hotel, laundry, manufacturing establishment, bowling alley, passenger or freight elevator, factory or work shop, or as a messenger or driver therefor within this state. No person, firm or corporation shall employ any child under fourteen years of age in any business service what - ever during the hours when the public schools of the school district in which the child resides are in session." It is quite clear that the business carried on by "The Norfolk Daily News" is not to be classed with most of the occupations as set forth above, in which child labor is pro - hibited, and, in the case of State r. Croume, decided not Hon. L. B. Frye, </seg>
            <seg id="p758">758 very long ago by the supreme court of this state, it was "A newspaper publishing company, engaged exclusively in printing and publishing a daily newspaper, though it employs machinery and mechanical labor in its operation, is not a manufacturing nor a mechan - ical establishment, as such terms are used in the statute regulating the hours of labor for women." fe Doubtless, the ruling would be the game in the instant and by a parity of reason, I am of the opinion it d be held that a newspaper is no more a factory or shop than it is a manufacturing establishment.

WOMEN— LABOR LAW— NURSES. rale nurses in training in hospitals of metropolitan cities and cities of the first class are not within the provisions of the female labor law, which forbids working for more than nine hours during any one day or more than fifty-four hours in one week or between the hours of 10 P. M. and 6 A. M. E. Luther B. Frye, missioner of Labor, oln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In your letter dated February 13, 1924, you say: "Will you kindly give us your opinion as to whether hospitals come under the provisions of the Female Labor Law of this state?" tine only provision of statute bearing upon this ques - 8O far as I have been able to ascertain is 8ection , Compiled Statutes, 1922 edition, which reads as </seg>
            <seg id="p759">OPINIONS 759 "In metropolitan cities and cities of the first class no female shall be employed in any manufacturing, mechanical or mercantile estab - lishment, laundry, hotel or restaurant, office or by any public service corporation in this state more than nine hours during any one day or more than fifty-four hours in one week. The hours of each day may be so arranged as to permit the employment of such female at any time from six o'clock A. M., to ten o'clock P. M., but in no case shall such employment exceed nine hours in any one day, nor shall such female be employed except by public service corporations between the hours of 10:00 P. M. and 6:00 A. M." It ig quite clear I think that hospitals are not manu - facturing, mechanical or mercantile establishments, neither are they laundrys, hotels or restaurants, and so far as nurses in training in such hospitals are concerned, they are not engaged in office work, within the meaning of the statute in ni} T opinion. It follows that if they come under the Female Labor Law at all, it is upon the ground that they are public service corporations, and upon that ques - tion, I will say that in my opinion they are not public service corporations in the sense in which that term is used in the statute under consideration. I am of the opinion that the phrase "public service corporations" as used refers to transportation, electric light and telephone companies, and corporations of like character. Very truly yours, O.

            <seg id="p760">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 760 WORKHOUSE. A workhouse is a distinct institution, separate and distinct from the county jail although the situs may be the same. Mr. J. A. ThraUkill, Sheriff, Loup City, Nebraska Dear Sir: You ask for our construction of Sections 986 to 991, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, particularly as to whether or not these sections, in referring to the work - house mean the county jail. We believe these sections refer to a workhouse as a distinct institution, the site of which includes the county jail, and such other space as may be required for the county jail and workhouse, as provided by these sections. Section 10169, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, refers to the county jail as a distinct institution, and it would seem that the court would have a certain amount of discretion in sentencing prisoners, dependent of course upon the particular offense and the punishment provided. We believe the sheriff in Nebraska is permitted to work prisoners committed to jail where the sentence so provides. If the work of the prisoners is not made a part of the sentence, or if the prisoner is not sentenced to the workhouse, we would be inclined to think that the sheriff would have no right to work the prisoner, but that the confinement would be in strict accord with the commit - tnt. If the judge's sentence requires that the convict imprisoned in the jail in the county, then he should be confined. If the sentence requires him to be fed on bread and water he should be fed in that manner, if the sentence is to hard labor then it should be hard labor in the jail, and if he is sentenced to the workhouse we believe </seg>

A specific provision of statute relative to the inspection of scales in certain classes of cases prevails over the more general provisions of statute relative to the inspection of scales generally. Mr. Wymer Drcxuler Attorney at Laic, Omaha, Nebraxka. Dear Sir: You call the attention of this department to Section 7590, Compiled Statutes, which provides among other things: "When not otherwise provided by law the secretary of agriculture or his inspectors shall have the power, and it shall be his or their duty to inspect, test, try and ascertain if they are correct, all weights, measures and weighing and measuring devices, kept, offered or exposed for sale, sold or used or employed by any proprietor, agent, lessee, or employee in proving or ascertaining the size, quantity, extent, area, or measurement of quantities, things, produce or articles of distribut - tion or consumption purchased or offered or submitted by such person or persons for sale, hire or award:" • * • and also to Section 5347, Compiled Statutes, "which reads as follows: "All track scales used by common carriers for the purpose of weighing freight shipped in carload lots within this state shall be under the control and direction and jurisdiction of the commission and subject to inspection by it or under its direction." </seg>
