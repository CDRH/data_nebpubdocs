            <seg id="p040">40 who 1* engaged in the ice business here, would have officiated in tklc position in person, but explained to me that he wanted the meeting to be a success in every way and therefore wanted to avoid all suggestions of a frost. I think that was carrying his business ideas too far. When I was asked to speak to you this afternoon, I was told that I ould be put down for the opening address. As I knew very little about he subject of horticulture and its allied branches, I began to post up. subscribed for a farm Journal and 1 have been reading it carefully for he past few weeks. I have been perusing all the seed catalogues I could nd at home so as to read up on floriculture. I tried to locate my her - barium that sorrebody borrowed of me when I was under Doctor Bessey the University, but I could not find it. I got all the facts that were omnlled In the newsnaiiers containing an account of the Pinchot - nallinper controversy so as to learn all about the subject of forestry, ltorether. I selected what I considered a fund of valuable information, had arraneed it in elegant and interesting order, when one day I met r. McCandlasB on the street. T asked him how long he expected me talk in this opening address. He said: "Oh, a couple of minutes — ree minutes. Just extend a welcome, giving them the keys of the ty, and then sit down." You can Imagine how I felt after having orked so hard to prenare myself for this occasion. I feel one consols on and that is that this society will miss more than I will. However, you are here more for work than recreation. I am sorry that we have so few thlnes in Wyrnore in the way of public institutions to show you. Tf you had met with us a few years ago. we might have taken you south of here and shown you one of the largest peach orchards ■here was then in the state, and. possibly. In the West. But that orchard has now gone to decay and back to the farm. We have in Wymore, in erabryotic state at present, a park system of which we feel rather proud. The origin of the system is due entirely to the interest and enthusiasm of our fellow-townsman, Mr. McCandiass. We believe that the day Is not very far distant when our arrangement of parks will be a credit to his forFslrht, to the city of Wymore and southeastern Nebraska. The work of this society, in my judgment, cannot be overestimated in the West and uartlcularly in the state of Nebraska, which, up to the present time, has been purely an agricultural state in the sense that work has been placed unon the soil for the purpose of gaining financial returns. Hut In the future more thought and attention will have to be given to floriculture as well as horticulture. In order to make the state uni form we should have flowers and trees; and when that time comes, tuch men as Morton, the father of Arbor Day, and Pollard, the man of orchards, will be given due credit for the work they have done. If my time was not limited, I would now be giving my speech proper, but as T have been cut off — The President: Go ahead, go ahead I will conclude b/ again extending to you a sincere welcome, with the hope that yon have a profitable and pleasant meeting. Tf your sea </seg>
            <seg id="p041">41 «lons are not largely attended, tt undoubtedly will be because the farmers are very busy at this season of the year. But I assure you that the people of Wymore are with you so far as their heart* are concerned, and we hope you will have a very successful session. [Applause.] RESPONSE. PRESIDENT HARBISON tThls Incident reminds me of a country church where they had pur ised an organ set to play forty tunes without stopping. There was no one who knew how to regulate It or to stop tt after it had once started. So upon this Sunday, after It had been started and they could not stop it, the minister appointed a committee to set it out upon the lawn. I thought our speaker here would not be troubled that way. We would have liked to have had him go along and give us two or three tunes at least. Plow. I would say that your beautiful city has quite a reputation on unt of its parks. The park system is immensely important in con- Ion with a village, hamlet or city. It Is a new idea comparatively, as only a few years ago that a city with parks was hardly thought Chicago was parkless for a long time. Central Park, New York, they have been adding to It for some time. Boston has a system of parks ?nd a most magnificent one of 150 acres. Then there Is another large park connected with this by a splendid boulevard. That contains nearly a wf stern section of land. Then there other parks in connection ■iith that. The idea of bringing the country right into the heart of the i-ity and giving the people a chance to rest is one of the great things of the present century. Lin Boston T have watched the poor women coming Into the park with t tired look with sickly looking children. Only five cents brings them to the gate of a most magnificent park, and they go and alt there and rest. What is wanted for this seething population of overworked men nnd women is rest. Sometimes they do not overwork — they don't exactly dodge it. but there are those who do work and they worry. Once in 2 while a man thinks he doesn't have to work, and he lives by his wits and his capital. But those who work so as to be tired out need a good comfortable seat in the park to rest, and a seat in a beautiful home. We did not think much of this when we were plowing up Nebraska prairies and making tremendous efforts simply to pay for the farm. Pt those frontier days are past. We are entering upon a new de - nent altogether. Years ago men came to this great country plod - along with an ox team at the rate of thirty miles a day.

Those pioneer days are past on the verge of an era of advancement, an era of parks, an era of lovely homes and luxuries. We are on the verge of a most magnificent development all over the country. Think of a beautiful home richly adorned and tastefully arranged. Think of one such home E" its influence. Think of a farm put to its very best — that is the il— we want farms put to their very best. Beautiful homes and sur ndinpK will add thousands of dollars to the value of the farm. A farm in this condition surrounded by a beautiful home would be a sort of mecca to which people would flock. What one man can do another ran do and then others would see what' they could do, and, in this way, this influence would spread ao that the whole section would soon be beautified. Surely this influence would still further spread so that the whole township would be put to its very best. All this is within the range of possibility. Tou would then see people coming in for hundreds of miles to look at those things. So, I say, we are Cht on the verge of a stupendous development. It is coming. While is possible that many of us will be silent when it comes, yet I tell i the time is coming. People will then remember some of the things I have uttered. The works published by me will live after me. I repeat it, my friends, that we are on the verge of a new era, an era of beautiful parks and beautiful homes. [Applause.! The President: We will now listen to a paper entitled "The Home Beautiful." by Mrs. .1 A. Reuling, of this place. THE HOME BEAUTIFUL MBS. J. A. BECLING. WTMORE. Fur city's welfare is our just concern and who promotes that best, proves his duty. Literally speaking not every one can own the "house beautiful," but every one may own the "home beautiful," the home of well kept lawn and garden, showing care of trees and shrubs'. Each one of us is a unit in the community of which we may be a part, responsible in a way for our own door-yard, our own street, our own town. A well kept lawn is the foundation for the home beautiful. The care 01* this means ozone for the lunga, red blood, sound sleep and health Vext to bodily health the Influence of the open-air work makes for Koodness, for it is easy to be good In an environment of beauty and Y&gt;eace It Is not at all necessary that the lawn be a large one, or that the bouse be fine or artistic. The satisfaction of caring for and having </seg>
            <seg id="p043">43 pleasurable than achievement without competition and for this reason prizes offered to children for the best kept lawns or flowers often prove s benefit even if there be but one or two to be the winners of the prizes, it is well for the defeated to have teen In the race and again. it has a tendency to the co-operation of those who may live on a certain street or square and may extend to that much to be desired quality, 'civic pride." With a well kept lawn comes a desire for cleanliness, and cleanliness, you know, is next to Godliness, but unlike it, cleanliness « largely a matter of education. Many people are Inclined to think this •duration a function of the public schools, but I contend we have already ;&gt;ut too many such duties on our overworked and underpaid school teachers and that the work shall be done by individual members, along rhe line of settlement work, that a lawn well cared for has its influence on every citizen and has a tendency to make us better members of our ■ ommunity. To borrow from a well known author, each well kept lawn added to t community is like another lighted candle added to a room." We s all imitators and the examples net by such surroundings will prove Inspiration year after year. The growing of a few annuals in well chosen places with attention to the massing of colors adds much to the appearance of the home beautiful. In our soil I have found that salvias. petunias, and nastur Mums thrive exceptionally well. Cannas, especially the hardier and coarser leaved varieties, are easily grown ana the bulbs with little care may be kept from year to year. But it is hardly necessary to depend upon seeds and bulbs when Nebraska offers such a wealth of vines, shrubs and flowers that may be had for the seeking. In this day of conservation would it not be well for us to make uae of nature's gift to us here in Nebraska, the home beautiful. We hare. ! am told, eight varieties of lilies in our state. The common wood violet makes an effective border and shows much improvement In color and size with some little cultivation. Our wild roses found in every part of the state are easily transplanted and are effective in beds or borders. The morning glories, that so soon become troublesome weeds, may be - come ornamental by Judicious care. And too, our Nebraska emblem, the goldenrod, is well worth transplanting. The woodbine and the wild grape may be used on arbors and to clothe unsightly sheds and fences, and for backgrounds and hedges, the elder and the sumac give a pleasing touch of color. Situated as it is, Nebraska has been particularly endowed in the varieties of flowers and vines, the states east of us have con - tributed to her wealth, the plains of southwestern Texas and New Mex ico, as well as the Dakotas, and tae Rocky Mountain states have given as of their best so that Nebraska affords an unique- illustration of the flowers of all these neighboring states. With this natural wealth of plants all that is nee wary to have flowers and shrubs is a- visit to oa&gt; woods and fields to find well rooted plants. Besides giving us a ijt$tm icnowladg* of our own flora we are conserving our natural reaouroea </seg>
            <seg id="p044">44 IMKAKKA UTATK HOHTICUNTUKAr, BOCtWTT The trees selected (or the home beautiful must depend largely on the ■lie of the lawn, and here I wish to urge the planting and protecting or our native trees. The several varieties of elm, the hsrkberry, the ash, the honey locust and the basswood furnish abundant varieties for the lover of native trees. Nebraska claims sixty-four varieties of native trees and while possibly there is no place in the state where all tbes* species grow together, Gage county Is exceptionally rich in the number found. The Blue river served as the great common carrier In the ages past, the great highway for the migration of plant life, from Missouri and Kansas. After all, is there anything better to find nut. than what In rroing on In the world about us? The love of beauty is growing and although it was once thought to be the prerogative of the rich, is now known to be the right of every citizen. Civic consciousness is awakening and women are beginning to acknowledge that city keeping or home keeping is closely allied to house Kplnf?, that environment subtily moulds our temperamentR and makeR creatures happy and contented or otherwise. We have the possibilities of an ideal environment within our town, an excellent system of parks, wide streets, good walks and an abundance of trees and by our individual efforts first and then by the united efforts we will have and are having a Wymore, the home beautlfu!. DISCUSSION IJTO BY A. I). M'rAXDLAHfi Er. McCanclass: Mr. Pietident. Ladxei and (ientle mm— Like Mr. ullen, I make no preparation for this address. In fact, I make It a never to make any such preparation. Without preparation I feel that I can draw freely from matters and things incident to the occasion and the subject. But this subject is so interesting to me, and as the society has honored my home town with their summer meeting, I made up my mind that I would make gome preparation for the meeting. So I got up early last Sunday morning so that I would not miss preparation and the church, too. You all remember that story of the spider that changed the destinies of all Europe. Some fellow who was incarcerated In a cell saw a spider crawling up the wall and falling down time after time took courage from this and succeeded. I am not so well posted in history and cannot speak his name Just now; and, then, whenever I ask a friend about anything it Is more than likely he does not know any more about the matter than I do. But the fact is that in this case it was not a spider that interfered with my plans. I arose in the morning all right. In getting my own breakfast I found the sugar bowl full of ants — the ant la closely allied to a spider, anyway, so I had to go to work and clean oat the sugar bowl, and then the next thing was the pantry, and la so </seg>
            <seg id="p045">45 Ebut I found paper had Ix-en chewed up into mice nests. After I had pantry cleaned out I had to clean out the cellar, so that, as a matter let, I did not get to go church, neltner did I prepare the talk that is to give here today. In arranging the program i had the presence of mind to put Mr. McMullen down for the opening address, expecting that he would talk all the afternoon, and in that event, I would not have to say anything. In this case, again, my presence of mind did not avail me anything, it didn't work out to do me any good. There were some Jews that went down to Florida during the winter and got mixed up In a railroad wreck, but none of them got hurt very badly. But representatives of the railroad interviewed them soon after - wards, and Jacob said he would settle for $500. Little later on he heard that Isaac had settled for $2,500, so he went around to see him. He says: "Isaac, bow is this? I heard you got $2,500. I settled for $600." Isaac said: "When that car turned over I had the presence of mind to kick Rachel in the face. So 1 had some damages coming." 1 told the committee that if they would hold their summer meeting here we would have a house full of people at the meetings — have a band out to meet them and all that. At that time I was park commis - sioner of Wymore and everything was going along smoothly. I thought we could do it. But I have been removed as park commissioner — I have been removed twice. Every time they remove me they put three men in my road — that is, they try to. They used to say it took two tailors to make a man;" but there it is again about history, and I can't give it straight — but It takes two men bo fill a position here. We have two park commissioners. One has lost interest in horticulture. They are overlooking one-half of our interest. Phave got our saloons, too. We have been working to get rid of them good while, but they slipped in on us this spring. But we have a wonderful sentiment in favor of parks. We have embarked on the greatest park system ever known. Down here by the depot there la a plot of ground consisting of several lots. I have been preaching this park matter for a long time, and when the question came up as to what they should do with that plot of ground, or how to get rid of It, someone said: "Oh, go up and ask McCandlass, that crazy old fool! He will take it for a park." So they didn't have to come up and see me. The idea had got started. I drafted the ordinance and it has been read the first time. The people are in favor of it, and we are going to take that and plat it for a park and add it to the park system of Wymore. We rll move the depot farther along toward the west, and we will have park there of 700 or 800 feet long. The council meets tonight and I believe it will adopt the ordinance. It will be a great improvement to the city, and it will have a great tendency to give our town a horti - cultural beauty to people who pass through here on the cars. Some of you have seen some of our beer houses and I know yon have ni|ii— — il </seg>
            <seg id="p046">46 yourselves concerning them. But it is wonderful how the interest In parks continues to grow when you knock out saloons, and as the saloons go out we knock in the porks. That is my experience. Parks are more permanent and don't have to be knocked out but we knock in one every year. They are like plants; it don't hurt them to get wet I am credited with having started the park system. After I had lired here about twenty years I discovered there was something wrong a ith the town. I could not think what it might be, except it might be pretty close to Blue Springs and not far from Lincoln. I got to looking around, but could not think of anything or any way to help the town out; we had tried almost everything. But the park idea was suggested. There was a fellow who got behind with his taxes and the question arose as to what we should do in the matter. I said take the ground for a park and use It for a park. They accepted and acted on my advice and are using it today as a park. We have plenty of nice homes. I was pleased with Mr. McMulien'e address. He might have said home beautiful, as my friend Gates would have amid, but beautiful in a literary way it may be a plain little cottagi of a poor man, a man who works ten hours a day and is stubbing along trying to raise his family, yet around that little home there will be a climbing vine at the end of the porch, there will be a beautiful foliage around a circle bed in the driveway, and even the back yard may be ornamented. It is not absolutely necessary that the back yard shall be a dumping ground. We have just commenced our work in Wymore along the lines of beautiful homes. We had to get some parks first, because we didn't know how else to dispose of these patches of ground, so we will now get tbe beautiful homes started. There is one started in our part of town. Near that park you could not buy one of those lots there for $400, and now there is getting to be some beautiful homes near that park. If I was going to speak of beautiful homes and describe them according to the inmates of loving parents, thrifty and studious, with a loving family growing up around them, I could describe hundreds of them. If I was going to describe beautiful homes according to architectural beauty, I could describe but very few. If I was going to point out to you homes made beautiful by flowers, trees, ornamental gardens and that kind of enterprise, 1 could show you hundreds of them in Wymone. although we are not noted for fine bouses or rich people. We hare neither in Wymore. We are a plain, hard-working people, industrious As I said, we are making a beginning along the lines of beautiful homes. We have a cemetery association here composed principally of ladles who have taken hold of the cemetery work. Since they hare come into it the association has improved wonderfully. It is quite a respectable place now, and is becoming more beautiful every day. It does not take money, as Mrs. Reuling said, to make a beautiful home, but it does take education to make it. Yon must know how to beautify </seg>
            <seg id="p047">47 There is one place where our common school system is weak, they don't teach it in our schools how to make a home. The foundation and sta - bility of our country and government is In the home, and there is where the ornamental decorations of our homes should be taught. Children should be taught to beautify the home; then, when the future generation comes on, we would have beautiful homes indeed, homes filled with music, books, and homes where the wife would be a helpmeet as well as a companion, and homes where love and honor would stand forever at the threshold, f Applause.] The President: That closes our program for this afternoon, but I see Mr. dates in the audience and we would like to hear from him. Rev. Mr. Gates: Mr. President. Ladies and Gentlemen — I did not i.ome here expecting to speak. If you were to ask me how to build a church, perhaps I could give some information upon the subject, but as to now to make a home beautiful, my experience has not been exten - sive because it has been along the line of Improving somebody else's property; it has been the property of the church that I have had any hand in. tl believe we can tell a great deal of the people who live in a town community by the taste that is manifested on the outside as well as the Inside of the home. We can go by the different homes in a town I note the way the lawn is kept, the way the trees are put out and trimmed, and the flowers that are planted — we can tell a great deal, at least of the individual taste, of those people. To me those things are significant of character or the lack of character. I am just a little bit partial toward that individual who is careful of the keeping of the outside conditions of the home. I think he will be careful, also, in matters of honor, and matters of his own individual standing in the community and he is apt there to exercise care. I think these things are catching. Let the property be fixed up on the corner and it won't be long until each property along that street has been transformed by improvement and fixing like the property ad - joining it. If you will excuse a little bit of personal reference, I will mention that about two years ago — I bought the worst looking piece of property for the church in the town where I was then located. It had an old, dilapidated looking house, said to be the oldest in the town. It was '.a an old town in the northern part of Indiana. I purchased the three lots and house. It had in it large black walnut sills and beams The frame was made just like they used to make the timber for barns of that day, 12x12, and these were of solid black walnut. I tore down the house, and put up a modern church, and built a parsonage alongside of it; and graded the lawn, put in cement walks; put up a retain wall, put in nice beds of flowers with foliage of cannas and made the lawn beautiful. I tried to work two hours a day to keep that lawn beautiful </seg>
            <seg id="p048">48 W El, it wu not long before every other property on that «treet ws» led and the lawns beautified, and it was the nicest street in the town ie of two year?. At first it was the worst, dilapidated old place, the t forlorn In the town. tarn glad for having the privilege of speaking to you and of meeting you. I have no prepared speech, and do not care to encroach upon time. [Applause.] The President: We are very glad, Indeed, to have our brother spea There is one thing I would like to emphasize and that is that we d uot use our inheritance. We do not use our own property — we do n reach out and take our own. When a person does that he is astonish find out how much belongs to him. I like the idea that Paul presented us. You know that when that man started out he was a home m onary society, a foreign missionary society; he was a theological pro - esBor; he was a minister and he was a teacher, all combined In one. it had started out on the present regime he would have needed sever ouaand dollars back of him. He was all gathered together. He had thorough training, and he started out not only to support himself b support his co-laborers. He used to work day and night. Paul, wit tat kit of tools, could defy the whole army of Satan, and shake a Asia. If he had not had an education at hand, an educated brain as we an educated heart, he would have made a failure of it. But becau he reached out and took the whole thing in he became the sublime ■access. I like the style of that man's preaching. I built, or helped uild, sixteen churches, and I moved around considerable. I never lived a parsonage but once. I built ten houses for myself. tThe idea of a man sitting down with dyspepsia and preaching dys - sia sermons I do not admire. He had better move around and have a little life in him. That is the way to do. There is a slogan I want people to take up and carry on this great work — the common people, the bomemakers, the farmers and everybody else. "Beauty Is wealth," mark that; therefore, raise a whole lot of it and be rich. It may be very difficult indeed for a person to gather four or five thousand dollars to build a magnificent home. If you only knew it you could have a beau ■iful home for your own care. Some years ago, after preaching over forty years with nerves all gone and this body fit for the ash-pile, be - lieving that Osier was going to chloroform me, all men over sixty years old — I was a man all broken down, just making a living but with lots of experience, broken in health and wealth, with the wolf at the door and nothing to go on, what was I going to do! I made up my mind that *ith heart within and God o'erhead, I would go ahead and do something. So I commenced ornamental horticulture. Out of my head and with nothing in my hands but the assistance of the great Counselor I went to work and succeeded. EAa I said, you may not be able to get three or four thousand dollars put Into a fine home. Perhaps you could put a few hundred dollars— </seg>

Remember, I said beauty Is wealth — why, one single carnation sold for $30,000, and that was the beginning of its history. Then, there is the peony; there is money in the growing of these. We have heard of the wealth of India and the treasures of the mine. They are nothing com - pared with the wealth and riches that is all around us. You have heard of that carpet of jewels made of sapphires, rubles and all the treasures of India gathered together in one magnificent carpet. You can have a ret far richer in beauty that that — yes, millions of people can have It may not wear as long, perhaps, but while it lasts, oh, how beau- Just think of it, beauty is woman's anyway. She suffers and she jiinee for It, and sometimes she even dies for the lack of it. I met a lady in Minnesota a few days ago. She was telling me of the desolation of that way off Dakota farm where she nearly died. But her husband went into the nursery business on a small scale and began to get flowers and that woman has been dwelling in Elysium ever since. She has be come ten years younger. They kept adding little more and little more ro their business. Suppose you have a humble home. You might better go to work and adorn it than to wait for a larger one. Suppose, for instance, you get ueonies. They continue a long while in bloom. We have many varieties. For some we have paid $5 and even $10. They multiply very fast and from a small planting in ten years there ought to be something like a thousand. Then, there is the syringa and the honeysuckle. There is one which is a marvelous plant from Manchuria. It is very vigorous and grows up straight and is compact. Suppose you have a flower garden and surround it with varieties of honeysuckle. There are many beautiful flowers that will grow readily with very little care. Then, there are those phloxes. I have spent many years in the grow ing of phloxes and have published a work on phloxes so that if any man. woman or child cares to they can produce even finer ones than I have. I have succeeded in getting thirty different varieties. I have made in - structions so plain in this manual than any child, even, if direction are followed, can grow them with success. The children are delighted with the beauty of those creations of their own. One gentleman said that from norne seedlings there was one flower he would not take $10, and that from another he was selling at 50 cents apiece. With a little care and research you will get at the fountain head. This study Is one of the most beautiful experiences that you cab have and you don't know when to stop. You are In the very land of Elysium, the land of delight Commence raising phlox and when you </seg>
            <seg id="p050">50 get tome new creations joupre fascinated with them. You lock at inem one day, and the next day, and then you raise some more and you want to visit these, and then you are in the edge of the unknown and out of the invisible, and there comes to you forms of loveliness which your eye has never seen, and you ran originate new ones. You don't have to pay a high price for them. Perhaps 25 or 50 cents apiece will give you a good start. Don't rest with one or two specimens. A lady one, said she only wanted three. I said you want more. k Plant an abundance. Surround yourself with plenty of these things, i ran so arrange it so as to have a procession of beauty from early sprint; until late fall. First of all, the tulips; then comes the columbines which use up all the colors of the rainbow; then those oriental poppies, mixed with some single flowers, nine inches across with their bloom of scarlet; then a little further on the peonies come in bloom, vieing with each other as if on dress parade. Go out and see them drill; they are like so many maidens each trying to see which can put on the most beautiful garment as if preparing for their nuptials. These annuals are very beautiful. When you plant them they stay planted. You can depend upon them year after year. Next in this beauty procession comes the phloxes. They commence blooming in July and continue blooming until frost. So all along your pathway you can follow up this procession of beautiful blooming flowers by a tasteful arrangement of the lawn. Thirty-five dollars will fix up that yard and make it a tit accompaniment to the flowers to make that home beautiful, and in that way will have the appearance of a two or three thousand dollar mansion. A house will begin to depreciate, and if you put in fine furniture it will soon begin to depreciate and afterwards will be second-hand. But if you plant trees and adorn your lot and lawn it will ever be on the increase in value. I have known many instances where the owner would not accept $100 apiece for his trees, and some trees that J500 would not buy. A lot and a home under these conditions grows in value. Surrounded by such an Ideal home you will not want any vacation — the only vacation you will want will be time to go out and enjoy them. The President: I notice by the program we have a number entitled 'Question Box." What is your pleasure concerning it? P Green: As far as the question box is concerned we had that for neflt or anyone in the audience who might have some questions she might like to have settled or discussed. In such case they write whatever they wish to have answered and hand it in and have it discussed at the next meeting. If anyone of you think of any - thing you would like to know about, just write it on a slip of poper and bring it in at the next session and it will then be taken up before the meeting closes.

            <seg id="p051">51 QUESTION BOX QUESTION BOX Mr. Youngers: 1 am somewhat interested in columbines. 1 believe in thia part of the state there is a white columbine. I have been trying to get gome, as there is none in our neighborhood. President: There are some in the eastern part of the state. Mrs. Reuling: What color? Mr. Youngers: One variety seems to be purple and another lavender Mrs. Reuling: I believe I saw some in here some years ago. E. Yager: In regard to the columbine, we have a columbine on the river that we think exceeds in beauty our tame columbine. We successfully transplanted it from along the Platte river into our is and it grows better than the tame. The President: What color is it? R Yager: Well,. I would have to say I could not tell just now exactly. :hink it is purple. We think they are very fine. We do not get aa colors as you do in the tame, but they bloom longer. They are in now, and we think a good deal of them. In this connection I will say that I am more and more impressed with the fact that people often - times overlook many of the wild native varieties that are found growing in our own neighborhood and locality that are so well suited to their locality in their haste to get something better, longing for and willing to accept anything except the things at home. The President: Yes, and I would mention as an illustration the wild snapdragon which grows along the Platte. I have seen it growing very large and beautiful. I gathered seed and planted. It is quick in culti vation. tfr. Youngers: There is the crimson hibiscus that I have seen | along the Elkhorn river. The President: There are three or four kinds of hibiscus Mr. Brown: There is a verbena growing along the Solomon ri\ have relatives there and they tell me it is getting to be quite a pest. That is where I first saw it, west, on the Solomon river. And there U a bellflower that very much resembles the county bell or the campanula. There is the wild cactus that grows all over the country. The flower is handsome. It is a mass of white flowers. It is a profuse grower; it makes a very good flower. It has a long beard. In early spring we have a nice line of anemone. There is another flower; it is yellow, that we see growing in the native sod; it is not so beautiful, but if brought out it will do well in cultivation. You might secure some of them. One of the handsomest and nicest things I ever saw is Snow on the Mountains. President: It used to grow around Council Bluffs. Mr. Brown: Generally, all over the West and in the western part of the state. I have seen It in Illinois; there they call it the spider plant: it grows about four feet high; I don't know the color. The President: It is a deep blue, I think. Mr. Brown: We see it growing in the western part of the state, out to the mountains </seg>
            <seg id="p052">52 The President: In Illinois we used to make blue ink of it Mr. Yager: There are a whole lot of these things, and I don't set why we don't take some action towards securing these plants. This society is sort of nursery of our state and should take some action towards securing all these different kinds of flowers and bringing them down to Lincoln and putting them in charge of this man here (Mr. W. H. Dunham) at the State Farm. It would certainly be a good move. We would have something to show the people in order that the people might be informed. There are plenty of people who don't know of the existence of many of the plants and flowers around them that would be a benefit to them in the way of ornamenting their homes, and it would be of Rreat benefit to the state in general. I The President: I agree with Mr. Yager. I visited Shakespeare Gar . at Cambridge. Mass., and saw many flowers there of very rare speci Mr. Dole: There are flowers here for everybody, and hope you will avail yourselves of the gift and will wear them on the street; and when the question is asked.

ORNAMENTAL SHRUBS. PHILIP EDI.MO.iKDl l,H SUPERINTENDENT OF PARKS. LINCOLN. I In the few remarks that I may make on ornamental shrubs suited to i climate, and there Is a great variety to choose from, I should like t to make a plea for some of our native shrubs. Take the Rhus or sumac family — our common sumac is not halt appreciated. Take a large mass of them, with their bright, green foliage nd masses of orange red berries, making a beautiful effect, that cannot produced with anything else, well repaying the little cost and trouble planting. Add to this the glorious fall effect of all the tints of the rainbow, and many more besides, making it one of our most useful rubs. Ita more aristocratic brother, the cutleaf variety (Rhus Lanclnata) Is superb with its finely divided leaves, but as it does not crow as tall, if planted in the former group, its place is in the front. nother member of the family (Rhus Cotlnusi. the mist shrub or smoke </seg>
            <seg id="p053">53 tree, is perhaps not quite so well known, but la a very desirable shrub, with Its somewhat ovate, shiny pea green leaves. And large panicles of mlstllke flowers in early June, making it very desirable, either in a group or a single specimen. The common elder (Sambucus Canadensls) is well worth growing for background, especially if enlivened with its golden brother (aurea). This latter makes one of the finest yellow effects that I know of In a large shrub, planted in a group or mass. I The Sympboricarpos, or Snowberry, I will only touch upon, simply ing that the red berried (Vulgaris) and the white berried (Race sus) are both desirable and not used enough in our planting. The next family in hardiness and general usefulness, I think, is the lneas. First, without a doubt, is Van Houttei. In hardiness it is able stand the most severe of our winters without killing back a particle; 111 stand about as much general hardship and abuse as anything we have, and will almost always give us a mass of white, the end of May early in June for about fourteen days. It is well worth growing. If It ever had a bloom at all, for its drooping, graceful habit. Anthony aterer, I think, is the next most desirable of the spiraeas.

It is quite a dwarf, hardly ever exceed g two feet, but ts one of the best shrubs we have for foreground in lrub borders, or wherever a dwarf shrub is suitable. Spiraea arguta. ne of the earliest, with snow white blooms, makes a solid mass of white. t has one small defect, that of portions of the bush dying back in spring. ut those should be cut out, and being a rapid grower, quickly recovers. plrsea sorifolia, or Ashleaf splnea, is very fine in foreground. Its finely ut foliage, almost like a ferm, setting off to the best advantage its large pikes of white flowers. Spiraea Douglas! is the most useful of all the &gt;rlght pink varieties. Its foliage is a somewhat darker shade of green an most of the others, setting off the rosy pink blooms to perfection. Of about seventeen other varieties of spiraea, I will only mention one ow, Opullfolia. It is a strong, rampant grower, with flat heads of white owers. It Is very useful, but has none of the neat graceful beauties the other five mentioned. The common lilac, we are all well acquainted with. It has little to ecommend it except its persistence in growth. When the season is vorable for bloom, it is a beautiful sight, but unfortunately It gets amaged with late frosts, making It very uncertain whether we will see In its beauty for four or five years in succession. Besides this, about the time you think you have a nice bush, along comes Mr. Borer and before you know It, has destroyed several of your main shoots. There are, I believe, about sixty improved varieties, more or less distinct, but will only mention four or five. The old Persian Is a vigorous grower. though with more slender twigs, smaller leaves and small purple owers, generally much better than the common. White Persian, very </seg>
            <seg id="p054">54 &gt; Eillar to the purple. Rowen, much like the Persian, except the foliag&gt; rather large and the flowers are reddish purple. It is a free bloomer lite Rowen, not a very good white, almost pink, but is a good free omer. Siberian White I like, aa far as I have seen it. It is not a •y good white, but Is a free bloomer. The only other I will mention the Japan tree. Thia is perfectly hardy, fend makes a grand display rard the middle of June, with its grayish white blooms, making a very asing white mass. This should be planted more freely. (The Philadelphus, more generally known as syrlngse, are so desirable ,t they are, and should be, used freely in either large or small plant s, grouped or singly. They always make a pleasing picture, will nd lots of neglect and come out smiling with a grand display of purr Ite flowers. French Mammoth, one of the best, I think, grows five six feet tall. Grandlflora Is very similar, with large flowers and sweet fume. Gordons is much later, is very fine and vigorous. Lemoines eta is very sweet, with white clusters of flowers. This should be nted freely. I will just mention the Lonicera, or bush honeysuckle. Marrowi, like some other early grown shrubs, are somewhat neglected. Manchurian and lartarica Grandiflora are splendid, planted and trimmed for hedges, mak ing a very pleasing effect, or planted back of dwarf shrubs and allowed to grow in their own sweet way to hide any unsightly objects, are a decided tThe Privet, or Llgustrum. Go slow on Ovalifolium (generally known California privet), unless you are prepared to take a setback eve d winter. Ligustrum Ibota Is better, but last winter proved a ha il for it. It killed back badly, but recovered so that now you wou dly know that it almost lost caste as a hardy shrub. The Swedls ret did still better and in ordinary winters does not kill back at a , the thing that surprised me most was the little Golden, quite dwarf ely exceeding thirty inches in height, stood the winter almost perfec -ely the very tips being touched and is now in all its golden glor best yellow, dwarf shrub we have. I Of the Viburnums, our old-fashioned snowball (Viburnum Sterilisi it avorite everywhere.

            <seg id="p055">.)KNAMBNTAL 8HIDW 55 Siberian Pea Tree (Caragana arborescens) Is a hardy, very desirable. 'all shrub, somewhat similar to a Laburnum, with bright, yellow flowers early In May. Its. long, composite pea-shaped leaves and erect habit, makes a very pleasing combination. It Is a good shrub for grouping and should be used much more freely than It is. The Japan quince (Pyrus, or Cylonia Japonica). this should be Id every collection, growing three to four feet high, with bright, red flowers, in early spring. It is very useful in masses, single plants, or ornamental hedges. Burning-Bush (Euonymua Wahoo) is one of our best shrubs to pro - duce a fine, tall effect. Its mass of orange red pods of seed makes It very striking. The Flowering Almonds must not be left out. Although they kill back enough to make them a dwarf shrub with us, they almost always retain enough growth to give us a good showing of bloom, early in the spring. The old favorite, hydrangea (Panlculata grandiflora). is too well known to need much space here. Its large heads of white bloom In August, changing to pink In September, recommends it. Its earlier flowering brother (Arborescens grandlflora) is perhaps not so well known. It Is a wonder, commencing to bloom in June, with immense heads of pure white and keeping it up until Paniculata is in bloom. To do their best, the hydrangeas must have rich soil, plenty of sunlight and moisture. I came near leaving out one of the best classes of shrubs that we have, the Berberls. The erect growing kinds (Vulgaris) and (Perpurem) are very similar in growth and habit, but the beautiful purple color of the one makes it much more desirable. They are fine, single, in mass or in a hedge, but best of all three is the dwarf (Japan Thunbergel). Kg spreading habit, rich shining, small leaves, white flowers in May and purplish red berries in the fall and winter makes it, I believe, the best dwarf green shrub for massing, or for a dwarf hedge, that we have. One of the best effects of the kind I ever saw was a solid mass of It on each side of steps leading up to a residence. Prill mention the dogwoods (Cornus) long enough to say that after us a fine, vigorous, healthy, green shrub through the summer and various colored leaves in the fall, they liven up the landscape with bright colored wood all through the winter. The bright red twigged (Stolonlfera), I believe to be the best red, and I have just gotten ac- Knted with its exact counterpart, except that the twigs are a bright ' yellow. I have been looking for a long tim.e for shrub with iw wood as good as Stolonifera is a red. This fills the bill. The king of all the light feathery foliage is the Russian Silver Tain arix. I don't understand why we don't see much more of It planted. It has bright silvery gray foliage, will grow freely in most any good ground, as a specimen can be trimmed to most any shape and makes a very pretty hedge The sprays of the foliage, or Its pretty pink flower*, ran b* uaed </seg>

The Altheas are not quite bo good to get established, but generally. after they get to be some age, they do well. I would advise buying plants from a good reliable firm that have them established, and pay a little more far them, than to buy very small plants shipped in from the Bast and try to get a start with them. They are such a grand shrub when in full bloom in August and September when most of our other hardy floweis are scarce that they will repay a little extra trouble to get them established. If you have a corner tor them, sheltered from the northwest, so much the better. Although there are a number of other shrubs that do well with us, ibere is not time in one paper to try to describe them all. I have tried tc keep to some of the most hardy and easily grown for I think there is much more pleasure and satisfaction in a healthy, thrifty looking plant of any kind (even if they do not cost so much, than in something you have to putter and fuss with to keep it in existence, spending a lot of time over it and then have it die, and then decide that shrubs are no good and will not grow for you. Plant shrubs, plenty of them. We can make a beautiful landscape with comparatively few flowers but we must have shrubs. There is not another thing that will give a cozy, homelike appearance to a residence, whether a cottage or a palace in the city or on the farm, like a liberal use of shrubs. The Chairman: Is there any discussion? DISCUSSION. Mr. Youngers: 1 don't exactly get the name of that privet. Mr. Edinborough: I don't know it by any other name. It is one of the Japanese variety. It will certainly bear all the expression I could give it in praise. I think it Is the best. It did not kill back six Inches. Mr. Brown: What we need is an ornamental hedge that will stand the winter. I saw in Fremont last summer a hedge of spirea. I saw two of them, one of a new growth, and the other ready to bloom. 1 thought the new growth the handsomer of the two. Mrs. Harrison: I have not had very good luck with the privet. Mr. Udlnborough: After I got it started it went right on and did well. It is the northwest wind and frost that is bad for It.

Olrastead, that peat master of landscape construction, will do well to follow nature in planting for harmonious effects. With your permission I will quote the words of Mrs. Van Rensselaer: "If now we ask when and where we need the fine art of gardening, must not the answer be, 'whenever and .vherever we touch the surface of the ground and the plants it bears with the wish to produce an organized result that shall please the eye.' " The name we usually apply to it must not mislead us into thinking that this art is needed only for the creation of hioad landsca"e effects. It does not matter whether we have in mind a great park or a small city square, a large estate or a modest dooryard, we must go about our work in an artistic spirit if we want a good result. Two trees and six shrubs. lawn and a dozen flowering plants iray form either a beau le picture or a huddled disarrav of forirs and colors. Eie development of the grounds about a house should be primarily out for use and convenience. It must be borne in mind that I differ much in climate, soil, in the requirements of the owner and in the amount to be expended. It would therefore seem futile to lay down any hard and fast rules for design, for that which would be suitable for a plain would be unsuited for a hillside. When cost is not an item of consideration, a complete plan should be made by a skilled Wndscai&gt; r gardener who is willing to incorporate as far as possible the trees and plants desired by the owner. Many individuals who hsv&lt;' a rocetal love for nature and have studied the effects of varying forms, sizo and colors of different trees and shrubs are qualified to make a satisfactory plan tor themselves. Once a definite plan Is decided mon do not ch«m?e any detail as it may destroy the unity of the whole sch°me of orna mentation.

A modi Oration of this is to plant an irregular screen of mixed trees and shrubs and herbaceous materials. This last Is a better plan as it gives oppor tunity for a greater variety of ornamental plants. Shrubs are seldom used too much and on a small place they may be used In great profusion because they take up little room. I Two methods of grouping are commonly practiced, I. e.. first, the uplng of many flowering varieties in one mass whereby some kinds f be in bloom at all times from April to November, and, second, th&lt; angement of large masses of one species or variety. The former I generally rive the most satisfaction on small grounds, but on ces of considerable extent by planting many specimens of one kind a group will give the most pleasing results. Another use of shrubs iclously planted to obliterate some of the unpleasant features of the unds. is Irregular grouping along the walls, and massing In retreat - angles of a building with Its smooth surfaces and rectangular lines ling abruptly out of the la-vn: they help to break the line of demarca - i. Curves In walks and drives are made to appear more natural by ups of shrubs and at points where the temptation to cut across tn rten distance on the lawn, they are very useful. I Some shade about the house is necessary for comfort during the b nmer months and for shelter in the winter. Do not plant tree close to the house — forty feet is close enough. Any large establish es should be retained where they do not Interfere with your schen ornamentation, for the most quickly growing trees that we have wi reach the sire to afford much shade under fifteen years of age. O small place do not plant tall trees on the inside, leave these for th »et line. Instead of planting short lived trees, such as willow &gt;lars, birches. Scotch pine and many of the weeping and variegated letles. use oaks, lindens and fir concolor. After you have your trees and shrubs planted for a background, d not forget the hardy herbaceous plants. This class of plants affo more beauty and pleasure for the least expenditure of time and mone For the small nlace the mixed arrangement of planting will be t! moat suitable. Summer flowering plants, such as coleus, geraniums an •-annas, should not be planted in the middle of an open lawn — these can be used to advantage with a good background, along the borde of walks, or clone im to the veranda. These plants produce effect durin the entire season, blooming soon after setting out and continue unt frost. For the bright effect and the pleasure of watching these plan grow they should be encouraged in the right place, which is not th middle of a lawn. Do not make the mistake of overcrowding you plants; most persons want everything in the nurseryman's catalogu Have your place supplied with plenty of water so that the plants can *et an abundance when necessary and plenty of food material, the nurcess Is almost certain </seg>

Ideal effects are not to be attained by the amateur without observe tion and study. Take a good illustrated garden magazine, get outside and study good plantings in our public parks, private grounds, and It possible see such places as the Arnold Arboretum near Boston. DISCUSSION A Member: 1 would like to ask if there is anyone in the room who has had any experience with that Schwedlerii maple. Talk about orna - mental trees for foliage, we want something more on the foliage line, if we can get it; and if it Is hardy it will be of great benefit for Ne - tka. Don't you have some of those maples in your parks here with le leaf? Er. McCandlass: We have some purple-leaved maples in the parks, ley are very slow to start, and have not done much in the time have been planted. I helieve the leaf is green in the spring, but ? fall it turns purple. C. 8. Harrison: I think it is one uf the very finest trees, but it wants the very best of cultivation and care. When it leafs out in the spring it looks like a bank of peonies against the sky. As the leaves «et old they turn to a somewhat purplish green. There are three va rieties and they are variations of the Norway maple. Mr. Edinborough: I would like to mention that I have been trying to get information concerning that maple for several years. We had i meeting in New York last September at which there were represents tives from all the states and there were several questions asked con reining this and the only answer I could get was that it was about as hardy a maple as anything we have. I was somewhat surprised at thosf reports, which were from all over the country. I tried last season with a few plants to get them started, but was not able to do so on account 6 their being so many changes in the season. Next year I shall make effort to get that branch established. Mr. McCandlass: Here. I think is a good chance to make a sug - gestion. This society ought to have a committee on resolutions in re gard to getting matters enacted into law, a provision for the collecting of these different class* .« of plants and trees that we have in Nebraska, and be formulated or classified so that they may be known by English names. So many of our names of plants and trees and shrubs are given in another name, some kind of Latin, Indian and Choc taw conglomera - tion.

I notice that in all the catalogues that I have received about the planting and raising and care of plants, and in conversation upon this association I don't kDow what is meant. Now, the writer of this article speaks about a purple-leaf maple. I have some white pines in my yard — I don't know what you would call them— no doubt it would be some hor rible cognomen. But this is where the trouble comes in with horticulture and floriculture and ali other kinds of culture; they don't use the Eng lien language. It is very embarrassing. I know these species when I see them and by seeing them, but I would like to call them by their English nan., b. 1 hate to show my ignorance. So I wish you would •■onsider this matter when you come to get your catalogues printed that you give the English of these names. If you want to sell me something, say, for instance, a Carolina poplar, don't sell me a cottonwood. Don't &lt; all it by some other name. Call it by what it is. I have been fooled no many times by these horticultural names, and I am beginning to leel revengeful — but pardon me, I am interrupting the program. Mr. Brown: This matter of which Mr. McCandlass speaks comes about from evil associations, I am afraid. Western people are anxiou. - to use the English language in their catalogues, but these names come from the Eastern people. In order to know just exactly what we are ug from the East when we order goods, we have to use the so tailed scientific names. If we were to order, for instance, honey lo - cust* by aiK.thcr name than that which is given in their catalogue, we would be at,, t to get the ordinary black locust. The gentleman spoke about Carolina poplar. The Carolina poplar is different from the cotton wood. There is nothing allied to it nearer than second or third cousins. 1 never si* Carolina poplar come from seeds, and I never saw one that grows with open shaft. It is always pyramidal in form. A Member: Carolina poplar is the male plant of the Eastern cotton wood. It is a different cottonwcod from what grows in the West. Mr. Edinborough: It seems to me as a reason for the use of these botanical names is that they are international and have to be, on that account, but iu local matters these names seem to get badly mixed up One catalogue may take a name one way and another fellow will give the same thing by another name so that there is Just about as much difficulty in l.otanical names as in any other. The Chairman: If there is no further discussion on this subject, we will now listen to a paper by our President, C. S. Harrison, entitled "CoMu-rvation " CONSERVATION.

It was the patient work of ages to spread a thin layer of soil over the rock* and on the hills and mountain sides, and then fasten it there with trees, shrubs and grasses. Mighty rivers flowed to the sea fed by thousands of streams which sang merrily on their way. These streams were care fully protected, forests, bushes and rank vegetation prevented the washing of the soil, while at the sources of all these rivulets there was the most careful planning lo retain the waters. Dead leaves, decay ing trees, mosses and the accumulated deposits of the ages all were like vast sponges to retain the waters so the streams would have an even t, Mighty forests wei • planted. They grew and decayed, and so as centuries passed the land grew richer and richer. E3w artistically all was arranged. There were often delightful parks e forests, and when the woods edged upon the prairies there were trees in the background, shrubs to the front, then the ffower kli'd carpet of green. Elmo ihe forests, the great -temples of God. What massive columns I the dark green canopy. Look where you would, in woodland, and mountain, the a?w of the past had made preparations for the o come. I ht n came the two brothers, graft and greed. With no appreciation whatever of the plans of the Creator. They were ready to kill the finest horse if they could only set his hide. They would burn down a man sion if they could only get the nails. A careless government which to - day from its own natural resources could have had income enough for &lt; urn nt expenses, allowed billions to be taken and destroyed. One or the BOM beautiful sights on earth is a splendid forest. One of the saddest spectacles is to see that same forest the prey of the ax and fire. Those blackened stumps, like the gravestones of departed grandeur. If (he lumberman had planned for the most speedy and utter ruin he could not have prepared a more complete system. He took only half of the tree and left the rest to dry for the great tinder-box. The fires came. All that dead niLbish was rtatjf tor them. Not only was the dead brush burned, but the age long deposit of dead leaves, rotten logs and rich mould planned to feed the soil for the coming eons; all were destroyed and a garden of Eden became a blackened wilderness. How the ruin has spread. Within the memory of man the mighty forests of In - diana and Ohio were chopped down and burned. If left until today they would be worth more than all the crops grown there since their destruc - tion. Take Arizona for instance. The forests have been cut from the mountains, the rubbish inviting the fires, and the fires never miss an in - vitation. Greed drove in great flocks and herds of sheep and cattle. They have destroyed the herbage which tastened the thin layer of earth to the rocks. The floods came and ripped the earth from the mountain sides and whirled avalanches of mud into the fertile valleys, often plow ing out great gulleys twenty and thirty feet deep through the rich sol! ._ j mil K 11 rrlpri An In fill thp ri vpf hpHt va«. whpn t hp flrwwin romp tkM </seg>

Go into Colorado and vandalism is there. The mountains art robbed of their beauty. The upland pastrues are overfed and you have desola tion instead of beauty. A pioneer in the Rockies said: "I think we early settlers should have great credit in coming in here and starting things." i replied: "If you never had seen this country and had left it today at God made it, it would be worth five times as much as it is now." Pur railroads are great civllizers, but the fires set by the engines a track of barbarism behind them. See how it is in Washington Oregon. The lumber barons who have wrought such ruin at the North are now at work among the grandest forests ever grown. They teem to concentrate all their energies there to complete the work of ruin. Every device Is resorted to to get possession of lands which belong to the people. Take the Appalachian mountains. The forests are being cut down, the beautiful rivers are filled with rubbish, sand and stones E carried onto fertile valley farms. In a short time eight, en millions damage was Inflicted and congress looks on in indifference and the ror grows. When you come to the farm you see also a terrific waste. In the East the earth is washed away and the rocks and stones are left, no thought or care taken to save the soil. Many beautiful regions where heavy crops were grown are now deserted and you can buy farms for half what the buildings cost There are no richer lands on earth than the great prairies of the West, and here in God's richest garden there have been two sources of disaster. The first is cropping lands without remuneration, raising wheat year after year with no manure, till some of the richest farms of Minnesota are now so reduced they will hardly raise chicken feed. This system of waste applies to rich level lands. There is a double system applied to hillside lands — robbing the soil and allowing it to wash. I have known the tlchest soil to be swept away by a single heavy rain, so the whole furrow would be gone and you could see the plow marks. Stand by any of our streams after a heavy rain and you will see the very cream of our field going to the Gulf of Mexico. It is waste, waste everywhere. Most feeders will have their feed lots perched on some steep hillside if they can find such a place, so that the richest fertilizer the world produces can be utterly swept away without any trouble on their part, and they keep on growing twenty - five bushels of corn to the acre, when by saving the manure and plowing their land deep they might have 100 bushels. Our coal lands with their marvelous deposits have been well-nigh given away. I have seen veins of coal eleven feet deep which the wise United States government sold for $10 per acre.

He looks on the past and then on the present, and then Into the future and he asks hlirself what will become of this nation 200 year* from now. On the ordering of Providence when a tremendous crisis comes there Is always a man to meet It. This time It was Glfford Plnchot, by education one of the best foresters the world has produced. A man of means, he Is not hampered In his work. He Is ready to to sacrifice thousands for the future. He mleht have made Judicious Investments In the great West he knew so well, so he could have become a billionaire. He could have taken his chances in an unguarded mo - ment and captured forests, water powers and coal lands. No man since the days of Robert Morris, who furnished the sinews of war for Wash - ington and then died In a debtor's prison, has done more or made greater sacrifices than Mr. Plnchot. Though for the present he has lost his position, he is yet a king, independent of throne or crown. Few men have shown such a fearless persistence In the face of the most determined opposition. There were thousands of men who had pet plans for the future. They wished to put their hands on the nation's wealth I.lttl» cared they for the future. Cattlemen and sheepmen, who for years had been allowed to ruin young forests and destroy pastures by overfeeding, these rose In arms, and what a clamor they raised. Pre was no way of fighting fires. The cattlemen wanted flre« if the cowboys had it worked down to the fine arts. Here wan they wanted burned. They might be caught. One takes a mag p!ass and sets It so the focused rays next day would li?ht on dry and other combustibles. The sun does its work and the Innocent &lt;*owboy proves an alibi, for he Is fifty miles away. I met a range rider In the Rockies and had a long talk with him. He would say to stock owners: "You can put only ?o many head on this range and. you must pay for It."' "Not much; we have had this range and we are going to have It." He would tell them: "I represent the United States govern - ment. You cannot afford to have a war with ninety million people." Often his life was threatened. All iranner of trumped mi charges were sent on to Washington and sometimes he had to face fire both front and rear. But these heroic men, like the mounted polhe of Canada, have convinced the ranchmen th»re was a law In th° land and It must be obeyed. In a terrible time like this, when most of our nortnwtstern forests are tinder boxes, what could be done without cur range riders and their system of fighting fires? Sometimes they are at It for forty-eight hours without letup. One man found two of them lyins on the ground In the deep sleep of utter exhaustion. They lay as they fell and the ants were running over them. Perhaps thrse men took a little relaxation and then the cry goes up: "See those lazy fellows and the waste In the forest service."

"Just look at that piece of red tape; can't you see It is broken?" But. thank God, the nation is fully aroused and our forestry system is established. I You can readily gee the clashing of interests. leading men in our ■ific coast cities want the bars thrown down. The future may care Itself. They want the coal dug and the water powers to be exploited. 1 flocks and herds to have free range. It all makes business and we it business now. There never yet was a national park laid out or a ?st reserve made but what there was a tremendous protest. When government made a reserve near Cass Lake, Minnesota, a howl, long I deep, went up. When we tried to have a park in the Wet mountain ley and could have gotten a bill through congress for one of the limest resorts, Colorado congressmen sat down on it. But slowly I surely the people are going to rule. This country is going to be ed. Not only conserved but made more beautiful and attractive. THE PART NERRASKA MVST PI.AT The rich soil of Nebraska is hungry for trees. In 1872 there waa not a tree or shrub on the townsite of York. Now It is called the forest city. We have single trees that would make over 1,000 feet of- lumber. Timber pays. In scores of instances men have cut $300 worth of cotton wood lumber per acre, besides the firewood, which was enough to cover tile cost. The land was left all the better because it was subsolled by those vigorous roots. The sidehllls must and will be defended from erosion and washing. You see farms with deep gullies ploughed through the cornfield too deep, almost, to get a team across. Sometimes a grain of sense will come to the owner and he will dump in a load of straw which stops the wash. One year we had a fearful dust storm in the spring and in some cases entire furrows on the hills were blown away. In one instance the rich •oil of a neighbor drifted three feet deep on one of my hedges. I told him I wished he would lariat his farm and keep it at home. Groves and windbreaks are needed to stop the fierce gales which for ages nave swept over our prairies. Buffet crops can be sown on the long sloping sldehills. I once saw in the Republican valley a large field of alfalfa which was catching the wash from the long slopes above it. The time will come when Instead of the man moving his barn to get away from the manure pile he will get a spreader and put it on his farm. The man who feeds cattle will learn sooner or later that corn fed manure is worth a small gold mine and it will pay to save. I People are waking up to their possibilities. The boys of the future are ng to show their fathers bow things will be done and that farming I pay. Two boys in North Carolina raised 125 bushels of corn per </seg>
            <seg id="p065">65 last year raised 114 bushels where the neighboring men were getting forty. Never yet has an acre of rich land west of the Missouri rirer been put to its best. The possibilities of our state are astounding. The time will come sooner or later when more will be raised on forty acres than the present system gets from 100. The roots of corn have been known to go down six feet where they had a chance, yet you see men plowing three inches deep for corn. The sidehills will not always be planted to corn which gives such a chance for washing. They will be planted to trees which will be mulched with straw or else sown to grass which will be well manured. The strangest thing is that men will not plant trees. There are millions of acres that are sometimes subject to overflow which for thirty years have raised nothing but weeds and which might be put to raising houses, tarns and woodpiles. Better restore the old wood shed and raise your own fuel and give the coal barons the go-by. A farm is an empire of itself. If the farmer raises everything he needs he will grow rich. The nation whose imports exceed the exports is growing poor. For the last few years the balance of trade was in our favor. The past year we were about 150 millions short and if this keeps up we will have trouble. The farmer who buys more than he sells will soon raise a big crop of mortgages. True conservation makes us work the land to advantage and save it as one of God's best gifts to man. So stand up for Nebraska and make it one of the most brilliant stars in our national constellation. AFTERNOON SESSION. 2 P. M. Mrs. F. C. Laflin favored the convention with a song, entitled "The Magic Month of May." ■ Chairman: The next number on our program is a talk, or by Mrs. W. A. Harrison, of York. FORESTRY. MRS. «\ A. HARBISON. YORK. The subject assigned to me is rather an ideal one. I have changed the title so as to read "Women in Forestry." Woman's Interest in trees is inherited. Her belief in her naturally religious make-up that Ood's first tempies were the groves. President Roosevelt sounded the key - note of the subject in his speech on "Conservation," when he said: "The 'ife of the state and the nation depends on the preservation of our forests, which is an imperative necessity. We have come to see clearly that whatever destroys the forests, except to further agriculture, threatens our well-being." He found listeners in the Federation of Wo - men's Clubs. The "Cry of the Pines" all over the land was "The Tree* are Dying " and that one piece of silver was buying the life of a ti w&lt;. </seg>
            <seg id="p066">66 Pe cry that the great pines My to each other. "Sister, the ax has scarred , too! My brother, we die, we die," found women anxious to arrange to atop the depredation, to further the reforesting of the wastes and to help in carrying on the work of proper foresting. Eight years ago the women took up the work, believing that tbe&gt; uust do something to preserve our forests. They found how lamentable was the neglect of our country of her best assets. Japan has practiced orestry for a thousand years. France commenced in the time of the great Nai&gt;oleon. Germany has a forestry law that whoever cuts a tree must plant three; but our first reserve was made under President Cleve - land. Having found the needed work, woman's first question was what o do. She saw wise legislation was needed. She saw that every state, nether wooded or destitute ol trees, should have intelligent laws pro - viding for a due proportion of forest area. When we saw that legis ation was so tied up and the question not coming to a vote we realized le importance of this burning question. We saw that something must be done which would make it possible, after live years' work in congress. to pass the bill providing for the protection and salvage of the White ountains, which were being denuded at the rate of 300 acres a day. When the bill had carried unanimously in the United States senate and ad a clear majority for its passage in the house, it should have been lowed to come to a vote. t There are different problems for each state to solve, and one of the fttest is the protection of the water sheds. We will not have any 1 water sheds until we get trees planted. Western Nebraska is dasti • of trees. We should also have the help of the landscape gardener in beautifying the ground close to bridges. We recommend the uniform planting of trees, and in trying to interest towns and cities to uniformly plant trees along the streets, thus beautifying the city. Boys and girls should be taught how to plant trees and shrubs for beauty. Some one in the state of Delaware wanted two rows of trees planted across the state. The same thing has been recommended for Nebraska. I am not pre - pared to state the value of such a proposition nor the beauty of it I Woman has started a campaign of publicity and education. She is ehing the people through the press. The Nebraska committee recom ided and secured speakers at chautauquas and lecture courses to ik on conservation. She has now a movement on foot to have forestry ?ed in the text-books of our schools where possible. A concerted rement this year is to be brought about In the entire country. Another thing, every farm should have its wood lot, its own propoi tion of trees. Especially is this true of the sandhill country. Give th sandhills plenty of trees — that is FatLer Harrison's recommendation and then every city should have its parks. The great need of Nebraska la tree*. Something we must have is a state forestry association. We must secure legislation along the line of forestry. We must have con — TTatlon. Horticulture needs conservation. </seg>
            <seg id="p067">67 It Is desired that women shall join In ihig grand organization to help carry on this great and pood work. If It Is accomplished. It will h* through the aid of the women. It rests unon the women of this state to see that Nebraska shall heroine the beautiful state she should be Woman recommends the safeeuarding of the source of streams. That every vtllasre should have Its park board, and to urge uniform planting of trees on streets and roadside*, so that our country shall then be "Ood's beautiful out-of-doors." 'Tnmp. let's to the fields and the meads and the mountains. The forest Invites us, the streams and the fountains." I We have the most elorlous out-of-doors there Is In our whole land, us strive to make It a place of beauty, so that It may be enjoy*! •ver TApplause.l DISCUSSION (Mr. Brown: Mrs. Harrison haa certainly struck the rieht note so as th's state Is concerned. You will bear me nut in the statemen f I have made this statement before th's socletv annuallv for t] t"-o or three years, concerning this forestry nrohlem. We have it West that has no trers.

We have th's question to solve, the ariantabill the different varieties to that county, and an ori^nlred effort shoti made bv the legislature to ascertain thit Information. Mr. Ta^er: A erf at manv times, while In attendance unon these eetin^s. I have felt a tlns-e of disnalr. Many times I hnve attended our eetln^s In anticlnation of ereat crowds that I expected to throne our all. I have been disaonntnted only to find a fe-&gt;- hundred present, 'or this reason I have sometimes dl8»atred. but when talking last veninr *-|th Mrs. Harrison she said that there were e'th»r el»ht or rh*y thousand club women In the state of Nebraska who are talfcin - y&gt;nt helnlne us In our socletv work and the nromotlon ana the nro - nlfatlon of the things for which we stand.

The answer : "Tt took too loni; 10 raise a crop of trees, because the farmer Id not afford to put so much money into trees and wait so long for I return." I said then. "Why not have the government do It?" An ? answer to that was: "We cannot trust the- government with th &gt;rk " Then, how are we going to get a forest planted? It seems the only practical method would be to set aside forest reserves »ry township and let these reserves be owned by stock companies, an farmers or people take stork in proportion to the acreage of Ian it they own. I&gt;et this be sufficient to plant It to forests. Employ ««ter to take care of it. Later on, as the forests become large, the ,y be thinned out. some of the wood can be sold, and in that way som urns would be made on the investment. In this way the burden t upon any one shoulder and the forests would be sufficient to mak a material effect upon the climate. Of course, this plan might depend upon the legislature to Rome extent, but in this way every farmer would crt a benefit. I Mr. Brown: That would be all right, but you will have to educate p man to it. or the farmer, up to the point where he will be led to lieve tuat there will be profit in the undertaking. If you can do th*t. undoubtedly will be a success. If you will send for and read "Forest illetin No. 27." you will get some facts that will open your eyes, u must create public sentiment, as has been suggested. This will b*&gt; ne by publishing forestry facts and principles In our text-books. In it way this problem would be solved. We might not live to see the nefltR of it, but the coming generation would. Mr. Mcfandlass: 1 wish to compliment Mrs. Harrison upon her splen did paper on forestry. Eight hundred thousand club women in the I'nited States working for the interests of forestry would be doing a grand work.

Wp turned this cemetery association over to the ladies and I moat say that the results have become a great credit to the city under their management. I few days ago I read an account of the erection of the first monu I in the state of Nebraska dedicating the line of the old Oregon This nionuini ut was erectod through the efforts of the "Daughters le American Revolution" at the city of Kearney. That trail is the fst graveyard in the world and the scene of more revolting murders bloodshed or men, women and children than all the battles of the war. This trail has just been marked out for the benefit of po« - f. That thought was by the ladies. Personally, I owe an obligation le ladles of the city of Wymore. because when I met resistance in work that I have attempted here in the way of planting trees and ing to beautify the city, I have always had the support of the *. So I wish to say that if you can get the ladies interested in any of work, that work will progress and go forward. </seg>

LThe Chairman: Our next number is by Mr. G. S. Christy, of John - , entitled "Fruits for the Farmer's Garden." FRUITS FOR THE FARMER'S GARDEN. CHRISTY. JOHNSON. I It requires some time and expense to furnish a good fruit garden for home and the question naturally arises, will it pay? Yes, in the ed pleasures and comforts of the home and it will doubly pay in saving of doctors' bills. Fevers kill many people in every new ntry as they lack the fruit acids as a system corrective. Fevers [dent to smallpox and measles have killed more Indians than the Ite man's bullets. They are not fruit eaters. When it is generaaly lerstood that the fruit garden has to do with health of the family well as the pleasure and comfort, there will be more atention given Children deprived of their proper supply of fruit will, when oppor - tunity affords, eat too much unripe friut, but this never occurs when they are supplied with plenty of fruit every day. And the ideal fruit garden in Nebraska will furnish fresh fruit every day from May 15 until snow flies. In buying trees or plants be sure to secure the ones you know will do well in your immediate neighborhood. Avoid buying varieties that have done wonders in Texas, or Xew York, or that are guaranteed to accomplish impossibilities. First. Ree how much cash is back of the agent selling such goods. Strawberries are the first fruits to ripen and a liberal supply of Bederwood, Dunlap, Gandy or any of the standard varieties will do well in Nebraska. Then there should be a good supply of other small fruits following along later— currants, gooseberries, raspberries and blackberries. Some of the hardiest and best varieties are Houghton gooseberries, Cumberland and Farmer raspberries, and Early King, Snyder and Mersereau blackberries. Be sure to plant cherries enough for the family, some for the neigh bors and a generous supply for the birds. Be sure to provide for the birds, for they will have their share whether you get yours or not. Early Richmond and Montmorency arc standards. Plant where you have a good, deep subsoil, as a little hard-pan near the surface will kill the trees at an early age. </seg>
            <seg id="p070">70 t Numerous varieties of crapes will do well but Moore's Early, Con d and Worden stand at the head. White varieties are more subject disease than red and black varieties and require more coddling. Pears are nice to have in the fruit garden and the following varieties have done well for roe: Kieffer. Sheldon, Garber. Koonce and Japan Golden Russet. These varieties will give a succession of pears fron. luly to January. Pears should be planted on the poorest ground and thould be seeded M grass three or four years after planting Rapid growth induces blight. t Apples are the standard fruit and can be had in a fresh state during greater part of the year than any other fruit that we grow. Without p aid of cold storage we have had fresh apples from July 10 to May 30 le varieties to plant will depend very much on the location. Plant mmer, fall and winter varieties. tlf you buy your trees and plants right, the first expense will not be » great. But be as careful to know the reputation of your nursery - i as you would to know the reputation of a man you expected to i $1,000 without security. DISCUSSION tMr. Yager: I don't think Mr. Christy ought to say that concerning Houghton. I think the Houghton is such a little scrub of a goose ry that it seems to me he ought to recommend something better a little bigger and something that is hardy. The Houghton is almost small. The Downing is hardy up in our country (Dodge county), if it is hardy up there it ought to be hardy all over this country. I then about the penrs, Mr. Christy recommends Garber. He ought more out the southeast corner of the state, or have it understood • this means anywhere else. A Voice: What is the matter with the Spanish Beauty? Mr. Yager: It is all right in our part of the country Mr. C. S. Harrison: I don't think there is anything like the oh. Houghton. The Downing is a nice berry, but you don't get a crop only about once In five years. A Member: I have planted the Downing and have had good success Mr. Christy: I would rather have something I know than something I never had success with. If you plant the Houghton you will have gooseberries. I get a few from the Downing, but if I want goot 'berries 1 plant something I have had success with. Of course, the Downing is a nice large fine berry when you get one. but you don't get them very C. 8. Harrison: If you transplant often and cultivate well you will and It to your credit. Another thing, people often use the gooseberry when it is green, pick it too soon. Take the Houghton gooseberry when it is ripe and it la pretty good eating. ▲ Member: Would you plant more cherry trees or the Russian mul l«rry trees for birds for the protection of the cherry? </seg>
            <seg id="p071">71 Mr. Christy: The mulberry tor birds. I had a cherry orchard of 600 trees and never lost a cherry until I got down to two or three tree*. When you get down to a very few you will find that the birds arc after them. C. S. Harrison: When 1 lived in Franklin county 1 had cherry trees surrounded by mulberry trees and never lost a cherry. tMr. McCandlass: I think it depends where they are. If you plant a small city lot, 1 would not recommend planting the mulberry; they all right on the farm, or around a cherry orchanl, but in town I lid stick to the cherry. Mr. Yager: I wish to offer a resolution — rtfioJtt'd, That Mrs. Laflin, Mr. A. D. McCandlass, Mrs. J. A. Reuling be made honorary members of this society. ■i y body can sing like Mrs Laflin and anybody can talk like Mrs. and Mr. McCandlass, they should be made honorary members, ore move the adoption of the resolution. Resolution was adopted unanimously. QUESTION BOX. I The Chairman: There have been a few questions sent in and they 1 be answered by different members. The first one is: "How many varieties of hibiscus are there in the state of Nebraska?" Answered by C. S. Harrison:' There is only one natural in the state, and that is the white hibiscus. It grows in many different places. It is a beautiful flower and ought not to be neglected. It often grows five feet high. There is another — the Crimson Eye; also, the Moscheutos. (A Member: Some more of that Choctaw language!) There are four different kinds of hibiscus that do well in this state. You might classify them as perenuial but the roots are hardy. They will come up next year and will grow you a very fine flower. They are very easy to grow. ■ Chairman : "What are the best varieties of cherry for a small r EAt. Youngers: The success of cherries in Nebraska depends upon tion, but we think the Early Richmond, Montmorency and English ello will cover the three best. In this section I would say Early nnond and Montmorency. As far as cherries are concerned, high ground is recommended. By planting on low ground, or having a suc - cession of wet years, the leaves turn yellow and drop. In planting cherries select grpund where the water will run away from them. The roots should not receive too much moisture. There are many varieties. C generally they are subject to the same care regarding low ground too much water. C. S. Harrison: I think it is important to keep cherries dry. They «an llv« without irrigation I saw a man once pouring water around his </seg>
            <seg id="p072">72 XBtASh.i STATE HOirriCULTi;RAh SOCIKTT. cherry trees. I said. "You are killing them with water. Tfcey are all light even if the ground cracks open. I have own them lire through the dry season and die during a wet season." EJ. Brown: I think there is an important point in the cherry ess and that is to have good subsoil. If you have a hard subsoil, want to watch out: in case of too much moisture it would not le water off. What are the best varieties of grape to plant for the market?' Ans»ei-rd l:y G S. Christy: 1 would say. first would be Moore's Early. The Woodruff Red is pretty good if well taken care of; but there is no market foi a red or white grape. If you have a black variety you an sell it. If you have many red ones you will soon overstock the market. I MUwa next to Moore's Early, I would plant the Concord, which comes a little later. I have some trouble with Worden and Campbell's Early — that are not hardy. k'What care should be given the dewberry? Should it be cut back and when?' Answer by O. S. Christy: I think the best dewberry is grown on a trellis; I think that is really the best way to grow them. I have mine two or three tret high. Cut the vines back and tie them up in the spring. If a person should cut them back in the summer, along about July, he would get more vines — they would get a little more growth to grow the berries on, but I have succeeded well in not cutting them back until the next spring, then tie them on the trellis. By having a trellis, you get the nicest and cleanest berries, and they are no trouble to pick. Q Ho* close have you cut them back? A Sometimes three or four feet. y. You leave the stems three or four feet long? Q. Do they winter kill? A. The better plan would be to cover them, and you will have stronger stems in the spring. Down in southern Missouri, as soon as the crop of dewberries is taken care of, they mow the vines and burn them; but up here they don't get quite enough growth. This method was recommended at a farmers' institute meeting in the winter time, one farmer, thinking it would do to mow them at any time, mowed his off in the springtime. So. I presume, it would be well to be definite and Kwhen to do a thing. The old stems that bear fruit this year are the next spring, and need to be cut out. Q. That is. cut them out in the spring when you trim? A. Yes. Q You use a trellis the same as for grapevines? A. Tea. Q. Make it of smooth wire? A. Yes; I just have two wires and tie the vines to them Q. Each year they die? A Yes * the branch or vine that bears this vear always dies The </seg>
            <seg id="p073">73 ror vine that comes up (his year is the stem that bears fruit next . Never let the main stem get over two or three feet high. t Question: "Will mulching be a good way to care for and keen down ■ds in blackberry and dewberry patch?" t Answer: Mulching does pretty well when you cannot do anything :, but it is not equal to cultivation, as I have tried both. In a dry son I have had blackberries dry out and not ripen at all, when right near by where I have taken care and cultivated them, they did ripen. This is the first year I have failed in blackberries for fifteen years. I prefer cultivation to mulching, but mulching is better than not doing anything. I would say further that if you mulch one year you better cultivate the next year, as the roots come to the surface and winter kill. I think these dewberries (exhibiting a box of dewberries) make the nicest berry there is. I can always get top prices for them. Mr. Yager: Mr. Chairman, I have a resolution I wish to offer: REPORT OF COMMITTEE OX RESOLUTIONS. Hiiolved, That we, the members of the Nebraska State Horticultural Society, assembled in session at Wymore, Nebraska, this 21st day of July, 1910, hereby extend a vote of thanks and appreciation to Mr. A.

ADDRESS OF WELCOME i&gt;k. r. mead wiwox. UNrvntsiTT or nfbrahk a Mr. President. Members of the State Horticultural Society, Ladies d Gentlemen: I am a beginner In the art of making addresses or elcome and so I shall afford you neither the luxury of an oration nor trouble you with the length of it, such as formerly accompanied an dress of this character. My immediate predecessor, in welcoming the ate Horticultural Society to the city of Lincoln and to the University has set an example which I feel that I can scarcely imitate in either sound sense or authorized statements of profit to the society. Then are three items missing from addresses of this sort: According to my knowledge of the olden times it appears to have been, in a measure, the tentlon that all men engage in one sort of horticultural work — garden ng. So man and his first wife were established in the Garden of Eden and we find they proved somewhat of a failure, and that original horti ultural enterprise collapsed, more or less, and man was sent out to ac - uire some more knowledge, and to engage In some more simple occupa - on, altogether more primitive. So horticulturists have been looking for knowledge all these years. and I am accustomed to gay to myself, and sometimes I have gotten bold enough to say It out loud, that in many ways this Is the most Intelligent body of men that could be gathered together In any city — a representa - tire gathering of people engaged In horticultural work. I think you will fnd the fact is quite close to being true tn say that horticulture )•&gt; </seg>
            <seg id="p079">79 Entitled necessarily with tbe acquirement of truth, and so to welcome to any part of the University ig to ask it to partake further of that &gt;n which it already knows or depends and thai is upon knowledge and in the search tor new truth. Now, botany and horticulture stand in close relationship, and ao anyone Identified u ith botanical work feels that he Is welcoming, in a mtasurt, an older brother, when a botanist stands before a gathering of horticulturists and extends the glad hand. In fact, they are now becoming so closely identified that they have reached the stage where they may be called twin brothers, so that when you start out to separate them them you will find it a very serious problem. On one hand we rtnd the botanist doing nothing but horticultural work; on the other hand we have a number of horticulturists doing botanical work. The point of view has caanged largely. What satisfied the botanist twenty - live years ago would not be satisfactory at the present time; what sat isfied the horticulturist twenty-five years ago would be of no value today, at least unsatisfactory. It is not broad enough. Botany of old itself named plants; someone has said they hunted plants very much as you might hunt rabbits. For example, you might chase it into a hole and then photograph the hole. Botany chased plants into names and then went away with the names, and I presume you have seen fellows come back from the University and throw names around indiscriminately aud you would think his knov ledge was very profound. Of old, botany distinguished new aames of a very few plants, but botany has grown from the study of names to the study of the behavior of plants; the mere name doesn't imply anything. You may introduce Jones to Smith and cot know either one — in fact, you may not care to know them — you simply sic Jones on Smith and assume no responsibility, you know their names, so possession of a name does not necessarily imply pos - session of any knowledge. To know the names of 100, 200, 2,000, or 5,004) plants does not necessarily imply any knowledge of botany at all today. Io horticulture has also grown side by side with botany. Som ght it was making progress slowly, perhaps traveling on several s at the same time rather than moving in one direction, but made great progress. 1 can remember very distinctly of succeeding measure, to a &lt; hair that had been held by a professor of horticu This professor had all his trees tagged with nails on which h ; horseshoes, because he was convinced that was an easy method ly iron to build up the constitution of those trees. There was her professor of horticulture found later who had tied sacks o lizer around the trunks of the trees because he wanted to kee here it would do the most good. He wanted to get it right In tbe lie of things — to save time, in other words- Then there are horticulturists who think or consider that they hare done their duty when they had planted a few hundred kinds of vege - tables and watched them grow one summer and see that they are gathered and stored away waiting to measure them and thinking they </seg>
            <seg id="p080">80 had some sort of knowledge of the varieties which should be grown. The next year more seed* were planted and very different results secured which did not agree with those of the preceding years, so the work was never done, and you touldn't expect to finiFh it. It was really a horticultural merry go-round on which they were riding and they could not tell nhtn they went past one what scenery they had seen the preced - ing years. They could not tell that they had ever been u.ion that road be - fore. Some of the more brilliant mindeU horticulturists have seen the way nut of the wilderness. We botanists congratulate ourselves that the wa&gt; out leads to\&lt; ard where we had already pitched our tents and had for years been at work. In other words, the horticultural people are appreciating more the need of investigation, and particularly along strictly botanical lines. I want to indicate what some of these directions are in which work is being done, and more work is being done because I a.n » dooming you to an institution which is related to you in the capacity of a productive .nacbine, in a way, to discover some of these things you want to know, in a way which you cannot discover because a large establishment is lequlred that must have co-operation and division of labor, and to do what the old horticulturist thought he could do more satisfactorily is now done by experts employed for that purpose. II want to Indicate some of the directions in whti h work is much ded. You will see all these directions lead toward what we have n calling pure science. One of the first is knowledge of breeding, ich in th( last ten years has received a stimulus, employed in new actions, and you might say a new science has been created, and plant idine. as we know it today, was practically non-existent ten years on account of new methods of work that uave been introduced. In :. tht whole idea underlying the methods of breeding has been fun nentally changed. Where ten years ago a man to breed plants had depend upon his memory to ascertain the facts, he would be con 'red an utter scalawag today; now he must depend on written records show in which direction he was going from year to year. That is direction in which scientific work is needed. t There is still another side which should be very highly developed. 1 that is our knowledge of the nutrition of plants. All nurserymen, fact, need to know more about that than botanists could tell them, we must push the work in that direction, because on that depend* successful propagation of plants. So that again is one of the direc - ts in which the work must be pushed on. tin the old horticultural meetings two subjects were always dia - led — insect pests and diseases of plants. I can remember when I was over ten years old, and I presume these subjects were discussed pre us to that. The old meetings were full of discussions of that kind, course, a great deal of progress has been made. We can hardly llze how far we have advanced. Such a proposition as spraying has ctically gotten out of the control of the botanist, even out of the trol of the scientist. We now look upon it as an ordinary operation </seg>
            <seg id="p081">81 ke plowing. I do not see much uioic Deed uf having a imofessor or raying than a professor of plowing. They are farm operations, ordl - ary, essential operations. Back of all the spraying lies what might metimes appear to be dull and uninteresting study of disease. It Is ecause before we can tell you what to do for them, we must know mething about the trouble and perhaps we can tell you then. In any cases we cannot because studies here, there and other places must be carried on and become acquainted with, and general conclusions rawn and further detailed studies made which may involve years of ork. Hasty conclusions based on an afternoon's nan or dream are o longer accepted at the value which they formerly were; we do not ppreciate what a horribly credible crowd of people we are getting to be. » Results of twenty-five years ago were accepted as gospel truth, not ed on anything in particular. We frequently built a building bot - i bide u&lt;&gt; in those old days ani drew our conclusions afterwards. In er words, we threw the roof up in the air and when we had leisure e we built something under it to support it. Now we proceed in ctly the opposite direction, by building the foundation first; that ndation consists of pure science. Nature gives to horticulture that e science which is botany, so they are there classed together. One very characteristic thing about the botanist and horticulturist is their natural modesty is always shown. C&amp;sar claims that all Gaul was divided in three parts. The nurseryman has all three kinds of gall (Oaul); they have both soft galls, hard galls, and hairy -root (tails, all three kinds, but we don't show it to any great extent. I think as a matter of fact the horticultural needs are not as a rule properly presented to the people. I remember in my first little effort to organize horticultural movement which was in trying to organize a closer spection work in Alabama, or at least to direct it along useful chan - els, I was called before a committee of the Legislature. There was a II up for consideration and there was a man in that Legislature who ad been In the house for ten or twelve years, off and on, who made he startling statement that he did not think there was any sense in having any legislation designed to assist horticulturists and nurserymei. &gt;ecause there was not any in the blooming state. Of course, as a matter fact, the largest in the world are located in the northern part of le state of Alabama. The active inspector will burn up more stock lere than the average state will produce, so I am Inclined to think &gt;at, although the horticulturists are in possession of all gall (Gaul&gt; ley haven't been displaying it to any great extent; so that horticultural nterests and their value, their general value, the value of horticultural ork in a community or commonwealth ts not appreciated as it should be, not by any means. I have been surprised frequently at what you get when you come down to hard figures with reference to some of thctie propositions. How many of you are aware that last year there was over 7,000 acres of cabbage planted out in Nebraska? About 7,000 acres of nursery stock? </seg>
            <seg id="p082">82 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL, 8OCIRTT Scattered around over th» state something like 110.000 acres of iv&gt;tatoes. Tn fart, that Industry has become bo larre that horticulture has dliw-ned It and called It a field cron and dumped It out of thp garden. Now we come down to trees. In 1910 there were about 3. 500.000 apples trees In this *tate. 3 700.000 accordlnc to the best statistics; ifii.000 near trees: 1.400.000 neach trees: 647.000 plum trees: over 700 000 cherry trees Quite a nice little shc-ine and not at all to be ashamed of. Then there are some nut trees— 318.000 scattered about over the state. So on the side of pomoiory we could ctte the above for parden horticulture or limited field cultivation. Horticulture Is of consequence, so anythln" tint will tend to promote horticulture Is worth while belne promoted Thern Is a rreat deal more In wdenlne and In the cultivation of Hants than financial returns. Horticulture Is better than profits, there Is alwavs a looking to the future and retaining their youth. An old m*n who has devoted his life to horticulture has devoted his life to an ennobllne calling. We say the agriculturist Is the noblfst of all; then for the part of the horticulturist In some ways It Is the noblest part, because yon have the esthetic side all the time, besides the money-making side. So the horticulture people should not be ashamed to proclaim from the house tops. If necessary. T think what they want, what anybody wants, they ret In the Ion? run. Even children do that; I find that true with my little limited experience with the family that even the ladles — and. by the way. what has happened to the ladles — I think T used the plural to commence with, I think I should correct that — they always take a ■ 'erest in horticultural work. Eiotlce according to our program another phase coming to the and that Is the specialization In horticulture. Here comes the i by themselves to discuss their special problems. I know they occasionally propound problems that are rather hard nuts to crack, such aa diseases and difficulties in growing crops. All these problems demand an immense amount of attention: some are coming to be expensive prob lems to solve. They are coming to demand a large equipment of men and apparatus and patience on the part of those who are seeking the results and on the part of those who are waiting for those results. So I congratulate you on having returned In a measure to the occupation originally laid out as a calling for mankind. It would be absurd for me to welcome you to the University, of which I assume you are already a part because It Is the people's University and I have already explained you are the people, and since you are here in your own institution it la unnecessary for me to extend any special welcome, but I do extend It most heartily to you and I hope the meetings may be moat profitable, interesting and encouraging from every point of view. Chairman Williams: Dr. Wilcox, on behalf of the society, I wish to thank you for the kind remarks and address of welcome you have given us this afternoon. We 'all appreciate meeting here in Lincoln once a </seg>

I believe our meetings which we have been holding here once a year have been very profitable to all who have attended and I hope that this one will be the same. Chairman: Our program consists mostly of papers by the florists this afternoon, and as the Florists Society is an auxiliary of the society. I will call its president, Mr. Irwin Frey, to the chair. STATE FLORISTS' SOCIETY. Chairman Frey: The first thing we have on the program is a paper on the subject of "Chrysanthemums," by Mr. Harry Hunt, of Kearney, but as Mr. Hunt is unable to be with us today on account of sickness. I will call on Mr. C. H. Green, of Fremont, on the subject of "The Retail THE RETAIL FLORIST. (.'HAS. H. GREE.N, FKEMO.NT. Had I been called upon some twenty years ago to talk to you about the retail florist, I would have approached the subject with the perfect . onfldence of the boy who went to work in the greenhouse one Monday morning and that same evening one of the men said to him, "Well, Roy. how do you like the florist business?" "Fine," said Roy, "fine, I'm glad 1 learned it." So it was and is, or was, with most of us, I "suppose. When we have scratched a little on the surface of floriculture, or any other big subject for that matter, we conceive the idea we have gone to rock bottom and fondly imagine we can give the older and wiser heads unlimited beneficial, even if unsolicited and unheeded, advice. As we E deeper and the impossibilities begin to appear where at first we only possibilities and probabilities, we begin to acquire knowledge is really useful and valuable. PvTow what is a retail florist? The man who has a little space under airway or on a corner of the sidewalk in a big city will tell you that 8 a retail florist. That man. a step higher, with a window and space for his refrigerator in a drug store in a side street admits he is a retail florist. The man who conducts the grand, marbled, mirrored, silver - plated, plate-glass establishment on the best corner in the heart of the re - tail dry goods section of the big city, often paying a rental greater than the gross income of a really prosperous florist in a city of the second or third class, knows that there is really only one retail florist and he is it. These people are dealers only, as they, almost without any exception, buy their flowers and plants from the growers or wholesale commission men. Those of us who supply the floral wants of a community with stock which we have ourselves produced, who have cared for our blooming and other bedding plants ull along the way from the propagating bed to the flower garden, who have watched over our cut flowers from the soil to the social event, sick room or cemetery and in doing so have </seg>

HuHTI' I LTIHAL SOCIETY.. incidentally actually performed or at leaart personally directed the multi tudinous duties necessary to the successful achievement thereof. We fondly hope \&gt;e have earned the proud title of retail florist, bui when the livery stable keeper or the hardware man comes to the green house with his wife in the spring for a dozen geraniums and a couple of dozen pansies for the flower bed by the porch, and solves for us offhand half a dozen problems that we have been worrying about lor quit* a while, we wonder. It is noi my iiilenuuii at ihis time to enter into details of the methods of conducting a retail fioi tsts business. A great many people imagine that raising tamttu is a nice comfortable occupation for an old lady to spend her time at. This is true up to a certain extent, but douL iiu, that Uower growing on the scale that is necessary as a bus ineas pioposition is a man's size Job. ner is it bo reniunciative that there is a mad scramble to get into it li» speculation who want to get lich quick. I believe that any retail florin will agree with me that it requires more ability to separate a dollar from the general public by this means than by any other known method. Well, maybe not to get it, but to keep it. i Still theie arc &lt; om.iusaiious. There is in itself an attraction about business that is so resistless that once a man becomes thoroughly •nsted he usually makes it his life work. I The tetail florist in a community not so large but what he is per ally acquainted with all or most of his customers, is a spectator to ay interesting incidents. The language of flowers is becoming more and r.,ore used in daily - life and a beautiful expressive language it is. Ho* can one better express the sentiments appropriate to any occa - f.on than through the medium of a bunch of fresh, fragrant flowers? E'ver fear that that mtssage will not be understood, be it joy or sympathy or congratulation, or penitence. Many an incident we that it- beautiful to see. And many a one that is so ludicrous that in inwardly for a week. E instance, Johnny Jones stops sending flowers to his regular Sue, and has them delivered to some swell girl who Is visiting f'tetty soon we notice orders from that other fellow going to Susan. The visiting girl goes home. Then one day Johnny orders a great big bunch of violets sent to Susan Sue. Could anything be plainer? Preferment, fascination, jealousy, encouragement, penitence t reconciliation, expressed as unmistakably as if bawled out from housetops. . Pnsus estimate of the gioss business of the retail florists of I nitcd Stau&amp; for the year 1900, shows a total of nearly $20,000,000. ik of it, you fluists. when you are hustling to get the amount of your th's coal Mil together. Nor is this vast sum representative of any % like the amount of business done during 1910, for the business really in its infancy and is Increasing by leaps and bounds. As the </seg>
            <seg id="p085">THE KLORJ9TS' ADVEBTI81NU. 85 newer portions of this great land are settled and the first improvements are made and the burden of debt is lifted from these new homes, the desire for some adornment and beautiful surroundings that is the her - itage of every rightly constructed human being is manifested by nothing more than by the flowers, fruits and foliage which surround them. The retail florist, to succeed, must be progressive, energetic and strictly up-to-date. He must anticipate the ever increasing wants of his trade, and be able to supply the demand for the new, novel and differen. in the right way with the right stock and at the right time. The extent to which you have succeeded In doing this, Brother Flor - ist, you have an easy way of ascertaining. If your annual trial balance does not look as good as you think it should, the sooner you find out the reason the better. Remember that fashions change in flowers th&lt; same as anything else. While it is not wisdom to grab at every ne* idea that comes along, a careful consideration of them will enable one to select such of these as may be profitably adopted. ' Success or lack of it depends not so much upon the great things of our business as upon the seemingly unimportant details. A satisfied customer is the best advertising medium and more eo if possible in our business than in any other as the intrinsic value of our products depends so largely on their beauty and power to please. To really be a successful retail florist you must, as the poet has so aptly written, "Give to the world the best that you have And the best will come back to you." Chairman: A burning question in the minds of florists of today is where we can get the most, so to speak, for our money in advertising, so we nave had Mr. Henderson, of Omaha, prepare a paper on adver - tising, as we thought he had had more experience than any of the rest of us in that line. THE FLORISTS' ADVERTISING. lOIIS HENDERSON , OMAHA. To advertise is to give publicity, to make known our goods, our wants and what they are. Rare living in a time of progress, in a time of improvement, in a hen our business has grown to a gigantic proportion. The capital d is far beyond the dream of the florist of less than half a gen - eration ago. We are in a time of competition when we strive to outdo the other in results. tWe must keep up with these times to accomplish the best results. If do not it is merely a question of time when we will be dropping off the wayside to the survivor of the hustler. How shall we do this if not through publicity? Some may say I don't need to advertise, my goods speak for themselves, they are of good </seg>
            <seg id="p086">86 This niay be true, but If you have something good keep it not u&gt; yourself, but push it along and let others know of It even if you are the only florist In the community. Don't sit and wait for the customer to come, as if to say they hare in come to me whether I advertise or not. t Advertising Is a reminder. Give it all due attention, It is very Inter ng when once gotten into. Its cost must be, like all other things, in poition to the size of your trade. The advertisement should be changed from time to time even if It consists of the merest heading and short sentence as a reminder of the various flowers in season, and the Joy and pleasure that can be obtained at very reasonable prices. Many a person would, In all probability, never think of buying a flower had he not been reminded by a little advertisement in some paper, program or some other way by some florist who may be struggling hard to make an honest living by selling nature's most beautiful emblems— messengers, conveying greetings of love. Joy, congratulations or sympathy from heart to heart. When a man starts in the florist business, the newspapers, of course, will make an announcement that "so and so" have started in the florist trade, but this is not enough. In the first place, this man's ability, his personality, character, even dress and appearance, is a walking adver tisement of what he is about to accomplish. He must make himself acquainted and be popular and his goods of first quality and in demand. He must put up a neat, clean show win dow with up-to-date goods artistically arranged, which will attract the attention as a reminder to the passer-by. He must be pleasant, courteous and generous, and by all means prompt. All these things are great advertisements as well as the qual - ity of his goods and the way they are put up. A neat advertisement or label on his boxes, his name in some trademark, not gay and gaudy, but something that appeals to refinement His delivery boys should be neat and tidy, his wagons or automobiles pleasing and up-to-date, in order that wherever they pass they will be pleasing reminders of flowers and the beautiful. He must keep his name before the public through the newspapers or in many other ways in order that the public k familiarise themselves with the same, and when in need of flowers remember where to go. Next comes the advertising man or a committee with a program of some entertainment to be given in some church or theatre, or social function in the community. They want an advertisement to help pay for the printing of the program. They as a rule always come to the florist. They may be your customers and it would seem to be wasting money to give them an ad. However, you are wise if you cheerfully give them an advertisement This same committee as a rule are the leading flower buyers in the community and you have advertised your </seg>
            <seg id="p087">87 However, don't be entirely content with the trade that you taavf- There Is always room for more. And more help to your working force, extend your advertisements farther and farther as your business grows. Send out circulars, catalogs and calendars to all your friends and to the flower-buying people as well as others. It will help to cultivate in them a love for flowers and nature's beauty. One florist can not do this all alone; we should all help boost and advertise. There is plenty of room for us all, and plenty of work to do at home and in our society, as individuals or as a unity. Nebraska is the very place to do this, with its energetic people, fertile soil, pleasing climate, abundance of sunshine, great factories and railroad systems, its beautiful valleys, rivers and trickling streams. tMake Nebraska a garden of flowers. Then advertise and let the -Id know that right here in our realms has been established or found "Lost Paradise," the "Garden of Eden." Enan: I do not know of anything else we could mention in rtising line but what Mr. Henderson's paper has covered it ' there is any part of advertising that he has not covered any member would like to suggest we should like to hear it. Our next topic is "Bulbs." by Mr. .1. E. Atkinson, of Pawnee City. BULBS. J. E. ATKIK80*. PAWNEE CITY. Knot like to begin a paper by apologizing, but I have been having st kind of a siege of the "grippe" and ought to be home now. putting off writing this paper until yesterday evening, and have not read it over since I wrote it, and possibly cannot read it now. Further than this, it is not intended for the florist, but is Intended to get the ordinary housewife and homemaker to plant bulbs; there Is nothing in it that is new to the florist and possibly nothing new to the ordinary citizen. Of the many plants grown for their flowers, none produce more beau ilful or more delicately fragrant blossoms, none are so easily cultivated and cared for, none are bo sure to succeed under widely varying or ad verse conditions, and none are so generally satisfactory in the hands of the unskilled as those commonly known as bulbs. Froadly speaking, and for convenience of description, bulbs and &gt;us plants may be placed in three general classes: Summer bloom - bulbs, hardy bulbs, and bulbs for winter blooming In the house. Kulbs rommonly known as summer-flowering will not stand severe freez - ing, but must be taken up In the fall and stored in a f ost-proof cellar. They are as easily kept as potatoes, require no more care or labor In </seg>
            <seg id="p088">88 combinations during me uummer and autumn. Among the leading kinds are gladioli, dahlias, cannas, tuberoses, and several of the amaryllis family. They may safely be planted about corn-planting time, and any good garden soil is suitable, although cannas are partial to a very rich soil, and must have It, and plenty of moisture, to be at their best. If you are not growing summer-flowering bulbs you are not living u&lt;&gt; to your opportunities and privileges as a Nebraskan. Hardy bulbs are best planted in October. They do not require a very rich soil, and are easily cared for. After planting, it Is well to cover the beds with leaves, straw or coarse litter, which should be re moved early In the spring. After blooming they may be taken u;&gt; and stored in dry soil, or they may be left in the beds year after year. Hardy bulbs are especially useful for outdoor planting as they bloom at a time when the yard and garden are utterly bare and destitute. They make a cheerful display in early spring when flowers a ost needed, and a few of them will transform an otherwise bare, blea ard into a veritable bit of Eden. Crocuses, snowdrops and scill ppear as soon as the snow is gone or the frost is out, and are follow y jonquils, tulips, narcissus, hyacinths, Lily of the Valley, etc Thr nd many others are perfectly hardy and may stay in the ground fro ear to year, producing an abundance of chastely beautiful and exqu ely fragrant flowers, and eventually forming larpe clumus that mu r* divided to continue to do well. The hyacinth is an exception, rare dooming freely more than three or four years in Nebraska. The towever, are so sweetly perfumed, so delicately beautiful, and su bloom, that we can well afford to plant anew each year. In fact, it pays to plant some of the hardy bulbs every year, for ■Mm impossible ever to have too many, and they succeed so well th ways exceed our expectations and are a continual source of surpri and pleasure. We might mention many other bulbs that are hardy an beautiful, including several kinds of lilies, but while many of these a mply magnificent, and well repay the little extra rare they rcqui r best development, yet as they do not succeed at all times, in a ands. under all sorts of conditions, it seems better to omit them an recommend only those that do well for everyone, at all times, und most all conditions. The last class, bulbs for winter blooming in the house, is perha le Tost important of all, from the florist's standpoint. Practically a the hardy, and many of the tender bulbs respond readily to hou ulture In winter, but there are a few that are so easily cared for an sure to flower freely, that failure with them is almost lmpossibl Perhaps the best known and most popular of these is the Giant Xa ssus. or Chinese Sacred Lily. It blooms equally well in soil or wate ree to five weeks after planting, and when done flowering may be rown out, as it is useless for further forcing. Others of the narcissi mily that always do well are Paper White, Rugrulosus. Emperor, Vo </seg>
            <seg id="p089">89 grown in soil than water, and all, except Paper White, may be planted out for permanent beds another year, or may be forced in the house again if the bulbs remain solid. E- house culture nothing surpasses the hyacinth. They may be 1 all shades from pure waxy white to yellow, from light blush to red, and from delicate porcelain blue to indigo and dark purple. Their large spikes of fragrant flowers are like nothing else in cultiva - tion and must be seen to be appreciated. The miniature, or Dutch Romans, are like the regular Dutch hyacinths in all respects except that they are earlier, and the flower spikes are somewhat smaller and more delicate. Single varieties are more satisfactory for the house than are doubles. Hyacinths bloom freely and somewhat earlier in water, but are much better and keep longer when grown in soil. So long as the bulbs remain solid, without splitting up or dividing, they are good for further blooming and may be planted out permanently or grown in the house another season. Tritileas are small bulbs of the easiest possible culture that are con - stantly in bloom during the winter. P Ilium Neapolitanum is a grand bulb for winter, and is certain to and bloom splendidly in any window. Its flowers are beautiful lasting and the bulbs are cheap in price. The Ornithogalum is a sure and showy winter bloomer that never fails and requires little care. The flowers are very durable, and the bulbs are good year after year. If there is one most desirable bulb for the house, sure to succeed »nd bloom elegantly for anyone In any situation, pleasing to all for its refined beauty and fragrance, easily grown and universally admired, it is the Freesia. Plant five or six bulbs in a six-inch pot of rather ltcht soil, and you will become an enthusiast. Pny ladies aspire to grow Easter lilies, and a few succeed. Most ■m fail because lilies cannot thrive in the dry, dusty atmosphere living room. The kinds surest to succeed are varieties of Candi - duni and Longiflorum. To do well they must have plenty of moisture in the air while growing. Given this, they are magnificent and well worth the little extra care they need. Just here, it may be well to say that many of the choicest lilies that often fail with ordinary outdoor cul - ture will do well if planted in large pots in the fall, kept in the cellar E winter, and planted out, pots and all during the summer. Give of moisture while growing, and you will feel amply repaid. Re the fall and proceed as before. Eie common Calla, as a winter bloomer, is too well known to M - description or comment. It is of the easiest culture, so easy in that many get only a magnificent growth of leaves, with but few s. The bulbs should be dried off in summer and repotted in Sep r in small pots of very rich soil. Give an abundance of water. I </seg>

A Urge bulb will bloom freely in a six-inch pot. while if planted In ■ candy bucket it may give only a grand display of tropical foliage. The writer once crowded an extra large bulb having three eyeg. into a ten quart pall, and this plant produced twenty-eight t&gt;erfect flowers durtne the winter; the record, so far as we know . There are many other winter blooming bulbs of the easiest possible culture, but this paper is already too long. There is one, however, the queen of all, producing all winter long, numerous strikingly hand some flowers of the most delicate and beautiful shades, white, pink, rose, blush, crimson, etc., and with foliage so prettily marked and bean tlful that it would be a desirable ornamental plant, even if It never bloomed at all. This is the cyclamen. Probably no pot plants are ao universally satisfactory. They require a light porous soil containing plenty of sand or roal ashes, and the bulbs should be set on the surface, rather than in the soil. As a rule, it is better to procure cyclamen bulbs already started, than to get dormant ones, as they do not all start readily under ordinary living-room conditions, although they do ex r«edlngly well when once started. In general, winter blooming bulbs should be planted from September .•unary in iKrts or boxes of light soil which Just covers the bulbs oil should be firmly pressed about them, they should be thoroughly » stered. and set in a eool. moist, dari: cellar to form roots.

In most cases when toi&gt; growth begins to show they may be brought to the light. and vill bloom in due time.

Mr. Williams: There is one thing in regard to bulbs, thai ih - be wintered as easily as potatoes. I want to take exception to that, in the case of the &lt; anna particularly. I have had trouble wintering them and I know most people do who attempt to keep them in that manner. kMr. Atkinson: Suppose I had said sweet potatoes, is there an ■ \ Lion to that? Mr. Williams: 1 guess chat would be all light. Chairman: The trouble with most individuals or private growers is that they shake too much of the soil off the roots. If they would leave all the soil on them and let them become dry with that soil on them and put them in a place near the furnace they will keep, but put I hem in a damp place. They can not have too much soil on them Mr. Simanton: I have not had much to do with keeping them, but 1 have collected something in the last couple of years and we hare been trying a little different plan. After the frost we cut the tops off but don't dig them up until the ground begins to freeze, leaving Ein the ground to ripen. I find that they keep much better that lhan when we dig them right out of the ground. That • xiilain - r satisfaction why they are keeping better. Chairman: I do not know what the causes of failure in keeping cannas are. We have never been troubled at all in keeping the bulbs. They seem to be one of the plants that take the least attention of anything we grow, but I should think in a wet season leaving the bulb after the tope were iiit would have a tendency to make them keep better. Mr. Williams: I believe that canna roots are very much like sweet potatoes, you have to be careful that they do not sweat. They should be spread out on a shed floor and allowed to dry thoroughly. If you have wet dirt around them they will sweat. Mr. Dole: We cut our cannas off as soon us the frost hits them, let them stand until we think it is going to freeze hard, when we dig them up and put them under a raised bench in the carnation house where we have wintered our cannas for a good many years. We always winter them that way, and our steam pipes are just above them, some of the tops will just touch the steam pipes, and we have never had any trouble with them excepting once or twice with some varieties. The more ten der ones, I think, are hard to keep, anyway. The hardier varieties are easier to keep, anyway. Mr. Oreen: I believe the keeping quality is due to the condition of the plants in the fall. If we have had a wet fall the inside of the plant has a soft growth, especially the hearts or centers of the bulbs or tubers. If we have a wet fall just previous to the time we dig </seg>

That we think gives the plant a chance to ripen up. That is done a week or ten days before we dig them. If they are wet underneath, then we cut the tops off after we have had a frost, and then we take them out, covering them up in case of a dangerous frost. That may have been unnecessary precaution, but the frost seems to do them good. I think the secret is to get your bulb well cured, or well ripened. Mr. Williams: What would be the ad vantage of letting the canna tops lreeze; why not cut them off? Mr. Dole: There would be no advantage of letting them freeze to - l.ight and digging them up tomorrow. Let them freeze and get two or three weeks of fairly warm weather afterwards. The frost checks the growth, I do not know why. It is simply an idea, but every florist seems to think it is beneficial to the roots. It. stops the growth, that I when it stops the flow of the sap. For several years we Lave had dig our cannas after the first frost because it turned very cold irtly afterwards. Mr. Siraanton: I think one reason is they are the most beautiful at that time of the year until it does freeze. ■Williams: I would like to ask if you can keep your dahlias as your cannas? We have not been able to. Mr. Dole: We keep them in the same place. We cut them off like the cannas, and in the same way we leave what dirt hangs on them. Erman: This discussion has been very good. We know that that have a carnation bed has a dry spot to keep his cannas ave anyone here who has a surer way let us hear from him. Mr. Atkinson: Do not keep them on a damp cellar floor. fhairman: Our next paper is entitled "Prospects for Wholesaling in aska," by Mr. August Eiche. I will say that Mr. Eirhe is sick at present time, but he has entrusted his paper to our secretary, who read it. PROSPECTS FOR WHOLESALING IN NEBRASKA AUGUST EICHE. LINCOLN.

In a large way, I consider Nebraska one of the very best states in the union for the grower of flowers. have so many of the essential elements for the production of t class stock so near at hand it would indeed be strange If we did not produce as fine stock here as grown anywhere in the country. With this stock, then, we are able to compete where first class flowers are demanded, with any of the large growers in the East or elsewhere.

Aside from this, we are centrally located and have the very best of express facilities for making quick shipments in all directions, making it pos - sible to fill orders for flowers that are to be shipped a thousand or more miles, with but an hour's notice. When I look back fifteen years and think what the business was then and what it has grown to be, and think of the future before us, I feel something like the early settler must have felt when he first viewed our vast acres of rich, rolling prairie land everywhere ready for th&lt; - tilling. So it is with us engaged in the production of flowers. We have a market everywhere ready to be taken; all it needs is the tilling. Our business differs from any other lines of business. Cut flowers ■ an not be kept indefinitely, like fruit. Ordinarily, when a shipment of 'ruii is made, and should it be delayed for some few hours, it would not affect the value of the fruit. Not so with flowers; they are more often ordered for an especial occasion than otherwise and must leave at a given time and arrive promptly or their usefulness would be past, and so the wholesaler must be prepared, at all times, to fill rush orders and when the time Is very limited, to Influence messengers to take ship - - without waybills. In fact, do many other things to get shipments the road in a hurry. To those of us engaged in this part of the trade, find this, during our busy season, not an exception but an every - occurence. The producer of cut flowers knows at certain times that there are not enough flowers to fill all the demands. Not so with many of the smaller retailers who buy what they sell and do not under - stand why they can not have all the stock they may want. During these periods come the strenuous days for the wholesaler; lays when it is necessary to figure every blossom that no one may be disappointed, for to disappoint a good customer when you have booked hie order, and who, in many cases has sold the flowers long before he has seen them, would do more to injure the business than anything I know of. It is by the careful booking and filling of orders promptly. Eth good stock, that our business will Increase to acres of glass I I ■ now have but small houses. Chairman: The next thing on our program is the Question Box. QUESTION BOX. Mr. Green: While 1 haven't any question to ask, there is one thing, in regard to inducing express messengers to accept flowers without a way-bill. As all florists know, sometimes in making a rush order you have not time to get the package billed out At Fremont they used to refuse to take them unless they were billed, and they being com - mon carriers we thought it was our right to send the package anyway. It was n matter of form with them to have the way-bill, and we felt </seg>
            <seg id="p094">94 \RRBAKKA STATK HORTH'll.TrRAI SOCIETY i hat if we had the package to the train in tin ; alien out that we had a right to send It. We took the matter up and found that we Ethe right. In rase you have trouble of that kind you do not to induce the messenger to take it; simply demand it and he will It without a billing. Plr Simanton: We are still having trouble with that down at Falls They claim that where there is no night man paid to take out express they are not obliged to take it, and where you put it on for any station without a way-bill it is at your own risk and they are not responsible for it. That is. where the night operator is there. If he is not paid to handle express, they do not have to carry it to that station on that train. Mr. fireen: You should deliver it to the messenger and put it in his care. Bir Simanton: The man at the destination will not take It at all. The sr-nger does not refuse It absolutely, but he says the man at the inatlon will not take it off the car. r. Green: I do not know how that would be, but I suppose if the nrer put it off it is his duty to receive it. I imagine it would be risk. If he carried It by and did not deliver it. it would be at »k. Mr. Williams: I received a decision on that It Is at your risk where you ship It to a town where there Ik no night man: you »hip at your own risk. Mr Simanton: Well, they will refuse to take it. P Williams: Yes, they can do so: you can not compel them to t where they do not have a night man. I got a ruling on that the American Express Company. I Mr. Green: Our trouble is not that way. Our trains all come in and out in a bunch between nine and ten o'clock in the morning and be tween four and five o'clock in the afternoon; sometimes we just barely Ket the package to the train. We get it down to them but they do no' have time to bill it and the boy would give it to the messenger on the car and he would say you can not send it, that you have to have a way bill; that is the point I am trying to cover. In cases of lack of tinv for getting the way-bills you can send it and they have to take it. E Williams: Where did you get your decision that relates to fruit* an flowers? Did you get your decision from the railway com Mr. Green: No, I got It from the general office of the express Chairman: The railway commission, I believe, has control over tb&gt; express companies at well as the railroads in the state, but we ha» - never been troubled in Lincoln with that difficulty. tr. Green: I do not know whether it is through the generosity of messengers, but I know we got it. If we get to the train in tim - lever have had the question raised. </seg>

I' is thrown off at your risk, but It has to be accepted. ■ SImanton: Would they consider the express prepaid if you (mar it? Chairman: Certainly, if you put a paid sticker on it of your own. Er. Simanton: We are situated like Mr. Green from the fact that our ess offices are both up town. There is none at the depot, and they do make the trains after four o'clock and there are some of the trains are night trains. It is a very inconvenient matter to get stuff on one road on night trains for the reason that we cannot get i billed, and we have trouble about this, they are not billed. Brman: One way with every guaranteed express package, a slicker tshed by the company which we use on all prepaid express r a prepaid guarantee would hold, I doubt very much. Secretary: The only time you have to guarantee express is wht-n i he company is to transfer it to another company. We have case* ot thai kind at Grand Island where we miss a train on one road, th&gt; - 'iiber road can take the package and make connection at another point You always have to guarantee it then. Chairman: But that is double express? Secretary: Yes, sir. E Atkinson: I have one problem that don't seem to concern you to ask how you can advertise to create a demand? Take a few plants in Alaska or potato plants in Egypt, just how would you to create a demand? Chairman: I am not able to answer that question myself. I have never had any experience where you have no competition, and the advertising means would be limited. I hardly know how you would *et around that. Maybe someone here can answer that for you. Kary: I believe, Mr. Atkinson, if you will take a large supply and advertise a special sale and get the people to come to the ie, you can do it that way. ■Atkinson: Hut we have no daily paper, and you have to advertise weekly paper and you can hardly tell so long ahead that you lg to have an oversupply on hand. Secretary: You could distribute handbills. I know several times a few years ago we used to get stocked up pretty well and we could see that we would have to unload, and we would put a little notice in the local and generally fixed for a Saturday special sale of carnations, roses or whatever we had and we always got rid of them and the people always appreciated these sales. The same way with our potted plants in the spring, if they did not move we advertised that we were short of room or were going to make a cleaning out and they generally com.' through all right. We found it was a good success out there Mr Dole: We advertise through the daily papers. We are fortunate </seg>
            <seg id="p096">96 In having two in our town. We used the locals mostly. I think they are four to one better than the display ads unless you take half a page or so. Then we get out a catalogue almost every winter which we distribute in March to every house in town. We take them per - sonally or send with a few boys to every house. I think it is con - siderably cheaper than to mail them and we know they get to the houses, too. tMr. Green: It is a fact in our business that every flower you put out. Hher you sell it on a special sale or give it away, it an advertise it. Every one you put out helps sell another one. A plan that we d successfully was this: We advertised that on a certain afternoon would give away a dozen roses or carnations. Because we had a :e stock on hand we could sell them a dozen at the repular price then deliver them a dozen free anywhere they wanted them to go, ?pt to their own address — really soiling: the flowers at half price, but would not cut the price. I Chairman : I believe from what I have seen from an advertising idpoint that Mr. Green's way of disposing of surplus flowers is a ■h better way than to sell them at a sale price, which is really a cot ■e. and less than they can really be grown for. There is no carna - i grower who will admit that he can sell carnations at a profit and them at twenty-five cents a dozen. If he sells them for the coming urday at twenty-five cents a dozen he will have an awful time the t three days of the next week to get fifty cents a dozen. The public iks that if they are twenty -five cents a dozen on Saturday they he not to be any more the following week. He has a hard time lainlng why he should have a surplus and be able to sell them ip on Saturday and not the rest of the time. I think if we dis -d of our surplus flowers to hospitals and the Home for the Friend , it would be better to do that than sell them at prices under which r can be grown. I think we should leave the sales to the depart it stores and sell at the regular prices ourselves, because it hurts ness where you sell at a less price on one day than on others. I Mr. Green: I want to emphasize Chairman Frey's remarks in r d to getting our prices. We would rather throw away the flower n to sell at half price, as far as value is concerned as a busines position, because it is awful easy to put the price down and a 'ul hard thing to get it bark to a paying standard. Again, we used have a rule that if churches or societies wanted flowers we woul Ice them a reduced rate, but now if a church or society comes i wants flowers we tell them they are Just the same to them as body else, or that we cannot make a reduced price on lilies fo ter. As the money they are buying them with has probably all bee ated and we will donate some too. We will sell a dozen lilies a dozen price and we will donate another doien, but we will no them two dozen at the dozen price. </seg>

I have never put a card in with them, we being the only florists in Beatrice. They know where they come from, and we generally hear of it. Someone calls us up and rh.inKs us for it afterwards and we know it has been appreciated, ana it is a good advertisement Rher way we have of disposing of surplus stock: We have our iwn town, the greenhouses are out three-fourths of a mile, and srtise that we will give a carnation or a rose to every lady to the greenhouse. We never mention children, because if we did have a thousand children out there after them. We give them &gt;• lady or gentleman calling at the greenhouse. Oftentimes we take some to the stores and hand them to the clerks; perhaps we have some every few days and we take down some this week, and in two or three days we take down some more to another store and hand them to the clerks, and it is a good advertisement We have found, or at least I have thought it did not pay to make special sales, unless once in a great while a special sale on carnations. Mr. Ayres: This talk on how to get rid of your surplus flowers docs not answer Mr. Atkinson's question. These gentlemen all live in towns of 5,000 or better, but what are we going to do in the little towns of 1,500 to 2,000? We haven't any dally papers, and no depart - ment stores, and we want a demand for the flowers we raise and grow Kit there at home. The question is how to advertise and get results, t Is what we want. Mr. Green: If there is no surplus you don't need a demand created. The idea In having a demand is to use the surplus. Mr Atkinson: I understand that, but in a small town you will be getting, say, 300 carnations a day; if you have a large funeral or two a week you haven't enough, but if a week comes that you have no funerals you will have a surplus. I don't believe we have received any extra orders on account of advertising, but the idea I am trying to get at is. to create a steady demand, and we must have a surplus, too. The demand hinges largely on funerals or receptions, and to have enough for these in ordinary times you must have a surplus. Clr. Sinianton: I think the person that gets up an absolute answer to advertising question can get a better job than the president of the York Life Insurance Company. I think that is a business problem with men in any other line and while some are getting better results than others, It is a problem with the best of them. •Jr. Green: I want to ask Mr. Atkinson If he caters to a shipping trade to any extent? Mr. Atkinson: In what way do you mean? Mr. Green: If he advertises out of town, if he sends any advertls- </seg>
            <seg id="p098">98 Mr. Atkinson: We reach a good many towns and we sell as many in surrounding towns as we do in our home town. We have Mr. Dol. ihtrty-flve miles on one side of us and Mr. Simanton twenty-five mile* on another side and Mr. Marshall is thirty-five miles southeast nf m and we can only reach half way to those places. Mr. Green: We have in Fremont some twenty-eight towns *herr we have an agent, as we call it, at a drug store, a restaurant or an undertaker's, who takes orders for us on a commission. He sends the orders in and we ship direct to him. He is really the dealer and w&gt; find that we get a big trade of that kind, and the demand is mon M lew steady all the time. It comprises about three-fifths of our emir. business. Chairman: I know a man who is or was an advertiser, or sperm salesman. This man could go out in a town of 2,000 and put on sale for a general merchandise store and always clean up that stor in ten days. He started in business for himself not long ago and h did not know how to advertise to make a little business pay tha did not have a thousand dollars invested. He could advertise for othe people in that one way and make a success of it, but he didn't kno how to go about it in a small way for himself. I think that most of these things we have to learn as individuals in our own surroun ings — surroundings which are different in each case, and the conditions are different. I do not think any of us could learn the remedy fo evils existing in any other place of business, or in any other town, think it has to be learned right on the ground. Chairman: Is there anything further to be said on the subject ot ertlsing, or any other subject that we ha\&lt;; not covered? Mr. Yeager: I think Mr. Green has struck the keynote of the situ on as far as the matter of advertising is concerned. I believe h an is the best plan, and it hinges on this: When a man's trade ot satisfactory and he desires to increase his business and his business not sufficient to warrant the increase, then of necessity it follow at he should increase his territory from which he draws and tiich he desires to sell his goods. 1 think Mr. Green has successful nswered your question. I know nurserymen who have been twent re or thirty years in a little town, successful, good nurserymen, wh ave li ■» n desirous all the time of increasing their business and wl lave been unable to do so because their trade would not allow it. We on the other hand, I have known others who have increased their fie which they worked. If they did not have the trade at home they we ut and sought it and built up and made trade in n»w territory. Th the solution all these people find in the promotion and building up their business. It applies tq nurserymen as well as florists. Anoth Ing I would suggest that helps trade a good deal: Competition som mes Is a mighty good thing to stir up businnw. It puts a fellow o « mettle. </seg>
            <seg id="p099">99 that probably we arc to take up later on, and that is an international florists' exchange, or (lower exchange between florists all over the coun try. There has been different systems suggested by florists all over the country. The latest one is this one Mr. Vallentine brought up In Florida. I was approached by another company in the East that was trying to establish companies all over the country, and they wanted someone to take hold of it in Omaha — just one man to handle that trade. This man was to pay $50 to the firm and all the orders were to go first to the headquarters and they will send the orders back to the dealer and they are to be distributed that way. If any of you fellows are posted on this subject it would not be a bad idea to take it up. Ean: The system that Mr. Vallentine has organized is one of comprising a lot of florists in all of the cities of the United believe it covers Europe as well. We have a list of the belonging to this society, and so, if we have an order to be in New York City, that order is immediately telegraphed to New York City to the one we may choose out of that list, as there may perhaps be a dozen members in a city the size of New York. In Omaha there would probably be two. They do not cut this list down to one in each city; anyone may belong who has the reputation of being a reliable florist by making the payment of dues can become a member and has his chances as well as his competitor in the city. Mr. Henderson: I think this society really ought to agree with Mr. Vallentine or recommend his system. I think it is the best system we have in the country, and we ought to help it along. Chairman: That is the only system that is recognized by the Amer - ican Florists. Pr. Green: While that might be and probably is all right, yet 1 believe the florists of Nebraska are ready for anything of that kind, will they be for the next generation. The idea of that is to deliver flowers in distant cities, and perhaps Mr. Frey or Mr. Henderson would have occasion to deliver flowers to someone going on board a ship, but in Fremont, Beatrice or Falls City we have no trouble in getting our flowers delivered. We have a directory and we can find the name of a reliable florist, and I do not believe it would be wise for Nebraska Uorists to go to the trouble of organizing anything of that kind for our individual use, inasmuch as we have the American Society, as author ized association of that kind. P airman: No, I think a society of that kind would be of little t to the florists of Nebraska; in these small places he would be three to five years getting back his returns Invested In an organiza - tion of that kind, but in large cities it Is an organization for which there is need. All the orders given to these florists are guaranteed to be satisfactory by the organization bark of them, and there is to be a </seg>
            <seg id="p100">100 !*■ )&gt;OMible to make it all over the United States during Ike &lt;lit1 Mr. Henderson: I will tell you of an experience I had, and th - system I use: I always pick out of the Florists' Directory where I have an order, and telegraph there the order and they always nil it and send the bill back to me with the discount. I always prefer a member the society of the American Florists, and he can look me up and see that I am a member too, and know that I am all right. I telegraph or flowers to Chicago, New York or Boston and I have never had any trouble with them. They are always delivered. To see If that other vstem has any advantages is the reason I brought it up. Chairman: The only advantage I ran see would be in having a uui orm price. Not long ago we had occasion to telegraph to Buffalo, Xe\« ork. for five dozen Bride's roses for funeral purposes. We did no 1 know what they would cost, and gave the customer no price at all. Bat customer was in good standing with us, but whatever the pn&lt; . harged in Buffalo we would have to charge. This florist in Buffalo ian;ed us (20 for five dozen, and our customer came in in a couple of eeks and stated he was in Buffalo at the time and bought flowers in is same store and got at good roses as they gave us at five dozen for 0. For that reason I think this organization will make prices more niform all over the country, and we will then know just about what e are going to pay and what we are going to get. I Mr. Atkinson: Some yrars ago I sold some carnations to be delivered Indianapolis, Indiana. The customer wanted Enchantress, which ell at 75 cents, and that bill came back to me and I was charged $?. h 20 per cent off. I had sold them for 75 cents. L Chairman: Such things as those have to be charged to profit and i and balanced on the side of experience. t Secretary: Occasionally, on the other hand, a florist will get an order ii N&lt; w York city. I got one last Christmas which said "Enclosed will find $25. Express to Captain and Mrs. 'so and so' at Fort &gt;inson five dozen roses." We were selling them then at $3 a dozen. Mr. Green: You ought to send that excess to Mr. Atkinson. Mr. Simanton: Last Decoration Day we received an order for flowers to be put on a grave at West Chester, Pennsylvania. We seit the order back i here and got our money for it, but never received a bill from that florist. Possibly we owe Mr. Atkinson the difference he paid. t Chairman: Are there any other questions anyone wishes to ask? not, I believe that is all for this afternoon. Second Vice President Ed Williams resumed the chair. Chairman: To-morrow morning Mr. W. F. Kydd, of Simco, Ontario will address us on the subject: "What the Canadian Government is Doing to Advance Horticulture in Ontario."

Chairman The first thing on our program is a paper by Mi A I Rrown. of Geneva, on the subject: ''Identification of Cafalpa ' Mr Brown spokf as follow?: IDENTIFICATION OF CATALPA. A. J. BBOWX. GENEVA. Bnk it was three or four years ago in a board meeting thU&gt; mat irding the confusion in catalnas was brought up. This subject have l&gt;een worded a little differently. I was asked to look the up and I have been two or three years doing it and have done poorly and needed to go a whole lot further than I have done, but what I have found and concluded I will tell you. My naper of neces - sity Is very firlef because it does not deal with anything except a few varieties. Bailey, in his Cyclopedia of American Horticulture, names mad describes only four species of catalpa that are hardy In this part of the North Temperate Zone, namely, Speciosa, Bignonioides, Kaempferi and Teas Japan Hybrid. Oil these we are interested in only tho first two. Speciosa and Bigncnioides. These two have been planted and are now growing over all of the eastern half of Nebraska. They are so nearly alike when small thai it is very dillicult if not impossible to tell the one from the other, but as the trees get larger there is a growing dlf ference which becomes more marked as the trees get older, yet in spite </seg>
            <seg id="p102">102 t;ly, lu distinguish one from the other. Notwithstanding this clow mblanoe, there is a very wide difference in their commercial value. The wood of the Speciosa is very durable in the ground, lastln early or quite as long as red cedar (I Uavr seen specimens that had een in the si-ound fifty years and were yet sound) and hence is re aluable for fence posts, railroad ties or for any use that requires timbe be set in the ground. On the contrary the wood of the Bignonioid ■ almost worthless for the uses above named, as it rots in a ve yoars in the ground. It is mainly valuable as an ornamental ade tree, it being a very profuse bloomer covering itself almost entire th magnificent clusters of very beautiful white flowers which av e last of June. In view of this, and the enormous demand for the seedlings of the iosa for forest planting, the Importance of being able to distinguish between the two species becomes at once apparent particularly in gather ing the seed, the Speciosa being very valuable for forest planting and the Blgnonioides practically worthless. tAs before stated the two species are so alike when young that it la rly or quite impossible to tell one from the other for several years tr planting. The first variance noticed is in the blossoming, the Spe - ;a blooming fully ten days earlier than the Bignonioides, the Individ flower being somewhat larger and the cluster of bloom smaller and i in number. Then, as the tree gets age, the Speciosa grows some faster I makes a strong upright tree, with a dark, deeply wrinkled bark ambling somewhat the bark of an elm or a box-elder. The Bignonioides, while a rapid grower, is more inclined to spread, making finally a broader head and somewhat lower tree with a lighter . olnr!»d bark much inclined to scale off. something like the soft maple Notice samples of wood Nor 1.

These are the only unimpeachable witnesses and always the court of last resort. EThe seed pods of the Speclcsa are usually borne singly and in pairs [ very rarely three or more in a cluster. There are from twelve to •nty-two Inches in length and from one-half to five-eighths of an Inch diameter The seeds are both long and broad, from one and three - rths to two and three-fourths inches In length and from one-fourth to ee-eighths of an inch broad, with the hair on either end distributed 1 across the end and not penciled. kWith the Bignonioides the seed pods are borne in cluster of from ee to six or more, are from six to twelve or fifteen inches in length ! from three-sixteenths to five-sixteenths of an Inch in diameter.

The seeds of the two species are quite different and are easily ■repeal, the principal marks of identification are shown by the ng comparative summary: SPECIOSA. Tree, rather robust upright grower, with a dark deeply wrinkled bark Blooms rather sparingly from middle until the last of June, small ■ lusters of large flowers. Eed pods are borne singly or in pairs, very seldom three or more cluster. The pods are from twelve to twenty-two inches in length ne half to five-eighths of an inch in diameter.

BIONONIOIDES. B Inclined to spreading growth, with lighter colored bark, much to scale off. Blooms the last of June and first of July, larger clusters of smaller dowers. Seed pods are borne In clusters of two or six and more, iml they are usually shorter and always less in diameter than Speciosa. ■ seeds are shorter and narrower than Speciosa with less hair on pointed ends and more or less penciled. In considering the foregoing it must be remembered that I hav** giver general characteristics of the two species and refer particular!? to the extreme types, the two ends if you please of a long line of similar individuals between the two extremes, which apparently gradually merges from one to the other thus making difficult the identification of som. individual trees. There is quite a wide variation in the pods and seeds of undoubted Speciosa. Please note the difference between the pods and set'ds of No. 1 (illustrating), which are long and heavy, borne singly and in pairs, and No. 6, which are much shorter In seed and pods, the latter being In clusters of two to six. This No. 6 is from the largest catalpa tree in Fillmore county. It is twenty-six inches in diameter one foot from the ground and nearly fifty feet in height. John P. Brown, of Indiana, examined this tree several years ago and pronounced it Speciosa. Trees growing on creek bottom land produce much larger seed than the same species grown on the upland and this has led to some confusion in determining the Speciosa. This identification of catalpa is a comparatively easy matter as </seg>
            <seg id="p104">104 produces individuals that it if very difficult to know definitely whether they are Speiiosa or something else. All this variation could easily be accounted for if the species would hybridize, but their blooming periods seem to indicate thai 1Mb Is very improbable it not quite impossible.

In order to better illustrate what 1 have tried to tell you I have five specimens of catalpa wood showing the different kinds of bark, also seed pods and seeds from the same trees, together with a number of samples of seed pods and seeds showing this apparent merging or on&lt; species to the other, or might it be the result of hybridization? Chairman: Mr. C. S. Harrison is on our program for a paper on the subject of "State Parks," but Mr. Harrison is unable to be with us at this time on account of sickness. However, we have with us Mr. W. F. Kydd, of Canada, and we are very lucky to have him drop in at this time He is going to give us an idea of what the Canadian government is doing to advance horticultural work. I take pleasure in introducing Mr. W. F. Kydd, of Sinco, Ontario: rAT THE CANADIAN GOVERNMENT IS DOING TO ADVANCE HORTICULTURE. W. P. KYDD, SIXCO, OST il do not come before you this morning with any idea of telling you i to grow fruit in this state, but I was asked to say a few words of it is being done In my country. I can not say anything against your eminent, but I believe our government Is the best for the farmer that re ever was in existence. Very nearly everything our farmers ask they get from our government. It Is granting immense sums of ley for agriculture in Ontario. It has now begun to help the fruit wers; large grants have been taken in the last few years; men have a sent to different localities where fruit growers, or farmers have en little care of their apple orchards to help them. Apple growing jo new thlag with us; I have seen farms with 10,000 to 12,000 trees it large enough to bear, but I can think of only three or four apple nards that have had any care that would justify a man in expecting a crop from such an orchard. It was those orchards that our govern </seg>
            <seg id="p105">105 HORTICULTURE IN CANADA. I nient thougnt fit to deal with and to prove to the frnit-grower, I will rail him a farmer, that there Is better money In his apple orchard than anything else on his farm. I do not think these orchards had been bringing more than $25 to $30 an acre, and I think the man was paid a big price even then because they had to go over a good many trees to find many bushels of apples and that adds to the cost fast. I do not want you people to think we are all like that, for we are making as great a success in some parts of our country as there Is made anywhere else. We hnve men who have been educated up to this in the last ten years who are making a handsome thing out of their apple orchards. T know a man who probably had 100 acres of land, with 80 acres of apples: as it used to be he got no revenue from it, but now he is g?ttinR about $2,000 a year out of his apples. Our idea is to educate these non-managers up to the same stage as that other man. Our way has been to send a man supposed to know the business into a certain locality, he hss probably six. sevpn or eight dis - eased orchards given into his charge in the spring, he secures a man to prune the trees, and he stays with him and teaches him how to prune them. I think it is easier to teach a man to spray than it is to teach him to prune. We get our men to spray without any trouble, but to get tlienr. to prune is a difficult thing in fact most of them butcher up th» trees. In orchards thirty-five to forty years old we find there is a trunk and the branches are cleaned up about six or eight feet above the crotch and no top at all. I call that a butchered tree with no fruit within ten to twelve feet of the ground, and others the limbs are bare all the way un. and others are like a fox tail at the tor. Now a tree like that, what it should have done to it. T am not teaching you. but I am telllne you what we are trying to do in our country. Is to force that tree to have benrine wood. How are we going to do it? We are taking eff the top and putting all our work on the branches way far up. and by top - working that tree we force the branches or sprouts to come out lower down on the branch. Every tree can be trained if you only cut it back as you ought to. So we are trying to bring that bearing wood down nearer to the ground as it ought to be. I know there are lots of apple trees that are mighty difficult to prune, almost impossible to spray, and simply impossible to pick the fruit from. You talk about planting and growing things in the moon, and planting potatoes in the moon, they have heen doing that in our country. All the pruning should be done largely on the outside. What for? To let in the sun; to color your apples. Take up all cross branches further in and the sun will get Into your apples far better. Colored apples, unless they are red, are no good at all, and then you will get them of a better size too. In many ways it will pay a man to thin his apples. If it takes time for pruning, it takes that much more time </seg>
            <seg id="p106">106 I This is what we do in planting apple trees; head them low to beg h, that is what the Oregon people do. where I believe are the bes nap&gt;-d apple orchards In this country and that is the Hood river d •t.

The only object of hie ilt- trees is to make easier cultivation, but if you want the easle slhlt- cultivation, why do not plant them at all. Now we will come to the subject of spraying. We are using Him ..ml sulphur We had been using the old-fashioned spray of Bordeaux In some itarts of our country we are troubled with the oyster-shell wale, to which lime and sulphur is death. We have another trouble black rot canker. Have you the oyster-shell here? Mr. Marshall: Yes. a little. Have you the black rot canker? Mr. Marshall: No. sir. I These are two hard things to fight, and I believe we have far mor. ?et trouble than you have, but you will get them; do not be worrtwi ut it I Our first spraying is done in July for the oyster-shell, using largely commercial lime-sulphur. Our farmers handle it more readily If y buy it than if they manufacture it. In young orchards of any size I am going to make it myself an will save fifteen cents a gallon by making It at home. That first raying we put on the commercial lime and sulphur in proportio one to ten: that is when everything is dormant. The next sprayin ■ use one to twenty: that is when the buds are breaking, and that ii we put in our arsenate of lead. We have tried nearly all of th •oisont- and I know of none so valuable as the arsenate of lead. Yo -an put it on just as thick as mud; you can plaster it on with the hand and it will not hurt. Put it on as thick as you like and it will set fa loafer on the foliage and it will stay longer in the solution. Then we cultivate our apple trees up to a certain season of the We begin in the spring and keep it up until the last week in me or the first week in July. That would depend upon your seasons hare, however. I am not prepared to say when you should stop culti ating here, but we keep absolutely clean cultivation until about the rst week in July. We have to conserve the moisture to make tho apple rees grow and keep the leaves green. Then we stop cultivation entirely and plant our cover crop to enrich the soil. Then we do not do any ing with it until the next spring, when we turn it under and carry n the same cultivation. Now, this cover crop Is very good because ■tops the tree growth and starts the ripening of the fruit and t' </seg>

Tf vour orchard hns not been cultivated I would advise you to cultivate It Just about as shallow as you can the. flrst time., for If you cultivate deep you cut off all the feeders and will give the tree quite a shock. To plow around these trees every man should have a plow with one horse, and have a clevis not less than fifteen Inches long. We pass r wire through the whiffletree and then the whifHetree can not touch the tree. I plow away from the trees for a couple of furrows one year and the next year I plow towards the trees. Be sure you do not cut into the trees. I should be sure that I had some grafting wax all pre - pared so that if the whifHletree tears the bark you can fix it right there and then. I Now we come to the picking of the apples. Have you co-operation the apple business here? If not, heaven help you; you are just like lot of threads. A thread is not strong at all, it will not hold unless is doubled, tripled or quadrupled. We farmers are the biggest duffers ve; we take anything they offer and when we come to buy we hare give anything they ask. It you farmers in this state of Nebraska 11 co-operate and stick together you can get anything in Nebraska it you please because you are seventy per cent of the population. What do we do? In our country we had no co-operation. A buyer came along — I had a small orchard in those days — and he offered me 100 lor that orchard. 1 said no, it cost me that to prune the trees In the spring. He went away and three or tour days later he came back and ottered me tW and at another time a week later be offered me $86. ow, wasn't that co-operation? You bet, but it was on the wrong side r me. But now we have co-operation. We had a bard lime to get ; there is no more stuDborn man than the average Canadian farmer; ou cannot get him to do anything that bis lather did not do. We asked ie farmers to come to a meeting. Another man and myself concluded e wanted it. We thought we required $5 or Jlu to buy oooks, but hen we asked them to put up $5 their feet got cold and there were nly tour men lett in the hall. The next year we got the thing started. e got sixteen farmers and. these tarmers proved to others that this thing was good to do and today we have an association of 35u apple growers. We have uniform packing; we can send a train load if we ant to because we are putting up these apples unilormly. There Is ne seeing eye over all. We get a good price lor our apples, buyers en are willing to pay a good price tor them and we receive every red nt tor them before the apples leave the platform. Formerly we ailed until they were paid for them, and sometimes we never were paid. We once had a man in our country that addressed a body of armers and he said if the farmers are lacking in anything they are eking In co-operation and were jealous of each other. We are jealous each other. Just another word and then I am done. Have you got any Inspection tn your country? Have you government inspection and condemnation </seg>

What is going to happen to the man that fills le middle of the barrel with culls and puts good apples in the top nd bottom? Go to your legislature and get them to start an inspection w. We have this inspection law and our apples can be branded fancy. o. 1, No. 2 and No. 3. Our No. 1 can not have more than ten per cent blemishes and must be of good color and fair size for the variety the apple. Our No. 2 may have twenty per cent of blemishes; they ay not be well colored. The No. 3 can not be sold at all except as Us. We have men educated by the government as inspectors who ravel all over, and I do not care where you are, they will mark them. e will say they are No. 1, and they will mark them possibly to be Id as No. 2, which means a difference to us of fifty cents, or possibly ou may be fined $100. I would fine a man a dollar a barrel. Are you boxing any of your apples? Mr. Marshall: Yes. Are you boxing many? Mr. Marshall: Not many. LI believe I am safe in saying that $4 a barrel is a fair pria* (or r winter apples last fall? Mr. Marshall: No, that is too much. Well, take it at that much for winter apples. I have been in qul a number of fruit stores within the past two weeks in your own count and I find that a great many apples are being shipped in from oth states; those apples cost $2.25 a box laid down at the store. I kno men who sent away and didn't get that much for them. Now, I ha estimated the apples at $4 a barrel, and apples at $2.25 a box, th would be $6.75 for three boxes, which equals a barrel. A barrel wou cost about forty cents, packing a box would cost not more than twen cents. That would be sixty cents to equal three boxes, which wou leave $3.40 for the apples in the barrel. Now, these three boxes apples would be $6.75 and the packing would be forty cents and t; boxes would be forty cents. Now. you can readily see that there is margin between the boxed apples and those put up in the barrel there is probably $2 difference between the apples put up in barre from those put up in boxes. I would advise you young men to bo more of your apples than you are, and by taking better care of you small orchards your revenue will be equal to the big men. I lived Kansas awhile, in Scotland awhile, and in Nebraska awhile, and I ha been working for the government of Ontario for a number of year and I have come to the conclusion that the man with a small farm we taken care of is making more money and has a happier life than th large fanner. I urge upon every fruit grower to make up his min that he is going to have the best fruit that can be put up, establish reputation for honesty and as soon as you get that you can not beg to supply the demand.

Secretary Marshall read his report as follows: SECRETARY S REPORT. The season of 1910 did not produce results to make the horticulturists braska very enthusiastic in general over the state. The fall and tarly winter weather preceding was the most disastrous with which the nurserymen and "fruit growers have had to contend for a number of years. Warm weather with an excessive amount of rainfall pre - vailed during the last half of November and the early part of December. There was then a sudden drop in the temperature, accompanied by heavy snow. The wet warm weather left the trees and plants in a condition more easily injured by the severe freezing and much damage resulted. Peach trees of all ages were killed outright in practically all of the state except the southeast corner. Much damage was also done to other trees and plants inclined to be the least bit tender, the nurserymen of the state losing quite heavily of young stock in the nursery rows. Then the spring of 1910 was another source of grief to the horti &lt; ulturlsts. After exceptionally warm weather in March and early April, bringing trees into blossom from two to three weeks earlier than usual, several days of trying weather for the buda and blossoms prevailed. The temperature dropped to several degrees below freezing several times and a high northwest wind prevailed, killing the blossoms of apples, cherries and plums, except in the southeastern part of the state </seg>

The i&gt;eople of the southeast part of the state, with orated and well tended orchards were fortunate and escaped th&lt; ' injury from freezes and fiosts and harvested one of the best 1 years, and on account of the light crop the country over ivid for all their fruit. commercial growers in Hh hardson, Nemaha, Pawnee, Johnson and adjoining counties harvested large crops of very fine apples, whilt - ;-&lt;ai&gt; and i»«ih&gt;s in this section also produced veil in a number ol tnsta nry C. Smith, of Richardson county, reports a yield ot more than 20.00U bushels of apples; the Shubert brothers, of the same •y, more than 35,000 bushels. Good yields were also reported fron. commercial growers at Peru, Auburn. Johnson, Tecumseh, Table Rock. Du Bois, and points farther west. In Lancaster county the crop was lighter, although a few orchards produced well. The quality of the fruit grown was above the average, due to more thorough spraying and cultural methods and to weather conditions not so conducive to the development of scab and other fungous diseases. Trees and plants in all parts of the state have made good growths and went into winter quarters in splendid condition, which indicates a heavy crop next season The capacity of Horticultural Hall at the state fair was taxed to take ■ •ar»' of the floral and fruit exhibits shown. The list of entries was large, notwithstanding the short fruit crop in the state. Almost every ■ lass nllid and practically all of the premium money offered was paid out and from the standpoint of quality and appearance we think the exhibit* tht- best ever staged at the Nebraska state fair. Wallaces' Farmer, in making a report of the fair as viewed from an impartial standpoint, had the following to say regarding Horticultural Hall: Horticultural Hall is always an interesting place to visit at Lin The state society lends its influence to encourage exhibits of apples and other fruits, with the result that a fine display is made every yi ar. This year, in spite of the unfavorable season in many localities, the quality and extent of the show surpassed all records The apples were of excellent coloring and size, and remarkably clean and free from scab and worms. Evidently the Nebraska fruit growers •re giving more attention to spraying and scientific orcharding. The increase in the display of pears was most notable, there being several times as many entries as last season, and this fruit is becoming more general in the orchards of the state. Among the interesting things of the show none were more eloquent of Nebraska's success as a fruit country than the handsome trophy cups and medals won by her hortt &lt; ulturists at the national show last winter."

Marshall: Our Viee-Presldent, Mr. Will Harrison, is unfor - ately away. In fact, it might be well to state the condition of the ee Mr. Harrisons. Father Harrison has been sick a long time and not able to be with us; Harry was sick for some time, but was up I thought he would be able to be here yesterday evening and would K&lt;-i&gt;ort adopted </seg>

While I do not like the idea of electing any one who is not here, all of those on the Board know that W. A. Harrison is one of the best members we have in the society. He is a live wire when it comes to business, therefore, I want to place Ms name in nomination for president. Seconded by Mr. Yager. Mr. Marshall: I move that the rules be suspended and that he be elected by acclamation. Chairman: The motion is out of order. Are there any other nomlna- ■ Brown: I move that nomination for President close. Seconded Strand. Mr. Green: I move that the Secretary be instructed to cast the unanimous ballot of the society for W. A. Harrison. Seconded by Mr. Yager and carried. Secretary announced that he had cast the ballot for Mr. Harrison. Cnairman: Mr. Harrison is declared elected. Chairman: The next office to be elected is the First Vice-President. Mr. Barnard: The First Vice-President, by the rules of the society, carries with it the superintendency of the fruit department of the Horticultural society, and I wish to place in nomination for that posi - tion a man long identified with the society and one who is always found in every place where there is good, hard work to be done. He has never had anything in the way of an honorary office, yet he is always ready to do the things we want him to do, has a mind of his own, and you will all bear me out that if he don't think things are going right he will tell you so, yet if we do not vote him he always submits to the majority. I want to place in nomination the name of Mr. A. J. Brown. Seconded Mr. Mr. Yager. Mr. Green: I want to differ with Mr. Barnard a little in regard to the office of First Vice-President carrying with it the superintendency of the fruit exhibit at our state fair. While that is convenient and has been for some time customary, it has not always been so. When I was First Vice-President we appointed a superintendent, and I believe on a motion to the effect that a superintendent be appointed by the Hoard. Now, we have as Second Vice-President, a member who has been valuable to the society and a good worker, and I believe he is entitled to an advancement, and that has been customary. I wish to place in nomination Mr. Ed Williams, of Grand Island, as First Vice- President. Seconded by Mr. Henderson. Chairman: Are there any other nominations? There seems to bo none, so we will have to have a ballot. I will appoint Mr. Yager aird Mr. Henderson as tellers. Chairman: You will now proceed with the ballot. I suppose you are all aware of the fact that just members are allowed to vote? Mr. Marshall: Is it allowable to say anything about the snperin - tendents?

You may proceed with the ballot. LMr. Williams: Mr. Brown has beaten me. and inasmuch as I am Mr. iwn'i opposing candidate I move that Mr. Brown's election be made unanimous, and that Mr. Brown be declared the choice of the society for First Vice-President. Seconded by Mr. Marshall and carried unan imously. Mr. Brown was declared duly elected. Mr. Barnard: I wish to place in nomination for Second Vice-Presi dent the present incumbent. I was under the impression that the florists have had two terms. The fruit men do not claim Father Harrison as a fruit man and the florists do not claim him as a florist, and the idea is to run the .irtsid&lt; ncy between the fruit men and the florists. I wish to place in nomination Mr. Ed Williams ;is Second Vir. -President, and hat way to keep th&lt; nun in line for the presidency so they will some training.

Chairman: Who will you have for Treasurer? I I move that the rules be suspended and that the Seer. tary be Instructed to cast the ballot of the entire society for Petei Youngers, for, I think, the twenty-fourth year. Seconded by Mr. Yager and carried unanimously. The secretary cast the unanimous vote of the society for Mr. Peter Youneers for Treasurer, and he was declared duly elected. Chairman: In electing Mr. Brown to the office of First Vice-Preai dent you have caused a vacancy in the directorship, and we now have * director to elect. Mr. Russell: T wish to place in nomination the name of a man who bas done a good deal of work for a good many years for this society. I nominate Mr. C. H. Barnard. Seconded bv Mr. Blystone. Chairman: I want to put in nomination Mr. Russell. He has always been here working for the good of the society, too. Mr. Barnard: I want to second that nomination, and I also want to decline the office, and I move that the Secretary be instructed to cast the unanimous ballot for Mr Russell for director for the long term Seconded by Mr. Green and carried unanimously. </seg>

Chairman: The next thing is the report of committee*. Secretary: There are a few other things that ought to come up now. Shall we bring up the report of the Committee on Premium List at this time? Chairman: We are not ready for that yet Secretary: I have here a petition which Mr. I» O. Williams has asked me to present, which 1b as follows: City Hall, Lincol&gt;\ Neb., January 9, 1911. el I .;i master County Gardeners' and Fruit-Growers' Association a: annual meeting held this day, do hereby petition the Nebraska Horticultural Society: Believing that the best interests of horticulture throughout the state of Nebraska will be greatly conserved and benefited by the organization ind growth of auxiliary societies throughout the various counties of the state we do hereby commend for your consideration the annual appropria - tion of a sum ranging from $50 to (100 to each county horticultural society that shall maintain a regular organization. Said appropriations, we believe, should be used by such auxiliary societies in the payment of premiums at their annual winter displays of orchard and garden products: also for the purchase of books, magazines, and other supplies necessary to the welfare and encouragement of horticultural industries among its members. Rv unanimous vote of the society L. D. CLIFTON, President U O. WILLIAMS. Secretary Blr. Williams: If it is proper to discuss this measure now I would to say this: I believe it is for the best interests of the Horticultural ety and its interest throughout the state to enlarge our borders by K missionary work and encourage local associations — county or dis - trict societies. Those who are acquainted with the Horticultural Society of Iowa know that such societies have had the support of that board for years — for twenty-five years or more. The society that I was • member of has had the support of the State Horticultural Society. It supports four local societies by an appropriation of $150 annually, and this btate has done nothing of that character so far. We have in our state society a nucleus of old members who have been working together in the same society in the same way all its life and if we could at least branch out and encourage at least the organization of new societies in parts of the state we would be doing a great work. Every effort to enlarge our membership has (inictitally failed and we are not getting in many new people, we are not branching out. Three-fourths of this btate is not iepresented in this society. Our membership is made up. I would say at a rough guess, of not over one-fourth of the rountiee in the state. </seg>
            <seg id="p126">126 Secretary: That is a mistake; we have members all through in Mr. Williams: What you want to get at is to get the benefits of the society all over the state where these meetings will be held and have these annual displays. The suggestion I make in this petition that this aid shall be used for the advancement, or for the payment of premiums for displays at our mid-winter meetings. This petition came from the I-ancaster County Gardeners' Association. We nave in this county alone not less than 100 men and an aid of this kind would encourage a larger membership among our people here. What we ask for is the encourage - ment of the association by aid of that character. Mr. Brown: Is that question for discussion now? Chairman: We might as well discuss it now. I Mr. Brown: This is a matter that would be a benefit to the society we could do it. This society has $1,500 a year to pay all of its run - ig expenses, except premiums. The expenses of our fair have to be id out of this appropriation from the state. If we can see our way ar to do this I would be glad to do it, and I move that this matter referred to a committee of three to be reported on at some session the society before final adjournment. Mr. Williams: I would suggest that it be referred to the Board of l'irotors. I Mr. Brown: I withdraw my motion and move that this matter be erred to the Board of Directors. Seconded by Mr. Williams and ried. I Mr. Barnard: There is one matter that has taken some attention the present time. The meeting of the Horticultural Society is set th&gt;' ihird Tuesday in January; that was done on account of the H ■•'! ' hti-s on the railroads, but they have quit that now and w&gt; - ild like to ihauge our meeting time back to the second week, so as to the benefit of the meeting of the Historical Society. They are taking same ground and I would like to have the members think of that and v.-nirh time they would rather have. I Mr. Brown: I move we adjourn until two P. M.

E'hairman: The first topic on our program this afternoon is "Forestry Profit," by Professor Phillips, of the University, who will now address FORESTRY FOR PROFIT. PROF. r. J. PHILLIPS, LINCOLN, NEB. tin taking this subject for the third time in three successive years it ms to me that the chairman has given me old ground to cover. I ieve, however, that forestry can be made very profitable in the middle west, more profitable than it has been in the past. I note in the census of 1900 the amount of growth in the states of Minnesota, North Dakota, South Dakota, Kansas and Nebraska. First let me call attention to the land owned by the government in national forests. We have something liko ir.2,000,000 acres, which are estimated to contain about one-fifth of the total timber supply of the country. In these states I have mentioned we have 175,000,000 acres in rough and uncultivated land that is not in the agricultural portion; forestry has claimed this rough land. The forester must take over very poor land if he is going to make a profit, although the more valuable land yields a profit from such a growth as that of catalpa and eucalyptus. These states in the middle west ought to take a greater interest in the profit side of this type of land; first, on such lands as are found along the streams, and second, non-fertile lands, and third, the small waste spaces on the farm, and fourth, such areas as contain a considerable amount of alkali, which are not suitable for farm crops, granting that these lands can be used for forestry. Now, in (speaking of forestry for profit, what species ought to be planted? Ordi - narily two or three species provide the greatest profit, such as the Scotch pine, hardy catalpa and the cottonwood. The cottonwood warps badly, liut with the present methods of cutting lumber and caring for it there is no reason why it cannot be grown profitably. The price of cottonwood in the Missouri valley is $50 per thousand, and notwithstanding the high price there is a great demand for it as soon as the cottonwood is matured. The spe&lt; ies will grow better in the river bottoms than elsewhere; there are immense areas of river-bottom lands that are used for pasture, and nre good for nothing else, that could be put into cottonwood. It has been estimated and proven by one of the best authorities that we could pro - duce saw timber cottonwood in from twenty to twenty-five years; the standard raised is 5,000 to 15,000 board feet per acre; with a minimum o' five a&lt; res we would have a maximum of twenty to twenty - five cords for fuel per acre in twenty to twenty-five yean; this is the contention held by Professor Miller, my predecessor, in which he tried to advocate the planting of cottonwoods for fuel. We are in the belt of the Mississippi valley and its tributaries, which produces remarkable growths of cottonwood. In Germany where. </seg>
            <seg id="p128">128 year It is profitable, suppose they have been growing forty years, then they would have produced forty cords per acre. While we consider that If we don't produce two and one-third to three cords per acre per year the Investment is no good. It is known that the state of South Dakota passed • law holding that lumber cannot be shipped out of the state. Colorado i£ not self-supporting in timber, none of the Middle Western states are except Montana. It is not going to be long before all of the Rocky Mountain states will prohibit the shipping of timber out of the state, and it strikes me that the same thing can be said of Minnesota. Mii-hi Fan and Wisconsin. It was a very common statement that the forests of Michigan .\ouiJ "supplv the world, yet at the present time all three of those states m rting lumber from the Pacific coast and the South. There is no 1 but that the Nebraska timber supply of the future is going to be much more important than it is today; a man can figure on a much rreaiei profit than he can make at the present time; nearly evcrv man who has taken good rare of his cottonwood growth has created a good rtaw, taking the' second tree, the hardy catalpa. that has even more ?rlng returns from the soil. Perhaps most of you have known about Robinson plantation at Pawnee City, after allowing five per cent for cost, they secured a profit of $6.25 per acre per year. It has been my good fortune to investigate some plantations in Kansas. At riutchinson. which is one of the best fruit renters in the United States, they u&amp;c the best methods of spraying and they are up-to-date in every particular. One owner had about 600 orchard trees and about 300 catalpa trees end he makes more money per acre from his catalpa trees than he does from hi* fruit orchard. The same thing has been proven in the Farl&lt;nzton forest. The manager claimed he had cleared $50 per acre per year. I doubt that. He must not have taken into consideration the various ex ritures. The Yeagey plantation has averaged from $s to $20 par per year. In the spacing of hardy catalpa I have reconimendt (I that ;hc-y t&gt; spsxYG live feet by live feet or six feet by six feet. We usually a.ivj e»l»&gt; cutting the hardy catalpas in from ten to twenty years, if on ttv upland twenty years, if on lowland in ten years, when you get your Brat fence posts. It has been found that planting four feet by four feet it is a little too close, so if you make it four feet by six feet It is better; and for the second, third and fourth crops make your plantation six feet by eight feet, that is the recommended spacing for these crops. Your second crop matures quicker than the first. At the Yeagey planta tiim they have actually cut at the end of the fifth year for fence posts, hut the average was eight years. I think, on the proper sites in th Platte valley where the hardy catalpa does not winter kill, we tan </seg>
            <seg id="p129">KORKSTRY FOR PROFIT. 129 Illinois as a basis. Thf other species that should prove profitable, and there is a poasi bility of growing them in the sandhills, is Jack pine. Undoubtedly you iinow we have 300, ono acres of sandy lands tn Nebraska for forest ttmt ing. This pine has given indications of success in the famous Bruner brothers plantation, started in 1891, where it averaged a profit oi a least $S to $10 per acre. It has proven far from satisfactory in subs - quent work, yet I believe we can claim that the aforestation of the sand hills is t.oing to be profitable. The Jack pine makes a slower growth here than in its native home in Wisconsin. One of the few things we are trying to do is to induce it to make a satisfactory growth, for taking 1 from the sandy soil of Wisconsin to Nebraska, where there is a dimeren kind of soil, makes the growth slower. Most of the stock being shipped Into the state by Minnesota nurserymen made it difficult for us to solve that problem until Nebraska nurserymen took hold of it. I know tha tne production of native Jack pine is a difficult thing. I questioned one dealer in Minesota and he said there were something like 200,00 of these native grown seedlings shipped out last year. There is no doub but the market will improve within the next five or ten years and many more Jack pines will be planted than at present There is one feature of the forestry work that I want to emphasize and that is the possibility of introducing trees from abroad. In thl morning's discussion it came up about the Scotch pine, one of the tree that made the Robinson forest what it is. So far, we have had but littl success with the Scotch pine, which is largely due to the poor seed. Fo instance, Reita seed, which is the local name, we have nearly alway secured the inferior seed. In discussing that with a German, I say th Germans sell us their poor seed; he says that is a lie, the German don't sell anything poor. I took the position that the German gel anything he can, and gets as much for it as he can, am is glad to sell it. I should like to see some of that Reita seed tried in this country. So far, the Experiment Station has devoted its money to mere experiments. I believe a more liberal appro - priation with a possibility of a state forester here we can devise som way whereby if we can # get all the proper conditions we can grow i This species should give to us as big a profit as to the Germans an A.ustrians, and these fellows can make from $8 to $10 per acre profit. If you look upon the reports of the Province of Saxony you will see that a man there is making more money from his forest lands than from his agricultural lands. It seems to me, with our greater American ability, if we went at this problem in the right way, that the forests of Nebraska could no doubt be made very profitable. Chairman: We have heard a very good talk by Professor Phillips oa this subject and it is a subject in which we are all interested, and </seg>
            <seg id="p130">130 is now open for discussion. We would like to have it as thoroughly tugged as possible. I suppose the professor will answer any ques - &gt; you ask him. Mr. Pollard: Does the ratalpa sprout from the root after you cut if down? KYes, Mr. Yager harvested a second crop and the second crop pn more profitable than the first. We do not know how many we cmn cut down catalpa. With the eucalyptus in Germany »ve between four and five coppisings. Q. Do you suppose we could raise eucalyptus in Nebraska? A No, it can not be grown where there is frost Secretary: What do you consider the best tree for the lowland when - it is too wet for field crops? A. A good thing to plant is the catalpa. if the drainage is good; If the drainage is not good, the cottonwood. Q. What would be the ultimate use of Scotch pine? EThey use it for saw lumber or fence posts. We find they do well by treating them with creosote. It grows very rapidly with southeastern Nebraska. The finest I have seen are near Auburn, are trees marly 100 feet tall. • tary: I have here the resolution that was read to you before noon regarding the bill in congress affecting forestry. Professor Phillips will explain it to you. ■freor Phillips: This Weeks bill is Introduced for the purpose of land in the Southern Appalachians at $5 an acre. It has already the house. I think that the Horticultural Society for the last ears has passed a resolution practically to this same effect. It is for national forests to be owned by the government at the headwaters of the principal streams in the Southern Appalachians. Since most of cur hardwoods come from the East we shall always be dependent upon the East for those supplies, and this concerns Nebraska, and we should be interested in thrse conservation measures brought up by other states. Not 3 single acre can be bought at to exceed $F«, and it must be more valuable for forests than for agriculture. Chairman: If some member will move Its adoption we can get this resolution before the meeting. Mr. Brown: I move the adoption of the resolution. Seconded by Mr Williams, and carried unanimously.

That a copy of these resolutions be sent to each Nebraska senator and congressman. Adopted. P Williams: I want to ask Professor Phillips if he has made any tions in regard to the Norway poplar known as Sudden Saw A. It would take the whole afternoon to tell about that. About nine-tenths of us don't know what it is, as near as I can find out. About nine-tenths are selling Carolina poplar for Norway poplar and getting about three times the money for it. I can tell it when Norway poplar eets to be about five or six inches in diameter; I believe I can tell It. ■Brown: You can tell It then when they are side by side in the t Professor Phillips: I took this up with Professor Chaney, of Minne - sota. He claims he can tell, but he told me he was never sure until it got to be about five or six inches in diameter. I know from personal letters from nurserymen that a whole lot are selling Carolina poplar for Norway poplar and can not tell them apart. Mr. Brown: There must have been some confusion in getting it years ago, in getting the Carolina poplar for the Norway or the Norway for the Carolina, because they are two distinct poplars. Those I have seen are on Mr. Harrison's place in York. There is quite a difference between them; I do not know as I know which is which, but I know vvhirh we cut for Norway and which we cut for Carolina. I did not suppose anyone would attempt to pass off Carolina poplar for Norway poplar, as they are quite different. Professor Phillips: I tried them at the Experiment Station for my own benefit. I bought several so-called Norway poplars, and some were true to type. I thought I could distinguish them when they were two years old, but I found out after I got them that I could not distinguish more than one-tenth that I got for Carolina poplar. I have taken measurements of some poplars grown in Minnesota which show far supe - rior to the Carolina poplar. I believe, however, I could work this out; so far as I went, I am willing to say that I could tell a Norway poplar In t earlier stages. It is generally conceded a superior tree to the Caro - , poplar. Mr. Marshall: What is the difference and how do you identify them? Mr. Brown: I do not know as I can identify them. The Carolina poplar, as we get them, makes a stronger upright growth and the Nor - way poplar has a greater diameter and does not grow quite as smooth to the ground as the Carolina and is just a trifle darker in color — a darker red — and has less branches. That is the difference I have noticed. LMr. Marshall: At certain times of the year there la a difference In color of the leaves. </seg>
            <seg id="p132">132 Mr. Brown: There U a difference in the rows of young tree* you look down the row. Chairman: Are there any more questions? We know that the* - orticultural fellows are looking to these professors for information in 1 these matters that pertain to any questions as to varieties of catal as and poplars and all these things. If they can not tell the difference do not see how they expect us to. I have wondered whether the Carn - fna and the Norway poplars were the same. I have them both growing bere is a difference while the trees are small. I do not know how ley will be when they are large. In the early stages of their growth ere is an apparent difference In the mode of growth, but these profea sort want to keep prepared to tell us the distinctions; that is what w&gt; - zpect from them. L Chairman: Our next topic is "Farm and Municipal Wood Ixits." by . O. A. Williams, of Neligh. FARM AND MUNICIPAL WOOD LOTS O. A. WILLIAMS. M3.TRH. I ft el like apologizing for appearing before this body of expert* and specialists alone the lines of horticulture and floriculture. But zimply that you may understand and make due allowances. I will state to those who do not know me. and that is practically all of those assem - bled here, that my ordinary business is that of an attorney-at-law. I ani not presuming to know much about horticulture and the raising of trees, but I think that the committee or person who arranged this lirogram understood that 1 was not presumed to know very much about the subject, because the subject which precedes me and the subject which follow* my address can be made to cover practically the same ground and furnish all the technical knowledge desired. But I suppose I am supposed to do like lawyers do. use authorities and speak about what others have said instead of advancing my own opinion and knowl - edge. However, in regard to this subject, I have taken a deep Interest so far as my business would allow me to. I have read a great deal In regard to forestry and have been particularly interested in regard to the application of the principles of conservation and conditions in Ne - braska, and along that line, and that line alone. I wish to address myself today for a very few minutes. You know there are two aspects of forestry; that one is the preaer vation of what we have. The maintenance of our forests is getting to be a serious question. They go on cutting indefinitely, like they cut their forests in Europe, keeping their nrincipal intact, but never destroying it. aa our lumbermen have destroyed entire tracts. Then there is the other aspect of it. which is the only one that concerns us, the creating of forests where none have ever existed before. I take it that in the agitation for cwmervatton we have heard altogether more of the practical side. In re- </seg>
            <seg id="p133">133 rard to the first aspect of conservation the setting aside of hug. tor.-at re - serves for the reforestation of the Alleghanies so that the hardwood supply would be preserved and increased, but we have heard practically nothing of the building up of the forests. You hear of their planting in northern Michigan and Minnesota, where the forests have been lumbered and the forests totally destroyed. The threatened peril that has brought about the agitation for con - servation was the destruction of the forests at the head of the streams — at the headwaters, which leads to soil erosion and floods. Then the destruction of these forests has modified the climate as the de - struction goes on, and we are more concerned in this additional feature than in the destruction of the forests. And then will come the Increased cost of forest products until experts in that line say that in twelve to fifteen years the hardwood supply in this country, at the present rate of consumption, will be practically exhausted, unless something is done. that means farm machinery, furniture and other things made from hardwoods will increase in price or substitutes must be found. We are in no danger in Nebraska from destruction of the forests at the headwaters of our streams and soil erosion, because we have but little of that danger. We have no forests to destroy; we are better off today than we were twenty-five years ago in that respect, in much better condition, but it is also true that if we would build up forests and plant trees generally over the land we would be in much better shape in reference to our climate; we would also, in so far as we succeeded in growing this commercial lumber and posts, prevent the increase in price of forest products to the extent that we devoted ourselves to its production. tMy experience In Nebraska dates back a little less than twenty-sii rs, but as I look back to 1885 and my knowledge of the preceding r or five years and the condition of my relatives and friends in Nebraska I see a great deal of tree planting. Groves were put out and timber claims were being taken up in those days until in the part of the country where I lived and where my relatives lived, there was about on&lt; timber claim to every section, which amounted to ten acres of forest timber planted then by almost every farmer. Many came from Iowa, where trees grow readily. They put trees around their farms and along the roads and they put out wind-breaks, but little care and atten- Ewas paid to the quality and kinds of trees planted and I have ced that as the years have gone by this tree planting has ceased ost entirely. That is the thing that this society and the people of Nebraska ought to address themselves to; that is the disease in regard to tree planting that needs attention in this state, but I believe there is an awakening along the agitation on conservation. You know this conservation idea may be put through by simply a vote, but it may be delayed and it is best to encourage it by talking about it and passing resolutions about it and It may be made a practical thing in Nebraska. In the main, we </seg>
            <seg id="p134">134 have simply considered conservation simply as a project, bat the time has now come when it ought to be made a practical thing. If we can not make it practical we have but very little interest in the matter, except as it concerns us in regard to the cost of forest products. I know that the chief disciple of forestry, Mr. Pinchot, in some of his works places great emphasis on the preservation of forest timber, insuffi cient as It seems to me, upon the planting of trees. The time has come for us to help ourselves and improve the state braska. We may talk of this and may talk as they have been talking about conservation, but the vital thing and the thing to do is to begin to plant trees. Example is much better than precept, and agitation in Nebraska could be made definite. In general, we have ample room for improvement. The time is ripe for action. Every year is delay and means that much precious time lost. I do not mean by that that we should seek to emulate the Germans and French, but what would be possible for Michigan, Indiana and Iowa. We are not so favored in Nebraska so far as tree growing is concerned, and we might as well admit it. I have lived in Iowa and have planted trees there and have seen them grow for five or six years. I have planted trees in Nebraska and have seen them grow and I know that we can get the results in Nebraska upon ordinary land. tit is well enough to talk about planting trees upon bottom lands. it of the land in Nebraska is in the second bottom, but there is upland t will grow good crops of corn. When I am speaking of trees and planting of trees, I am speaking about lands where the wells are feet deep, where the trees grow successfully, notwithstanding that L If you can not make forest trees succeed upon that kind of land, d they will not succeed generally in Nebraska; but we can do well bin our means. Cottonwoods were spoken of. Years ago they were plentiful. Out in 7 part of the country I was going to say there are less there than ere were ten years ago, because they have been cut down and made to lumber and used for wood, and there has been no replanting of ttonwoods in the last fifteen years, practically none at all, and the ea has gotten out that they are practically worthless. They were anted originally along the highways and upon the farms. There was large area of land, several rods wide, that seemed to be destroyed by ose rows of cottonwoods, and the conclusion was reached by those who ave not thought deeply or carefully in the matter was that they should abandoned instead of placing them In groves by themselves. Any oss to adjoining land would be slight. The agitation should be renewed we would have cottonwoods planted generally in Nebraska by the armors. I have spoken of the ordinary uplands of the state, not the best lands in the extreme Eastern part of the state. I am speaking of what you might call the average lands in the North Platte country. In Ante - lope county, where the land is a black, sandy loam, where there are </seg>
            <seg id="p135">135 seme few sandhills, where, after you cross the bottom lands, I have noticed this upon these uplands that black walnut makes as good a growth as box-elder and all those trees of that character, which are generally planted, that the growth is sure, and I see no reason why these trees can not be planted and grown into value for lumber in the years to come. I think we ought to advocate the planting of black wal - nuts for timber and which would be a good thing for society in the next lifteen or twenty years. There is another value besides simply marketing the trees and that the creation of windbreaks, not simply to keep the winds from the orth and West from the house of the farmer, but also to break that weep of wind from the prairies and conserve the soil moisture. The me has come when some definite plans ought to be advanced by those authority, by which the farms would be kept up in proper fields &gt;&gt; single, double or three rows or trees, so that tha whole country may benefited by this breaking of the sweeping winds of the spring, which tentimes whip out the crops in the sandy lands, and as we saw two ars ago, the clay lands of the bottoms was drifted until the oat crop as cut right out of the ground. The lighter soil suffers still worse a country where the trees are not grown. Where you have the trees own every eighty rods you will find this wind damage much less. It a thing worthy of careful consideration. Now as to my subject, I fear I have drifted farm from it, "Farm and unicipal Wood Lots." There are three forms of activity for thf anting of trees in this state, as my subject would indicate: One Is te municipal planting, the second is the ordinary farm wood lot, and e third, which I would add, would be corporate activity in tree plant g. By that I mean the organization of corporations so a number may in themselves together, who have no farms to develop, both for and behalf of the interests of their pockets and the general good of the mmunity, by putting in a forest tract, whether large or small, and or the second, the incidental benefit of demonstrating to the people nerally that forest planting will pay in Nebraska. When you li»ve emonstrated that you have won the battle. That is one of the important ings to take hold of now and in this year of 1911. When we come to the question of municipal wood lots our thoughts vert to the days of old in the European cities and villages where dwell any of these corporations which are enabled to go without taxation together on account of the revenue they derive from their forests. It o obvious that we cannot gather unto ourselves in the different states rests like they can in countries entirely forested to begin with, and by reful management get a revenue therefrom. It is a more difficult roblem which presents itself to us, and that is the bonding of villages nd cities, because we must speak of those of the second class. It is mmaterlal in regard to Omaha or Lincoln and the several cities of e third class, unless you can reach the villages of the second class reform would amount to nothing. These municipalities must bond </seg>
            <seg id="p136">136 N'EBKAMKA STATE HOHTI SOCIETY « themselves for $5,000 or $10,000 and buy lands which are now $50 to $10t&gt; an acre and forest these tracts, and It would be ten to fifteen years before any revenue can be derived therefrom. Will the people do it? I do not know I think it would be a good thing to do just as an example to show what can be done in Nebraska. But as a lawyer I want to say that I do not think there is legislative authority to do that; that is. to purchase lands and plant trees for the purposes of profit. There is authority for the creation of parks for park purposes, but the definition of a park is not such as would include the planting of trees and main mining tracts for profit only. So if you go into this matter as a munici - pality you must do it under the law authorizing the purchase and main - tenance of parks and indirectly get a profit therefrom. I doubt whether the legislature, under the constitution of our state, could empower Elcipalitles for the purpose of buying land to plant trees for profit, constitution limits the municipality and the legislature so far as granting of powers in municipalities we come to the most important feature of tree planting in this •laie. that is the farm wood lot. Probably from ten to twenty per cent of the land should be in forests to get the best results. We ought to have that much, but I am willing to abide by the much talked of sixteen io one ratio. I think that if every ijuarter or 160 acres had a farm wood lot of ten acres it would be about the right proportion, and it is avail - able. The proper amount of agitation would procure it in the main. Let me Illustrate: I have been planting trees upon a farm I have from year to year persistently for the last few years and the force of example is worth a zood deal. When I go out to that farm I must invite neigh ban to heli&gt; plant trees, and this has been my attempt. I induced a neighbor that I got to help plant some trees two years ago to send to the nursery for 500 trees to plant himslf on his land. So if you once get the idea into the air it will carry itself, but it will not start itself. Now you have already heard in regard to planting trees for profit and I can not add anything to that. I have planted catalpas on the ■ d 200 feet above the water supply used in the well; there are no streams in the neighborhood; they are growing and have not winter killed, as far as I know, but seem to be getting along all right. I planted locusts, and 1 planted cottonwoods twenty-five years ago, not - withstanding; we have said that bottom lands constitute the best prac - ticable and only feasible place, I have planted cottonwoods for profit. KThey grow well on these uplands, not as well as on lowlands, but we e large trees there that could be cut down and made into lumber; they id well and they did not die; they went through the drought of 1894. .Vow, if we could get this idea I have mentioned of ten acres to every quarter section for a wind-break or to retard evaporation, we would have accomplished a great deal for the state. Now, the third method is that of corporate investments. I think that has dome decided advantages. There are a great many living in towns interested i» this matter as I am and yet they have no lands and have </seg>
            <seg id="p137">137 no farms. 1c is true those living in town* who read about conservation are oftentimes more vitally interested than the farmers themselves. It is true the farmers are too apt to plod along in the same old way and plan to reap their profits for their work every year. It used to be hard to get a man to plant alfalfa and clover because they could not rv»p a profit the year they sowed It. They would not wait even two or three years. Thtv are sometimes very short sighted, too, in looking forward to their o»x good. In the town. i&gt;eoj&gt;l&lt; are more apt to be theoretic in regard to these uiatteis, and I see no reason why in almost any village of the second ■ lass you tan not gather from $2,000 to $5,000 profit. Let each man take such an amount of stock as he pleased, l.et the tract be pur - chased and planted just as they have in many places put their thousands of dollars in eucalyptus and catalpa projects. I realize that if you had a project like that its chimerical value is much more attractive to men than the ordinary projects which are all figured right at home. I have watched men in my community who refused to take stock in a home telephone company that pays eight per cent dividends and has for the last seven or eight years, who buy eucalyptus, coal mining and gold mining stock and lose money. But there ought to be a few sensible men left who would figure out a forestry proposition and say I will put in $50 or $100 on this experiment, and we will demonstrate to the people of this state, and educate the farmers, that it pays to plant trees for commercial profit. The benefit in the main in the towns would be 'he r ame incidental benefits I have mentioned. Who does not estimate a community as he rides through the country on the cars or in his automobile by the tree growth in it? When you find a growth of trees along the road here and there you think what a fine country It is, the people are enjoying life there, and it would be pleasant to live there: it looks like home. That is what these projects mean instantly as you view them. I do not know that any new organization is necessary, yet 1 have thought in my own community that if I had a little more leisure than I have I would see if I could not organize an association, and we would buy a tract of land and plant it to trees and then we would send out to the farmers and say to them, here is a pledge we want you to si&lt;n. "How many of you will pledge himself to plant ten acres of trees — one acre each year for ten years?" and If they would not plant one acre for ten years then one acre for five years, and get these pledges, get 100 men in one county; and when you get 100 to do that they will talk It to their neighbors, that means 500 that will do that. It runs throughout the whole community, It spreads and is a good example. So I come back at the end where I started at the beginning, and the thing to do is not to theorize, but to be practical and plant trees and do It now. DISCUSSION. Chairman: I am sure we have been delightfully entertained and have listened with a great deal of interest to this splendid address on </seg>
            <seg id="p138">138 the subject of tree planting and forestry by Mr. Williams. The subject tnow open for a brief discussion to those who want to ask any ques - ss. or offer anything further on the subject. R Taylor: I do not know whether the cotton wood varies in this s It does with us. We have apparently two varieties, one very and straight grained, while with the other the different growths be weaved together. So it will pay you to select your trees. Mr. Pollard: I think it would be a good plan to plant some hardwood trees, as he says the supply is being exhausted. Hickory, oak and black walnut will grow just as well as your cottonwood will; they do not grow as fas-t. I have cottonwood trees that would make 'saw logs now. Why not advocate some hardwood such as I have named, and then wv would have wood suitable for furniture. Cottonwood is not good for anything unless you get the right kind. This man has the right idea; there is the yellow and the white kinds; the yellow is very nearly as tood as this Indiana poplar. The white one you can split with a maul and wedge, but if you get the board sawed it will roll all over your lot, and when you put it in fences they will crawl off. Cottonwood will die of old age at fifty years and then it will never sprout up. We have had ■ great deal of talk here in Nebraska, and there is nothing more impor - tant than this forestry business. If this society is going to recommend trees to plant I want to say that I have lived in Nebraska a good while and I have gotten terribly taken in by poor advice. Now, do not let us start in and urge thtse farmers to plant worthless trees. Cottonwood is a Food tree to plant if you want one to come up quick, but also plant some hickory, ash and walnut, and then you «ill get a start with «me hardwood. Now, this idea of having a farmer's wood lot is an important thing, but this gentleman is a little wild on that; he wants them to plant ten acres on each quarter and I have six acres and that will support two farmers. You do not need ten acres; there are little plats near the creek, little banks where you can get two or three acres and have all the wood you want. You will find a few cottonwoods good, liut I would put in a few ash and black walnut and oak, some elm, some osage orange, they make good telegraph and telephone poles, and they make good fence posts, and they last longer than any other tree. We are planting osage orange for hedge, and we are cutting hedge now, that hedge pays a good rental for the land, and we have the fence and we have the wood lot. Some are cutting down their hedge because it takes up so much room. I like this man's idea, the home in Nebraska is a sacred place, and I believe now by planning a little we can talk the farmers into improving their homes a little in Nebraska. I can build a fence up sky high where nobody can come in and I may stay and live there in comfort and luxury and by planting some trees on these prairies we can get some firewood; we must have firewood. You can raise all the fruit you want, raise all the vegetables you want, and you can have a perfect home on your farm in Nebraska. I believe in fixing up right and starting right. Nebraska is an Ideal place to make an ideal home; we have </seg>
            <seg id="p139">139 the finest climate, the finest soil, and perspective views, and landscape views, and in giving this advice to start I want them to start right; I have had lots of advice given me and I have planted hundreds of thou - sands of trees that are not worth a cent. If forests are started it is a grand thing and there is no danger of running it to the extreme if you get the right kind of trees. The box-elder tree will die in about forty years of old age. I have planted' cottonwood trees and sawed boards out of them fifteen inches wide and those boards are just as Kas this poplar. We have sawed yellow cottonwood trees planted ' years ago and sawed the lumber and made a house out of it. Prman: We always listen with a great deal of pleasure to these men, men who have been through the mill, and Mr. Pollard is 1 who has taken poor prairie and made a beautiful home out of many of us have seen it. We are proud of our pioneers and we like to have them give their information and experience. It inspires us E these lines we are seeking more knowledge on. Many mistakes made by many of the earlier planters and many of those mistakes x- avoided by taking the advice of these pioneers. Mr. Youngers: I heartily agree with Mr. Pollard that in the earlier days mistakes were made, and I think right now is the time we want to have it understood that all parts of the state are not adapted to trees like those in the locality where Mr. Pollard lives. While there are trees and varieties that will thrive with him, if planted in the western part of the state they would not thrive at all. It is well enough for the planters throughout the state to look around and see what will thrive, whether we want to plant them for wood lots, for timber or for posts. N'ow, in Mr. Pollard's section of the state the white pine is a most excel - lent tree, and with us we say it is a failure. In starting right it is well enough to find out what will succeed in the locality in which you live, and in that way we can succeed and avoid the failures that Mr. Pollard and myself have made in the earlier days. L Chairman: At this time I will call upon Mr. Tanner, &gt;-.no is, 1 eve, the delegate from the Iowa Horticultural Society. REPORT FROM IOWA DELEGATE T. C. TANNER, PAI O, IOWA. As a delegate from Iowa I will have to report almost an entire failure of fruit in 1910, owing to a very peculiar season. The early fall of 1909 was rather dry, followed by rain and very warm weather that started the sap in the trees and shrubbery; then came the sudden freeze in October that killed a great many of the more tender varieties of fruits and ornamentals, which was followed by a deep snow in November and what we call a mild winter, the snow remaining until February, when the weather turned warm, and as there was no frost In the ground, the snow melted and all went into the ground, leaving it in ideal condition for fruits and all kinds of crop*. Through March </seg>
            <seg id="p140">140 Nl and into April there was no frost. I never wv a better nrosoect for • roarniflcent crop of fruit, but alas! the temperature fell mid so did the snow, and our beautiful rrop was pone. Although our crop vas almost a failure, our annual meeting was well attended and all seemed Inclined to take a cheerful view of the situation and hope for something better in the future. There was a fair show of fruit from the southern district. Mr. Langham had some fin* - grants from the central district. Or Dennis, of Cedar Rapids, and Mr. Wragg, of Waukee, showed good collections of nuts. The best walnuts and hickory nuts shown so far were found in Linn county. There seems to be quite an interest taken in the collection and propagation of nut. - *n I think we may look for something fine in the near future. kOur experimental stations have several thousand seedling plants from id fertilised seed from our best fruits and ornamental plants from irh we expect great results in the near future tThe burning question before the association was the smudge pots. ne seemed to think they could almost raise fruit in the winter with m. Thtv will have to be tested further, I think, before any definite J&lt; can be placed on their work. In the southwest district they had some fruit, and there was one man who had a large orchard, who reported that he saved his fruits by the smudge pots, and thought they were a great thing. Another man right across the road who had a seasoned orchard used no smudge pots and had just as good a crop as the other man had with the same exjioBure Youngers: Would not it have been possible for that man to have benefit of the other man's smudge? A. No, the wind drifted the other way. L. O. Williams: Who do you refer to, what orchards were those? A. One belonged to Mr. Spencer. I believe t Chairman: I am sure we are always glad to welcome delegates from societies of other states and are always pleased to hear from these pp.ites. and we are pleased to hear from this delegate from Iowa, are neighbors and we ought to be friendly and sociable. Mr. Russell: Have we any other delegates from other states present* Chairman: I believe there are no others. Kr. Russell: I move that Mr. Tanner be made an annual honorary ber of this society. Seconded by Mr. Stephens and carried unan «iy. Mr. Tanner: I thank you. gentlemen, for the honor k Chairman: We will now have a paper by Mr. E. F.

STEPHENS, CRETE. Coming to Nebraska when pre-emption could yet be secured In Saline ntv. and having exercised the rights of pre-emption and timber claim </seg>
            <seg id="p141">141 laws, the fan thai I purchased railroad land on fifteen years time with six per cent interest at $8 per acre, indicates that conditions were very different from what we find them now. In that early day land did not represent an investment of more than $10 to $20 per acre. It was the common feeling that shelter belts were needed and investments in forest trees for such purposes a legitimate and necessary expense. Away back in those days the demand for forest seedlings of varieties suited to the growth of wind-breaks and shelter belts formed an important portion &lt;&gt;f the nursery trade. tit was easy for the nurseryman to get hundreds of bushels of ash ] along our streams and many millions of ash seedlings were grown supplied to the trade at very moderate prices. Seeds of the soft maple and box-elder could be gathered along the rivers. The low cost at which seed of the ash, maple and box-elder could be secured led to their production in nursery row and offering them to Intending planters at prices below the present cost of production. I well remember thai one season I grew thirteen million forest seedlings and that number Cso far below the demand of my trade that I purchased five million e of the neighboring nurseryman. tin the early eighties the Russian mulberry was introduced and mil - is were sold to the planting public. A little later Catalpa speciosa was y freely grown and its merits as a timber tree were freely discussed, ling to free planting of this excellent variety of timber. I remember in our contract work, planting 2,000,000 catalpa, about 2,000,000 Russian mulberry, 3,000,000 ash, box-elder and black locust on timber claims. At that time we were without experience in regard to the proper limits of the safe planting of Catalpa speciosa and of the Russian mulberry. Statements were freely made that the Catalpa speciosa was hardy as far north as northeastern Iowa; that being true, In good faith nursery - men advised their customers to plant the catalpa in central and western Nebraska. I remember in those days of carrying samples of Russian mulberry cut from a mulberry tree grown in Hamilton county, the height of the tree twenty-five feet, the diameter of the section ten inches, the tree twelve years old. Believing that the mulberry would be useful in grow - ing a quick shelter belt and ultimately post timber, in common with other nurserymen I felt safe in recommending Russian mulberry in western Nebraska. In process of timp we all learned that trees like the catalpa and Russian mulberry were indigenous to climates or longer seasons than we have in western Nebraska, where they are liable to be yet unripe when the first autumnal freezing cold wave comes down on us from the northwest, sometimes in September, nearly always in October before the trees have yet completed their seasonal growth. This killed the Terminal buds, the unripe wood and over large sections of western Kand eastern Colorado caused the catalpa and Russian mulberry ; frequently a heavy bush, rarely a timber tree. In this Conner j say that in the park at nilpsburg. in northeastern Colorado. </seg>
            <seg id="p142">142 catalpa trees cultivated in sod land were compelled by lack of moisture to ripen their autumnal growth In early fall, and those trees are still In existence and in pood condition; but under cultivation and in shelter belts, the Russian mulberry and catalpa almost invariably grow too late to be prepared for winter and are usually unripe at the time of the first autumnal freeze. I The Black Locust— The extreme durability of the black locust when d as a fence led to the tree being planted in central and western iraska. We have in mind timber claims 350 miles from the Missouri ?r that were planted near Bridgeport, in Morrill county, Nebraska, •se trees were planted on dry ground; fortunately perhaps, the sum rs and autumns were so dry that the trees were compelled to ripen ing their early years of growth. After the black locust has attained isiderable size and the growth is more widely distributed it is not ply to grow as late in the fall as during the early years of planting, ese groves are still in excellent condition; they have furnished shade summer, and shelter in winter for the large bunches of cattle owned Mr. MacRadclltr. In other neighborhoods I have found that where under certain con - ditions the black locust was planted and almost completely neglected. lack of cultivation and weed growth compelled the tree to ripen and thus prove its hardihood and adaptation to the district where they were planted. On the abandoned homesteads of far western Nebraska on dry knolls and ridges of thin soil and gravelly ridges, healthy trees of the black locust have endured the extremes of Nebraska climate for more than twenty years. The black locust is a tree that cannot with - stand favorable conditions and prosperity; it is inclined to grow rapidly and too late in the autumn. I have in mind one excellent grove, the owner of which states that the grove was never cultivated, simply allowed to compete with the weed growth. It should be stated, however, in connection with this grove that there is in the underlying subsoil, moisture at no great depth. Under such conditions the weed growth prevented too rank and too late growth. We still regard the black locust as a favorable tree for central and western Nebraska where care is taken to compel the tree to ripen its wood not later than September. The honey locust we have found in our trade and in our contract ork peculiarly suited to very arid and trying conditions. We have ound this tree standing sucessfully and holding its own in wheat rass sod on the elevated table lands of Kimball county. I believe rom experience and observation that the honey locust can endure more arid conditions than any other tree now sent out by nurserymen. In eastern Nebraska on our own orchard farm we have planted some miles of honey locust In single rows acting as a hedge and shelter belt or the orchards and fields. At the age of thirty years we cut down a considerable number of these trees and sold a number of carloads of oney locust posts. The value of the honey locust for post timber is not </seg>
            <seg id="p143">143 nearly equal to that of the black locust. It, however, makes a beautiful shade tree and I remember noting a very beautiful specimen of honey locust in the lawn of J. Sterling Morton at Nebraska City. This tree was highly prized by Mr. Morton. I have two or three of these trees near my office in the city of Crete. They have attained large size with a broad, symmetrical head. The foliage is pleasing. The Green Ash — The green ash is indigenous to our eastern rivers and streams, seeding profusely at an early age. Because of the abundance of the seed, I have had quantities gathered at fifteen to forty cents a l usht'l of ten pounds. The ease and certainty of germination of the ash seed, the fact that two hundred thousand seedlings could be grown by skillful care and cultivation on an aero, made this variety a favorite among nurserymen. The trees used to be offered to the planting public at such moderate prices as to induce the planter to make large use of the ash seedling, perhaps more than of any other variety. I have in mind two of our timber claim contract groves of this tree in Scotts i:luff county on high dry table lands within twenty-five miles of the Wyoming line. Planted in ten acre tracts of timber claim work, we round that after cultivation ceased to conserve the moisture the trees nn the south side of the grove left to themselves suffered. The north half of the grove would intercept the drifting snows of winter, which ultimately melting would supply the north half of the grove with ample supply of water for continued vigor and growth. The snow having been intercepted by the north half of the grove and the south side of the grove suffering from weeds and not infrequently from the browsing of cattle, could not make the same growth as the north half. Planted as a shade tree in western Nebraska, standing in sod without cultivation, suffering severely from summer drought has caused the ash to be attacked by borers. This reminds us of Professor Bruner's suggestion made to our society at the Trans-Mississippi meeting in Omaha that "borers are scavengers of nature, attacking trees already suffering from the extreme heat of the summer." Soft Maple — In the early history of the state the soft maple wa» te freely planted and the seed could be gathered along the rivers and later wherever they had been planted a sufficient length of time. Where the tree has been planted in eastern Nebraska in shelter belts it has served a good purpose but has not proved desirable on the elevated table lands of western Nebraska. The demand for this tree at the present time is not large and it is not grown in nurseries with anything like the freedom of earlier years. The Box-Elder — The elder is still planted with some freedom in central and western Nebraska; transplanting with ease it grows with vigor and has proved its usefulness in wind-breaks and shelter belts. At the present time the tree does not have the call that it had twenty years ago, its place having been taken by other varieties of timber. The Cotton wood — The eastern or Missouri river cotton wood grows with much greater rapidity than the type of cottonwood found along the </seg>
            <seg id="p144">144 team* in the western portion of the state. In far western Nebraska cottonwood has been so buffeted by winds and oftentimes scorched Ores that a different type hats been developed from that which we find the Missouri river. The Missouri river cottonwood transplanted Into western Nebraska, where I am familiar with it, in groves within ) miles of the Wyoming line, has proved its superiority over the il cottonwood. It is much more rapid in growth, more regular in line, better for shelter, shade and timber. tin towns like Bridgeport, perhaps sixty or seventy miles east of the omin? line, there is an active demand for the cottonwood shade ;. It endures their conditions, and its rapidity of growth pleases public: In western Nebraska at the present time in our personal le we find a larger demand for the cottonwood, in seedlings for shelter :s and in shade tree form, than almost any other tree. The Carolina Poplar — This tree has been very freely planted in central and western Nebraska. On the David Hunter plantation in Lincoln county. Nebraska., there are poplar trees aged eighteen years that are now fifty feet in Height, and Mr. Hunter regrets that he did not plant forty acres of them for saw timber. Although this tree under irrigation sometimes grows too late in the fall and is unripe at the time of the first autumnal freeze, yet we Hnd a very large demand for this variety. I The Norway Poplar -The Norway poplar has been pushed with vigor nurserymen and their agents and it is giving satisfaction. The price which it is sold leads to its use more freely as a shade tree rather n in wind-breaks and shelter belts. I Because the cotton wood can be furnished at a very low price, the rage planter needing five to ten thousand trees is more likely to at the cottonwood than either of the poplars. I At the present time in eastern Nebraska perhaps the catalpa speciosa being sold more freely than any other tree. In an early day the homesteaders or land owners in the eastern portions of the state did not hesitate to plant several acres of timber, anywhere from two to ten acres, on lands worth from $10 to $20 an arre. Now that the lands in the eastern half of Nebraska have been found to be very well suited to the production of corn and wheat a farmer hesitates to plant a grove on land worth a hundred dollars an acre. I am informed by real estate men that some tracts of farm land near Crete can be sold for $150 per acre, and this without buildings. A farmer naturally hesitates to plant timber on $100 land, preferring to get an annual crop of corn or wheat rather than to wait for a return from the production o* timber, a matter of ten or twenty years. In our immediate neighborhood traveling salesmen from Indiana are Helling our farmers Catalpa speciosa seedlings at $25 per thousand. The average farmer forgets to call up the nearest nurseryman over the phone to ascertain what these trees are really worth. Plantations of catalpas which I have personally planted in Saline county twenty-six ▼ear* ago show very clearly just what can be done and what cannot </seg>
            <seg id="p145">145 MINNESOTA HORTIOUI/TTTIIK. fx* dcMifr* with this tree. Correspondents from the Pintle* valley writ© roe siatinc that traveling salesmen in their neighborhood are selling catalpa promising the planter that it will attain a height large enough for tele - phone poles in six years. This, of course, is an unreasonable statement and ought not to mislead anyone. Personally I regard the catalpa as one of the best and most favorable trees to plant at the present time in Eastern Nebraska. The season is long enough, we have a fertile soil, the trees have no enemies; after three or four years the tree will take take care of itself and will nearly justify its planting on $100 land. It should be borne in mind, however, that many farms contain tracts of broken land, ravines, corners or small tracts that cannot be conveniently £tivated in corn or wheat, and such tracts can be very profitably nted to a durable timber like the Catalpa speciosa. P-man. I am sure we have all listened with a good deal of pleas- Mr. Stephens; he is one of our pioneers, like Mr. Pollard. I e have about covered the ground and our time is limited. Chairman: Secretary Marshall attended the uncling of the Minne sota State Horticultural Society as a delegate from this society. We will now listen to his report. MINNESOTA HORTICULTURE. C. G. MARSHALL. E'ht- Minnesota State Horticultural Society is doing a great work horticulture in Minnesota and the Northwest. Its membership now Is more than 3,000 and consists mainly of farmers and friut growers of that state, with a sprinkling through the Dakotas. northern Iowa and Wisconsin. At the annual meeting, held in Minneapolis December 6, 7, 8 and 9, some 400 to 500 members from all parts of this section were In attendance to discuss the problems confronting the horticulturist in this severe climate of the north. »The interest and enthusiasm shown at this meeting and in the face the discouragements before them was certainly commendable. Those from parts where the natural conditions for the production of horti - cultural crops are anything but favorable gave glowing reports of their successes and of what they expected to accomplish in the future in a horticultural way. When success does not accompany their first and sub - sequent efforts to grow certain horticultural crops, instead of giving up the Idea of trying to grow these things, the horticulturists of Minnesota set about to originate new and hardier varieties or to devise some Ktical form of aid or protection for the varieties that they already The Minnesota farmer and fruit-grower has many more discouraging things to contend with than those in Nebraska. In common with us, he has the spring frosts, the summer drouths, the codling-moth and other </seg>
            <seg id="p146">146 NEBRASKA HTATK HOKTKTLTl.KAL SOCIETY. be has tlie dry and severely cold winter weather to contend with. This has the effect of limiting the number of varieties that be can grow to a a very few of the very hardiest, which usually means that he must con - tent himself with those kinds that are not the best from a standpoint of quality and appearance. None of the best quality apples, such as Grimes' Golden and Jonathan, &lt;an be successfully grown in Minnesota except in a few favored locations. The same thing holds true with other kinds of fruits. Almost all of his small fruits must be laid down and carefully covered each winter to save them, which does not have to be done in Nebraska, except in thp north and west parts. The influence of the horticultural society, .'i is co-operating in a harmonious way with the horticultural depart neat of the experiment station, is widely felt, however, and interest is awakened and fostered in all phases of horticulture. As a result of this interest much is being accomplished and fruits are now being made to grow and bear where a few years ago it was considered very fool - hardy to attempt it. Minnesota is in need of some late keeping varieties of apples that -tand its severe winters. Only a few varieties, including the Duchess, Wealthy, Hibernal, i'atton's Greening and Okabena, can be recommended for general planting in the state and none of these are what we in this ■ would call winter varieties. Good cash prizes are offered by -ociety and by interested individuals for new seeding! that will meet certain requirements. One thousand dollars is offered for a seedling apple tree "at hardy and prolific as the Duchess," with fruit equal to Wialthy in size, quality and appearance and that will keep as well aa the Malinda." One hundred dolars is offered for the best seedling plum. One hundred dollars is offered annually (total $700) for seven years for the best late winter seedling apple. Under this last offer the first prize of $100 will t&gt;e awarded at the annual meeting of the society to be held in 1912. A similar amount will be awarded at each annual meeting thereafter until seven such prizes have been awarded. These prizes are to be given for seedling apples grown from seed planted not earlier than 1906 and under prescribed conditions. Thousands of apple seedlings are srown each year by members of the society. Much of the seed used for this purpose Is from the few hardy varieties that grow in Minnesota. Cross-pollenization of hardy varieties, and other varieties more tender but of better quality is being done each year by a number of the more enthusiastic members, the idea being to improve both upon the hardiness and quality. These seeds are planted and the trees given careful atten - tion until they fruit, or top-grafting into bearing trees is done as soon as the little tree grows enough wood for this purpose. This hastens matters somewhat, giving fruit in three to six years from the time the seed is planted. As a result of the efforts along this line a number of very promising seedlings are now being tested. At the society's fruit show fruit from </seg>
            <seg id="p147">147 more than 100 seedlings of the Mallnda were exhibited. Some fifteen or twenty of these show promise and three are now being propagated. The Evelyn apple, originated by Mr. Wyman Elliott, of Minneapolis, gives promise of something valuable. It is a cross between the Wealthy and Ben Davis, and resembles both its parents in shape and color, and is of fair quality. It keeps well until mid-winter. The Okabena, originated by H. J. Ludlow, of Worthington, and introduced by the Jewel Nursery Eiany, is a valuable acquisition. The Jewel Nursery Company paid Ludlow $1,000 for the right to propagate this apple. It resembles )ucheEs very much in quality and appearance, but is a later keeper. A number of very interesting papers were read during the four-day meeting. One that excited considerable interest and discussion was "Strawberries for Every Garden — Five Bushels to the Square Rod." Mr. G. J. Kellog, of Wisconsin, gave this paper and showed how every farmer and home owner can grow an abundance of berries on a small area in any part of the country where corn and small grains can be successfully grown. Another paper that was very well received was written by Father Harrison. Mr. Harrison's theme was "The Mission of Ejty." Drouth and frost problems have been of vital interest to the iculturists of Minnesota and questions pertaining to these were dis ed with much interest. The Plant Breeders' Auxiliary, the Bee Keepers' Association, the Mar - ket Gardeners' Association, the Minnesota Rose Society, the State For - estry Association and the Woman's Auxiliary, all of which are auxiliary societies of the horticultural society, had their places on the program and some very interesting papeis were read at each of these meetings. These societies are all working together for the good of horticulture in Minnesota. El meeting closed with a banquet at which 150 plates were laid. rogram as well as the menu was fine and everyone left feeling ley had spent their time profitably and pleasantly while attending meetings. DISCUSSION. Bfr. Dickinson: Is the Wealthy apple considered a winter apple in nesota? A. Yes, sir. It will keep about like the Jonathan and the Grimes' Golden will with us. They can keep them in their cellars about as long as we can keep the Grimes' Golden here. ■ Dickinson: I had a little experience with a couple of barrels: them in cold storage in August and kept them until April.

            <seg id="p148">148 QUESTION BOX Q. What do you know about orchard heating? Chairman: Some of you who know tell in about two minutes whai you know, or tell where they can find out. Professor Howard: What I shall tell you is what we have done here on the experimental grounds. We heated two acres last spring and the results were so encouraging that I ordered enough heaters two weeks ago to heat the remainder of the station orchard. While we were only heating two acres we managed to maintain a temperature inside of the heated area of about four degrees above the outside. We had some tour or live thermometers scattered through the heated portion. We maintained that temperature with a type of heater holding about three gallons of oil running at about one-half of its capacity. We would have been able to increase that burning surface about twice as much any time of night. I asked the weather bureau the velocity of the wind and was told that night it was some twenty-three miles an hour; we were fighting frost that night, heating an area of two acres with the i velocity at twenty-three miles an hour and we kept the temperaturi up four degrees. Mr. Williams: Did you save your fruit crop? A. We had more fruit than we ever had before; we had several barrels more. Mr. Marshall: Was there a noticeable difference between the pan heated and the part not heated in the crop? A. The particular part that we were heating we call our varlet&gt; orchard. There were only two trees of each variety in the portion we were heating and I can not answer that question. We had apples outside the heated area. Ben Davis chiefly. We have something like 160 to 200 varieties in the variety orchard; some of them would not have borne If there had been more cold weather, on account of the variety. LQ. What tree would you recommend to plant for wind-breaks in theastern Nebraska? L Chairman I will ask Mr. A. .1. Brown to answer that |&gt;arti&lt;-ular stion. Mr. Brown: I would plant Scotch pine. Q. What varieties of apples would you plant in a tfciw Iff orchard near Omaha? Chairman: I will ask Mr. Russell to answer that qu stion ■ Russell: I think I had a friend of mine MS that ({iistion aiiri some one else to answer It. Mr. Williams: Refer that matter to the recommended list of vartttir.- 8ecretary : For the benefit of the man who asked that question, in th« - annual report you will find a list of recommended varieties for each •ruit district in the state.

            <seg id="p149">149 at nine o'clock and I do not want to bore the people now with anything I was going to give in my talk tomorrow morning. Q. Is the Grimes' Golden a hardy tree? A. Particularly so south of the Platte river. Q. Is the Grimes' Golden a disease-resisting tree? A. Yes, fairly so as to the top, but not as to the roots. Q. About what Is the average existence? Er Marshall: That depends on the health of the tree while it la g. I would say in the east central part of Nebraska it would lire ty-flve years and longer. It might live forty years. LMr. Stephens: I have some Grimes' Golden that were planted in 3 and two years a?o they gave twenty-seven bushels. Q. How des it compare with other varieties? Mr. Marshall: I believe the Jonathan will outlive it with us. It is very nearly like the Jonathan. We have trees at Arlington that are twenty-two years in the orchard, and last fall I think they averaged ovit twenty bushels to the tree; there are just a few trees, probably seven or eight of that age. The Jonathan is about the same, but I would say for the Grimes' Golden that we can not afford to leave It out of our orchard. It is an apple we can give to our New York friends and feel proud of it while they are eating it; it is an annual bearer; it does not overbear, but it bears all through the tree, mil it is a scab reaister. It is not absolutely hardy, yet it is well worth planting in 'he eautern part of the state. Q. What variety of apples come closest to the Grimes' Golden for quality of fruit, and season, or could be substituted for it? A. The Jonathan. I think. PVassey: The explanation made is not entirely natisfaclory. It d that it was partially a short-lived tree. Well. Just how much we cut off the tree's existence is the question in my mind. The reason the question was asked. I have an old orchard, my own home trees have been planted seventeen years; there were five Grimes' Golden trees in the orchard, and four of them are dead and another one is not bearing. They have all gone about the same way, affected right at the soil on the south side of the tree, where it is entirely dead, while on the north side they have fruit. They have only fruited about five years. If that is the length of the tree's usefulness I fail to see good sense in recommending a tree of that kind to be planted in district No. 4 in this state. It is much harder to get the substitute in an old orchard than to get it in the first place. I do not want to plant Grinits' Golden for only four or five years' fruitage and then have to plant another tree of some other variety in its place. I sent some of the specimens of the hark to Professor Wilcox and he said as far as he could see there was no disease, but that it had been killed by the frost. Is it possible that in an ordinary winter the Grin-, &gt; Golden is not sufficiently hardy i&lt;&gt; </seg>
            <seg id="p150">150 Idure a moderate winter? If bo, is it a tree worthy to be recommended r planting? Those are a few questions that are interesting a few farm - s in my neighborhood. I am not the only one having trouble with the lines' Golden, and the question is what can we substitute for it? Or n we get other trees that may have a longer life and more usefulness 0 thought someone might have had experience with them. Mr. Pollard: I have had the same experience with the Grimes' Golden as the other gentleman has had; I found on large bearing trees the apple leaf turning yellow on the trees. I supposed borers were in the trees, but I could not see any. I could not find any rust on the leaves and I looked to the roots. The roots had dried up and I found by putting blue vitriol around the trees that it stopped it, and none have died since. Whether that will remedy it or not, I do not know. I There is another question about the age of the trees. You cannot wer the question how long It will live, because it depends on the ow who tends It. These trees want somebody that can associate h them; that can get acquainted with them. You can associate with ir trees, gentleman. Mr. Youngers does not associate with the 1 pine '. but I could associate with it and make it live. In this age of &gt;s we have the Janet — some call it the Never Fail. We have some t were planted in 1862; they are forty-nine years old, and those s are healthy and strong and bearing good apples. They bear just good apples as the others. Some apples we sent to St. I^ouis to the ', and we got some of our finest apples from our oldest trees. Our *st trees made the best showing; the best apples we got were off old trees. We had the Ben Davis, but they died a long time ago. I Mr. Williams: I would like to call upon the gentleman here who has I experience in orchard heating to aid us in that matter. I Chairman: Mr. Dickinson, who has the old Hartley place, tried ■e heaters last year. Let us hear from him. I Mr. Dickinson: I understand that the question of orchard heating to come up tomorrow. I Chairman: I think we might give a very short time to that subject r. We have some other matters here, but we would like to hear tn Mr. Dickinson very briefly on this subject. I Mr. Dickinson: Well, I have not tabulated any results and have figured on it and can give nothing definite. The most I could do ild be to give it in a general way. Of course, last year was the t year we have had anything to do with It. It was just an expert at. I was not really ready when the time came, the spring coming very early and before we were ready, and I have not given it what might term a thorough test. There was grass in the orchard and t windy night, the first night, we could not light our heaters on Dunt of being afraid of fire, but on still nights after that blow was r when the frost came we lighted our heaters and we could control temperature; I think there is no question but what the temperature </seg>

As fax as results are con - cerned, the part where we had the heaters we got more apples than from the part where we did not have them; while the part last year that we did not heat gave more apples than the part we heated. Of course, my man's theory is that the lay of the land on the south side of the orchard, that is, the side we did not heat, lies to the north, and the cold wind we had rame from the north, and he says that cold wind blowing on that south side had a better chance to blight the blossoms. He thought the higher side we heated lying to the south had a tendency to give us more fruit on that side. All I know is that we had more fruit from the part we heated than from the part we did not heat. Secretary: Do you expect to continue the operation next year? A. We are building 1,000 more of these heaters. We are building l hem now for the other side. We will probably make 1,500 more heaters, as we are going to equip the full orchard.

Chairman: The first thing on our program is a paper by Professor R. F. Howard, of the University, on the subject of "Co-Operative Spray CO-OPERATIVE SPRAYING. l'KOK IS. K. HOWARD, UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA. tWhen your Secretary asked me to talk on the subject of "Co-operative aying" I suggested to him that certainly the topic was broad enough to permit of one's talking on most anything about sprays and spraying and yet stay within the bounds of his subject. Since it would be out of the question for me with my limited experience to try and tell you men who have been in the business of spraying for years how to spray, I thought I might say something that would be of some interest on the experimental and demonstration work the department of horti - culture has been carrying on for the past five years. We hear the ques - tions asked quite often: "What does it cost to spray apple trees?" or "How much does it pay to spray?" These are reasonable questions for the man who has never sprayed to ask. They are questions, too, that the average man who sprays can answer with difficulty. They are difficult for him to answer because the average grower is not in the habit of figuring the cost of every little item of labor and teams and subtracting them from the total receipts. One thing I want to do this morning is to answer these Questions </seg>
            <seg id="p152">152 t means of data compiled from this experimental work. Another thing want to touch upon ia the relative importance of the lime-sulphur rays as compared with Bordeaux as a summer spray for apples. Another topic which really comes nearer to the assigned topic than either of the above is the matter of what is to be done with the small home orchards of Nebraska? I will have a few suggestions to make In thla connection. SPRAYING DEMONSTRATIONS. I In 1906 the experiment station, in co-operation with the United SUt.-.&lt; aii mint of Agriculture, began a series of spraying demonstration:: eastern Nebraska apple orchards. The results of the first year's ■k were published in Bulletin 98, entitled "Spraying Demonstrations Nebraska Apple Orchards." In 1907 the work was continued by the eriment station alone and the results reported in Bulletin 106 under title "Does It Pay to Spray Nebraska Apple Orchards?" In 190k v ork was again conducted jointly by the experiment station and th« ted States department of agriculture and in 1909 and 1910 the expert it station was alone in the undertaking. The work of the last tlirt. rs has not been reported previously. This paper was compiled by •ffssor Emerson and will appear in a bulletin later. During the ■■« rs demonstrations have been made in twenty-two orchards, represent eighteen localities, in thirteen counties. I Before the work was begun it was well known that it was possible proper spraying to control scab and codling moth, the most general!* ublesome pests of apple orchards in this state. There was available vever. very little definite information regarding the cost of spraying the profits to be derived from it under our conditions. The majority farmers made no attempt at spraying. Many of the more prominent nmercial orchardists, even, were trying to produce apples without tying, and those who were spraying more or less regularly were, h few exceptions, not sufficiently thorough in their work to get th« t results. On account of the lack of knowledge of the proper means employ in combatting the common orchard pests many orchard 1st* I come to believe that apple growing was not a profitable business i under the conditions prevailing in many orchards, this was a per tly correct conclusion. I It was, therefore, planned from the start not merely to demonstrate possibility of controlling apple insects and diseases, but also to deter ne whether they could be controlled profitably. To accomplish this was necessary to know exactly what it cost to spray, what sprayed It yielded, and what it was worth in comparison with unsprayed it from the same orchards. In every spraying demonstration the ie spent in mixing and applying the materials and the quantity of terial used were recorded. The cost of labor, of men and teams per ir was taken at the orchard owners' estimates and the cost of materials ■ charged at the prices actually paid by the orchardists. Tn every </seg>
            <seg id="p153">153 orchard a block was set apart for the demonstration spraying and another block, In every way comparable with the first, was left without spraying at a check on the results of spraying. The exact yields of both market - able and unmarketable fruit from the sprayed and from the unsprayed blocks, or from considerable parts of them, were noted. The net value of the fruits was determined by deducting from the actual prices received by the owners, the estimated cost of picking, grading, packing, hauling, etc The net value, therefore, was what the fruit was worth on the trees. The work was done under all sorts of conditions. The trees varied in age from ten years to twenty-eight years and averaged about eighteen years. In some orchards they had been well pruned, but in more eases they had been pruned little or not at all for some years. In some cases the spraying was hindered by the closeness of the trees and in others by a secondary crop of bush fruits. In some orchards, on the other hand, the trees were conveniently spaced and the ground was free from troublesome bushes. A few orchards had almost every convenience for mixing and applying the spray materials, while others were almost com - pletely without such conveniences. Contrast, for instance, a case where it was necessary to go a half mile or more from the orchard to gat water for spraying and where it was then necessary to pump it by hand and lift it up to the spray barrels in buckets; contrast this with the cases where the mixing stations were near the center of the orchards, where a sufficient supply of water to spray a considerable part of the orchard was held in a large tank filled with a windmill or gasoline engine, and where the supply tank, dilution tanks, etc,, were on a plat - form higher than the spray wagon so that the mixtures simply ran down into tte spray tank. Under the first set of conditions it often coat more to mix the spray than to apply it, while under the second set of conditions little time was spent in mixing and hauling the spray. Some orchards were provided with efficient gasoline power spray pumps mounted on trucks carrying large spray tanks, overhead platforms and the like to facilitate the work. The other extreme was a poor hand pump with which it was barely possible to maintain pressure for one spray nozzle. The cost of spraying naturally bore very direct relation to the facilities for work in the various orchards. The labor, cost of mixing and applying the spray varied from one and a half cents per gallon under the most unfavorable conditions to only slightly over three - tenths cent per gallon where the conditions were in every way favorable. The average cost of mixing and applying the spray in these demonstra - tions, namely, one cent per gallon, is therefore higher than it need be. at least in commercial orchards. Not only did the somewhat unfavorable conditions noted make spray- Ins more costly than necessary, but the rather poor average condition of the trees, mostly from crowding and lack of pruning, reduced the average yield of choice fruit materially and Indirectly increased the relative cost of spraying. That is, the cost of spraying per bushel of « </seg>

In one orchard, for Instance, ' half the Winesap apples from the sprayed block were graded No. 2. ugh almost entirely free from scab and codling moth many of the ts were small and poorly colored because of lack of proper pruning. t same season the same variety in another orchard of the same age on tar poll, and not far from the first, produced fruit nearly all of which. 1 the sprayed block, graded No. 1, not because it was more free from &gt; or codling moth, but because it was of much better size and color. trees in this second orchard had been more thoroughly pruned than trees in any other orchard in which spraying demonstrations were tOf the five seasons covered by these spraying tests, four have been avorable owing to the prevalence of killing frosts at blossoming time. • yields of fruit secured have not, therefore, been so favorable as they lid have been under more nearly average conditions. The price* •lved for the fruit have, however, been good on the whole, in part at it offsetting the rather poor yields. Moreover, the difference In value ween the sprayed and the unsprayed fruit has probably been as it as It would have been in more favorable seasons because of the : that spraying seems to increase the yield of fruit more in an off r than in a good fruit year. On the whole then it may be said that these spraying demonstrations ware conducted not under ideal conditions but under conditions fairly representative of eastern Nebraska orchards and that therefore con - clusions rightly drawn from the work should be of value to orchard owners in that part of the state. The results were not exceptionally good. In fact, the up-to-date orchardlst should be able to get — and does get — better results than those reported here. I The following statements give a summary of the results obtained m the first four years' work: COST OF SPRAYING Number of orchards sprayed, 16. Total number of trees sprayed, 3,300.

The sprayer will last several years, and can be used to fair advantage in orchards up to five acres.

The question of whether one can afford to spray has been answered. It would not be so easy to determine how anyone who owns an orchard can afford not to spray. The next thing I want to mention is a few things on lO-OPEKATlON IN SPRAYING SMALL ORCHARDS tFor the most part the commercial orchards of the state are now IS sprayed. On the other hand, the small home orchards that receive i attention are exceptions rather than the rule. L Nearly every farmer in eastern Nebraska has fruit trees growing ut his place, though he may consider this a very minor phase of his farming business. The mere fact that fruit growing is incidental to his general farming, coupled with the seeming trouble of mixing and applying the materials, is why these small orchards are neglected. Early in the spring is the time when there are many things demanding the farmer's attention. This is the time, also, when the important sprayings have to be made, if the apples are to be protected from codling moth and scab. The average man with an acre or two of orchard does not feel he is justified In spraying it if his other work is interrupted. This same man would probably appreciate the difference between sprayed and unsprayed fruit enough that he would be willing to pay a reasonable price to have someone else spray his fruit. If some method were Introduced whereby these small orchards could be sprayed a great need would be fulfilled. Spraying outfits could be run on the same plan that threshing machines are operated in this state. Just what that charge should be would depend somewhat on the local conditions. It seems to me that if a man were to introduce such a system it would be not to charge per tree, but per gallon. I heard a Han making a talk about it at St. Joe at the association there about a month ago; he said a man could make a profit at it by charging five cents a gallon. A five or ten acre orchard is enough to Justify a man getting a power sprayer, the capacity of such a machine is easily twenty acres. Under these conditions the owner of the outfit might co-operate with fifteen or twenty of the small orchard owners in his immediate locality to the extent of spraying their trees. He could in this way make his machine pay for Itself, besides reducing to a minimum the possibility of infection to bis own orchard from outside sources. LJME-BUUHUB AS A SUBSTITUTE FOR BORDEAUX. Piile Bordeaux Is probably the best all round fungicide we have sent, it has certain characteristics that sometimes make it undeslr- Some varieties of apples, for instance, are russeted so badly that market value is materially decreased.

We were In one orchard that had evidently been sprayed well with Bordeaux and that produced something like 1,000 barrels. The quality of the fruit was ezoellent so far as codling moth, scab and fungus growth was con - cerned. The russet due to the Bordeaux would have thrown that crop from grade No. 1 to L It has been known for some time that certain mixtures of lime and sulphur possessed funglcldal as well as lnsecticidal properties. Recent demonstrations have proved that the lime-sulphur sprays have properties that warrant their use when winter treatments for San Jose scale are needed. Of course, we are not interested in it as a dormant spray since we do not have the San Jose scale.* As a summer gpray to combat fungous troubles they have to be used in a more cautious manner. Lime-sulphur sprays may be devlded into three groups: Commercial, home-made and self-boiled lime sulphur. Pimmercial lime-sulphur, as it is put on the market by several firms, the form tl an orange-red solution. It is the product of these substances after having been boiled together until they go into solution. The products of different firms vary in degree of concentration and, as Parrot showed,* there may be a wide range of variation in this respect in the product of a given firm. The only safe plan to follow in using these commercial brands as summer sprays for the apple, is to have a hydrometer and know Just what dilution is being made, and not depend entirely upon the directions upon the barrel. Prhe hydrometer is a glass instrument consisting of a weighted bulb i a graduated item which determines the weight or density of liquids. test the solution suspend the hydrometer in the liquid and take the reading at the surface. Hydrometers are of two kinds: Beaume and Specific Gravity, which differ In the standards of measurement on which they are based. These two types may be combined in the same instru - ment by having separate graduations on opposite sides of the tube. These instruments with a range of 0 to 36 degrees. Beaume, or 1,000 to 1,330, specific gravity, are recommended for this work. They can be purchased from Bausch * Lomb Optical Company, Rochester, N. Y., and Elmer * Amend, New York City. A commercial lime-sulphur solution testing 32 degrees Beaume will require about thirty gallons of water for each gallon of concentrate as a summer spray for apples. Most of the commercial brands test between 25 and 33 degrees Beaume. The following rule can be safely followed in diluting commercial and home-boiled lime-sulphur: Get the specific gravity reading of the «m - eentrate, ignore the figure at the left and divide by the decimal of the diluted mixture, which should be 1.01. The product is the number of gallons of water needed for each gallon of concentrate. This rule applies to both home-boiled and commercial lime-sulphur. * Symons. Md. Agrl. Exp. Sta. Bui. No. 131.

            <seg id="p158">158 HOW TO MAKE BOME-BOILED LnTEBULPHUB. Use fifty pounds stone lime, 100 pounds sulphur (flowers) 50-65 gal Ions water. Slack the lime In about ten gallons of water, add the dry sulphur, and mix thoroughly by adding more water. After the mixing and slacking is completed add enough water to make fifty gallons and boll. Keep it well stirred until the sulphur scum is gone, then add water and boil again until you have about sixty gallons. If it is necessary add water a third time and boll down to about fifty-five or sixty gallons. In all, the mixture should be boiled about an hour. This product is now ready to be poured through a strainer into barrels to cool, or directly into the spray tank. This concentrate may be made well in advance of the spraying season and stored for later use, but it will crystallize badly If left exposed to the air. It can be protected from the air by pouring melted parafflne over the surface. This finished product should be protected if made In winter before the spraying season. Home - boiled lime-sulphur with 1.24 density will not freeze (according to Profes - sor Stewart of the Pennsylvania station) above 15 degrees Fahr. To dilute either this home-boiled or commercial lime-sulphur with the hydrometer, simply get the specific gravity reading of the concentrate, disregard the 1 and divide by the decimal of the spray desired. The reading of the dilute spray material should be about 1.01 as a summer ■pray for applea. In order, then, to dilute a concentrate for the density 1.29 specific gravity, divide .29 by .01 and this gives .29, which means there should be twenty-eight parts of water to one part concentrate. 1.03 Is the strength used for San Jose scale (or dormant sprayings). LWe have used self-boiled lime-sulphur the last two seasons as a imer spray for apples. It differs from the other two kinds In that It is not a chemical mixture, but merely a mechanical mixture, all of the heat used in Its preparation being that from the slacking lime. 8-S-60 and 10-10-60 are the formulas we have been using, i. e., eight pounds lime, eight pounds sulphur, fifty gallons water, etc. Kection with the spraying demonstrations of 1909 and 1910, tests led on to see how apple «eab could be best controlled without the fruit or burning the foliage. To determine this Bordeaux, commercial (Rex) and self-boiled lime-sulphur were employed. Different strengths were used. Certain plats had Bordeaux used throught the season, and still others had lime-sulphur either for the second spraying or through the season. The scab results for 1909 were somewhat con - tradictory. These tests were repeated in 1910, but no scab developed even on the unsprayed plats. A representative tree was picked from each plat and the fruit sorted for russet Two grades were made, those showing no injury and those showing it slightly but not enough to injure their sale, were put Into one grade; and those with russet enough to injure the market value into the other grade. </seg>

The lime-sulphur sprays do not russet the fruit, the small per cent noted In the table is probably due to the Bordeaux from adjacent plats. No serious leaf injury resulted from any of the mixtures. In the Columbus orchard, 1910, the self-boiled lime - ■ulphnr plat seemed to have brighter foliage than either the Bordeaux or Rex plats. No injurious effect has ever resulted from arsenate of lead in combination with the lime-sulphur sprays. Now, as to the cost of making this home-boiled lime-sulphur as com - pared with the commercial lime-sulphur. The man with a small orchard can not profitably equip himself to make the home-boiled lime-sulphur. With the man who has a large orchard it Is a different question. There are big cooking outfits for making this mixture that may be bought I know of only two firms that handle them, The Farmers' Supply Company, of Philadelphia, and Montgomery, Ward £ Co., of Chicago. The cost of the lime and sulphur for preparing fifty gallons of this concentrate is about $3. Added to this should be the coat of labor, which would make a total of $3.50 as a conservative estimate for making fifty gallons of home-boiler lime-sulphur. Fifty gallons when diluted will make about 1,200 gallons of spray to be applied to the trees. My personal opinion Is that a man with only a few acres would not be justified in going to the necessary trouble and expense of making home-boiled lime - sulphur, for the difference in cost between it and the reliable commer - cial Brands. Under our conditions I had rather risk either Bordeaux or commercial lime-sulphur to control apple scab than "self-boiled." DISCUSSION.

Do you think there is any advantage at all to the bark of the tree? A. It might kill some of the hibernating insects, or probably some fungus disease. It would do some good no doubt, but whether enough to justify it I rather doubt. Mr. Williams: How about this, does it destroy the oyster-shell bark LA. Yes, the concentrated lime-sulphur 1 to 8 — one gallon of eonce* - te to nine gallons of water. LMr. Williams: I have seen badly infested trees with the oyster-skill k louse in this state. Q. How do they affect the trees, how do you detect them? A. (Mr. Williama.) You can see it on the trees. It is a scale-like insect, the shape of an oyster. Mr. Meek: How late in the season is it necessary to spray tor fungus, how late would it pay to use fungicides? A. For the first, second, and third sprayings it is necessary- It would depend on the local conditions regarding later spraying. I do not think it necessary to add the fungicide to the fourth spraying. If an apple gets scabby, I think a scabby apple will be scabby always. Mr. Barnard (exhibiting a sample apple): What would be the cause of that would it be frost? A. It might be frost. Q. Did you have cold weather in April and May at night? ■If I remember we had some rainy times about the second spray - before. It was cold and damp in May too. Mr. Kydd: We had apples that looked like that and they never saw a spraying. We had it cold too. EMeek : I have seen Ben Davis with a ring around the apple, it looked band. When the fruit is about this size (indicating) it will leave around it Mr. Kydd: Do you claim that there is too much bluestone In that Bordeaux? A. Yes, sir. Q. Why not put in more lime? A. We tried an excess of lime and we got it just the same. We uaed 4-4 mixture with three pounds arsenate of lead. BKydd: We put fifteen pounds of lime to the barrel In Bordeaux. Does your fruit russet in wet weather? Mr. Kydd: This year we had it russeted because we had excessive • old. It was a most exceptional season.

And no bad effects? A. No, sir. I Chairman: While this discussion is extremely interesting, we have ne other topics on the program and we do not want to cut out these ler fellows. They have a whole lot of oratory that we do not want cut out. The think that we all like Is a practical fellow, a man who i accomplished some good results. We are pleased to have with us lay one of our big orchard fellows who piles up his great big pile dollars, and that is what counts — Mr. Henry C. Smith, a horticulturist 1 fruit farmer of Falls City, who will now tell us how to grow apples. Mr. Smith spoke as follows: HOW WE GROW APPLES HEXBT C. SMITH, FALLS CITY, I do not know what I am going to say, did not when I started up here, so what I say will be without order or connection. In Illinois, where I was born, lived a family by the name of Ingersoll. Robert G. used to come there. How I used to admire his deliberation and cool - ness, accompanied by his eloquence. Wished I possessed a small share of it at this time, enough at least to be at home. If you had told me a few years ago that I would talk to you on the growing of apples I would probably have been as much surprised as you may be. Unlike some professors, who believe any one can grow apples, I have found out long ago that you cannot make Luther Burbanks out of every one who plants fruit trees. I Well you want to know how we grow apples, that is, "The Forest Hill lit Farm.' I was not very old when I found that to make any business a success it had to have special attention and that one man could not learn it all. In the first place, that is to say, to be successful in any one line, in the growing of apples as well as anything else, a person must be interested in what he Is doing. I believe this is essential with all people who succeed in any walk of life. When a little boy I used to play in my grandmother's flower garden. To me it was laid out very beautifully, with the beds arranged in colors. the grass was kept mowed, the borders of the flower beds were kept sheared, not a spear of hay or straw in the yard. I used to play there and it seems to me now, there was nothing more beautiful, so I early had a liking for the beautiful in nature. I have planted many trees in my lifetime, probably 100,000. and to-day </seg>
            <seg id="p163">163 HOW WE GROW APPLES. nothing gives me more pleasure than to plant trees and watch them grow. In talking about growing apples I will have to take you down to the sunny hills of the Missouri river with their mossy valleys. Here we find the loess soil which holds the moisture, does not bake and ig rich and productive. It makes the best foundation for apples that I know of In the state. A number of years ago I was walking through our court house In Falls City, when Mr. Jack Stevens, a well known man of our county (who on account of being tall and slim was usually called, "the tall Sycamore from Barada") was selling a tract of land about thirteen miles northeast of Falls City, near Barada. He called to me saying, "What will you give me for this?" I did not know where the land was or what it was worth, but thought it was worth five dollars, so I said, "five dollars per acre." I then went over to my office, forgetting all about the transaction. In a little while Mr. Stevens came over to my office and said, "You have bought It" As it was an executor's sale, I had to take it. I went over to the county treasurer and asked him if he did not want to take half interest with me and he said he would, so we Ei one hundred and sixty acres of timber land northeast of Falls and about two and one-half miles of the Missouri river. Later I it his half Interest. Shortly after that I met the late ex-Governor Robert Furnas, of Brown vllle, and was talking to him about apples. As I had been reading a great deal about orchards, I asked him what be thought of that location for an orchard and he said, "Fine, the Missouri river will pro - bably help you in moisture and you will always have a crop of apples." To post myself thoroughly I went over In northeastern Kansas, north - western Missouri and southwestern Iowa and to different parts of south - eastern Nebraska, talking with the best apple growers I could find, getting all information I could as to the growing of apples, and returning borne determined to set out an orchard. Shortly after this I went out to see Mr. Russell's peach orchard, south of Wymore. To him I owe con - siderable of my information. With him I determined on the different varieties of trees to plant and I think arranged with him for the pur - chase of two-year-old trees. In the spring I hired about twenty men and went to work clearing off the timber and planting trees. Where there were growing forest trees In the morning there were growing fruit trees In the evening. We did not break up or plow the land as the soil was rich and loose. We planted the trees about thirty-three feet apart east and west and a little closer north and south. We thought it would be proper and right for the sun to shine on one side in the morning and on the other side in the afternoon. In planting trees we usually plant two rows of Ben Davis, two rows of Jonathans, two rows of Ganos and so on through the orchard as we think mixing the rows that way helps them to bear better than </seg>
            <seg id="p164">164 V this. Id our orchard we planted Winesap, Ben Davis, Oano, Wealthy. Jonathan and Grimes' Golden, but more of the Ben Davis than any other variety. We dug the holes for the trees with spades, cautioning the planters to straighten the roots out as well as possible and arrange the ground well around them. Out of nearly 4,000 trees I do not think we lost a dozen. We cultivated them and raised corn the first few years. Later, when the trees got larger, we ceased planting corn and grew potatoes and small fruit, such as black raspberries, red raspberries and strawberries. We also pianted a few rows of peaches between the trees, but the peaches did not do very well. We probably got enough fruit off of them to pay for planting the trees. We have never sown any kind of grass ■wed in the orchard except clover. When the trees were four years old they commenced to bear some apples, but not enough to count commercially until about the ninth year. There is about sixty-five acres in this orchard. Mr. Wileman, who helped to plant these trees, is still on the place and now owns a part of it. He had never gone to college but he was a good, level-headed man with natural tact, prudence and Judgment. He was all right when he knew, bat, like the man from Missouri, "you had to show him." As indicated before, a person to grow apples must have experience and with that experience a desire to succeed, accompanied with persistence, stick-to - itiveneaa, stubbornness and determination. Many times this same man and his wife came to town ready to quit, saying that the apples would not bear sufficiently to pay. I would encourage them and they returned to the farm and took a fresh start until the blues overtook them and they would come in again. When the trees were old enough to spray I wanted to spray, he did not. He called my attention to the fact that nature was here before I was and would be here after I was gone. He said, "The Great Ruler will take care of them." In return I said, "You planted corn in the field out there." He said, "Te»." "Well, what are you going and cultivat :ng for? Nature was here before you was and will be here after you are gone. I do not expect to change nature but only to assist it." Soon after some government experts come down and gave a demonstration of spray - ing. Some trees were not sprayed, some were sprayed once, some twice and some three times. That settled the question. We commenced to spray and have been spraying ever since and Mr. Wileman is probably •tronger for spraying now than I am. He does not want to leave the orchard now. Last year we sprayed six times and cultivated eight times. tWe cultivate in the middle of the rows with a good farm disc wn by four horses. Under the trees we used the Johnson orchard : which can be extended under the trees. Discing keeps the ground ist all summer. The applet do not stop growing if a dry spell cornea on. tAa to time of spraying we think it a good time to spray, once in fall soon after the apples are gathered, with lime-sulphur, a spray </seg>
            <seg id="p165">165 DI8CU88ION. material with which you are all acquainted. We spray in the spring lust before budding time with lime-sulphur; again after the buds hare opened and the blossoms are fully developed, and when one-half or more of the petals have fallen to the ground we spray with arsenate of lead. Am stated before, we sprayed last season six times. Hr. Wlleman, who to on the farm and Interested with me, thinks he will spray oftener this year. We use a pressure of about one hundred eighty to two hundred rounds, which makes a good fog. This fog goes through the trees thor - oughly and coats the under side of the leaf as well as the upper side, reaching the Insects on both sides at the same time. When the time comes to gather the apples we get the best men we can, — men who have had experience in gathering apples as well as packing. We had about five hundred apple picking boxes, made in St. Joseph, Ho., which we scattered along down the rows of apple trees. We use the regular picking sacks for gathering the apples and use orchard ladders for going up in the trees. When the boxes are filled (each holds one bushel of apple?) we have a low wheeled wagon and put the boxes on this wagon, taking them to the packing house where they are sorted over and graded for the market. Last fall we employed about fifty people in gathering, packing and hauling to market. The apples are loaded on the cars at once and sent to cold storage. This all sounds easy enough but you will find out you will need men of good brains and sense for the best picking and packing of apples. We have had all kinds of men in our orchard, from the graduate of Harvard to the man who never had been In a school-room. We pack most of our apples in barrels, as they seem to be in good demand, are more satisfactory to handle, less storage charges and leas expense in packing. We store in different ' places on account of the market We sold our Jonathans last season for $6 per barrel and are now offered over $4 for Ben Davis In storage. On this orchard of sixty-five acres we had twenty thousand bushels of apples. Oft* of one acre of Wealthy we sold $600 worth of apples. What we have done anyone can do if they will go at it with a determination to succeed. You must figure on ten to twelve years before you realize your anticipa - tion on apples. Nothing will work for you like nature. Nothing that I know of in the fruit line equals apple trees. Off of one tree we gathered forty bushels. DISCUSSION. ■ Williams: What kind? Snow apples. Mr. Williams: Do you believe in cultivating your orchard A. Tea, sir. </seg>
            <seg id="p166">166 LA. Tea, I would do It now; I believe it would be good to sow red rer in the orchard occasionally. Q. For how long? A. For a year, I think, at a time, as the cleaner you keep the orchard the less insects you have. We also believe in pruning, as the apples grow larger and are better colored. You cannot grow wood at the expense of the fruit Mr. Williams: Do you head any of them? A. We will try a few this year. We sprayed our orchard last fall after we gathered the apples. We do this to catch any Insects that might possibly be about. The trees are shining and bright and we wish to keep them that way. It does not cost much and we do it to be on the safe side. You remember the old saying, "A stitch in time iMr. Williams: What kind of spray material do you use for winter lying? A. Lime-sulphur. It has been suggested by some here that the farmer mix his own lime-sulphur. We think that it can be bought to better advantage from people who are in the business than for a farmer to undertake to mix it. Life Is too short. Mr. Williams: Do you get this from the Rex people? §A. Yes, the past year. There are quite a number of good firms a make lime-sulphur spray. We used last year the Grasselli arsenate lead. Q. Do you fertilize your orchard? A. None at all, as we understand it. Q. Do you sow your ground? LA. This last season we let the natural growth come up In August; ground was well covered. LMr. Van Keyser: How many acres did it take to produce that 20,000 hels of apples? A. Sixty-five acres. Q. Do you have any trouble from soil wash? I A. Yes, It will wash during heavy rains if not taken care of. We tivate the ground well by disc and when that is done the ground 1 take in any ordinary rain. Q. You do not manure? A. No, sir: If you did not have timber soil you would have to manure; that is the reason we planted on timber soil. Mr. Van Keyser: How do you dispose of your windfalls? A. We have a vinegar factory In FalU City which uses all of our cull apples in the manufacture of vinegar. O. How old is your orchard? A. Thirteen years old. Mr. Williams: You say you sow clover; how long do you let it grow? A. About a year; If busy, possibly two year*. </seg>

Yea, to a certain extent. Mr. Val Keyser: What sort of a plow do you use? rA. We Just disc it as stated before by a good farm disc and use extension disc to go under the trees. Mr. Pollard: Do you have orchard ladders? ■ Yes, sir. We have the Bacon ladder of Appleton. New York. Did you ever try Clark's cut-away disc? A. Yes, sir. ■ Where do you get this Johnson dlac? In Omaha, from the Lininger Implement Co. Do you believe in smudging? E. We never have. I believe if you make your orchard right, have trees healthy, the buds will grow strong and resist any ordinary Mr. Williams: How much is your orchard elevated above the Missouri river? P. I do not know. I think about one hundred feet. The altitude In part of the country is about nine hundred feet; possibly a little The altitude is not as high there as here. The matter that seems to have a great influence in the raising of apples is being there your - self, which means, as poor Richard said: "He that by the plow would thrive himself must either hold or drive." "Handle your tools without mittens." "A used key is always bright," — are some of the rules that are good to follow in the growing of apples. LMr. HofMann: If I had twenty -five acres to plant to apples, what ds would you advise my planting? kA. I would plant largely with Ben Davis. We And that the Ben ris bears very evenly and well. In the spring when all others are e they come up smiling. Q. You planted mostly Ben Davis? A. Yes, sir. Q. What other varieties would you plant? A. I would plant Weathly in a commercial orchard, enough to grow two or three car-loads, say two hundred trees. I would also plant about two hundred trees of Yellow Transparent. Our experience 1* that they do well. A man east of us had five acres and says he received 12,000 for the apples. Q. What is the matter with Jonathans? ■They are all right, but they do not keep so well; they are o handle and are consequently more trouble to the grower. </seg>
            <seg id="p168">168 STATE HORTICULTURAL 8OCIBTT, A. Yea, sir; but the Wealthy is an early apple, and when yon have the kind we raiae they buy them right off of the trees In the summer. Q. What are the other early apples? A. Transparent and Grimes' Golden. Mr. HofMann: How do your Grimes' Golden trees d&lt; Q. How about the New York Pippins, hare you got them As. No, sir, we have not. O. How far apart do you plant the Ben Davis trees? A. In the rows east and west thirty-three feet apart and in the rows north and south at least eighteen feet. We have good rich soil and thought by pruning that this would be a good distance. In planting corn there are frequently three stalks in one hill. Sometimes you distribute them along with a drill. We planted our trees closer in the rows north and south and thought that would do If we kept them pruned as the soil Is very rich. LMr. HofMann: Does that leave room to drive your sprayer between rows? A. Yes, sir. Q. Hare you plenty of room to cultivate A. Tea, sir. Q. Hare you plenty of room to drive through and spray your Ben Davis trees that are thirteen years old? A. Yea, plenty. We keep them cleaned out and thinned so that fruit will grow a good size and be well colored. Some people say you will kill the trees, but it does not seem to hurt them. The first time the trees were heavily pruned people thought it would kill them, but the K; year we had a crop that was a surprise to every one. I do not k that people prune enough. Mr. Williams: Do you do your pruning in the winter time? E. Any time of the year. I know what many of the professors say t that The general theory is that if you prune in the winter you more wood; If yon prune in the summer you get more fruit We e any time of the year when we have time. We really think in July and August the trees seem to be healthier and heal better. Mr. Pollard: Do you paint the knots? A. Yea, sir. We always paint at time of pruning and any time afterwards we think best. Mr. Williams: Do you use white lead paint? A. We use Venetian red and linseed oil. Mr. Pollard: You would not recommend pruning In the winter time unless you did paint, would you? A. I would not prune any time without painting the cuts at time of pruning.

Do you plow deep and cut the roots when you cultivate? A. No, we do not plow at all excepting with the disc. Q. How do you get rid of the brush? EWe take a couple of long poles and tie them up In front, then i couple of poles up in the front and rear and pile brush In 1. When we get a load on we drag it out with a team. Mr. Williams: Do you favor boxing the choice varieties? A. Well, if I had good boxes I would box a few. There are but few apples boxed with us, there being no experienced hands. Our experience is that apples packed in barrels are more in demand and give more general satisfaction. This was the case where we stored in Kansas City, Malvern, Iowa, Omaha, Council Bluffs, St Paul, Chicago and Hannibal this year. Distributing your stock this way you can handle it to better advantage, for the reason an apple buyer will think that what you have- in this place Is all and he will be anxious to get a car before they are gone. Q. Are they all uniform? PYes. Now as to storage, if you raise good apples the storage i know It and they will all write you soliciting your storing with also offering you a good rate for the season or otherwise. A few ago we had to hunt for storage at a high rate, now it is different Mr. HofMann: Where can you get a 35-cent rate in Omaha? A. Different places. Q. Are they all uniform? A. No, sir. Q. You do not mean to say you can get that rate for the whole season whether it runs past the first of April or not? A. Tes, sir. You can get it as well as we can, if you have a faw thousand barrels to store and have good stuff. Storage houses are very particular about that As stated before, if you have good stock they will write you making you a proposition. Mr. Pollard: I would like to question you a little on this Ben Davis. yon recommended Ben Davis. How old are your Ben Davis trees in roar orchard? A. Thirteen years. ■ You haven't Ben Davis that have come to their maturity then. Ben Davis that are dying of old age, lots of them. A. Tou have never been In our orchard? Mr. Pollard: No, sir. Yours are thirteen years old. A. Tes, there are Ben Davis nearly thirty-live years old. Mr. Pollard: I have Ben Davis trees about thirty-eight years old and I expect that orchard will lire as long as I do. Our oldest bearing trees »re Wlnesaps and Jonathans; they have been planted forty-eight years. They are healthy and sound and are bearing good apples.

Chairman: Ladies and Gentlemen — It has delighted us to listen to Mr. Smith talk, and I know we would like to hear him talk for two hours longer and allow you to question him on this matter. He has been a successful man and that is the fellow we want to talk to. I wish we could line up about 400 of these kickers on the raising of fruit in this country and let them look at him, and see if he, don't look prosperous when he talks about having raised 20,000 bushels of apples which we know he has done. LMr. Williams: He is an old bachelor and don't have any family to e care of. Chairman: He has produced the goods and that is what we are looking for. Chairman: We will now have a paper by Mr. Val Keyser on the subject of "Tendencies in Horticulture." Mr. Val Keyser spoke as follows TENDENCIES IN HORTICULTURE VAL KEYSEK , LINCOLN. Since the introduction of the orchard heater there has been a wonder - ful awakening among progressive orchardists concerning the possibilities of eastern Nebraska for growing high class market apples. $600 an acre for Wealthy apples, and $20,000 profit from sixty-five acres of orchard, cannot help but awaken an interest In any fruit grower or farmer who has an eye for business. Such profits were produced during the past season in the orchard owned by Henry C. Smith, of Palls City, Neb., and there are thousands of acres of good apple lands in the river counties, from Burt county down to the Kansas line, which could be made equally profitable. There are also many districts in the counties of Johnson, Oage and Pawnee, which can be grown to apples and made commercially The writer has been a student of horticulture for the last ten years and had the pleasure of spraying four demonstration orchards in south - eastern Nebraska during the season of 1906. It was at this time that Mr. Smith'* attention was called to the possibilities of his orchard, if only proper methods were applied. The people of eastern Nebraska are not awake to the possibilities of </seg>
            <seg id="p171">TENDENCIES IN HORTICULTURE. 171 a number of commercial fruit growers in Missouri, Arkansas and our own state) the southeastern section of the state, and especially the section comprising the river counties, is one of the finest apple growing regions in the world. This section of the state has the natural con - ditions, the soil, the climate, the natural rainfall, the bright, sunny days to produce fruit of the very highest quality. The great fruit regions of the western United States — Oregon, Wash - ington and Idaho — have just as many difficult problems confronting the apple growing business as we find in eastern Nebraska, and when the fruit is produced they cannot compete with this section of the state in quality. To grow fruit successfully in any country requires a high classed man and a knowledge of the subject, and one who is not willing to equip himself with this accomplishment had better stay out of the business and continue to be satisfied with from $25 to $40 an acre profits from growing corn, hogs and alfalfa, and it might be stated in this connection that the average farmer in eastern Nebraska is content with a smaller profit than above mentioned. If a man is anxious to make a safe investment, which after ten years' time will return great profits, he can buy a patch of land in eastern Nebraska from twenty acres up, plant it to apple trees of the right varieties, and duplicate the returns from the land which we see in the orchard of Henry C. Smith, of Falls City. $600 per acre in a single year is equivalent to $60 an acre for a period of ten years. A man need not ask returns of such propor - tions for a single year because an orchard in eastern Nebraska ten years of age is just commencing to bear. For the next ten years, properly handled, it should return a net profit of from $150 to $200 an acre, and this can be done. PM are as many horticulturists in the state of Nebraska as any class of people, but ignorance of horticultural methods has pre - a large majority of tillers of the soil from engaging in this class of work. Hundreds of families have been discouraged with ordinary farming in the state and have gone west — to Idaho, Washington and Oregon to engage in the raising of fruit. Just what frame of mind a man must be in to prompt him to travel all over the United States in search of some pleasant spot where he might plant an orchard, is difficult to analyze. Here in eastern Nebraska we find that nature has been most generous in supplying all the elements and conditions necessary to the production of fruit This is not the case in the great irrigated districts of the west There are about five propositions with which it will be necessary for the fruit grower to become acquainted if he expects to make a success of commercial orcharding. First, the choice of land, its preparation and methods of planting the trees; second, the proper selec - tion and proportions of commercial varieties; third, cultivation and pruning; fourth, smudging and orchard heating to keep off frost; fifth, spraying. To these must also b? added perhaps the most important con- </seg>
            <seg id="p172">172 N Eon, the harvesting and marketing of the fruit. By the use of te methods in each of these phases of orchard management, is sure to result What man has done, man may do. In many places in the western part of the United States orchard lands are selling as high as a thousand dollars per acre. Much of the land is commanding prices from $400 to $700 per acre. Here in eastern Nebraska, much of the desirable orchard land can yet be purchased for the sum of from $75 to $100 per acre, and there are thousands of acres for sale at a much lower figure. Strange as it may seem, fruit growing, with the possible exception of vegetable gardening, are the only lines of agricultural practice which can be made to pay dividend* over and above taxes and interest on the investment, in land valued above $400 an acre. If it is true that our population is increasing, and the report of the Bureau of Commerce shows this to be the case. If it Is true that the general value of our lands are rapidly increasing in price, and this is surely apparent to the man who is anxious to invest in land, then this increase in population and value of land commands of our farming population that greater dividends must be paid on the invest - ment. The time will come when land reaches a figure above $200 an acre. Then many will turn to horticulture, for in fruit growing it Is easy to pay large dividends on land valued at $200 an acre. With one acre of apple trees twelve to fifteen years of age, properly handled, the owner should be able to double the number of acres he owns every year. This cannot be done with any of the ordinary field crops. For a number of years the writer maintained the idea that the thing most needed in Nebraska to build up attractive rural conditions was the small family orchard. It was hoped that through the influence of the agricultural press and the Experiment Station bulletins, and the living advocates on the institute platform, that thousands of farmers would be induced to plant and properly care for a small orchard, growing a sufficient quantity of fruit to supply the needs of the family. After ten years of constantly encouraging this practice, and continually seeing the orchard neglected and abused, the writer has abandoned this idea. The technicalities and difficulties in the successful handling of fruit requires co-operation, some outlay of capital and a careful study of the life history and habits of many insects and diseases. The difficulty Tn storing also complicates the problems of commercial apple growing and is equally applicable to the growing of fruit on a small scale. Another condition which has tended to discourage the small orchard Is unfor - tunate climatic and soil conditions. Many of the small orchards will never succeed on account of these unfavorable factors. The eastern and especially the southeastern portion of the state is not confronted with these problems. The soil is not too rich. The natural rainfall and other climatic conditions favor the production of better quality of fruit than it if- possible to grow in many of the counties in the central portion of the state. We find this true in nearly every state In the Union, even in the states of Oregon, Washington and Idaho, the famous Hood River district. </seg>
            <seg id="p173">173 PLANTING THE OROHAKD. There are a few essential points to be considered In planting the apple orchard, and It Is important that each of these receive proper con - sideration. The following questions naturally occur to the man who la planning to plant an orchard this spring: Where shall I buy the trees? Shall I buy one-year-old or two-year-old trees? tWhat points should I consider in selecting the orchard site? (The i upon which the trees are to be planted.) (a) Should the land be level or rolling?

What method of preparing the land should I use before planting the trees? How should the trees be handled when received from the railroad station? What distance apart should the trees be planted? What points need I observe in the actual planting of the trees? Where to Buy Trees. — As a rule it is better to purchase trees of your home nurseryman. Different nurserymen, however, have different methods of handling their nursery stock, and different methods of storing their trees over winter. If one is a critical student of the effect of certain methods on the vitality of the trees, this might determine his judgment as to the proper nursery from which to buy. It should be remembered, however, that the nurseryman is in the business to stay, and very likely his method of handling the trees has proven to be moat satisfactory. There are many ways which trees can be kept without Injuring their vitality. The usual custom is to dig in the fall and store in packing houses and storage cellars, where the roots of the trees are covered with dampened moss (spagnum) or straw. The continued association of the different nurserymen of our own state, has brought into use quite uniform methods of handling trees. It la much better for the inexperienced man to trust to the judgment of the nurseryman in buying trees, and so long as the nurseryman usually guarantees his trees to live, if properly handled, this matter need not give us much concern. Age Tree to Buy. — Some planters prefer yearling trees, but as a rule it Is Just as well to let the nurseryman go to the expense of growing these trees to a two-year-old, as experience has shown that there is very little time gained in planting yearling trees, and they are so small when planted in the orchard, that the damage from culture machinery U greatly increased. In reference to the age of these trees we mnii a </seg>

It never pays to ' culls and inferior stock, even though you get these trees for the ing. Choosing the Site. — There has been much discussion since the early history of orchard planting in Nebraska, concerning the proper site for an orchard. Perhaps each slope or aspect has its advocates. At one t'.me it was quite generally agreed among horticulturists that a north - east slope was preferable for apple orchard, and volumes of argu - ments have been produced to prove the advantages of the northern slope. The facts that have been borne out by experience in orchard planting do not verify the conclusion that one slope has any advantage over another. The things to be considered in planting an orchard on rolling land, are, what will be the effect of the wind, the frost and the washing of the soil? We have seen our buds freeze on northeast slopes as rapidly as they do on southwest. Perhaps the northern aspect has an advantage, when we consider the detrimental effects of hot winds from the* southwest, in July and August, but other things are of so much more importance, that the slope need not concern us to any alarming degree. Preparation of Land. — If the orchard is to be planted In a field which has been under cultivation for some time, and which has been cropped to the ordinary grains grown upon the farm, the land should be prepared similar to the preparation necessary for growing a crop of wheat. By plowing deep in the fall of the year, and working the land down early In the spring by the use of the disk, this method holds the moisture, which is very essential in starting the trees early after planting. There are certain crops after which it would not be advisable to plant an orchard. Alfalfa would perhaps be the most striking example. Alfalfa land should be broken and cropped to some grain crops for at least one season before an orchard is planted. The chief reason for doing this is to rid the ground of the alfalfa plants and provide for the storage of moisture, which it is impossible to acquire while the alfalfa is growing on the ground. As a rule the lands in eastern and southeastern Nebraska are preferable for tree growing and commercial planting, because of the nature of the soil. The limestone outcrop along the creeks indicates that all this country is underlaid by this lime-stone formation. Much of the soil above this lime-stone is clay, and above the clay comes the rich black loam, which in many cases has been nearly all washed away. In selecting a plot of ground upon which the orchard is to be planted, the grower should aim to plow every foot of this land, as though he was preparing for corn. This refers to the average land. Many of the steep hill sides in that portion of the state Just referred to, would be better adapted for fruit land than the rich bottoms where the loam soils predominate. In preparing a hill side, K may not be advisable to plow all of the land. It would perhaps be better to plow at right angles to </seg>
            <seg id="p175">175 TENDENCIES IN HORTICULTURE. the slope* of the hill, stirring a strip about ten or twelve feet wide, which would be thoroughly prepared, and In which the row of trees U to be planted, leaving the virgin sod untouched. After the trees arc well established, the strips about the rows of trees may be seeded to clover and the space between the rows broken up and cropped, or kept thoroughly cultivated. There are several orchards in the state which stand as living monuments to the method of culture, which should not be used. Soil should not be allowed to wash away between the tree rows, and leave the trees mounted on a hill to dry out and produce only a feeble growth, and later a disappointment instead of a crop of apples. Heeling in Trees. — Trees packed at the nursery are usually in ideal condition for shipping, and they will endure many days of exposure, which is usually necessary in shipment in the freight cars, and while stored at the freight depot, but the trees should be considered, and as soon as the shipment is received at the nearest railway station, the owner should get these trees, remove them from the package (which is usually a box or a bale) and heel them in. Many nurseries put out Instructions for handling the trees after receiving the shipment, but the usual way of heeling in is to dig a trench one foot deep, and wide enough to admit the roots of the first layer of trees, then spade off the north side of this trench, piling the dirt back on the trees and admitting another layer as soon as the first layer is covered four or five inches beneath the soil. Place another layer of trees and cover as before. As a rule it is advisable to point the tops toward the south, as this position seems to lessen evaporation, and protect the trees from the direct rays of the sun. The soil In which the trees are heeled should be moist and in good condition for planting. This usually is not difficult to find In the spring of the year. Distance Between Trees. — The distance apart which apple trees should be planted is the next important consideration. It is true the varieties to be planted will govern somewhat the distance apart they should stand in the orchard, but experience has shown that thirty-three feet each way is about the right distance for planting most commercial varieties, especially winter sorts like Winesap, Ben Davis, Northwest Greening and York Imperial. Some varieties are upright growers and will therefore occupy not more than half the spare. To this class belong mostly summer and fall varieties, such as Whitney, Yellow Transparent, Chenaga Strawberry and Wealthy. Much will depend upon the slope of the land and the purpose of the orchard, but it is probably better to plant the rows north and south, making these rows thirty-three feet apart, and placing the trees sixteen and one-half feet apart in the rows. The writer has had experience in spraying and harvesting the crop* in an orchard planted in this manner, in which Missouri Pippin were used for fillers. It was the owner's intention to cut out the Missouri Pippin after five or six crops. The advantage of this method of planting </seg>
            <seg id="p176">176 STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY. recommended for your careful consideration. When an orchard U planted In this manner after the fillers are removed it will make the trees thirty-three feet apart each way; with some varieties of trees the orchard will be found crowded even at this distance, but it is the writer's opinion that if the orchard is properly handled and pruned each year, from the time planted, that it will not pay to keep the trees after they have reached the age of twenty-six to thirty years. Planting the Tree. — After the plan of planting has been decided upon, which should be worked out before time to ship the trees, the actual planting of the tree is perhaps the most important consideration, in the starting of an orchard. Very little pruning should be done on the roots as the nurseryman usually attends to this feature. The top of a tree should not be pruned until after it U planted. A hole should be dug at least eighteen inches in diameter, to admit the roots of the average two-year-old apple tree, and as a rule two feet in diameter Is better. The plan should be to plant the tree not over two inches deeper than it stood in the nursery row, which can be told by the ground mark on the trunk of the tree, Just about the brace roots. The trees should be slanted slightly toward the southwest, and care should be taken to get the rows straight each way so that the orchard presents the appearance of a carefully checked field of corn. Just enough dirt should be thrown in over the roots in the bottom of the hole to nicely cover them, and this should be tamped firmly with a liberal use of the heel. It is very important that the soil should be tamped firmly around the roots, making it at least as firm as it was when growing in the nursery. Always plant an apple tree as though you were expecting a drouth. When the hole has been filled half to two-thirds full of dirt, carefully tamped in, two or three buckets of water should be poured in the hole and allowed to soak down. It Is perhaps better not to finish filling the hole until the next morning, and then it is well to leave the ground slightly hollow about the tree to catch all rainfall which may come later. If the ground has been properly prepared, following the directions as outlined above, the tree should not receive a set-back by the necessary handling before planting. After the tree is planted It is necessary to prune back the top. As a rule at least one-half the previous year's growth should be cut away, and not over four or five limbs left to bear the head. It is difficult to describe Just the method of pruning, and each tree will need a little different treatment The writer wishes to state that he is personally acquainted with many of the nurserymen in the state, and that each of these men are a walking encyclopedia on orchard planting, and every new planter should make a liberal use of this fund of information. SPRAYING. There seems to be something in the atmosphere this spring, that Is creating an ususal interest in the care of the apple orchard. There has bees more pruning during the months of March and April, than was •w witnessed before In the history of apple growing in Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p177">TENDENCIES IN HOBTICULTUKB. 177 177 l Here is ftiso &amp;o UDUsiiAi interest id t dc sudjpcl oi spr&amp;y lug. i bc secretary of the State Horticultural Society and the Department of Horticulture at the Experiment Station, are receiving constant requests for information along the line of spraying apple orchards. Since the introduction of lime-sulphur as a fungicide spray, the question naturally arises in the mind of the orchard manager as to whether it is better to spray with lime-sulphur or Bordeaux. The answer to this question will depend largely upon the previous care of the orchard. Where an orchard has not been sprayed properly, and there is every evidence of abundance of scab and other diseases of the foliage, and fruit, it is quite likely that it is better to spray the first time with Bordeaux mixture. Our experience with lime-sulphur ia so limited that it does not entitle us to draw definite conclusions. Where apples are grown on a commercial scale (and it is that phase of apple growing the writer has In mind in outlining this article), every care should be exercised to produce the cleanest and best quality of fruit. The chief objection to the use of Bordeaux in spraying has been its tendency to russet the fruit and injure the foliage. With lime-sulphur there is little danger in this respect as the lime-sulphur apparently does not, to any extent, injure the skin of the fruit or the foliage, and seems to be in most cases equally effective as a fungicide. The Rex lime-sulphur, manufactured by the Rex Company, perhaps has the greatest reputation as commercial lime-sulphur of any brand manufactured. Another feature in favor of lime-sulphur is the ease with which it is mixed ready for application. As it comes from the factory the solution tests from thirty to thirty-two. The explanation of this test, and the use of the hydrometer, are thoroughly explained in Professor Howard's article on co-operative spraying. To state briefly, when the lime-sulphur tests thirty, we add thirty gallons of water to every gallon of lime-sulphur solution. This is merely poured into the spray tank together with the poison, which is usually four pounds of lead arsenate to every one hundred gallons of water. The tank is then filled with water and you are ready to spray. We know that Bordeaux mixture is an effective spray, and we know that Bordeaux mixture has its disadvantages. Horticulturists should not, however, forget how to make Bordeaux, for it is quite likely it will play an important part in the renovation of neglected orchards. At present Bordeaux is cheaper than lime-sulphur. There are Just three important considerations in the successful spraying of an apple orchard. The orchardist should keep ever in mind these considerations: First, the mixture must be properly prepared. Second, it must be properly applied. Third, spray at the right time. The question is often asked, how many acres of trees ought two men with a hand pump or two men with the gasoline power outfit be able tc spray in a day? It is next to impossible to answer this question directly, as trees vary in size, and require varying amounts of the </seg>
            <seg id="p178">178 r three acres of trees, set forty trees to the acre, and twenty years while two men with two leads of hose and a Cushman gasoline power outfit, ought to spray ten acres a day if the machinery is in good running order. Before concluding these remarks the writer wishes to say just a little about cultivation of the orchard. In growing a crop of apples then- Is a continual warfare against insect enemies, and diseases, cold weather tnd weeds. If the orchard is allowed to grow up to grass and weeds there is no question but that the danger from diseases and insects is greatly increased. Many young orchards are materially injured by the Buffalo Tree Hopper, and various other biting and sucking insects, which would not bother the trees if they were kept under an ordinary state of cultivation. Almost any orchard needs cultivation of some sort occasionally. Many orchards are benefltted by a liberal application of barnyard manure. Some advantages of early cultivation, perhaps just as the frost is coming out of the ground, are that the soil can be torn to pieces, and the blue grass sod such as is ordinarily found in orchards is not so tenacious, and lends itself much better to cultivation. The object of early cultivation is not usually a question of conserving moisture, especially in the eastern portion of the state, but rather a question of putting the soil In such condition as will allow for later cultivations during the latter part of June, July and August, when there is a dearth of moisture, and when the tree is making its heaviest drains upon the water supply in the soil. Whatever cultivation is given to an old orchard should be shallow. There certainly can be no advantage in deep plowing and cutting off old roots. A light plowing is not objectionable, but more of the cultivation should be done with a disc and harrow. The unusual interest in the subject of orchard management is awaken - ing an ideal which is now in its embryonic stage of development. The fie Is near at hand when southeastern Nebraska will be put on the map one of the leading apple producing sections in the United States. Chairman: I tee it is ten minutes to 12 and most everybody eats about that time. I was on the last part of the program, but I will not keep any of you from dinner, but I will say I had a very fine paper prepared, con - sists of eight or ten pages of carefully prepared statistics.

            <seg id="p183">IN MEMORIAM Hk.nky C. Smith was born in Canton, Illinois, March 7, 1856. Received his schooling mostly thjre and in March, 1869, removed with his father to Richardson county, Nebraska, where he assisted his father, the latter having established an agricul - tural implement warehouse, etc., in Falls City, the first in the county. Also ran a real estate agency In connection with which he carried on a farm. Mr. Smith was one of the most widely known business men of Falls City and had occupied the same office continuously for a longer term than any other business man in the city and was probably longer in business there than any other person, having established a real estate office in 1879. He was one of the first in Richardson county to plant or - chards on a commercial scale. The seventy-acre orchard in Barada township has been a heavy producer and since they have taken to spraying and giving the soil the regular summer cul - tivation, in which he also was the pioneer for this county, that orchard has produced fruit of unexcelled quality and has gained a reputation that is widely extended in the larger markets. His Nemaha county farm and also the one in Pawnee county have both been largely set to apples and other fruits, and are com ing into productive bearing. His theory always was that every growing apple tree he owned added a dollar every year to the value of his estate. He was laughed at some by his neighbors in the years of poor fruit crops, but that made no difference. He was confident of the outcome, and several times his judg - ment has been vindicated by apple crops that were worth more than the value of the land. kitr. Smith became a life member of the State Horticultural iety in 1896. He was stricken with paralysis and passed away at the Union Hotel in Falls City, where he had lived for a number of years, Saturday, October 21. 1911. (183) </seg>

            <seg id="p189">DEVELOPMENT OF HORTICULTURE IN EASTERN NEBRASKA. &lt; Paper read at State Conservation and Development Congress, Lincoln, February 23 and 24, 1911, by G. A. Marshall, Arlington, Nebr.) Eis with much pleasure that I say a few words regarding commer" horticulture along the eastern boundary of this state. Twenty to &gt;■ years ago thousands of acres were planted to orchards along toe Duri river between Omaha and St. Joseph. The orchards which then bearing yielded such nice, clear and attractive fruit that the prevailed that all that had to be done was to plant the trees and r the iruit. The enthusiasm inn high and people from all walks oi life, including doctors, lawyers, merchants, railroad men, capitalists and others rot the fever and fairly feli over themselves to procure a pieie of land and plant a commercial orchard. Time wont on and uatuie smiled on this country as usual and th • small trees planted on these many hills grew into vigorous, beautiful orchards and began bearing fruit. You know nature has decreed that 'we i-annoi obtain sum-thing for nothing;' well, tor lack ol cart- the bugs anil worms and fungus thrived and got in their destructive work and the result was second and third class fruit, slow sales and second and third class prices and small profits. And as many of these orchards wci t planted on good farm land where annual crops of almost anything one cared to plant could oe grown with ease and certainty, the orchard enthusiasm waned and the enterprise dropped to a low ebb. The care of orchards dropped to the same level. The few orchards, however, that escaped the ax, lived and bore and bore. Finally their unceasing per - sistence was noticed and many of them have been leased and others are now being leased by the more enterprising Hardeners and fruit growers or taken up again by their owners and after a year or so of cleaning up, pruning, spraying and cultivating, the orchard responding nicely, pro - duces an abundant yield of fruit of good qualit&gt; wL'eh will sell *nd be acceptable to any market. The conditions for commercial orcharding now are pretty well under - stood. We know about what to expect of a tree and what to plant to receive the best results. In fact I know of no country that ha3 been more thoroughly tested. I have looked east, west, north and south and made all kinds of comparisons, and I firmly believe, everything con - sidered, that this same Missouri river hill country has them all beaten for commercial orcharding. The advantages here are many and telling: First, we are far enough south so the tree will live and do well, yet far enough north so the fruit is at home and is perfect in color, size and quality. We also get just about the right amount of rainfall to mature the 'ruit with the highest of quality and it is not reduced in flavor and k^ping qualities by artificial watering as when irrigated. Neither is the (189) </seg>
            <seg id="p190">190 N orchard at the mercy of the Irrigation company and that terrible annual water tax forever absent. Second, the land is cheap, much cheaper than the farm land in the same community and many times cheaper than the apple lands of the West. Third, the wonderful certainty, ease and cheapness with which the tree is transplanted and grown into bear - ins. Fourth, nearness to market, which is a greater factor than we at first Imagined. Gentlemen, this land is most wonderfully endowed and it is up to us aa to what the outcome will be. We should wake up and get in the ranks. Our old, slow-poky way will not be tolerated longer. We must get out of the old ruts. The world demands things strictly up-to-date. Much better fruit is demanded now than ten or fifteen years ago. Neat. new packages are in demand. Apples should be unblotched and sound. Grades should be even, dividing our ordinary old barrel grades into at least three grades. All these uneven sized apples mixed together, al - though they may be good apples, look much worse than even the smaller ones if alone, and how much better the large specimens look when they are placed with others of equal size and appearance. Let the expert grader regrade these same barrel apples and I venture the assertion that the third grade will appear more attractive and bring a better price than the original pack did. Then you have the advance price on the second grade and a still larger advance on the first, which will very materially Increase the profits. We should not think about the size of the cull pile when grading apples. The proper time to reduce this pile is during the previous season when we are pruning, cultivating, spraying and caring for the orchard. We are too apt to let the orchard take care of itself, then try to reduce the cull pile by putting these apples in with the upper grades, which spoils all. Cooperation is another factor toward success in commercial orchard - ing. On investigation, I find that fruit associations get much better teas for their fruits than the average individual can possibly expect. When buying from associations, buyers can be sure they are buying from ocalities where there is plenty of fruit, they can have standard grades and the markings on the box will tell them exactly what there is in each and no disappointment will follow. Then these same associations can acquaint themselves with market conditions in every direction and know ust where to place fruit at all times. They are also in position to pur chase the best packages on the market at the lowest possible price. Also, sprayers and spraying materials and in fact all kinds of orchard tools isX go with the growing business. The Individual grower will also be lmulated to produce and deliver the best that is possible as he will now the consequence if he fails. He soon learns that the association his best friend if he will only be good. Now, as I said before, we have the country, all we have to do Is to develop it If we will only exercise the same determination that Western ■Towers do, we can show the world how to grow fruit. </seg>
            <seg id="p191">191 REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON FRUIT RAISING*. AT THE STATE CONSERVATION AND DEVELOPMENT CONGRESS. LINCOLN. FEBRUARY 23-24. Mr. President: Your Committee on Fruit Raising begs to submit the following report and recommendation*: The experience of farmers, fruit-growers, and planters In general In Nebraska has proven that the natural conditions, soil, climate, etc, ar favorable for fruit production in the state. Pioneers coming to Ne - braska found splendid wild fruits growing along almost every water course extending out into the state where protection from forest fires was afforded. They found wild plums, grapes, crabapples, raspberries blackberries, etc., growing In abundance and which were finer flavore&lt; larger, and in every way better than wild fruits growing in other sec - tions. The varieties were also greater and aside from the annual prairi Ores conditions seemed to be ideal for the growth of these wild fruits. General J. C. Fremont and other real pathfinders for the Western pioneers noticed this indication of natural and favorable conditions for fruit development and referred to it in their early writings. General Fremont said: "The best indication of the richness of the Nebraska river (Platte river) country is the luxuriance and prodigality of the wild fruits, found growing wherever there is the slightest protection of trees. Our men gathered and enjoyed more than twenty different varieties of plums and grapes, all very much finer than any we had ever before seen. There were also many varieties of blackberries, raspberries, dewberries, and other kinds of berries that were new to us." General Dodge, in one of his reminiscences of the building of the Union Pacific railroad, said.: "We were seldomly without an abundant supply of some sort of wild fruit during the time we were working in Nebraska, throughout the season from June till September, and from the Missouri river to the Rocky mountain foothills. The rich lands produced the finest wild fruits we have ever seen, with the finest flavor and in tho greatest varieties." Since that time there has been great developments in fruit culture in the state and today almost every farm-home has Its orchard and fru garden. Many mistakes have been made and many orchards and smal fruit plantations have not been profitable to their owners. We flm however, that the natural conditions are not responsible for these cond tlons but that lack of Information as to the varieties best adapted, Iocs tion, culture, etc., and neglect of these important factors which are essential to successful fruit culture are usually responsible for failures. On the other hand we find that In practically all of the state where proper varieties have been planted on suitable locations, and where reasonable good care has been given, that apples, grapes, cherries, and other fruits grow remarkably well and bear fruit of good sise, color and quality </seg>
            <seg id="p192">192 Plantations of commercial proportions have been very profitable undertakings for those who have given the business the required atten - tion. We find this true, especially, in the older counties along the liasouri river. Orchards, vineyards and small fruit plantations are roving exceedingly profitable In this section and much of this land is tetter suited for fruit culture than for any other use. The soil is rich n potash, phosphates and other elements favorable to the best develop - ment of both wood and fruit. Its texture is such that it readily absorbs le water of heavy rains and melting snows. Then due to its sponge-like nature it is able to hold sufficient moisture in reserve. The topography of the land provides for good drainage, both soil and air. which are im - portant factors to fruit production. We believe this section of Nebraska is unexcelled, everything con - sidered, by any and equaled by few of the widely advertised sections of the country for commercial fruit growing; that with the same energy expended in growing apples and some of the small fruits commercially, better returns for the investment may be secured than is secured in many of the famous fruit sections of the country. The advantage of being from 800 to 2,000 miles nearer the principal market, than Western fruit sections, thereby saving the growers much in freight charges and loas from the long haul that the Western fruits are subjected to. are also great advantages to the Nebraska growers. Aa a result of the success of a few commercial apple growers in this section who have practiced thorough and up-to-date methods of handling their orchards, a revived interest in this business is shown and indica - tions now point to more thorough methods being practiced in handling the old and heretofore neglected orchards and to more planting of orchards for commercial purposes. During the seasons of 1909 and 1910 growers reported returns of from 1100 to $1,000 per acre from their orchards. k Vineyard and small fruit plantations have also been proving rwy fitable. Numerous Instances may be cited where such plantings have irned from $800 to $1,000 per acre. With the natural conditions favorable to fruit growing in this section, growers by observing four important factors, i. e, cultivation, pruning, spraying and heating, can make crop failures very rare and the business a source of great profit. We recommend that this congress go on record as favoring and t*n - couraging the development of the fruit industry in eastern Nebraska to Its fullest capacity and that the attention of the farmers and growers or fruit in general be called to the much neglected condition of the orchards and fruit plantations of the state and that they be urged to give better care and culture to their orchards and fruit gardens. (The above report was unanimously adopted.) </seg>
            <seg id="p193">193 FRUIT FOR THE HOME. VAL KIY8CR, UNCOLS. Ef farmer is interested and anxious to grow a sufficient amount fruit for the home supply. The fact that the business of succeaa - . growing incurs a few technical problems such as, prevention of killing frosts during the blooming season, the necessary warfare against injurious insects and destructive diseases, and the fact that all fruit grown in Nebraska, except apples, is by nature so quickly perishable after ripening, has discouraged many farmers from trying to provide these luxuries for the home. In some sections of the state an occasional visitation of hail has also added to the discouragement of the farmer growing fruit. These are problems which require experience with careful thought and study to overcome. A few Nebraska farmers, assisted by the experience of the nurserymen and fruit growers and the Experiment Station and State Horticultural Society, have had the courage to master these problems sufficiently to make Nebraska recognized as one of the leading fruit growing states in. the corn belt. There has never been a season in the last quarter century so un - favorable that it would not produce an abundance of fruit of certain kinds and varieties, where the grower applied his knowledge and gave his trees, vines, bushes and plants a fair chance to show what they could do. There have been seasons that most varieties of apples failed to pro - duce, but some varieties were sure to bear at least a light crop of choice specimens. This occurs even in the best fruit growing sections of the country. A failure of the cherry crop is a rare exception in Nebraska. Grapes and strawberries are absolutely reliable and can be grown as a profitable commercial crop on nearly every farm in the eastern half of the state. Peaches have come to be considered too uncertain for com - mercial planting except in the southeast corner of the state, but every farmer can afford to keep a dozen trees of mixed varieties for the crop which conies occasionally. Plums, pears and apricots are also rather uncertain producers except in certain localities or when given special care. There are a few localities where certain varieties bear nearly every year. These can only be ascertained by experimenting. The different steps necessary in growing fruit are about as follows: The choice of site or place to plant the trees, vines, etc., whi&lt; h naturally would be on well drained land and as near the house as possible, the preparation of the soil, the choice of varieties, the planting, cultivation, pruning and spraying. A two acre apple orchard is as large as any farmer should attempt to plant. This will give a nice collection of va - rieties, as the apple trees may be planted thirty-three feet each way, which would require about forty trees per acre. Cherry and peach may be used as fillers between the apple trees, filling the rows north and south, leaving a wider space between the rows east and west. This affords </seg>

The orchard can be used (or such crops when young to good advantage if proper care Is exercised in the cultiva - tion. All kinds of garden crops and strawberries do well in such cases If planted In rows to allow the use of the cultivator. Small grain and alfalfa or grasses should not be grown in the orchard in most sections of the state as the trees must be cultivated to succeed weil. Nearly every orchard should be cultivated up to the middle of July until it is eight or £ years old and during very dry seasons it is advisable to continue the tivation a few weeks longer. It is also often advisable to cultivate ly in the season in old orchards, continuing this cultivation should there be a heavy crop of fruit maturing and not a liberal amount of rain - fall. Small fruit, such as raspberries, currants and gooseberries may be grown in the rows of trees, and will do better where partly shaded The chief consideration in planting is to get the soil firmly packed about the roots. In planting cherries and plums care should be taken not to plant so deep that roots may start above the graft union. The severing of such roots in cultivating will often cause them to send up sprouts which are very annoying. Most cherries and plums are budded or grafted on stocks that do not sprout from the root and the bud or graft union should not be placed more than an inch and a half or two inches below the surface of the ground so that the improved top which will sprout up is not deep enough in the ground to form roots. A good wind-break should be planted on the north, west, and south sides of the orchard. The Austrian, Scotch or Dull pine are the best for this purpose. Do not plant cedar trees as the cedar rust has become a serious pest. In orchards with cedar trees growing near, such varieties as Whitney, Wealthy, Jonathan and Northwestern Greening have been defoliated by this disease which is common to the apple as the cedar. A row or two of some fast growing deciduous tree may be planted on the outside of the pines to serve as a protection until the pines spi well started. The following varieties of fruits are recommended for general plant Ing In Nebraska: Winter Apples — Janet, Northwestern Greening, Grimes' Golden. York Imperial, Ben Davis, Jonathan, Missouri Pippin. F»ll Apples — Plumb's Cider, Snow, Wealthy, Utter's Red Summer Apples — Duchess, Yellow Transparent, Chenango Straw berry. Early Harvest. Whitney No. 20, Cooper's Early White. Upright growing varieties, such as Whitney, Yellow Transparent. Chenango Strawberry, Missouri Pippin and Wealthy, do not require so much space as varieties which spread more like the Northwestern Green - ing, York Imperial, Utter's Red and Winsap, and when planting this fa&lt;t should be taken into consideration if space is limited. The Early Richmond and Montmorency cherries are about the only varieties that can be recommended for general planting. They are both </seg>
            <seg id="p195">195 the late varieties are more susceptible to fungus diseases and tavnr*o by wet seasons these diseases play havoc with them. Hardy varieties of grapes are Concord, Moore's Early, Worden, Camp - bell's Early, Brighton and Elvira. They should be put on wires c trellis after they are two years old and pruned every spring, cutting bark so there will be an average of about three buds left for each cane of the last year's growth. Strawberries should be planted in combinations as some varied"* are not self fertilizing. The Senator Dunlap, Gandy, Crescent, Sample, War field and Bederwood are desirable varieties. There are many other va - rieties equally meritorious for certain soils and localities, but for gen - eral planting those mentioned are the leaders. A liberal use of fertllb.or of which barnyard manure is excellent may be used to advantage .u the strawberry patch. Spraying has become an essential factor in profitable fruit produc tion. It Is only the Job of a half a day to spray the home orchard of the size above described, and it often makes the difference between success and failure in a fruit crop. Directions for spraying depend upon tbe fruit to be sprayed. kThis Information can alway be obtained from the secretary of &lt;hc te Horticultural Society, or the Experiment Station. TREE PLANTING IN NEBRASKA L Nebraska is less than fifty years old. The men prominent In its early tory have nearly all passed to the beyond. There were those noted in pioneer life; there were great lawyers; great journalists; some noted military men, and some noted for state-craft. All their claims for recog - nition and fame have been submitted to the Impartial judgment of his - tory; but among those, the favorable consideration of Nebraska Is per - haps more uniformly accorded to J. Sterling Morton, than to any other. Brilliant though he was, — a ripened scholar and finished orator and bold and uncompromising as were his political views, none of these constitute the basis of his fame. His enduring fame rests largely upoi. the outgrowth and development of a sentiment which in his later years appeared upon every letterhead which left Arbor Lodge. That w*s In the form of a command to "Plant Trees." Pie Kings of Controversy and the Dukes of Discussion seldom work good to their country, state, or nation. The valuable man Is he can discover the greatest need and combine that with a valuable present and effective means of satisfying it.

The foresight of Morton, and those who thought with him looked forward to the time, when the treat forests should be depleted, and all the attendant evil results therefrom would begin to be felt by, not only local communities, but the aatiou at large, and that in the even limited forestization of these plains, ih"se Eigs would occur: Rain-fall would increase, rain-fall would »■'. run red and held, soil would be e nrirhed and rich soil protected, whi'. ■ th&lt; utifying of the landscape would follow as the day follows the ni- In the more than a quarter of a century that I have lived in your midst, I have seen four classes of men who used, for their pleasure or livelihood. Nebraska soil. The first was typified by a man on the plains, year after year, sowing and planting in the spring, reaping in summer and garnering in the fall. I saw no trees about his home or aloug the borders of his land. I saw the constantly diminishing crops of wheat and corn from year to year and the rank sunflowers waving in the wind while the cockleburr clung tenaciously to the soil. Again I caw another, who. within reasonable bounds rotated his crops, and and used now and then scant fertilizer. He gathered what he had sown, but year by year there was a larger impoverishment of tfco ■oil and lean years was the prospect for his future. He wrougrr some men live, from hand to mouth. Again I saw a thrifty man. whose crops were rotated with timothy un&lt;l clover and better than the s. . with alfalfa. That man was using foresight for at least a decade ahead in sowing the last, and its growth, for a num ber of years. He was restoring the soil to its virgin fatness. And I saw another man looking farther into the future and in ad - dition to the sowing of clover, alfalfa, and other legumes, upon the hill - side, in the low and wet places, and along the roadside, he planted trees suitable to the place and their probable use in the generations to come. That man was planting for future generations. He was not only en - riching the legacy and devise to his heirs, but he was enriching the holdings of his neighbors. He was not only looking after the interests of self, but he was blessing and enriching the country present and future. Historians agree that the cradle of the race lay eastward and from the southern European seas and that Palestine, Persia, Arabia, and Egypt, were the earliest settled portions of the globe. True, there were early deserts, but the deserts have increased uniformly with the progress of the centuries. We read of the fertile plains and the rich, luxuriant river valleys, along such streams as the Jordan, the Tigris, the Euphrates and the Nile. We read about the mountains, clad with forests of which the cedars of Lebanon were the highest type. But man. thinking more of his city than of his country, impoverished the soil and despoiled the forests, so that the shifting sands have broken their former limits. and the vast domain which fed. for centuries, the multitudes of earth. </seg>
            <seg id="p197">197 their ruda agriculture and the commerce and manufacture of the vast cities have seen year by year the arable lands decrease until the waves of sand lapped the postern gates, and dozens of cities prominent in his - tory are in ruins, or lie buried in great depths by the desert. Inhabitants who lived there, prospered, suffered and died. Nomadic tribes, carrying on more or less precarious and doubtful existence, oc - cupy the montain fastness or travel along the narrowed river valley*. Over in western Europe, a few centuries ago, Spain was regarded as the granary of the world. Choicest cereals and rich product of the vine, came from Spain to sustain and stimulate, the inhabitants of every port where shipping was carried on. She destroyed her forests and with their destruction came the washing away of the best of her soil and Spain is dotted over with barren and denuded tracts, while, agriculturally, ike cannot feed hep own people. Europe has awakened to the situation. France, up till about fifty years ago, allowed her forests to be depleted and exploited, for private use, but for more than forty years there has been no sale of forest lands, and France is building up forestry in place of that destroyed. In the last year $40,000,000 has been spent in France in foresting the sand dunes and mountain sides. Since 1831, Germany has been planting forestry to take the place of that destroyed by the deforesting of that country, prior to that time. The result is that the government has great forestry of its own, which is being cared for, and in nearly every rich estate and every small farm holding, we find the government's work emulated by private effort, until men tell you that, small as Germany is, its tree growth and products are increasing and are becoming a source of vast wealth as well as the means of national and community beauty. Even in India, where vast forestry always existed, but in the early part of the last century was to a large extent waited, we find that the British government began in 1872 to replace the destroyed timber of the vast empire. Among the states of the Union whose legislators have looked about and noted the destruction of forestry and the ill effect it was having, not only on building material, but In the Injury to the landscape and wasting of the soil, New York, in 1885, began extensive work and expenditure to reforest the Empire state. In Nebraska, man found it without forestry. Vandalism never had an opportunity to work its ruin along forest lines, but It was left to man to build up and improve that condition which showed nature's manifest neglect. In doing this, we know the federal government had encouraged the planting of trees upon government lands but this was working from above down to the bottom and the success following it was not measur- </seg>
            <seg id="p198">198 fctim at the bottom, that is, with the individual, and expanding from year to year, will follow the course of development which is usually successful, that Is, the enterprise begins with the individual; it spreads like a contagion among the individuals and then when those Interested develop a standard of production or achievement, the state is asked to make uniform the enterprise and require those who do not volunteer their share to perform or contribute toward their respective parts. So in Nebraska, men like Morton have planted areas and stretches of trees. They built up a sentiment until, following the adoption by the various state organizations of the name "Tree Planters" ascribed to Nebraska, the legislature and governor officially called this the "Tree Planters' State." Quite recently. Professor Bessey, America's leading botanist, speaking before the Conservation Congress, recommended the planting of trees, by private, co-operative and state action, one-fourth of the area of Ne - braska. Professor Bessey Is probably an enthusiast; the mark set by him involves, perhaps, too much, yet I have no doubt that an approxima - tion of his Ideal would make this state a wealthier, more beautiful, and better commonwealth. Tree planting in cities and villages In Nebraska has been usually observed. A quarter of a century ago, Fillmore county villages were of oblong architecture, shingle roofed, lightning rodded dwellings. No tree, for a child to sit in its shade; no branch from which a man could commit suicide. Now, like our own county seat town, they are largely wooden bowered, a luxuriant shade provided in nearly every home and Tree planting In the country should be encouraged. We submit the following reasons: It holds the soil in place, therefore to a large extent the trees should be planted where the soil is liable to be eroded. The leaves enrich the Immediate locality. The groves conserve the moisture and within limits, aid its increase. LThey protect the crops, both cereal and fruit. In summer against the i and in winter against storm. They protect the flocks and herds against the rigorous winterblast.

            <seg id="p199">199 TBKB PLANTING IN and at proper Intervals, the oak of strength, the maple of beauty, the elm of grandeur and the pine of pride, and if need be, the willow of woe. Each in itself conveys some lesson to the young and old. Each one will have the effect of binding the man and the woman, the boy and the girl to the soil to stay by It, to love it, to defend it, if need be. The trees about a home more than anything else give Its character. I have often thought that farmers should instead of speaking of the Jones farm, or the Smith quarter, or the Brown eighty, should give some name to their abode, something significant to its appearance and charac - ter, elevating and suggestive. I know a few people in the county who have done this and I would like to see more of it and one of the greatest Ees of proper farm nomenclature would be the trees about the home, and women will endeavor to live up to the names they give their ■ as professional men live up to their calling. And I would like to see this organization start and keep a record of the various farm names that may be furnished the society. I believe that it would be a good and helpful sentiment My own farm is named, I call It "Fair Montlcello," named for the place of my birth and my first home in Nebraska. There Is another reason why I urge the planting of trees and the naming of farm homes and this Is that men and women, boys and girls, may foster an interest and pride in these farm homes. I have visited cities, large and small, and have seen the varied life of their numerous inhabitants and had some opportunity to observe their ways, their lives, their motives and ambitions. I have considered these with reference to the future of our state and country and have noted the somewhat in - creasing unrest of the swarming millions as they touch and crowd should - ers, one with another, and I have thought that tranqulllty and harmony cannot always prevail and that when friction shall become trouble, and trouble grow into riot, and riot shall swell Into rebellion, and rebellion threaten revolution, the strong conservative element of balance and con - trol will be found In our farm homes where our young and old live in health and comfort, work with strong hands and think with clear brains. There will be the force which will overcome state or national danger and keep our country and its institutions Intact, free and strong. That for this, and for other reasons here given, we should encourage tree planting. More than that, we should plant trees! b Thomas Dunn was an English poet, who saw the pleasures and utles of pastoral life and saw that much of them spring from the ennlal products of the soil. He wrote the following: "That was a day of delight and wonder While lying in the shade of the maple tree under. He felt the soft breeze of its frolicsome play. He smelt the sweet odor of newly mown hay, Of wilding blossoms in meadow and wood. And flowers in the garden that orderly stood; </seg>

Then he had all for his use or his vision All that the wishes of mortal could seize Then when he lay in a country Klysian Happily, dreamily, under the trees." HORTICULTURE IN THE NORTH PLATTE VALLEY. MAX PKAEMHER, U. 8. ETPEMMrNT STATION, MITCHELL, NIB. On the North Platte river there is I considerable area which is or will be under irrigation. Here we want horticulture to gain a foothold and thrive in its various branches. Before this area was irrigated, horticulture .ould not develop on account of lack of moisture. Being supplied with sufficient water now our worst hindrances are the strong and drying winds and the lack of winter moisture In such a climate as we have here we must develop a horticulture our own. Various factors will assist in such a development For frui and ornamental plants we must go to our native species first, p them under cultivation and cross them with our hardiest varieties, we graft trees we should see that we have hardy stocks. The same true of nursery stock, the root should be hardy. Top-grafted apple trees are very desirable if the stock is the Hibernal apple or the Virginia era Budded apple trees should not be bought. It is best to buy grafted tree and If possible trees should be secured that have been grown fro lung scion Krafts. I Apple and other trees liable to root-killing should be planted four to inches deeper than they stood in the nursery. These are some of precautions against root-killing. Winter-killing, both in branch and in root is often nothing but actual drying out. In this section plants and trees' can very often be insured against winter-killing by a late irrigation or watering. This application of water should be made after the leaves are off the trees and before the ground freezes deeply. The only way to contend with oar severe and harmful winds and to protect ourselves against them is to plant good wind-breaks. On farms, the orchard, garden, stockyard and home grounds should all be sur - rounded by a good wind-break. Such a wind-break should consist of from five to ten rows or more of trees Including the following kinds: cottonwood or Norway poplars, willows, green ash and hackberry. The nearest row of trees should be at least two rods from orchard or building </seg>
            <seg id="p201">201 crops. But then there are also other ways in which we can lessen the effect of the strong winds. Apple trees and other fruit trees should be headed low. About twenty-four inches is a good height. Prune or trim all trees so that there will be a main central axis and no weak joints. Avoid crotched trees.

GRAPE GROWING IN SOUTHEASTERN NEBRASKA J. K. DUNCAN, PERU. Grape growing in a commercial way in southeastern Nebraska is Just in its Infancy. This section of the state is destined to become a great fruit section. Soil, climate and location all favor the production of high quality fruit. The bluff land lying adjacent to the Missouri river is a rich loose soil. This is natural Umber country making it ideal fruit land. As to its adaptability for grape culture the bearing vineyards give abundant evidence by their big yields of high quality fruit. Grapes grown on Missouri River bluff land cannot be excelled for quality by grapes grown in any other section. At present only a few men are engaged in growing grapes commercially and as they are m»M^g a — ewi of it a larger acreage is being planted each year. How much will it cost to bring a vineyard into bearing, how long will it be before returns will come in, and what revenue can be expected from bearing vineyards are pertinent questions to beginners in grape culture. Land may be purchased for from $50 to $125 per acre depend - ing on location. Any land that can be cultivated may be utilized for vineyard purposes. The cost of vines (one year No. 1), planting, post and wire for trellis, labor necessary to bring vineyard into bearing, will vary according to kind of grape set out, labor put on land, etc. The varieties commonly grown are Concord, Worden, Moore's Early and Brighton. Several newer sorts are being tested out with gratifying success. Notable among these is the Campbell's Early. This is a large black grape that commences to ripen with Moore's Early and will hang on the vine for ten weeks and be in marketable condition. With us the past two seasons it has excelled the standard sorts in throw - ing out a heavier crop after being frozen back by spring frosts. It stands at the top as a commercial sort in this section. Late spring frosts have of late years been the bane of the fruit grower. This enemy of the fruit grower can now be eliminated by equipping the </seg>

A number of growers In this section are intending equip their orchards with heaters this spring and thus insure a crop of fruit. With the advent of orchard heaters grapes become one of our most profitable crops. The approximate cost of bringing a vine - yard into bearing and equipping with orchard heaters la from $100 to tper acre. Add to this the cost of land, interest, taxes, depreciation .lis and vines, and an acre would cost from $175 to $250 to change m the bare land to a bearing vineyard. An acre of grapes will yield from 200 to 2,000 eight-pound baskets of fruit. The price obtained varies from 2 to 4 cents per pound, so that an acre will return from $100 to $500 net. Taking the greatest cost per acre ($250) and least returns ($100) and an acre will give 4 per cent on investment. Is the average farm growing ordinary farm crops bringing in these returns? I think not. I believe that southeastern Nebraska has as a great a future as any section of the country for the production of fancy table grapes, apples and other fruits. Our fruits, when given proper care and put in competition with fruit from other sections, have taken their share of blue ribbons and have sold on the market at the top. Why go to Washington, Oregon. Idaho, Colorado, or other widely advertised fruit sections and pay from $500 to $3,000 per acre for land when Just as good land (better than some) several hundred miles nearer the big markets can be bought in Nemaha, Richardson, Pawnee, Otoe and other eastern counties for from $50 to $125 per acre. Our land will produce as much per acre and If proper care is given fruit will sell on markets for top prices. "Distance lends enchantment" is only too true in the fruit business. If you contemplate engaging in the fruit business you can make no mistake to buy a few acres In southeastern Nebraska, setting it largely tc grapes and if you put same care and attention acre for acre as Western fruit growers do the net returns will be larger. Stand up for rtheastern Nebraska as being as good a fruit section as Is found these United States of ours. HOW TO SELECT APPLES FOR EXHIBITION PURPOSE8. r. HOWARD, DEPARTMENT OF HORTICULTURE, UNIVERSITY FARM. The appearance of our fruit exhibits would be raised considerably and more prize money would go to men who really have fruit of merit if a little more attention were paid to selecting the fruit. It is pre supposed that the fruit one exhibits is the best he has. Unfortunately, this is not always true. Too often men go into their orchards or cellars for exhibition fruit with nothing more In mind than to select the largest and perhaps the reddest specimens they can find. Apples olectad In this manner are no more apt to take, first place at an apple </seg>

Size and color have their Importance, but unless associated with the several other things that con - stitute perfection they are not often of sufficient Importance to place a plate of apples in the blue ribbon class. There are at least five things that should be kept in mind when one is selecting apples for show purposes. They are: Uniformity, soundness. color, size, and shape. The five specimens constituting a plate should be as nearly alike in color, size and shape as it is possible to get them Uniformity, or the lack of it. are usually the most noticeable things about a plate, and the tendency of most judges is to lay the maximum amount of stress upon this point. Score cards differ in different states snd in different horticultural societies, but most of them allow about thirty out of a possible one hundred points for perfection In uniformity. One should never be tempted to place an abnormally developed speci - men in color or size upon a plate with the other four unless they, too, have the same characteristics equally well developed. The condition of the fruit with res]&gt;ect to the various kinds of blemishes and diseases is an important matter. About thirty points are usually allowed for perfection in soundness. Some of the common blemishes to be avoided are: Wormy .'mit i notice the blossom end carefully), apple scab, spray burn or russet, stemless fruits, bruised places and the sooty or fly-specked fungus patches. Never try to improve the appearance of show fruit by rubbing or polishing it. Fruit that has been kept too long in common storage or has been taken from cold storage a few days is apt to be in a more or less withered rdition. For show pun&gt;oses apples should not be withered enough wrinkles to form when they are pressed firmly in the hand. K fruits that have the variety color well developed. Specimens d color should be avoided if you know the variety is normally I one. Vlng will be gained by trying to select abnormally large fruits color and shape are apt to be sacrificed if this is attempted Study the variety shape and select show fruit that conforms with It. When show fruit is to be shipped it should he wrapped and care - fully packed in such a way that it can not bruise. HORTICULTURE IN SCHOOL OF AGRICULTURE. ■OT E. MARSHALL, LINCOLN. Horticulture is required of all students In the School of Agriculture. Tbe men receive two years of instruction, freshman and senior years, and the women take the course* during their sophomore year. The aim of the course is to give the student an understanding of all the practical «iiv/iio \ vamsBKM. iwi "iiu i or QUi^Wl 111 IOCMI VX DOruCUIlUrc. Hr </seg>
            <seg id="p205">205 r;r with gome of the scientific principles on which these operations based. The course is taught by series of lectures and in addition the students have cnp two-hour laboratory or practice period each week. During this practice period the classes are divided into small sections tfrom five to eight students in order that each student may receive ■(• thorough instruction. At the beginning of the first year the men take up the study of management of both the home and the commercial orchard. They begin with the propagation cf trees, then the culture and care of the orchard and finally they study the harvesting, storing and marketing of the fruits. Only the tree fruits adapted to Nebraska conditions are dealt with, and si&gt;ecial emphasis is laid upon varieties best suited to our con - ditions. A great deal of stress is also laid upon the methods of tillage and spraying. After the tree fruits have been thoroughly covered in the lecture room as well as in the laboratory, the study of small fruits is taken up in much the same manner. During the senior year the men make a study of ornamental garden ing, vegetable gardening, plant breeding and fruit judging. The latter is taken up in the laboratory and several periods are devoted to the study of varieties and judging the fruit. In the study of ornaments! gardening, the general principles, and the methods of ornamenting both farm and city homes are discussed. The students are instructed in the methods of propagation and identification of ornamental trees and shrubs. The students are required to draw up plans of their farmsteads and ornament the same. The course in vegetable gardening includes the choosing of the site, preparing the ground, rotating crops, the making and use of hotbeds, the testing of vegetable seeds under various condi tions and the storing and judging of vegetables. The men receive thr. • Cures each week during their freshman year and two during their ior year. In the course for women particular stress is laid upon the growing of flowers and other ornamental plants, both indoors and out. Home orchardarding and vegetable gardening are also briefly covered. Special emphasis is laid upon the principles of ornamental gardening as applied to the home. In the laboratory they deal largely with the propagation of shrubs and both annual and perennial outdoor and indoor flowers. E laboratory or practice period is a very essential part of the Let us take spraying as an illustration. This subject is thor covered in the lecture room, but If the student really makes some of the spray material he remembers it longer and everything U made plain to him. He not only makes a small quantity of spray ma - terial, but in the case of Bordeaux mixture he uses three different methods for a short time, in order that he may gee which one remain in suspension for the longest time. Students who complete this work satisfactorily and who have had some practical experience in addition are prepared to engage in com </seg>

A large number of students, upon graduating from the schoo have returned to their homes and made their father's as well as thel own orchards return much larger dividends. They have also been help to the Experiment Station in securing data, and they are always ■ore deeply interested in the subject If a student cares to go into the subject deeper than the Instructor goes In the class room he will be given any number of references to books and bulletins which may be found in the library and bulletin room. However, if a person wishes to specialize along some branch of horticulture, he had better enter the University proper, where the sub - ject and allied subjects are dealt with more deeply and scientifically. The horticultural department is crowded very much at present, but it will be located on the second floor of a new brick building on the site of the present Horticultural Hall, in about a year. It is hoped that there will be plenty of room then and that the laboratory equipment will meet the needs of the students as well as the department rEF SURVEY OF HORTICULTURAL WORK OF SEASON AT THK NEBRASKA EXPERIMENT STATION. V. V. WE8T0ATE. The horticultural work at the Experiment Station has been more or leas handicapped this season by a lack of rainfall. However, in the case some of the special experiments artificial watering was resorted to, that most of the experiments were carried on without serious handi cap. In addition to the ordinary routine work with fruits the depart - ent has been carrying on some experimental spraying tests with the urn. Careful sprayings were given different varieties of this fruit In rder to determine Just what would be the effect on the curculio. Ar senate of lead was the material used and the results were quite favorable, though, of course, one can't generalize on the results of one season's praying. The small fruits at the station were injured by the drouth and only produced a fair crop. This was especially true in the case of le blackberries and raspberries as moisture was very deficient at the most critical time. Currants particularly and gooseberries and straw - berries produced the best among the small fruits. Some moisture tests n connection with raspberries have been carried on this summer, which will be continued during the winter. The idea of such experiments is to elp determine the relation of the soil moisture content to winter killing, ome of the raspberries were protected so that they received practically o water during summer. In another plat the normal rainfall was re - ceived and in a third plot heavy artificial watering was resorted to. Daring the winter the behavior of the plants under these different eon- </seg>
            <seg id="p207">207 much mooted question: What causes winter killing? A great deal of work in plant breeding has been carried on during the summer. Professor Howard has been continuing his heredity studies with some of our common flowering plants such as the portulacca, bal gam and snapdragon. Color Inheritance is the chief phase of this work, although the behavior of size, shape and other characters was noted as well. Professor Emerson is away on leave of absence, doing graduate work at the present time. The extensive work in heredity studies which he has started is being continued partly by himself at Harvard University and also, in part, at the Experiment Station, under his direction. Prac - tically all of the plant breeding material was of such a nature that it had to be watered artificially during the summer and, even then, it was impossible to grow some of the plants as they should be grown. But very few new experiments in any line have been started &lt;by the depart - ment during the present year on account of the fact that Professor Emerson is away. However, several new projects are contemplated for the coming season. E mentioning horticultural work one must not overlook the land side which has been carefully looked after under the supervision Dunman. A good many trees, shrubs and other plants were set out last spring and the general plan of the campus has been consider - ably improved. A portion of the campus lawn dried up during July but the most of it was well watered so that on the whole the summer bed ding effects were quite good and were appreciated even more than they would have been had the summer been extremely favorable for the best plant growth. Some time within the next year the horticultural department hopes to have much better facilities for carrying on its work — as a new plant industry building is to be constructed which will house this department and several others. BEAUTIFYING THE FARM E. H. HZHM1K0HAU8, LINCOLW. It cannot be denied that the tasteful ornamentation of rural homes Is not only one of the most agreeable, but also the most natural recreation that can occupy a human mind. Yet there are but few well ornamented rural homes. The causes of such a state of affairs are usually considered four in number. In the first place, many do not appreciate the need of ornamentation; they see neither a recreative nor an economical value. Secondly, we find very poor competition among the tillers of the soil in the way of landscape ornamentation. Not only are the individual places poorly ornamented but whole communities lack beauty as well. Then there is little to spur the farmer on. unless he is otherwise sifted witb </seg>
            <seg id="p208">208 I aesthetic nature. Thirdly, the farmer is not aa enthusiastic over ure as urbanites, for he fairly lives with it and as a result he fails appreciate it. Lastly, he lacks the time. Now there is no reason Y these four causes cannot be removed — each one seems absurd. ely the best method of removing them is to hire a competent land l«c gardener to plan your place, then you have instituted competition I the whole community will be benefited, for no one fails to appre - e tasteful gardening. Another method is by reading references in dening and accomplishing the work yourself. The location of build b and drives is the first thing to be considered in planning a place, it will be my object to say nothing of this but to discuss some means which a farmer can beautify his place himself, no matter what condi 1 it may be in as regards to location of drives and buildings. Surely the first thing to consider is the general neatness of the place. 1 occasionally make a visit in the country, northwest of Lincoln. The drive takes me past several neat places and two places are made notable by their lack of neatness. The house of one is bedecked with only a portion of a chimney; the other portion had been wrecked by a storm The partially destroyed chimney was not attrartive, but to overtop this the owner bad failed to remove the bricks that were left upon the roof. I first saw that three years ago and it is still in the same condition. The rest of the place was in harmony. Here stood an old hay rack, there a mower and so on, besides piles of iron scraps and old lumber. There was absolutely no neatness there. The other farm is characterized by having machinery in the front yard and along the road aides. We must have lumber piles and iron heaps, but put them in some unseen place. Do the same with the machinery if you do not have a machine shed. If you do not have a secluded spot at your disposal then make one. All that is necessary is to take a certain plot of ground and en cloae it with trees and shrubs. You can also make a rustic fence and cover the same with vines such as grape or morning glory, preferably grape. As you drive through the country, how many farm homes do you see with uniformly painted buildings? In moat cases you will find only the house and the barn painted, the former white and the latter red. A uniform painting or buildings as regards to color will give a moat pleasant effect and above all an immediate effect. Never paint your buildings white. White is bad for two reasons. First, it is too con - spicuous a color; and secondly, white as a color will not blend with the I— dsrspr As a general rule select the colon of building material, such as cement, stone, wood, bark of trees, etc. In doing this you select a neutral color and one which will blend with the landscape. Browns, drabs, fawns and grays are just fine. Paint all buildings the same color, bat it is well to paint the house a few shades lighter than the other %^fifing« as it should be more conspicuous. The trimmings should be a few shades darker than the body color. The smaller the house the lighter the color, so as to have it stand out more prominently. Never </seg>
            <seg id="p209">209 paint the blinds green for it la too striking and you violate the first general rule in selection of color when yon do so. While it always seems necessary to have a fence about the house, it U nevertheless bad. All fences are bad but there are degrees of badness. If a fence can be dispensed with, so much the better, for in doing so you usually create a large yard and the rural home ground should be large. The best fences are, of course, those that are most natural; namely, hedges. A good privet hedge will keep out the chickens and, by the way. this is one of the most hardy and beautiful of hedges. Arbor vitae winter kills and osage orange makes a too open growth. Plant this hedge in front and on the sides, where there are no shrubbery groups. Where the hedge runs into the shrubs, have it drift in, so to speak; that is, vary its shape and size as it approaches the group. If the house is within 75 feet of the road, use no hedge but otherwise it is permissible. A parlor would seem at a loss without a rug or a carpet and Just so would the landscape be without a green sward. The lawn is the founda - tion of landscape effects on the farm and without it it is incomplete. Never break up a lawn with (lower beds. Trees and shrubs should be to the side, leaving an open renter. Blue-grass makes the finest of lawns ki this region, but it is sometimes difficult to secure a good stand. Clover is next best and it is advisable to plant clover first and then grad ually work in blue grass. Red Top is good for quick effects as well as some of the commercial mixtures of lawn seed. The two greatest enemies of the lawn are dandelions and crab-grass. Dandelions can be eradicated by the use of a digger but crab-grass offers a greater problem. Crab - grass sets seed so freely and the mower will not get all of the heads as they may be flat upon the ground. It pays to rake up the crab grass be - fore mowing, thereby getting some of these heads. A crab-grass lawn If mowed often is not bad but it is late in coming out in spring and dries up early in the fall. I believe it can be crowded out with clover. The best results in lawns are secured with fall sowing. As a general rale never let the lawn-grass go to seed. Using the parlor example again, trees are no more indispensable to the landscape than furniture is to the parlor. Trees have four uses upon the farm: namely, for wind-breaks, for screens, for shade and for pare ornamental purposes. It is advisable to plant a windbreak north of the barns and feed lots. A wind-break northwest of the house would also be advisable if it does not Interfere with the grounds proper. These wind-breaks should be of evergreens; preferably Bull, Austrian and Jack pines or Norway and Black Hill spruces. Cedars should not be used owing to their relation to the orchard. If there Is any disagreeable view from the house the same can be screened off by the use of trees. The barn - yard should certainly be screened off from the houses. Certainly the trees' shade is one of the most striking advantages. Then plant trees so as to shade the house but do not plant too close to the house or to each other. Do not plant too many trees, as Is generally the case, resulting </seg>
            <seg id="p210">210 NEBRASKA STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY la a forest. Tree* are also beautiful in themselves. They have form. color and texture. Elms bare square heads, pines have a horizontal branching habit and the Lombardy poplar has an erect branching habit. Then there are also weeping elms, mulberries and willows. The honey locust and the catalpa have lighter foliage while the pines are of a dark green. Catalpas have large broad leaves, while the locust has fine compound leaves. Now, use these trees in your screens and shade for their diversity. If you cannot use them for shade or screen purposes use them for pure onamental purposes. The deciduous trees are showy in summer and conifers or evergreens In winter and, by the way, plant a specimen tree of the beautiful Colorado Blue spruce, as there Is nothing more delightful or inspiring than the same in dead winter. All in all, have a variety of trees and good ones, too. Poplars, box-elders and willows are cheaper, but they give a cheaper effect. Everyone has seen a forest or a woodland. It not only consists of trees but it also includes shrubbery or under brush growth. The shrub - bery plays its part by hiding the trunks of the trees and by covering up a general bareness at the base of the trees. Shrubbery should be planted with groups of trees to give this naturalistic effect. They should be planted in groups, yet the spirea Van Houttel makes a fine individual specimen. The group may also serve as a screen, or as a barrier to trespassing. By all means have groups of shrubs at the sides and back of yard. Make these plantings the boundary of ttie~yard. This boundary may -consist of one continuous group or of several smaller groups. Do not plant the shrubs in rows or squares but just clump them together. The boundary of the groups should be curved or bulged out at places. Do not place much shrubbery at the front boundary. It may be well also to have shrubbery directly in front of the house and at the sides. Perhaps there is a foundation to hide. In these groupings one should have tall ones in the rear and smaller ones in front. Tamarix, mock orange and lilac are good tall shrubs. Spireas, dogwood, snowballs and privets are very good intermediates. The Van Houttei spirea is the most beautiful of our shrubs in flower, form, and foliage. Make an entire group of this one. Barberries are the best of small shrubs. Of course you have a good nursery down at the creek. It will offer dogwood, buckbrush, sumac, gooseberries and elderberries. It will be well to use some of these — yes all of them, for there is nothing better for a rural effect The forest also has its vines. The tallest weeds along the road sides are twined upon by morning glory or bindweeds. It certainly la a part of nature. By all means plant vines. Plant them on the fence if it still stands. Sheds can be completely covered by vines. If your house is built of brick, then use the Virginia creeper, but do not use this on wood as it will aid decay. It is possible to have vines on the house by using a trellis. Honeysuckles, clematises and Crimson Ramblers are fine for a trellis. Ordinarily vines are used on porches and the effect is good. I «*e* saw a farm home porch covered with a grape vine. The Tine was </seg>
            <seg id="p211">211 BEAUTIFYING THE FARM It wag very beautiful as well as economical. Morning glory, cypress and balloon vines are our best annuals, while the three mentioned previously are best perennials. Again you can go down to the creek and find plenty of grape and bittersweet. Ordinarily, flowers attract more attention than other parts of the landscape. Too often the case, they so overshadow everything else that shrubs, trees and all are ignored. Flowers are beautiful and conspicuous but they should not overshadow everything else. As mentioned above, never put a flower garden in the lawn If you wish a natural effect, and that is the only one for a rural home. Plant the flowers in the borders, in the shrubbery groups or against the fence. The shrubbery group Is the most inviting place for the flowers and a most appropriate one also Flowers will serve to fill out the gaps and form the graduation from the tall rear shrubs to the lawn grass. There are two classes of flowers — annuals and perennials. We might add bulbs, but they are either annual or perennial. Annual flowers live but one year while perennials live from year to year. It is advisable to use perennials as they need but little care and are permanent. Many perennials flower early in spring, an effect you can not secure with annuals. With perennials you can have something flowering all through summer. I want to emphasize again, never to have flower beds, but plant flowers In borders, among shrubs and alongside the fence. Use tall flowers in the rear and shorter ones in front Bulbs give a fine early spring effect and they are out of the way in time for the annuals. Plant bulbs in fall or early winter. The following can be recommended: hyacinths, crocuses, tulips and the narcissus. The best annuals are: petunias (single and double"), balsams, candy tufts, bachelor buttons, cockscombs, nasturtiums, pansies, phlox, popples, castor bean, sweet peas, verbenas and zinnias. These few will give every color, form, texture and size desired. The annuals should be grown from seed. The best perennials are: columbines, bluebells, cor - eopsis, larkspur, Chinese bell flowers, hollyhocks, Oriental poppies, peonies, phlox, golden glow, golden rod, tiger lilies, day lilies and irises. Every one should have every one of these growing in the border. Peonies. Irises and oriental poppies are the most beautiful of our garden flowers and surely no garden could be complete without them. These perennials can be grown from seed but It is difficult to get good results. Buy a collection of your nurseryman. He will sell you the roots or plants. Then, each two years divide up the clumps and transplant. In this way you can start with a small stock and have a sufficiency In a few years. It is necessary to mulch the perennials for the winter. The last phase of this subject that I wish to discuss is that of the care of the roads, roadsides and field ends. The best improvement that a rural community can make Is that of the road improvements. Good roads are not only economical but they add beauty to the landscape Procure or make a drag and use it on your part of the road after eack </seg>
            <seg id="p212">212 E. It will not take much time and the whole community will appre - &gt; it. Nothing can be more unsightly than roadsides of sunflowers or leburrs. They obstruct the view of the fields and besides It indicates management. A good collection of smaller weeds, and weeds that not so harmful, do not make a bad effect, at least there is an air of ralness. But as a general rule, mow the roadsides. After this is &gt; go on the other side of the fence and mow the weeds between the e and field ends. I In conclusion. I hopt ihn fv.-ry reader will try some of these sugges - ns. at least clean up and paint the buildings. There is not much ex use to what has been advistd. Anyway, never think about how much Is going to cost, but ask if it is going to be beautiful. If it is beautiful, will be a recreation to you -yes. an inspiration, by these means you re hare not only made the place beautiful and more homelike but you ve increased the value of the place over and above the cost of the unification. THE HOME BEAUTIFUL. C. S. HAKMKO\, YOKK. It is a delightful thing for th&lt; home to have a procession of beauty from early spring till the hard frosts of autumn. On account of the winter drouth which prevails in Nebraska and other portions of the West it will not do to plant trees and shrubs in thf fail unless we except the lilac, which is one of the hardiest ornamentals rhe practice which succeeds so well in the moister climate of the East nas been discarded with us. tWith perennials, however, it is different. Their tops always die down the fall while the roots survive. We have never found a raspberry Ich did not kill to the ground while the roots would be uninjured. If sible we always plant perennials in the fall and seldom lose a plant. honiis If you note the structure of the roots you will find the buds which are to produce the next year's foliage and flowers are perfectly formed e last of August. In September we commence to plant. If the tops are green mow them off and dig and divide the roots. Some of these ay be very brittle and snap like pi pest ems when handled. Let tonm ry a half a day and wilt a little; toughen them so you can cut them up n safety. Then you can put them in water or plant in moist earth and ou restore them to plumpness again. Often among valuable sorts there great loss in cutting up when freshly dug. You need a bud with a root to make a success. Wilt them and you can .divide with perfect safety. Dealers will often dry them a little to prevent the roots from reaking while being packed and then use moist material to restore them om the way. You plant the root while the bud Is young and tough and mmediately It will throw out tiny rootlets which by September will b* </seg>

In November it has become more so and must be handled with care. In the spring they begin to grow at a very low temperature and the bud is easily damaged. Dealers, in saving roots for spring sales must keep them, partly dry, in cold storage so as to retard their growth. Thus kept back we can plant as late as the first of June and they will live and perhaps you will have a few blooms. But the best time is September and October. You seldom lose a peony on account of their extreme hardiness. In planting put them in slanting. If you put them in straight the earth may settle away and the bud punches it way out to be damaged by the 6. Put them in at an angle of forty-five degrees and they will with the earth. Have the ground in good condition and put the xo or three inches below the surface. You should not lose a plant indred. IKISES Pfeeae charming flowers of ethereal beauty are more and more com Into favor. It is a delight to see the marvelous colors and wonderful sry of most delicate tints interwoven with matchless skill. Next to peony they are extremely hardy. They multiply with great rapidity We have divided thirty "from one plant in two years. Get a few of choice kinds and you will soon have some splendid masses of them. We have kept the plants in moss in boxes six months at a time and then planted them out when well started without losing any. They do best when planted in August or September. We have planted them successfully after blooming in July. Sometimes they are planted very late just be - fore freezing. Again, early spring is a good time. At the North they should be planted in good season and then they should be mulched. Put the roots about two or three inches below the surface. Of course the ground should be well pulverized and moist. OBIEMAI POPPIES These are perennials, bearing flowers from the same root for twenty years. A large bed in full bloom is one of the most striking things In floriculture. It is a blaze of splendor — a miniature sea of fire. The great flowers are from six to nine Inches in diameter and inside is some of the nature's finest handiwork all done up in jet. They bloom in June and they go into a dormant condition in July and August and you think they are dying when they are only going to sleep. They should be planted in August or September when you will probably save every one. The root is shaped like a parsnip. It increases with age and then subdivides. If you wait till spring the outer skin slips from the root and you do well if you save 25 per rent.

A gentleman procured some In the fall and not g ready to plant them Just then, he threw a board over them and ot all about them until spring, when he took up the board and found q in good condition. He planted them with no loss. October and ember are good months for planting them. We do not often mulch seldom lose a plant Farther north It is well to cover them. Her* ground seldom heaves. Sometimes we hoe dirt over them In the fall remove it in the spring. The nurseryman often has orders for them he spring when they are a foot high. It is cruel to disturb them in condition. In the spring they begin to grow before the frost is ly out of the ground. Great improvement has, of late years, been le with them. We have produced several of great merit and we k much Oner than any of the imported ones. They are in bloom 1 June till November. The Phlox Manual takes you Into wonderland shows how you can produce new varieties as well as the European DBLPHIimniB. These prove to be very attractive. In the main they carry all the shades of blue, besides the pure white and the yellow. The latter, how - aver, is not perfectly hardy. These should be planted in October and November or very early in the spring. At their best you see great branching plants, sometimes six feet tall, miniature trees, overwhelmed with super blooms. Many new kinds are being produced. Burbank's and Boston mixed seem to be among the best AQUI1XCIA OB OOLUUBXNB tvery hardy. The Rocky mountain coerulea is among the finest e flowers are on hand for Decoration Day and bouquets of red, white blue make fine tribute for soldiers' graves. Hardy chrysanthemums, pyrethrums (painted daises), pinks, be gonlas (plume poppy), campanulas of the perennial sort, hollyhocks and many others may be planted in the fall. Shasta daises. Stokes' asters, digitalis and galllardlas are classed as hardy perennials but they are Dot If planted In the fall they must be well covored. It is well for them to wait until early spring and let the florist take the risk of winter t Plant in abundance. They are cheap— a little money goes a good rs.

The best and most permanent results in the planting around the homes have been accomplished by men who have tried to work out a certain ideal, who have planted trees and shrubs because they wanted them to decorate and protect the building site. Some varieties have served their purpose well, while others have long demonstrated the mis - takes of planters. It is interesting to consider the ideals and motives which induced the pioneer to have these horticultural surroundings. Some were anxious to provide shade and windbreaks for protection and comfort of the family. Others loved the fruit of the tree and the vine. The same idea] has been carried out in a general way in the plan of the lawn. It Is the show window of the farmer's place of business — the thing he prides himself In keeping neat, clean and attractive. There were some people in pioneer days, and it is unfortunate for the beauty of our state, that some of them still exist, who preferred to live in a house Isolated on the bare prairie with not a tree in sight. Occasionally we find a progressive, industrious man who believes it Is necessary first to reap a fortune from the fertile soil before he can build his home and surround it with trees and plants. This man Is unfortunate in being burdened with such an ideal, and experience usually teaches him his mistake. The comforts and likes of the wife and children should be considered. Every one is appealed to by things beautiful to a greater or lesser extent and as environments and surroundings play a very important part in character building, all these things will tend to inspire and to elevate the ideals of the young mind. Some have the inspiration and desire to have the home made more attractive but from a lack of knowledge in selecting and caring for the trees and plants they fall to accomplish the desired results. In the first place it is necessary to give a little thought to varieties. Those which are perfectly hardy in the particular locality should be selected and If they cannot be secured from a neighbor or a local dealer they should be purchased from the nearest reliable nursery. Too oftei trees and shrubs are purchased from foreign concerns or those not hav - ing an established reputation, and the purchaser gets stock which Is not adapted to the country and consequently does not thrive. When considering planting, one should try to get a dear idea at the </seg>
            <seg id="p216">216 STATE HORTICULTURAL SOCIETY •tart of what be desires to accomplish. In other words the planting should be done with some definite end in view. It will then be necessary to consider the various trees and plants suited to the climate, and see which can be best made to produce the effect desired. All trees and shrubs do not grow the same. Some are symmetrical in growth and make handsome specimens when standing alone while others are ragged in appearance and give the best effect when grouped. The color of foliage and flowers and the time of blooming should also be taken into consideration when laying out the grounds. There is one class of shrubs that is desirable because of its blooming early in the spring; there is another that blooms in mid-summer and later; another is desirable be - cause of its brilliant colored foliage carried late in the fall, and still another Is desirable because of the rich coloring of the trunk and twigs. A complete list of trees and shrubs which may be safely used in Nebraska for ornamental purposes will not be given here, but a few good one* which experience has shown may be used with a reasonable degree of certainty shall be mentioned. One of the first things to consider in starting a home In a prairie country is the planting of trees for protection. The building site and feed lots should be entirely surrounded with two or three rows of ever - greens. Scotch, Austrian, Ponderosa (or bull) and Jack pines thrive in almost any part of Nebraska. While they appear to grow slowly, at the expiration of ten years, if properly cared for, they will average almost twenty feet in height and form a protection that protects the year round. There is probably no deciduous tree that will make a windbreak so effective, especially during the bleak winter months, and certainly mm that will add cheerfulness as these with their winter coat of green. Care should be taken in planting the lawn not to get ornamental* 100 close. A few good shrubs such as the hardy hydrangea, splrea Van Houttei. Japanese quince, bush honeysuckle, and perhaps two or three (Colorado blue and Black Hills) may stand by themselves. Mainly the planting should be In groups and should be arranged at the sides of grounds and at the angles and rear of the house. A few good shade trees set at convenient places, a nice bed of bush roses, two or three beds of hardy perennials (phloxes, peonies, irises), two or thre» t climbing vines (clematis jackmanni and paniculate), two or climbing roses and possibly a weeping tree or two will about te the list for the average home. E'he trees, shrubs and plants mentioned are all hardy in most parts of ■tate and ran be had on all home grounds with a small outlay of ey. But they must have care to do well. The roses and peren - nials will not succeed planted singly over the lawn any more than a stalk of corn would when chocked by blue grass, but should be planted in beds and hoed the game as garden crops. The sod should not be al - ■to grow closer than eighteen inches or two feet from the trees, and climbers until they are well established. </seg>
            <seg id="p217">217 THE TKEE AS AN ENGINEER I The better we are acquainted with a tree the more we appreciate it. I we are at times astonished by an intelligence which seems to be almost on the border of reason. Take one standing out in the open. It is seventy-five feet high and the limbs have a spread of Sfty feet and it is filled with leaves, the whole presenting an immense frontage to the winds which are blowing at the rate of sixty miles an hour. Rt hand that problem over to a civil engineer, the best educated one in find. Tell him of the immense leverage the tree gives to the and that the base where it touches the earth is only four feet h, and he must strengthen it that it will not blow over. What would he say if you told him he must erect a house seventy-five feet high and fifty feet broad, all on a base of only three or four. He would tell you it could not be done. That to be safe you want a foundation as broad as the house itself, and that it was not in the power of human skill to meet a problem like that. Ptnd yet, that tree without having been to school, without studying neering, and without a knowledge of the higher mathematics, tly goes to work and solves the problem without a mistake, and most difficult problem too. While in Illinois I bought a place on which were sturdy oaks that had to be grubbed out. I learned better than to cut down the tree first. 1 wanted the leverage of the top and it made a wonderful difference. Then I could study the marvelous feat of engineering. What a huge bulge there was at the base wher# those tremendous brace roots went out to clutch the earth like tent cords. There was the tap root which bored its way deep into the ground. If you followed out these lateral braces you would find them like cables of steel throwing out an almost infinite number of small roots and these would wander out like net - work, a hundred feet away. Now let the tremendous root pressure come. How tough the trunk is. If not well woven it would snap like a pipe stem. Let the top bend and sway, ten thousand little cords covering the whole area of a circle of 200 feet around the tree are converging in the main braces and clutching the earth, and each telling the other to hold fast, and they do. The storm wages with redoubled fury. The great mass sways and bends before it. Each limb is a canvass to catch the gale. What a mighty battle between the storm and these unseen tent cords which are holding the tree. Every fibre has been toughened, and the process of resistance has made the tree stronger for future emer - gencies. If you go into a dense forest you find another condition of things. TtM trees standing on the outskirts are the sentinels which guard the HARBISON, YORK. </seg>
            <seg id="p218">218 rest, and how well rooted they arr. They interpose their own sturdy forms to protect those within. Now in the deep woods where trees stand in companionship and help one another, where the wind cannot single one out to pour all 1U wrath upon it, they do not need to be so well rooted and are not braced like the ones out in the open. But let the guards and protectors be cut away. Leave an acre thus trained to the mercy of the wind, and the storm finds them all unprepared and they are torn up by the roots as we have seen in very many instances. Thug we see Nature ever on the alert to meet the varying conditions that she may be ready for them. She has no energy to waste with extra and needless roots and braces in the deep woods. But out in the open Bhe has every needed device brought into play. There seems to be a presiding genius somewhere in that tree which like a general in a besieged fort prepares for any contingency. Every tree is a Port Arthur standing siege for ages and the commanding general unseen by us always near to strengthen every point of attack and repel every effort, and successfully resist the bombardment of every storm. I And when I pass such a grand monarch I feel like taking off ray hat some superior genius presiding there. SKUKISC. FOOD \M&gt; DRINK. If you watch a tree closely and study its habits you are surprised at its shrewdness In searching out its sustenance. It is almost as cun - ning as a rat in finding out good food and plenty of drink. I have ■em a cottonwood, green and fresh in the dryest part of a dry summer, have leaves of deepest green, putting out at the same time a vigorous growth, while a little beyond and all around were trees and shrub" badly wilted and suffering with the terrible heat What made the tree so fresh and vigorous? Two hundred feet away was a cistern, the iree found it out and sent its roots plowing through the hard earth to that cistern. It was a large one, had never failed before and the people wondered what became of the water. On exam - ination it was found that the roots had gone down outside the brick and pushed their way through the cement and had carried the watei 100 feet up to that tree. And the tree seemed to be crowing like a tri uraphant rooster over its victory. I spent much time in the mountains studying the evergreens. One fall it had been very dry, in short, but little rain had fallen during the summer. There was a grove of Ponderosa pine that seemed to be dying Was it possible that these hardy trees were going to succumb? I went up to see them. They seemed to have taken counsel and decided that there was so little nourishment they could not carry all the family through, so they would take what they could. And they dropped about two-thirds of those long needles and retained the rest. And when spring came with plenty of moisture from the melting snows they </seg>
            <seg id="p219">219 INTELLIGENCE IN TRKK8. put on fresh vigor. I have known these trees perched on high bluffs to send roots down the steep hillsides, a hundred feet, and pump up water to them. In some Instances I found roots from trees two hundred feet away drinking up the water and sending it back to the trees and these were very fresh, vigorous and thrifty, retaining their foliage while those beyond on the mountain side from necessity had to drop a portion of theirs. It is remarkable what keen intuition a tree has to know just how much it can stand, so that it can adjust itself to circumstances. A neighbor had occasion to move quite a load of red cedars. He said "I am going to take my time and move them so carefully they will not know it." He took up a lump of earth with the roots, but of course be could not take all the roots, for they were not at home when he went after the trees. Be careful as you may, with large trees you can not get all the roots. The feeders have wandered off on a foraging ex pedition some distance away. Well, the man dug with greatest care and took rains in planting and watering them well. In a few weeks he came to me and said, "All my trees are dying." "No," said I, they know a good deal more than you do and are acting accordingly. They have not roots enough for all those tops and so they are hauling in to 'cut the coat according to the cloth.' When you cut off the roots in digging you should have cut the tops back to match and that is what they are doing." We examined and found they had discarded about one-half of the limbs, and those near the trunks were green. I told him to con - sult his trees and find just what they wanted, and cut off all the limbs they refused to carry. He did so .and found he had cut them severely. But following the judgment and wish of the trees he saved every one and they had fine, heavy, compact tops as soon as they could be well Ked to sustain them. Now where is that intelligence lodged? It la e. Does the tree have a soul? It surely has wisdom. Pd you ever notice how the trees practice self-surgery? Next time go out you will notice that there is a burl at the base of very Sooner or later the tree seems to know that the lower limbs die and after a time they will break off by that burl. Then it pushes that over the wound and closes it up, just as In amputation when the surgeon saws off a limb he carefully saves a flap of flesh to cover it. In trimming a tree nature should be aided. The best time is in June r don't wait till the limb gets large; cut it off close to the burl and flap closes over it and it is soon healed. Ei intimated before the tree is very shrewd in looking for its food, ■e moved to a place where my predecessor had abandoned his gar - because he said, "there was too much shade and nothing would there." Now It was one of the richest pieces of ground in the village and I thought I knew what the trouble was. A hundred feet away was a thrifty row of trees and I knew where they found their nourishment. Taking a spade I dug down and found the little feeding roots of those trees were so thick that a lump of earth was like a </seg>
            <seg id="p220">220 sponge Immediately I dug a ditch about twelvo feet inside the I putting It down deep enough to cut off all the roots. Then I spaded the ground and had one of the finest gardens in the neighborhood. But would th&lt;&gt; trees Rive up? By no means! The ditch which had been filled must l-e opened again for the whole invading army had passed over to possess the land. When I left the next man let them have .their way and had to give up gardening. We talk about trusts and monopolies. There is a good deal of hu an nature in a huge elm or cottonwood; they want the earth and ill have it. You can do little with lau:l within reach of a vigorous ttonwood. A strong tree will absorb the strength of several town lots and though the tree is on your neighbor's grounds it is getting in its ork on yowis just the same. Neighbors are not always careful in this atter I have known a big tree in front of a man's house to invade it grounds of the neighbors on either side and there was no use In try - g to raise anything. My neighbor plants a tree or a row of them few feet from the line. If I have a rich garden they get over one-haK eir nourishment from my side. If he does not cut them down I must pport them. The only remedy for me is to run a ditch on my land and cut off the invading roots. This is my privilege and it is bettei an a quarrel, for no one can dispute my right. In the meantime the woes on the theory that possession is nine points in law and does ot care a snap for surveyor's lines, fences or warranty deeds. At one time I was speaking on this subject before the horticultural society of Worcester. Mass. After the meeting, the president, that veteran horticulturist. U. B. Baldwin, said: "I was glad you touched on that subject for here is an illustration: 1 had a row of apple trees which of course were throwing out their roots for sustenance In every direction. Some distance from the row I had occasion to dig a trench and fill it with manure well mixed with earth for a row of pieplant. A year or two after I bad occasion to dig out the trees and to my amaze ment I found thos-e roots once headed in another direction had turned. some going under the trees and some beside them, the whole root sys tern intent on getting to that trench." That was wonderful and shows a degree of intelligence worthy of the animal kingdom. What Instinct guides that great army of foragers in their quest for food? Who told them of that trench that they made such haste to reach It?

But they do not falter. Every day the cherries grow larger and larger. But where do they find that rich tissue with which each one la wrapped until the whole tree is one vast bouquet of beauty. A stupendous flower touched and painted by unseen fingers. I have known a man to gather seven bushels of those beautiful cherries from a single tree. How much hard work was done to reach splendid results. There is the strawberry. Did you ever see such a diligent little toiler. Just watch that plant; consider the berries, how they grow; invisible machinery is at work to turn out "God's best." The fruit might be of the color of cobble stones — no, it must not only be luscious, but lovely in color and form. It must be complete, and there is a ball of delicate juices wrapped in tissue of glowing red which makes the mouth water to think of it, and Just think how that little plant has to work to turn out a dozen or two of those wonderful berries fit for a king's table.

Between the bark and the wood there is a highway of commerce. You put your hand on it. and you do not feel the rush of enterprise, the coming and the going, and when the golden autumn comes on that noble tree there are thirty bushels of the choicest fruit — perfect in form as if turned out by the most intricate machinery, with a coloring such as only artist nature can paint.

Save a few seed pods and plant them, -haps you may get an improvement on the parent plant. Once you get prested in hybridizing, it is very fascinating. Variation from type is uncommon. And it is due entirely to cultivation and to the patient I systematic efforts by hybridizers that the fruits as well as the flow of today, have reached their high standard of excellence. Not b&gt; ating fruits or flowers. Man has never, nor will he ever, create a it or a flower. I We may take the wild or natural types and by proper selection, cai encouragement of the desirable qualities and as careful discarding undesirable ones from generation to generation, lead a fruit or flow far away from its original form that it will appear to be entirely d ent. It is in this way that from the Pyrus malus. or wild crabappl nd growing naturally in most parts of Europe and the United States e come all the magnificent varieties of apples grown today. From th nthus Caryophyllus or Divine flower comes not only all the dlfferen ts of carnation grown by florists of today, but the clove pinks, th &gt;et Williams, the Marguerite pinks, the garden pinks, etc. </seg>

Sometimes, in a highly developed variety, a dormant quality will awaken and then we have what Is commonly known as a sport. This may be vastly different in color, or form, or size, or habit of growth, or quality, or to some extent in some, or all, of these from the parent plant But whether a new variety is a sport or the result of haphazard cross fertilization, or the result of years or even hundreds of years of hybridiz - tand careful selection, it was there all the time and only needed the er combination to bring it to light. Though man has, and will no doutt continue to the end of time, to improve the fruits and flowers, he is none the less a benefactor who gives part of his life often without receiving even the reward of appreciation, that we may enjoy a more beautiful flower or a better fruit. ORCHARD AND GARDEN SUGGESTIONS. C. O. MARSHALL. PICKING AND MARKETING FKVIT. The complaint made by farmers and amateur fruit growers that there is no market for fruit when a crop is produced is very common in east - ern Nebraska. That these conditions do exist to some extent is a fact, and the fault usually lies with the producers. They load the market with inferior fruit packed in almost any kind of box or basket, and one commission merchant tell of receiving one consignment of plums put up in grain sacks. The majority of growers seem to think that if they get the fruit into the hands of the merchant that is all that is required of them; the con - dition of the fruit does not enter into their calculations and they expect to receive prices for first class carefully packed fruit when their fruit is second class and thrown together. Small fruits are very often picked when the fields are too wet to take a team into the fields and some of the fruit is over-ripe while some is picked too green. This makes a bad appearing package of fruit and one that must be used immediately or it will spoil. A few over-ripe berries in each box will spoil the whole crate in twenty-four hours if not put on ice. </seg>

One man was careful in picking; and grading his fruit, throwing out all imperfect and over - ripe plums and put them up in a neat, attractive way, while the other took them as they came in from picking and threw them in his wagon on some hay which was thoroughly mixeil with them before reachine t Apples are handled about the same as the fruits already mentioned, the first plac very few apples in Nebraska are sprayed and are usu - ' wormy and scabby, which spoils the quality and appearance of the It. Then when picking time comes windfalls and all are thrown to - iler and either put in sacks or thrown loose in the wagon box ant led to market. Often when the trees, bear a crop of choice apples t would bring a good price on the market if carefully picked and de&lt;l, they are shaken off and bruited, which greatly hinders their The appearance of fruit is what sells it. The large, coarse red apple will sell on the open market while right beside It apples of much better quality but less attractive in appearance will lay and rot. So it is with all kinds of fruit. The people want &amp;r. article that looks well and the api&gt;earance seems to more than make up for the lack of quality with a great many people. Fruit 'of whatever kind should be packed In new. uniformed-sized packages and the fruit sorted and graded as to size, color and ripeness so far as possible, and full measure given. I There are of course a great many farmers and amateur growers braska who do not think it pays to buy baskets or boxes specially f imall amount of surplus fruit which they might have. And in son es it might not pay, but it always pars to grade the fruit and thro all imperfect specimens. A bushel basket of No. 1 apples will us r Bell for more money than two bushel baskets of windfalls, culls an id apples all mixed together. The culls and bruised fruit should own out entirely and the sound fruit sorted and placed in at leas &gt; separate packages. The package of Xo. 1 fruit will sell for the to re and the seconds of course will sell cheaper but If they are mixed one package they will all sell at the price of seconds. PBrSIKO THE OKCHARD. tThe proper time to prune is generally conceded to be in early spring I before growth starts. Almost every fruit grower has a system of own in pruning and it does not make a great deal of difference it system is followed if certain points are borne in mind when prun - . In the first place a limb should never be cut unless there is a good son for so doing. With some people pruning Is a habit and trees are ined every so often whether they need it or not. On the other hand, ay of our home orchards are never pruned and the trees grow so com t and close that limbs interfere with one another, the weaker gradu </seg>

When a tree is planted it should be pruned so that it has a well bal - anced head with the limbs well apart on the trunk and with a leader in the center just a little longer than the side limbs. This will prevent a forked tree which is often the result when the renter limb is not left longer and encouraged to stay in the lead. The tree should be pruned each year thereafter, but there should be a reason for every cut made. Where limbs arc crossed and are injuring each other by rubbing one should be taken off: or where two or more limbs are growing parallel and so close that they are interferin&lt; with one another one should be taken out. By going over the orchard annually and pruning in this manner the operator will seldom have occasion to cut out large limbs. The undesir - able limbs are taken off when small and the tree suffers no bad results. When trees are not prunned for a number of years after planting and have a considerable surplus of wood, care should be exercised in getting rid of it. It is sometimes better to cut out only a limited amount each year for two or three years or until the tree is in the shape desired When large limbs are taken off, as is necessary in pruning a neglected orchard, it should be done preferably in the spring and each wound should be coated over with paint or grafting wax. But when the or - chard is pruned each year it will be necessary to take out very few large limbs and bad results will not be obtained by pruning at other seasons. They may be pruned when the owner is not busy with the farm work if severe pruning is not practiced. Better at any time of year than not at all. Grapes are pruned mostly in late February and March. They should not be pruned except when dormant and many preter early spring to late fall as all immature wood is usually killed during the winter and can be pruned off leaving only strong, live, vigorous buds. Many vineyards are not pruned severely enough for the best results. When too much bearing wood is left some varieties set more fruit than they can mature properly and as a result it is of poor quality. Grapes, more than moat other fruits, require judicious pruning for the best results. There are a number of different varieties, many of which require dif - ferent training than others. Some growers prune each new cane back to two or three buds and others take out a portion of the new canes en - tirely, leaving other canes almost their full length. Whichever system is followed it is well, with most varieties grown in Nebraska, to leave only a small part of the last season's growth, possibly enough buds to average two or three for each cane that' grew the previous season. MORK SEVERE PRUXIXO OF THE APPLE. By studying the tree at the time the fruit is picked much can be noted as to the requirements of the tree. At this time the need of pruning Is </seg>
            <seg id="p230">230 more apparent than at any other. The picker Is first impressed with th«" act that the heads of many trees are so thick that it is almost Impossible o get through to gather the fruit. He also notes that the shade is so ense in places that sunlight cannot get to the fruit and that is is not coloring as it should be. And with some varieties he notices that on account of too much wood the tree has set more fruit than it can pos bly mature properly. If the season furnishes plenty of moisture the niit grows fairly large but the vigor of the tree is so impaired that the Mowing year no crop, or least a light crop, is produced. If the season dry the fruit does not grow large and much of it is too small to place n the market and is good only for cider and vinegar. The proper way to prune an apple tree has been much discussed at horticultural meetings in this section and many different arguments have been advanced both for and against severe pruning. Some of the pioneer apple men in the state have held that very little If any pruning snould be given apple trees, but this theory Is now considered out of date by all up-to-date growers. All agree that pruning is necessary to the production of good apples but all do not agree on the severity of thr operation. A rule that we have repeated to many that we thought about right to follow in pruning is: "Start vhen the tree is young and keep all water sprouts cut out and thin out the limbs so that they do not rub one against the other.' This method will probably prolong the life of the tree but we are now of the opinion that the value and quality of the fruit grown on trees receiving such treatment does not equal that grown on trees pruned more severely but carefully, provided all large wounds are carefully painted and spraying is practiced to hold in check fungous '&lt;!— sim of the tree as well as the fruit We have studied orchards where very severe pruning has been prac ticed and compared the results with those where light pruning has bee the rule and have been making some tests ourselves of late and the mo we study the question the more we favor rather severe pruning. Las August we visited two orchards in the southeastern part of the state, on having had practically no pruning since planting while the other has bee pruned severely. These orchards are about the same age and are locatec but seven miles apart on similar land. The severely pruned orchard has had better culture than the other but both were sprayed the presen ■••■on. The bodies of the trees were about the same size in each orcharc but the tops of the pruned trees contained only from one-half to tw thirds as much wood as the unpruned trees. There was no comparison be tween the fruit in the two orchards. The pruned trees were carrying full load of fruit well above the average in size and very even while th unpruned trees were carrying numberless stunted apples that never wi be worth anything except for cider. § Growers in the famous fruit districts of the west thin out and clip k until the trees look like skeletons with not enough bearing wood to duce anything, apparently, yet they get large crops of fancy apples — </seg>
            <seg id="p231">231 every one large. It is probably necessary to reduce the bearing surface more in the West than in Nebraska as the soil is not so rich but the Nebraska growers will undoubtedly produce more and better fruit by following the Western system in a modified way. Rather severe pruning must be practiced to produce large fruit and large, attractive fruit Is what sells on the fancy markets. Elt is true that the life of the tree may be shortened by severe prun but it is certainly a great help toward producing fancy fruit while tree lasts and a short lived tree that produces the "goods" is more uable than a long lived tree that pi educes occasionally a little good it and a whole lot of second class stuff and culls. If severe pruning practiced, however, it must be carefully done, every wound must be Mediately painted and kept painted until it heals and thorough spray - and cultivation must be practiced. OUAKDON AI.AlNvr WINTER IN.HRY. Trees and plants should not be overtaken by winter with dry soil about the roots. Trees evaporate water at all times and there must be a supply about the roots in winter as well as summer. Much winter killing of trees and plants in the west is due to the dryness of the soil and atmosphere rather than the extreme cold. Evaporation of water from the parts above ground often takes place faster than water can be supplied and those parts dry out, resulting in injury called winter killing. With some plants the roots suffer equally as much as the tops when the soil is dry about them and the freezing is severe. Dry winters are not the exception in Nebraska, at least in a great part of the state, and it is often advisable to water thoroughly newly set plants and trees or those that are not extremely hardy just before the ground freezes. A mulch of some kind will help very materially to keep the ground from drying out during tn-? winter months. Among our important fruits that are subject to winter injury in a reat part of the state are peaches, grapes, raspberries and blackberries, rapes may be protected quite easily by laying the canes down and vrring with earth or coarse litter such as cane or corn fodder. A eavy covering is not essential; just enough to check evaporation and keep the canes from alternate freezing and thawing. It is not the vere cold alone that injures them, but that together with the drynem the soil and air and the freezing and thawing, does considerable milage except in the south and oast parts of the state. Raspberries and ackberries are more difficult to protect by covering although rasp - berries are sometimes laid down and covered with soil without much ouble. If planted in a pocket in the grove or between the orchard ees where they are protected against the drying winds and partially taded. winter Injury Is not so apt to result. </seg>
            <seg id="p232">232 RABBIT nWTTBY I Often much damage is done by rabbits during the winter month*. la is especially true when the ground is covered with snow for some «. With the first snow-fall of early \» inter, however, rabbits are liable begin gnawing the bark from fruit trees and so long as this normal d supply is covered with snow they are apt to feed on the tender bark young fruit trees. It is no unusual thing for a young orchard to be irely ruined in a few nights by rabbits girdling the trees following hist snowtali. Special care should be taken to see that nil young hard trees are protected against rabbits before snow comes. And in n»wer parts of Nebraska where none of the legumes or grasses that p green late in the season are grown, it is well to have trees protected n before heavy snow is expected as the rabbits will sometimes attack tree when the ground is bare on account of there being no green etatlon in the community on which to feed. t Different means of protecting the trees are employed. Killing the bits or trapping as many as possible will of course help some. One two good dogs about a place when the orchard is near the house 1 often keep tbe rabbits frightened Hway. As long as a healthy rabbit eft in the community, however, the trees are in danger and in addition the suggestions above it is advisable to give each individual tree Good resulu are obtained by using wrappers of various kinds. In the small home orchard four or five corn stalks set up with cords do \trj well. This method is a cheap ore. In Nebraska corn stalks are always to be had and although more time is required to put them in place than some of the patent protectors a small orchard can be attended to in a short time. Pieces of screen wire cut in strips six inches wide by eighteen or twenty inches long and wrapped around the trunk and tied also make good protectors. The patent wooden veneer wrappers which can be bought for $4 or io per thousand are used quite extensively by commercial orchardists These are soaked in warm water for a few hours when they can be wrapped around the tree and tied with cord or wire. Some of them have a coating of tar applied at one end which gives them more durability when in contact with the moist earth. They will last about three years and need not be taken of)' unless the tree needs more room for enlarge - ment. If set two or three inches in lht ground it is claimed that they arc a protection to some extent against borers. Trees subject to sun scald are also said to escape when protected with this kind of a wrapper and that newly set trees will make better growth for a year or two when protected against the hot sun and intense heat. Bandages of cheese cloth or other cheap cotton materials are often used. The material is torn in strips two or three inches wide and wrapped just as a bandage is wrapped around an injured limb. The last end of the bandage may be split and tied around the tree to hold th» wrapper in place. These bandages will usually last two years. </seg>

The methods of protecting discussed will do no good in cases of this kind Suitable wind-breaks should be provided to catch and hold the snow be tit reaches the orchard, otherwise the trees are liable to Injury from rabbits and the snow which when settling is apt to split the trees.

The above mentioned seeds should be sown in the hotbed and transplanted before planting to permanent quarters. Phlox drunimondi and verbenas must not be omitted from this list. Salvia or scarlet sage as it is sometimes called is one of our most useful bedding plants. The seed if sown at once will make small plants by bedding out time which, by the way, should not be much before the 20th of May. Many persons prefer buying these plants from the florist. When ordering, ask for such early flowering varieties as Zurich (dwarf and very early flowering). Splendens. Bonfire and Clara Redman. Omit the gigantic varieties as they are very late in flowering. Poppies, sweet alyssum and dianthus can be sown into permanent beds at once. If early (-annas are desired these can be divided and started in hot frames, using sandy loam. Dormant bulbs of dahlias and cannas can be planted the last week in April or the first week In May. Plant quite liberally of Gladioli Brenchleyensis. The corms are not expensive of this variety. Higher priced ones but very good are Ameri - can pink, Princeps. the largest flowered gladiolus (scarlet crimson). Mrs. Francis King (flamingo pink) and Augusta (white). April is not too late to plant perennials. Any clumps of coreopsis, hardy phlox or Shasta daisies can be divided. Oftentimes these clumps hare become too large and the flowers are smaller each season. By dividing and resetting every three or four years they are greatly benefited. Gradually remove the winter mulch from roses, herbaceous plants and the spring flowering bulbs that were planted in the fall. IMPORTANCE OF MULCHING AND PBOPER WATERING ON BEDDINC P] During the hot, dry weather it is impossible to attain good results without watering. What I mean by watering is not standing back from your flower bed ten or fifteen feet, spraying the water overhead for five minutes, thinking you have given the plants enough. Take the nozzle off your hose and get over your plants, watering the ground not the flowers. Nothing will spoil the looks of your canna and geranium blooms so much as to water them overhead, especially when the sun is shining bright. Els. to give that beautiful sub-tropical effect so much desired ve an abundance of water and very rich soil. We frequently remark "What is the matter with my salvia bed, it Is not ;?" If an early flowering variety has been planted, then I always say give them more water. This plant, from my experience, requires the ground to be saturated. Again, some people ask, "Is It not harmful to water flowers during the heat of the day?" My answer Is "No, but do not water overhead." </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 Mulching I consider nearly as important as watering. About two or iree weeks after planting give your beds a good top dressing of well ecayed barnyard manure three or four inches thick well pulverized. his mulch will lie found a great help to encourage growth and bloom. On account of our short growing season, very hot and bright sunshine. ur I cilding plants should be planted closer than It is generally done give immediate effects. The importance of this method, I noticed par - ularly on our place this summer. One variety of canna was planted rther apart than usual and at this date too much bare ground Is U\ Of course it will look all right by September, but who liket to ait that long for a bed to reach i»-rfeition? With good rich soil, liberally atered and heavily mulched close platting is not injurious, but better nd more pleasing effects are attaint"! earlier in the season instead of ailing till two or three weeks before frost. Another plant that appreciates plenty of water is the hardy phlox. The many complaints I have heard about this plant not doing well this season (1911), are undoubtedly due to the lack of water. The phlox on the campus are looking magnificent, due to plenty of moisture. This plant may be hardy but it cannot be neglected and then be expected to give satisfaction. TILLAGE OF ORCHARDS. MI B, MARSHAL!, LINtorV I The tillage of orchards, although often neglected, is widely recog ed as beneficial and especially in regions of dry summers and cold iters. Cultivation impro\es the physical condition of the soil, aug - its the chemical activities and conserves the noil moistures. The sod mulch common in many Nebraska orchards robs the trees of at food and harbors a number of orchard 1 ests. In experiments 're tilled and sod mulched orchards were compared, it has been id that there is a larger yield of larger apples in the tilled orchard that they keep longer, have better quality, the trees and fruit are e uniform, the trees are in better health, the leaves come out earlier he spring and tail later in the' fall aud that there is less dead wood n in the sod mulch. The sod mulched apples are more highly colored, lure one to three weeks earlier and the trees are more shallow tori-li-irdists who have practiced thorough cultivation have found th y do not have as much loss from the falling of immature fruit during dry seasons as those who have not cultivated or have only cul ed a few times. If the season is dry the orchard should be cul ed quite frequently and later than usual so that enough molstu 1 be conserved to mature the fruit crop. One prominent fruit grow Nebraska, reports that he cultivated fourteen times last season. N inite number of cultivations can be set, as it will vary with th tion of the state in which the orchard is located and the amount an e of the rainfall during the season. </seg>
            <seg id="p237">237 air, warm the soil up quicker, and drain off the excess of moisture through evaporation. The plowed layer prevents evaporation from lower depths and increases the moisture holding capacity of the soil in work tne it. The plowing should be fairly deep so that the surface roots are • nt and encouraged to penetrate deeper. When trees are allowed to form surface roots they are not well protected from freezes and the moisture ■apply is not as regular as at deeper depths. Shallow rooted trees often -unVr to quite an extent during dry seasons. This is where the straw mulch is also faulty, as there is usually a great amount of moisture near the surface of the soil, and the roots spread out here and oftea the trees suffer for lack of moisture during dry seasons Crops are often plumed in the young orchards between the rows. Small grains should never be planted, unless they are to be plowed under before they mature. Only crops which necessitate cultivation should De used, as they require just tho conditions for th^ best growth of young trees. The same crops should never be grown more than two years in sin cession. The cultivation should cease the latter part of July, ordi - narily, so that the v ood may rii&gt;m and be prepared to meet winter con Horticultural investigators quite generally agree that clean tillage throughout the whole season is not the best orchard practice. It has a tendency to deplete the humus contents of soils, which causes them to pack and often bake, is responsible for considerable soil erosion in hilly sections, and frequently ke°ps the trees in a growing condition so late that the wood does not ripen for winter. In order to remedy these con - ditions a cover crop may be sown about the first of August. Thus the term "tillage," as applied to orchards, has come to mean thorough cul - tivation during the early part of the season followed hy a cover crop, which is plowed under the following spring. A cover crop is a crop grown during the late summer and tall for the benefit of the orchard. It is not to be removed but is left on the ground until spring. There is a number of crops which may be grown but some are tender and are injured or killed by early frosts, such as cane or millet. These are usually considered the best as they cease growth Kh the flrst frost and allow the soil to become rather moist again for ter condition*. In cultivating the orchard during the summer, an orchard disc should be used. This is a small disc that may be set to throw the dirt in or out. By using this and throwing the dirt toward the trees at one cultivation and drawing it away the next, the ground can be kept quite level. Other implements necessary for cultivation are a plow and a B orchard requires fertilizer the same as field crops do. Barnyard may be applied at any time. The orchardlst should watch his id if they do not look thrifty and make a good growth each &gt;y undoubtedly need manure or more cultivation. </seg>
            <seg id="p238">238 PRUNING THE ORNAMENTAL TREES AND SHRUBS J. J. THOBNBEK, IN ItETTF.K KHl'IT. I There are few ornamental trees or shrubs that do not require occa aal pruning or trimming at one season or another for their bes &gt;wth and development. The extent of this, with certain exceptions never, is often quite limited, and in this respect ornamental plan rer from fruit trees. Pruning is usually given too little attention b amateur planter and home-maker, with the result that the task ! off as long as possible to be finally disposed of with little or n ethought at one "fell stroke," as it were, of to? ax or saw, regardless results. It goes without saying that all newly set trees should have their branches cut back to correspond with the loss of roots incident to trans - planting, though this does not mean that such trees are to be reduced to poles. At planting time all mutilated parts of roots should be re - moved, and on trees that are of considerable size, i. p., eight feet or so high, the main limbs should be cut back within twelve or fourteen in' hes of the trunk, the leader, of course, being retained. A sufficient number, varying with the kind of tree, of the more vigorous of these main limbs are left to form the framework of the crown. These should be disposed at nearly equal angles about the trunk, and not lie in the same horizontal plane. If handled in this manner such trees as •ah, locust, mulberry, cot ton wood and sycamore will need lltle further attention for some years, and will usually develop Into pleasing, sym metrical forms. When small trees are used considerable pruning is often needed in first few years after planting on account of excessive growth through climatic conditions, cultivation, enriched soil or extra water supply. This growth commonly manifested itself in water-sprouts, over •levelopment of the liead, causing top-heaviness and leaning, or in extra giowth iu occasional vigorous branches in one part of the plant or another, all of which tend to destroy the otherwise natural form or symmetry of the tree, unless 'orrected by careful pruning. The much planted and Justly popular i&gt;epp-r tree is a notable example of the above, due partly to its soft, yielding wood. On this account, during its first years, cutting back and thinning out of the crown is necessary in addition, to secure bracing of the trunk. It is justifiable at times to resort to topping in the case of shade trees to induce a denser growth, or where trees have become too tall to be in harmony with their surroundings, though this latter condition is ot common in our region of extremely strong light, and sometimes •ant supply of plant food.

Likewise those that are non - mmetrical can be worked into symmetrical trees by removing the bnormal parts, though such treatment is more effective in the earlier ainlng of the plant. As trees get older it becomes necessary to cut it some of the Inner branches, to open up the crown, thereby over mlng a, crowded or bushy appearance, and providing for continued mmetrieal development of the tree as a whole. The numerous dead nibs in the centers of even healthy trees are excellent witnesses to this THE FARM CANNING FACTORY. AN ME IIOKKRATH, IN FRl'ITMAN AND GARDKNKK. "Sell what you can and can what you can't," has become the motto 01 many truck growers. That is. all surplus vegetables and fruits which cannot at once be disposed of to a good advantage are preserved for future sale on a better market. This is done by canning the surplus at home, and in such a way as to meet the requirements of the market and at the same time command a good price. I The process of canning is very simple, and the machine used la ther complicated nor expensive, which places this industry within reach of anyone desirous of trying it. Asparagus, string beans, peas, sweet corn, squash, beets. sw&gt; i aloes, tomatoes, kraut, apples, peaches, pears, berries and chicken, beef and old-fashioned lye hominy are all included in the list of things, canned for home use. Tomatoes, string beans and peaches are the chief products of the farm canning factory that are put up for the market. ;&gt;cars and berries being a close second. kThe fruit and vegetables, being gathered fr^th from orchard and den. and packed, sealed and cooked before they are allowed to eriorate, retain their flavor unexcelled. The fruir and vegetables are packed in the cans by hand while raw, the can is at once sealed and submerged in boiling; water and left to cook the required length of time to insure its contents keeping. The length of time required to properly cook the contents of the can varies from six minutes for strawberries to five hours for sweet corn, in order that the heat may thoroughly destroy the germs that produce fermentation. I In canning peaches, pears, strawberries and raspberries, a syrup ie by dissolving granulated sugar in water is used to fill in after the it is packed in the can. I A weak salt brine is used for sweet corn, peas and string beans, just ugh being used to season to taste, but no other preservative of any </seg>

This insures all home-canned goods complying with the food law, because they are free from any injurious acids, coal Ur or deleterious ingredient* of any kind. I Being parked by hand, each can is well filled, and as all rotten, rripe and imperfect fruit and vegetables are rejected, honest weight I first class goods are the rule. I Southern farmers have found the canning machine a means of re - ing the acreage of the cotton crop, and at the same time bringing m good money. As one Southern farmer has aptly said: "More to toes and less cotton means more money and less debt for the South - farmer." In fact, the canning industry has grown to such dlmen is in the South that in the state of Texas they have organized the Las Home Canners' Association. A state business agent has been lointed to purchase cans in carload lots, and all other supplies at olesale ratfti. He will also solicit orders for their canned goods, to shipped in carload lots. I A uniform label will be used on all their canned goods, and each tuber will be given a number, which he will stamp on the labels on all goods he packs. kBach member will be required to guarantee the quality of his ned goods. When an individual member needs a supply of cans, he I notify the local agent of the association, who will in turn forward order to the state business agent. A farmer in Massac county, Illinois, purchased a canning machine last year and put up a variety of fruits and vegetables. An epicure living in an adjoining slate had been importing all his canned goods and even his Irish potatoes direct from Germany. Through mutual friends he learned of this Illinois farmer's home* aimed goods and decided to yy them. Consequently he ordered a sample, but without intimating his intended experiment. When the goods were received he subjected them to the most crucial test to discover any acids or &lt;olorinp mattir. The result was so satifactory that he promptly ordered several cases for his own table use. The profits to be derived from canning fruits and vegetables for market vary with the persons doing the tanning, the locality, cost of labor, and ih&lt; market facilities, just the same as in all other farm products. tTho cost of i ins, solder-tipped lids, soldering luid and solder, readv ed and crated, f. o. b. at the factory will cost from $18 to $20 per ►0 for two pound cans and from $21 to $23 per 1.000 for three pound k Isabels cost from 90 cents to $10 per thousand, according to th&gt;: lit &gt;- and the quantity used, but $2 per thousand is an average mini m price.

Few flowers are so satisfactory or can be so easily and cheaply secured as some of these bulbs. They can be procured from any of the leading seedsmen or ornamental nurserymen at a cost of from $1 to $10 per 100, depending on the kinds. Since they may be had so cheaply and require so little attention after planting no lover of flowers can afford to be without them. They may be used to good effect in bed or for borders. They are perfectly hardy and will grow and bloom for anybody. </seg>

Tulips and other bulbs of this class do beet in a rich, sandy loam, well rotted manure being used for fertilizer. The manure, however, should not come in too close contact with the bulbs as it sometimes causes decay. The planting should be done carefully, getting the bulbs from two to five inches below the surface. After the ground is frozen three or four inches deep a top droning of leaves or coarse manure should be applied to keep the ground from drying out and to prevent alternate freezing and thawing. This covering should be taken off in the spring Just as growth peeps through, leaving just a thin cover on the ground. Other hardy and satisfactory bulbs to plant are hyacinths, narcissus crocus and most of the lilies. The hyacinths and lilies should have more sand mixed in the soil as these rot more readily than the others. They should be planted deeper than the tulips, the hyacinths four or five inches deep and the large growing lilies about eight inches deep. PRUNING SHADE TREES AND ORNAMENTALS At certain seasons of the year it seems that many people have a desire to have their shade and ornamental tress cut to pieces and em - ploy the first man who professes to know anything about pruning to do the job for them. Often this man is not an experienced tree trimmer. bat a tree butcher who not only mars the beauty of the trees by his cutting and slashing but impairs the health of the tree as well. Much of this is done each year in the cities and larger towns of the state. The proper pruning of a tree or shrub requires good judgment on th art of the workman. There should be a good reason for removing eve mb before it is touched with the knife or saw. Pruning, as practiced 7 some, has the effect to render trees and shrubs unnatural and i egant. Every tree, shrub and plant has a habit of growth peculiar tgelf. and this very peculiarity is one of its beauties. By pruning a trees into regular shapes their identity is destroyed. The prunin knife, therefore, should be handled with judgment and care to assi nature. Straggling branches should be removed, the head should be tinned when too dense and the dead woods removed. When more seve uning than this is practiced there should be special reasons for doin I Different shrubs have their peculiarities of habit and foliage, and we &gt;uld aim to preserve them as far as possible. Judicious pruning to serve health and vigor is necessary, but trimming all kinds of shrub* ) one form shows a lack of appreciation for natural beauty. Wlegelas. ck orange and other shrubs that flower on the wood of the preceding r's growth should be pruned in the summer after they have finished rering. Those that bloom on the new growth may be pruned in the iter or spring. I Evergreens, except those planted in hedge rows, should never be rhed with a pruning knife except occasionally to thicken the growth to preserve the shape. </seg>
            <seg id="p243">243 HOTBBDB AND COLD FRAMB8. HOTBKDS AND COLD FRAMES. C. 0. MARSHALL. Hotbeds are devices supplied with bottom heat from fermenting manure or other source for the purpose of growing plants out of season or for forcing them into a quick growth. More farmers, fruit growers, and others growing garden vegetables for the home should make use of the hotbed. It enables the gardener to start cabbage, tomatoes, sweet potatoes and other plants into growth early in the spring, even when the ground is yet frozen solid, so that when the danger of frosts out-of Eis past the plants may be transplanted in the garden and with the that they already have they come on early and supply the home regetables much earlier in the season. Euch plants as tomatoes are started in hotbeds by market gardeners early, and then transplanted in coldframes, which are of similar truction but without artifioal heat. The plants require a gradual process of hardening off before being transplanted to the garden and this is done in coldframes, while the weather is yet too cold for outdoor planting. By the time the weather is suitable for garden planting many Ehave attained considerable size and have begun to bloom. This enables the grower to place his product on the market very early season which assures him good returns. To construct a hotbed the soil should be excavated about two and one-half feet deep, six feet wide north and south and long enough to accommodate the number of sash to be used. The most common size of hotbed sash is three feet by six feet, The excavation, preferably, should be made on the south side of some building or other protection where the sun's rays are not obstructed. A frame should be built, using strong boards set on edge extending from slightly below the surface of the ground to about six Inches above the ground on the south side and twelve inches on ths north side. The end board should be cut slanting to fit Strong stakes, extending to the bottom of the pit, should be placed in the corners of the frame and at intervals of about three feet on the sides and ends and securely nailed to the frame of boards. Light cross bars may be placed across at proper Intervals to keep the frame from spreading or being pressed inward. Sash may be made to order or se cured from seedsmen and dealers in garden supplies. Pie pit should be filled with fresh manure containing much straw the horse barn. It should be spread evenly and firmed down well, extending to within six inches of the level of the ground. Rich garden loam should then be placed over the manure to a depth of six inches, and a liberal amount of water supplied so the manure is thor - oughly wet to the bottom. In four or five days the manure should begin to ferment and give off heat. The hotbed will require regular watering every day or two, depending on the weather. On warm, sunny days the sash may be raised to let in fresh air to prevent over-heating. If severely cold weather Is expected at any time the outside of the frame should be covered with straw or old carpets. </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 SPRAYING CALENDAR. LTh&lt; following calendar tor making the different applications in spray - apples is civen in Nebraska Experiment Station bulletin 119: In ordinary years, it will be necessary to spray four or five times during late spring and summer with one or another of these spray materials. The kinds of spray used and the times of applying them may be summarized as follows: 1st. After the cluster buds of the apples open but before the indi - vidual flower buds ?xpand — using Bordeaux mixture or lime-sulfur. N&lt;&gt; pol«m. 2d. Just after the petals have fallen but before the calyx cups have closed — using either Bordeaux or lime-sulfur, plus the Insect poison. 3d. Three weeks after the petals have fallen — using the same ma terials as for the second spraying. 4th. Seven weeks after the third spraying — using the insecticide EThe lirsi spraying is chiefly for apple scab and of course for this rdeaux or lime-sulfur alone is sufficient. If the canker-worm should working on the foliage of the trees at the time of the first spraying ich docs occasionally happen, the poison should be added to the igiclde. Tho first spraying is given just as the leaves are beginning develop. Because of the open condition of the trees at this time, the aylng can thoroughly coat thr twigs and expanding leaves with sprav. ich should be done. , • The second spraying, given when the petals hive fallen, is the mog' important of all applications. It is always the most important spray - ing for the codling moth, and in a good many years it is the chief one for apple scab. This second application should also be the heaviest one given. As the trees have a mass of foliage that must be thoroughly ■ overed, we shall find the spray dripping from the trees after the job is completed. Under normal conditions the first flowers will be the ones to set fruit. For that reason the second spraying may have to be giver, before the petals have fallen from the late blossoms in order to fill the closing calyx cups with the poison. However, a too early spraying is undesirable, as it would kill many bees which are pollinating the bios sotns. The reason for thoroughly filling the calyx cups is that a large number of the codling moth larvae will enter the apple through the ■ alyx. In careful tests, it has been found that fully 76 to 80 per cent of the larvae enter in that manner. Although the eggs of the moths are not hatched until two or three weeks after the second spraying, if a sufficient amount of spray has been placed in the calyces at this second spraying, enough will be held there to destroy the larvae as they enter. Strong Bordeaux at this spraying will be apt to "russet" the fruits. For that reason, a weak solution, 2 lbs. of copper sulfate to 50 gallons of water, is preferable, or, even better, one or the other of the lime-sulfur .sprays described elsewhere in this bulletin. </seg>
            <seg id="p245">245 HAVE FI.OWEKM THE SEASON THROUGH. &gt; The third spraying is applied just about the time the eggs of the first brood of codling moths are hatching. By coating the foliage and fruits with s;iray at this time, a large number of the worms will be killed. This spraying Is especially valuable for destroying those larvae which may attempt to enter the appk at some point other than the calyx. Apple scab largely spreads about the time of the first, second, an third sprayings. If the weather is hot and dry during this period, th germination of the spores is retarded, and in such a season apple sia dors little damage; but if we have moist conditions the disease thrives As we do not know in advance what weather conditions will be. t! only safe plan to follow is always to make the first three sprayings wit the fungicide. As scab is not developing when the fourth spraying made, it means a waste of material to apply Bordeaux. Lead arsenat mixed at the rate of l'.j pounds to 50 gallons of water, should be use at this time,— which is for controlling the second brood of the codlin moths. Carefully mixing and applying the second and third sprayin means that comparatively few larvae of the first brood will escape hence the second brood would be few and would cause but little troub For that reason, it behooves the orchardist to be unusually careful wi the earlier sprayings. At times in the past, a fifth spraying has bee recommended, but certainly it is not very essential providing the earll sprayings have been properly given. Where a fifth spraying is mad It should be with the insecticide alone and should be applied three four weeks after the fourth. HAVE FLOWERS THE SEASON' THROUGH. IIAKKIBO.N. YOKK. Suppose you have a humble home. You might better go to work and adorn it than to wait for a larger one. Suppose, for instance, you get peonies. They continue a long while in bloom. We have many varieties. For some we have paid $"&gt; and even $10. They multiply very fast and from a small planting in ten years there ought to be something like a thousand. Then, there is the syringa and the honeysuckle. There is one which Is a marvelous plant from Manchuria. It Is very vigorous and grows up straight and is compact. Suppose you have a flower garden and sur round it with varieties of honeysuckle. There are many beautiful flow - ers that will grow readily with very little care. Then, there are those phloxes. I have spent many years in the grow - ing of phloxes and have published a work on phloxes so that if any man, woman or child cares to they can produce even finer ones than I hare. I have succeeded in getting thirty different varieties. I have made instructions so plain in this manual that any child, even, if direction* are followed, can grow them with success.

With a little care and research you will get at the fountain head. I This study is one of the most beautiful experience that you can have 1 you don't know when to stop. You are in the very land of Elysium, land of delight. Commence raising phlox and when you get some r creations you are fascinated with them. You look at them one i and the next day, and then you raise some more and you want to it these, and then you are in the edge of the unknown and out of the Isible. and there comes to you forms of loveliness which your eye has er seen, and you can originate new ones. You don't h'ave to pay a b price for them. Perhaps 26 or 50 cents apiece will give you a good ■t. Don't rest with one or two specimens. A lady once said she only ited three. I said you want more. Plant an abundance. Surround yourself with plenty of these things. You can so arrange it so as to have a procession of beauty from early spring until late fall. First of all, the tulips; then comes the columbines which use up all the colors of the rainbow; then those oriental poppies, mixed with some single flowers, 9 Inches across with their bloom of scarlet; then a little further on the peonies come In bloom, vlelng with each other as if on dress parade. Go out and see them drill; they are like so many maidens each trying to see which can put on the most beauti - ful garment as if preparing for their nuptials. These annuals are very beautiful. When you plant them they stay planted. You can depend upon them year after year. Next in this beauty procession comes the phloxes. They commence blooming in July and continue blooming until frost. So all along your pathway you can follow up this procession of beauti - ful blooming flowers by a tasteful arrangement of the lawn. Thirty-five dollars will fix up that yard and make It a fit accompaniment to the lowers to make that home beautiful, and in that way will have the appearance of a two or three thousand dollar mansion. A house will begin to depreciate, and if you put in fine furniture it will soon begin to depreciate and afterwards will be second-hand. But if you plant trees and adorn your lot and lawn it will ever be on the increase in value. I have known many instances where the owner would not accept $100 apiece for his trees, and some trees that $500 would not buy. A lot and a home under these conditions grows in value. Surrounded by such an ideal home you win not want any vacation — the only vacation you will want will be time to go out and enjoy them. THE PEONY t litre we come to the queen of flowers.

It has good strong stems and the flowers are fine keepers. It is easily grown and is a fine flower, giving you the best returns for the least trouble of any of our favorites. A firm in England has picked out choice specimens and by selection has secured at least fifty varieties. We have paid a good price for some of them and they were not satisfactory. If you want to improve them and raise new sorts, do it yourself. You will find no two exactly alike. Some will be large and full and the others somewhat meager.

Fulva (Tawny Day lily) gives bronzy tinted yellow blooms late in the season. Flora Plena is a type of the above with double flowers. Gold Dust has large yellow flowers late in the season. Middendorfi is a beautiful deep yellow variety. Thunbergii is the latest of all, bringing up the rear. So with this charming family you have blooms from June until September. In propagating pull the clumps apart and you find individual plants which you plant Hibiscus (Rose Mallow). t These are very robust plants which kill to the ground like peony tops ry winter and come up strong again in the spring. The plants are ing growing, from three to five feet tall. The tops should be cut down and removed or the next year the plants will have a ragged ap - pearance. The flowers are very large, often five inches across. Their re is in the background. If planted in front of ornamental shrubbery, are very effective. I Golden Bowl, though classed as a perennial, is really an annual and uld be treated as such. We have raised them, but they have been dis - ded. Sow early and they bloom profusely, but the first hard frost kills them, root and all. If dug before frost, they can be carefully stored and they will live over. t Crimson Eye has a snowy white, large beautiful flower, very effective. ; center is deep crimson, which contrasts beautifully with the pure ite. tPalustris is evidently a sport or variation of the same flower. It is a t refined pink with a crimson eye. We are claiming this as our own it Is probably a variation of the old favorite. tMoscheutos (Swamp Rose Mallow). — This is a strong growing plant, wing wild on the borders of our marshes. I think this is a variety wing on the Elkhorn river in Nebraska. The flower is large uniform k, with no deeper color In the center. Militarls is the rankest grower of all, making a strong bushy plant laden with large pink flowers with a very deep red center. An Eastern firm has been making especial efforts to improve these flowers and now have various striking colors called Mallow Marvels. </seg>
            <seg id="p252">252 PROPAGATION You ran make root divisions of very large roots or you can grow them from seed. The best way is to get one or two-year old plants which have long white roots like icicle radishes, when you will have a profusion of flowers the same year, or you can grow them from seed planted in th- - spring after danger of frost is over. Oriental Poppy iPapanek! Many poppies are annuals; we will not treat of these. The marvelous oriental species is a native of Armenia and was introduced in 1714. It has been familiar to American people many years. It is growing in popu - larity and favor with wonderful strides. The flowers are of brilliant flame color, of dazzling splendor, often six to nine inches across. A mass of them is like a miniature sea of fire. They have been known to bloom from the same root for twenty years. They bloom with the peonies and. while the individual flowers do not last but a few days, there is such a succession of them the period of blooming will last for weeks. Inside the flower is some of nature's marvelous painting. There is the immense seed pod surrounded by delicate, tremulous stamens, also patches or squares all done up in jet. Of late years there have been developed strik - ing variations. The Parkmani and Menelick are mahogany. Then we have the Salmon colored and Silver Queen, making a rich and charming variety. As the latter are sports or variations you are not always sure of what you get from seed, so they are as yet quite expensive. It is disappointing to have gorgeous flowers with great seed-pods and not a seed in them. This seems the fate of the highest developed flowers. The great double peony, the perfect carnation and the full massive double rose have reached the limit and seldom reproduce themselves from seed. PROPAGATION. tThey are often multiplied by root division. When a root is several rs old you will find it has divisions which can be separated and Dted. Those that cannot produce are increased in this way. It is a little difficult to grow them from seeds. If we should send out a dozen packages to as many different persons probably not more than one could succeed. Our springs are usually dry and the seeds are very small. Sow them under a lath screen, cover lightly with burlap and water that every night. Watch carefully and when the tiny plants appear take off the burlap at night and not expose the tender things to the full light of day at once. Keep on your lath screen and water as The Plattcodon. t These are very hardy and the flowers are beautiful as well as good ipers. The name is compounded from platys (broad) and kodon (bell) : ad or wide open bell. They grow readily from seeds and the plants </seg>

Grandiflorum. — Has large blue flowers, charmingly veined. Grandiflorum Album is a large, white flower with delicate penciling of blue. Tho plants grow to be two and a half feet tall and are covered with masses of flowers. There is a Japanese blue platycodon which is double. It is not quite as large as the other sorts. These should be planted early in the spring. The surest way is to get some plants of some seedsman or nurseryman, when you will have a good crop of flowers the same season. You are not always sure of getting the colors you want. If you send for seed of the white you will be apt to get some blue ones and among the blues there will be some white. Florists are generally careful to weed out the strays and so hare them as nearly true to color as possible and yet once in a while a blue will stray in among the whites and vice versa. But there is no harm done, and as the florist usually puts in good count you can pull out the strays if need be. These flowers are so hardy and prolific that they should be found In every collection. POLYGONUM, OR MOUNTAIN Fl.EBTE. The name is compounded from poly (many) and goun (Joint); many jointed, from the numerous joints on the stem. There are many va - rieties. The two generally grown are: tCompactum, which grows about eight feet tall and is surmounted by je spikes of greyish flowers. Cuspldatum, the giant variety, has very large semi-tropical leaves and is topped with immense trusses of flowers. These, like the Bocconias, should always be placed in the background as they sometimes grow to be six to eight feet tall. PROPAGATION. These are produced from seeds, but the best way is by root divisions. They are inclined to spread and sprout from the root so they should be confined to the background. They are effective when set in front of lilacs or ornamental shrubs. You can dig up the roots in the fall and put them in a box of sand in the cellar just as the nurserymen propagate blackberries from root cuttings two or three inches long. Placed in sand in a cool place they take their time in winter, when they have nothing else to do, to form a callus which is preliminary to sending out roots. When planted in the spring they soon send out roots and tips. These, like the Bocconias, Boltonias and Hibiscus, all kill down, in the fall. The tops should be cut off and removed so the new growth can have all the room they want in the spring. Should they be inclined to wander and come up where they are not waste*, cut them down— they are not hard to kill. </seg>
            <seg id="p254">254 Ptkcthbum (Paintd Daist) This is a very hardy plant, producing a charming flower of aster form, often striped and penciled in great beauty. It has reddish tints mingling with other colors. The flower is about an Inch to one and one-half Inches in diameter. It comes on early and is usually in full bloom on Decoration Day. It make* a very attractive bouquet, not bulky but delicate and charming. There are quite a number of varieties. They are generally single, but in recent years double forms have been Introduced. t There are annual varieties. One is called Golden Feather, which is ular for borders. We do not think much of it however. It becomes persistent as a weed and we treat it like one. tUliginosum is a noble, tall growing plant covered with large white fers with a golden center. It is in bloom about the time frost comes ?n It does its best to cheer the world up as It enters Into the rold. PROPAGATION. You can get the seeds of some reliable firm and raise your own, or you can get plants already grown and so be a year ahead. The roots keep increasing year by year. With us they have been very hardy though it would do no harm to mulch them. Only do not put on enough to suffo - cate them. Sow the seed early in the spring and you get good strong plants which will flower the next season. Coreopsis LThls is a showy perennial with graceful long-stemmed flowers, well ted for bouquets, and is one of the garden's great forces in yellows. tThe name Is from korls (a bug), and opsis (like); like a bug. A uiist must have a vivid imagination sometimes, especially In this *nce, to see any resemblance between the two. Coreopsis Ariculata is a showy flower, growing two to three feet tall Grandlflora Is probably the best. It is quite hardy and produces great bundance of golden flowers which continue a long time in bloom. The ant has great vigor and it Is hardy, probably from the fact that great uft« of foliage fall down and cover the roots completely. This is na - ure's protection for many plants — a sort of automatic mulching. They ower generally In July. They are very welcome at this time of the season. The flowers are solitary; that is, they grow singly on a long stem. As a general thing, the value of a flower depends on the length and trength of the stems and also on the keeping qualities. tLanceolata is also a beautiful yellow flower, but not near as large as indlflora. The flower is a little more delicate In structure and it does continue quite as long in blooming. Coreopsis Senifolla sometimes grows six feet tall and flowers in August. Coreopsis Verticillata grows about two feet tall and flowers from June </seg>

If the weather is moist you can sow seeds as soon as they ripen under a screen or bow early in the spring when they will blossom the first year. You can also use root divisions.

The Boccoma (Plume Poppy j. i These are very showy plants, with large semi-tropical leaves and tall y plumes. They often grow four to six feet tall. They continue in bloom a long time. As they are tall, strong growing plants they must be put in the background. They are inclined to spread and musi be kept within bounds. This can easily be done with the hoe, however. Cut them off a few times and they will soon take the hint that they are not wanted. There are two kinds, Bocconia Cordata, the sort commonly grown, and the Bocconia Microcarpa, entirely distinct from the former. It has very large striking foliage and the flowers are of a bronzy tint. They grow eight and ten feet tall and are among the most imposing plants we have. PBOPAQATION. I This is a little too easy. You grow them from seed planted early in spring and from stalons or offshoots from the roots. Dixlytba (Bleeding Heabt). I This was found growing in North China by a Mr. Fortune and was t to the London Horticultural Society in 1846. It is a native o." eria. As it is increased rapidly from root divisions It has spread all over the country and has become a great favorite. In good rich soil it grows about two feet tall and produces charming sprays of exquiately beautiful flowers. If they are planted in such a way the sun can strike them they become ethereally beautiful. The roots are very hardy but the plant will often be killed to the ground, flowers and all by an un - timely frost. But they usually spring up again with an entirely new foliage and a new set of flowers. Of course, the second ones are not as fine or profuse as the first. When they have a fair chance they are on hand for Decoration day. Placed in a bouquet with other flowers they are very effective. Hoots can readily be divided either in the fall or early in the spring. Plant in good rich ground and they will multiply rapidly. A small plant soon becomes a large stool. They can be used In B border, for a rookery, or they can be planted in the shade. Of course they will not bloom so early or so bountifully as in the open, yet flowers </seg>

If planted straight up and down the earth rht settle and leave the bud exposed. The common sort is called Spectabilts. tExima is rose colored with soft fern like foliage which keeps fresh summer. It will bloom until frost comes. Formosa is another form which gives bright red flowers in May We had the Exima for years and while flowers and foliage were beau - tiful the roots were so delicately fragile it was almost impossible to handle them, and they would be so bruised and drop to piece!! so badly in shipping and handling we gave them up in disgust. Campanulas (Bell Flowers) Named from Campana. a bell. There is a very large family of them, some 200 varieties, including annuals, biennials and perennials. Annuals must of course be sown every spring. Biennials, like hollyhocks, come up one year and bloom the next and then die. The perennial like the iris, phlox and peonies live from year to year. tThe cup and saucer varieties are very large and striking flowers. •se are biennials. They are about as conspicuous as any in the flower Sen. They are so large and delicate they should have some shelter n the winds. The Carpathica, blue and white varieties, are perennials. They have fine blooms and are conspicious for their delicacy. They are low creeping plants and are not of special merit save to adorn rock work. The blue are fine bloomers growing on stems two feet tall. They flower gloriously in Minnesota. I hardly knew them when I saw them blooming there. They are very hardy, reproducing themselves from root divisions and from seeds as they fall and come up whether the season is wet or dry. They are exceedingly hardy and a fine flower for the North, especially. PROPAGATION. tSow the seeds early in the spring. Don't expect the biennials to be ennlals. The cup and saucer sorts need some protection in the winter when they bloom you will find it pays for they will give you surprises loveliness. All varieties like rich sandy soil with good drainage. Full blown specimens of the Canterbury bells can be transplanted to pots for house decoration by soaking the soil about them with water and lifting with a DlCTAMKCS.

The plant emits a volatile oily tter which may be ignited in hot weather. There are three sorts. Fraiinella, from Fraxlnus, the botanical name of the ash, and the leaves somewhat resemble those of that tree. There is the Dlctamnus Rubra, with red flowers. Alba, with white flowers, and the Caueasicus, a giant form, with flowers twice the size of the others. The plants are rather slow in coming into flower, but they make It up by keeping at it for a century. They require a good soil and a sunny position. They are propagated from seed, which begins to ripen in August, and should be sown immediately and they will come up the next spring. If allowed to get dry and hard, they may be sown the next spring, when they must lie in the ground a year before they will come up. It is much the best way to get the plants about three years old and so save time and make sure of having them. Some seed, like those of the peony, If sown immediately on ripening will come up the next spring, but if allowed to dry they will take the sulks and there is no process by which they can be hurried and they may take two or three years to germinate. Aquclegia. ob Columbine. There are about fifty native sorts of these flowers and as they very readily cross or hybridze there is an almost infinite variety. Some of them are of great beauty. Quite a large number are found in America. One of the finest is Coerulea, photograph of the deep blue of the sky and the fleecy clouds. This is the state flower of Colorado. The Chrysantha is a rich golden flower and one of the latest. It grows wild in the Yellow - stone park. Both of these are single with very long spurs. Its habit of growth is to form large clumps. The peculiar peudan flowers are interesting in themselves because of their unusual form, ant this feature, taken in connection with the graceful habit of the plan gives each clump a striking and interesting appearance. The shades o color In columbines are almost infinite, while in form they vary fro single to double blue, the flowers quilled like a dahlia. Some of the sam form are red and some are white. They are usually on hand for Decora tion Day when we often put up bouquets for soldiers' graves of red, whi and blue. Some are very early and some, like the Chrysantha, are very late. I like to sow a lot of mixed seed and let nature blend the colo as she sees fit. A bed of fifty or more varieties is exceedingly attractive You love to linger over them and see the variations of form and colo So wide is the range that they take up all the colors of the rainbow.

AMONG THE PHLOXES § These flowers take a high rank on account of their remarkable beauty, itinuous blooming from June until November and because of the ease their propagation and culture. We found we could not depend on many of the imported ones in the trying climate of the West. Some cannot endure the drought and heat. Others will rust and blight in wet weather and many do not find the soil congenial. Said a florist from the East, "You ought to send down and get the kind we grow." We showed him the Identical ones, but he could hardly recognize them; soil and climate affect them so much. For years we have been building up a new race. We want— List. A plant of great vigor to resist the heat and endure the wet ither. t2d. Many of the imported ones are very slow propagators and there - » unprofitable. 3d. We must have fine Individual flowers to blend in one large gym metrical head. 4th. We want continual bloomers. A plant should be interested in the matter and seed well. Many ds do not seed and others have only abortive pods like many peonies. I This matter of seed bearing is very important, for there is a great ure for phloxes. We are raising thousands from well bred seed, most which will compare well with imported ones. Among the thousands some that will score the five points of excellence. A RITE. avoid confusion we name our new creations from the goddesses I heroines of ancient history. Arete is a cross between Crepuscule and Richard Wallace. It has a large symmetrical head, florets of a large sire, white as snow In warm weather and tinged with lavender late in the fall ; crimson eye. The plant is a strong one and a continuous bloomer from June until November. It also understands the multiplication table. Born at the «ame time we have Alcyone. This I think is the moat beautiful phlox on earth. Immense florets of snowy white and in the center five little brilliant stars, artistically arranged. But with the same treatment I got but twenty Alcyone and 600 Arete. I consider the latter one of the most profitable of all. </seg>

The Cross of Honor never does i, the plant almost Invariably produces flowers of a lilac tinge. Crepuscule does not always reproduce its own color, but Invariably gives a symmetrical head and a very large floret and continuous bloom. I find this the most satisfactory of all to breed from. Plant the boat sorts In close proximity, let the bees do the rest. You plant the seed and raise miracles. I Nature makes no mistakes in the blending of colors. A large bed of dling phloxes in continuous bloom until the first of November is one the finest spectacles of the flower garden. Out of a thousand you can k some of marvelous beauty. I The Phlox Manual tells how to raise from seed. A little girl following actions has raised some as fine as those produced by European experts. A gentlemen said from some well bred seed I sent him he secured one that $10 would not buy. Said he, "I first saw it In the dark. It shone like a lamp." Another gentlemen secured one with variegated foliage. In short we find ourselves in wonderland. Some of ours have richly variegated blooms. Seed must always be sown in the fall. The next summer they bloom and you know in a short time just what you are FORESTRY NOTES. C. 8. HARBISON, YORK. NEB. Norway Poplar — The Sudden Saw Log. This never saw Norway, but was found growing among the Norwegian Minnesota, hence the name. Its origin, like that of the Carolin poplar, is unknown. Professor Hansen thinks that it was one of Pr eaaor Budd's importations under the name of the Giant Asiatic poplar think I had the same thing thirty years ago. Attention was first called it by Professor Green of the Horticultural Department of Minneso gricultural College. He says: "It is the most rapid growing tree o ur grounds." We secured some for this station and in one year had undreds of trees eight and ten feet tall from cuttings set in the sprin ne fall I cut some for fence posts which at four years measured flftee nches in circumference three feet from the ground. A farmer In Minnesota in fifteen years had trees seventeen inches through and flfty-flve feet tall. The groves among the Norwegians were examined by a United States government expert and he made a favorable report, which was published in "Forestry and Irrigation." </seg>

He says: "We noted a number of trees that would make V sixty feet long that had a difference of only ten inches between the Is." Instead of wasting itself in side branches it retains its size as it &gt;unts upward, as if in great haste to make a good saw log. It grows •y straight, which makes it very desirable for quick results for wind ■aks. driveways and avenues. It is in such a hurry to get there thai &gt;re is the greatest call for it of any tree, being the most rapid grower any for our Northern states. Et is some like the Carolina, so much so that for the first few months i may think them identical, but wait— there is a difference. FOB FENCE POSTS Nebraska alone spends a million dollars a year for fence posts. Plant Xorways, care for them and in five or six years you have several thousand from an acre. Cut and peel them in August. Pile them up cob-house fashion and let them dry thoroughly. Throw them on a burning brush pile and char them slightly about three feet up or dip them in hot coal tar and you have a post costing about five cents that will last for years. We have seen the lumber. It is better than pine for bridge planks, for framing, for sheathing and flooring, and dressed with hard oil it does well for casings. I When you find a tree in such a desperate hurry you ought to help it ng.

An Overlooked Opportunity POSSIBILITIES OP THE SANDHILLS Nebraska land is all the while rising in value and it is strange that the possibilities of a fourth of our great state have been overlooked. It is taken for granted that sandy land is worthless. For some things it Is the best land In the world. I What Is the experience of Europe? In the days of Napoleon, between Gironde and the Pyrenees there was a tract of drifting sands which i a menace to the fairest portions of Prance. When the gale* blew </seg>
            <seg id="p261">261 the sands were swept inland. Farms were ruined, sometimes villages were engulfed, often church spires sticking out of the drifts told where towns were buried. Watching it all a man by the name of Bremontier conceived the idea of fastening the sands by planting them to Maratime Pine. He showed the plan to Napoleon. He saw the advantage and ordered the work done. After years of patient labor the whole area was changed to a thrifty forest. Remember, a sand bank is always an invitation to a conifer. Up in Manitoba, 150 miles west of Winnipeg, while on the cars we went through a region of shifting sands. Farmers foolishly broke up the ground in the hope of raising wheat. They got a crop or two, but the grass being de - stroyed the sands began to drift. On the highest point of this sandy stretch there was a clump of beautiful thrifty white spruce and I noticed fine, healthy, vigorous little trees springing up all over the desolate area, where the winter winds swept in their fury and the mercury sometimes dropped to 50 below. Professor Green, of the Minnesota Agricultural College, one of the best forest experts in the Northwest, visited the French forests and found he foresters cutting out logs and they were actually shipping turpentine nd resin to America. Just think of it. The rich products of their sand elds sent to us after we had wasted millions and millions of acres of le finest pine forests in the world. The professor then went up to the ismal River Experiment Station to see how the men were making it anting pine trees in our sandhills. He was pleased with the prospect nd said he could see no reason why they should not succeed there as ell as in France. Really there was a better show. There is considerable ass on our sandy lands and so some humus In the soil. What Impro— ed m favorably was the pure air and fine water of that region. He thought was one of the healthiest places in America. I It is well known that about twenty years ago Jack pines were planted Holt county and these have made the phenomenal growth of two feet year without cultivation or irrigation and little seedlings are coming ) all around them.

We have for years maintained that the proper way to raise Bull or Ponderosa pine was to raise it in the open like onions with no shelter. We recommended sowing late In the fall as nature does, or very early In the spring. It should come up as soon as possible. If it can put on the second coat of leaves before the hot weather comes on it Is immune from the blight or damps. Prank Brown, of Paynesvllle, Minn., has sown under our direction lor several years about fifty pounds of Ponderosa seed. The stand has been perfect with no damping off and now he has thousands of One healthy trees two and three years old. H. J. Stevenson, of Norrls, Manitoba, got 4,000 plants from half a pound of seed and when two years old he trans - planted them with hardly any loss. A clergyman In the sandhills planted our seeds for two years and reports that a man can easily secure 6,000 from a pound and he should lose but few in transplanting. A Mr. Tllden from the sandhills came to our office last spring with a broad smile on his face. He said: "I got two pounds of seed a year ago fl have 12,000 One plants. I want two pounds more, and with an outlay only $12 I will have enough to prove up on my Kinkald section." VITALITY Or SEED. While some conifer seeds lose their vitality In a year or two, these M*4 retain their vigor a long time. Last spring seed three years old came just as well as those gathered the fall before. A friend had some he gathered ten years ago. I planted them and they came all right. The seed are large and are incased in a thick hard shell which keeps them for an indefinite period. The Attenuata pine and the Contort* will keep their seeds intact in resin sealed cones for a century until a fire opens them when they fall into the ashes and spring up by the million. It Is Important to know of the vitality of the Bull Pine seeds for they are produced only once In about three years and then in large quantities. Then they can be procured and stored in safety for years. Pnember when you plant a grove of Bull Pine you plant a flock of and an oil well. By a recent chemical process fiber and cloth are from the long tough needles and a valuable oil is distilled from which is used in the manufacture of soaps and candles. </seg>
            <seg id="p263">THE STORY OF JOHN CHAPMAN. 263 "JOHNNY APPLE SEED." The Stobt of John Chapman, the Apostle of Apple Growing, Who Planted Nurseries in the West in Readiness for Coming Settlers. It is over a hundred years now since John Chapman and his little nurseries of seedling apple trees were extensively known In northern Ohio and northern Indiana. His name was John, not Jonathan, as some have it. He was a very eccentric man, whose benevolence outranked his eccentricity. He was born in the vicinity of Springfield, Mass., in 1775, and died near Fort Wayne, Ind., March 31, 1845. His first coming to the West was about 1801, when immigration to Ohio — yet a territory — was fairly under way. In the early portion of the nineteenth century Mr. Chapman was a familiar visitor in northwestern Pennsylvania, but more particularly in northern Ohio and northeastern Indiana. His all-absorbing occupation — a labor of love — was planting little nurseries of apple trees, miles apart In advance of civilization. He made small clearings in favorable localities, protected the grounds from outside injury with fallen trees, brush, etc., planted the seeds and passed on to the next desirable place. The seeds he obtained mainly at the cider mills in western Pennsyl - vania. He sometimes carried them on his shoulders in the oldfashioned saddle bags, but when more plentiful, in larger quantities on the back of a sorry looking little pony. One person mentions meeting him on the Ohio river below Pittsburg, with two canoes lashed together and loaded mainly with apple seeds. In 1806 he is said to have planted twelve or fifteen bushels in his little nurseries. During the growing season he would visit them and give the little trees whatever attention they would need, traveling nearly always on foot and often barefooted. When the trees grew to the proper size he would be on hand to sell them to the settlers, getting money sometimes, sometimes a note and sometimes old clothes. The man who wanted trees was never turned away. He never grafted. This seemed an unknown mystery to him. And not a few of the early nurserymen — who never itinerated as he did — were of the same class. Most of their trees produced small, austere fruit, but with the plentiful supply of maple sugar at that time they were excellent In pies and sauce. It has usually been considered that his tree raising was altogether In Ohio and Indiana, but the late Rev. J. H. Crelghton, of the Ohio Con - ference (who was well informed in pomological affairs), stated in a com - munication to the Ohio State Journal some years ago that he had reason to believe that the Northern Spy, a noted apple of New York, was one of Chapman's seedlings. The family came from Massachusetts, and East Bloumfleld, N. Y., where the Northern Spy originated, is near the track of </seg>
            <seg id="p264">264 Mr. Chapman was usually thinly clad, often In old clothes given him In exchange for trees. And It was an Invariable rule with him to give part of hi* scant wardrobe to anyone he met who seemed to be more needy than himself. He was the friend of all, young and old. Indian and white, and had free pass everywhere. More than once his warning of an Indian uprising — passing through the country with almost the speed of a race horse — gave time for flight or security and saved many lives. I Many time he slept in the woods, and was on the best of terms with denizens of the forest. It is related that one cool night he had made r-e in the woods for his comfort, and after lying down he perceived the mosquitoes were flying Into the blaze and losing their lives. He up, carried water in his hat from a nearby stream and extinguished lire. Strange, unheard of tenderness and consideration. Mr. R. J. Curtis, of Moundsville. W. Va., In a letter to the Ohio Pomologlcal Society (published in the report of 1S59) states that he ever knew him to give way to revenge or resentment in any form. He once saw him outrageously abused by a man much smaller than himself, ut he bore It all with meekness, wholly unruffled. He never carried a gun, never killed any game, pushing to extreme the principle of his life, ever to do harm to any creature. He considered that he was living as e primitive Christian did; and If his practical piety did assume un - ual forms who shall say that it was less acceptable to Htm who "seeth ot as man seeth?" tDr. Henry Howe, In his most admirable work, the "Historical Collec - ts of Ohio," relates that one of the early itinerant ministers, preaching the public square in Mansfield, Ohio, came on a passage not in the ginal plan of the sermon. Raising his voice at a certain point, he ed — doubless without any expectation of an answer — "Where is the -istian traveling to heaven barefooted now?" L'Here he is," cried Chapman, raising his bare feet aloft from a pile of iber on which he was stretched at full length. A part of his regular business was the free distribution of religious literature, which he carried, along with the New Testament, in the bosom of his shirt. If he happened to have plenty of books or pamphlets they went out Intact; but if he ran short at any time he separated them into small portions, so each person could have at least a partial benefit. In church relation he was a follower of Emanuel Swedenborg. And one peculiar phase of his oddity was that he considered he had angellr communications, and particularly in regard to marriage. Though once or wlce bis heart seemed touched with tenderness toward persons of the pposite sex, he never took to himself a helpmeet. Rut he was consoled n his loneliness by the promise — which he said he had from two spirits — that if he continued single and upright in the present life they would both be his wives in the life to come. In this particular he may be said have antedated the late Joseph Smith and surpassed him as well in at he postponed the "peculiar relation" to the future state of existenr-p To endure the toll and privation he did he must have had a fine &lt; on </seg>

A monument has been erected to Mr. Chapman in one of the One public parks of Mansfield, Ohio, and his name has been engraved on the Eient in Ashland county, Ohio, erected in 1882 to commemorate the massacre, a sad tragedy performed by certain Indians just seven ■ars previously. The life of this peculiar man came to an end through his special occu - pation. Hearing that cattle had broken into one of his nurseries in nothern Indiana, he hastened to the locality to put the fence in order, without regarding the heavy rain-storm which prevailed. It proved too much for him. He died at St. Joseph township, Allen county, Indiana, and Is buried two and one-half miles north of the city of Fort Wayne. — J. R. Black In National Horticulturist. TRAMPING FOR EARLY FLOWERS. BY CHARLES E. BEBSEY As soon as the snow is gone and the warm weather has set in it will be well to take a preliminary tramp over the higher prairies to catch the earliest plants in bloom. You must have your eyes open, and es - pecially sharpened for the little plants that venture to open their tiny flowers in protected places. It is astonishing how soon some of the early spring plants can push out their flowers. I remember many years ago that one spring in central Iowa the snow had remained until late in April, when it went off with a rush, and in less than forty-eight hours from wintry weather I found the little blossoms of the Shepherd's Purse smiling in the warm air of a protected nook. And so in Nebraska I have often found the saucy face of the Dandelion peeping from some warm spot on the University campus when there were still the remnants of snow - banks not far away. So when you go searching for the early prairie flowers do not overlook the semi-domesticated plants in our lawns and door-yards, and begin looking for them very early in the season, or you will miss the first ones that come into bloom. A. Vert Early Prairie Flowers. I. Low, smooth plants, with very small whitish flowers, Wild Parsley (Cymopterut) II.

OUR COMMON SUMMER FLOWERS BY CHABLE8 I. RE88EY The abundance and richness of our summer wild flowers has been the admiration of every lover of flowers ever since the prairies were first seen by white men, but this very richness and abundance of species has dis - couraged many an amateur botanist who has wished to make their closer acquaintance. "What shall I call this pretty flower?" is the question that has been asked by nearly every new-comer to the prairies, who wishes for a familiar name, but who has not the time to find it by the study of the rather difficult botanical manuals. Now I can not hope to make an easy "short cut" to the names of all of our summer flowers, for there are too many of them, but it is possible to point out with sufficient exactness those kinds that are most striking and that are most noticeable, and this must suffice until the publication of the key to Nebraska plants, now nearly completed by Mr. Petersen.* Of course, even in such an article as this it is necessary for the seeker after • Mr. Niels F. Petersen has nearly ready for publication a descriptive catalogue of the flowering plants of Nebraska based upon the State Her - barium in the University of Nebraska. When published it will enable any one to find the name of any of our native flowering plants. </seg>

Even in such a simple thing as learning the names of our wild flowers "there is no royal road to knowledge." All that I can do is to grade down t highway and roll off some of the stones, so that the road may be :r more easily traveled.

Although Nebraska was largely treeless when white men came acroae the river, there are now more than a hundred different kinds of trees that one may see in almost any place in the eastern part of the state, and it adds much to one's pleasure to be able to tell what they are. I have often wondered how it would seem if I were to find myself unable to recognize the trees in our forests and parks. I am sure that half of my enjoyment of out-of-door life would be taken away if I did not have a "speaking acquaintance" with the trees. It would be like being in a company of pleasant people, all of them strangers, instead of familiar acquaintances. Therefore if you will, I shall be glad to In - troduce you to some of our more common trees. Of course in a short article like this I cannot mention all of our trees. Evergreens Every park and almost every dooryard if large enough has some trees that retain their leaves through the year. They are green in the sum - mer, of course, but when the fall comes they do not let their leaves fall (th-&gt; falling leaves give the name to the season), but retain them all winter; so such trees are always green, hence "evergreen." In the north the only trees that are evergreen are the pines, spruces, firs, hemlocks, and cedars, and these may be told from one another very easily. Go to any evergreen tree in one of our parks and you will find it possible to tell at a glace to which of these it belongs. If it has long, very narrow, stiff leaves that look like needles, it is a pine. In all of our pines the leaves are two in a place, or three, or five. If the tree you find has short leaves, that are needle shaped, 4-angled, and always one in a place, It is a spruce, while if the leaves are short and flattish, bat still one In a place, it is a fir. Lastly If the leaves are very small and like little green scales crowded and overlapping one another it is some kind of a cedar. These facts may be shown as follows: Leaves narrow, needle shaped — If now we look at the pinks we shall find that it is not difficult to distinguish several kinds, as follows: A. Leaves long, needle-shaped, stout, in twos. 1. Leaves less than 2 inches long Jack Pine (Pinus divariemtm) 2. Leaven about 2 or 3 Inches long; large tree, . Leaves, (needles) 2, 3, or 5 in a place Pines (Pinus) L Leaves one In a place. a. Leaves 4-angled Spruces (Pico*) 6. Leaves flattish Fir (AMet) ;. TjMves very small, scale-like Cedars (Thuya and Juniperut) </seg>
            <seg id="p274">274 3. Leaves about 2 or 3 Inches long; small tree, Mugho Pine (Pin us montana) 4. Leaves about 3 or 4 inches long Austrian Pine (Pinus auttriaca) 6. Leaves about 5 or 6 inches long Norway Pine (Pinut retino$a) B. Leaves long, needle-shaped, stout, in threes. Leaves about 3 or 4 Inches long (some in twos). Bull Pine (Pinu$ ponderota) C. Leaves long, needle-shaped, slender, in fives. White Pine {Pinus strobut) Try this little key on the pines you find in the parks of your town. or the dooryards and other private grounds, and you will soon have no difficulty in telling what kind you have before you. Now try the sprites, in which the leaves stand one in a place, and are short and needle shaped. In most of our spruces the leaves stand out all around the twig, and are about half an inch long. In most cases they are very sharp-pointed. If you have sharp enough eyes you can easily make out that every little leaf is not round like a needle, but four-cornered, which is the final test for the spruces. You may find the following spruces in the parks: A. Leaves blunt. Foliage green; cones large, 4 to 6 inches long, Norway Spruce (Picea excelta) B. Leaves sharp pointed. 1. Foliage green: cones small, 2 inches or less long. White Spruce (Picea canadentit) 2. Foliage blue green; cones medium, 3 inches long. Blue Spruce (Picea parryana) Ehe hk trees have leaves that resemble those of the spruces, but ad of being four-cornered they are flat, and I do not recall any of our vated firs with sharp-pointed leaves. Another thing that young folks with sharp eyes will notice is that while the fir leaves when old break off from the twig right at the surface of the twig, in the spruces they break off a little above the surface. So a fir twig after its leaves fall is smooth, while a spruce twig is rough with the stumps of the leaf-bases. There is still another peculiarity of the fir trees in the fact that they are very "pitchy" — having little sacks of clear pitch in the bark of their young branches. Just look over the next fir tree you find and when you see a puffed out spot on the smooth bark run a pin into it and you'll see the pitch gush out. So you should have no trouble in recognizing the fir trees. In fact you should be able to distinguish the two kinds of firs that are rather commonly grown, as follows: L Narrow leaves, 1 inch or less long: foliage green. Balsam Fir (Abie* baUamea) 2. Leaves broader, 2 or more Inches long: foliage blue-green White Fir In a few places in Nebraska the hemlock (Ttuga canadentit) la grown. It resembles the spruces and firs, but is neither one nor the other. </seg>
            <seg id="p275">275 IU leaves are flat, but when they (all off they leave a rough twig, and there are no sacks of pitch in the bark. The cedars have very small, scale-shaped leaves, differing greatly from those of pines, spruces, firs or hemlocks. Many people who look at the cedars do not look closely enough to see the myriads of minute leaves that completely cover the twigs, and it will surprise many a reader of this article when he takes his first close look at these trees. There are two principal kinds of cedars grown in Nebraska and popularly dis- tinguished as White and Red Cedar. 1. Leaves in 4 rows; flat: cones oblong and woody, nearly half an inch long Arbor Vitae or White Cedar (Thuya occidental^) 2. Leaves in 3 rows, rounded dorsally; cones round, berry-like, fleshy, about one-fourth of an inch in diameter, Red Cedar (Juniperus virginiana) Here I may put a couple of relatives of the foregoing evergreens, that drop their leaves in the fall, and so are not "evergreen" in the strict sense of the term. In a few places in the state people have been able to grow the labch (often called tamarack). All summer long it looks much like a cross between a pine and a spruce, and has needle-shaped leaves, an inch or so long, but when fall comes all drop off and leave the twigs bare. If you look closely you will find that on the new shoots the leaves stand one in a place, as they do in spruces, while on older shoots they are in clusters of a dozen or two as though trying to imitate the pines. If you can find the cones you may be able to distinguish two kinds of larches, as follows: 1. Cones small, less than an Inch long .. American Larch (Larix laricina) 2. Cones large, more than an inch long. .European Larch (Larix decidua) Have you seen the gi.nkoo tree? It is a distant relative of the pines that have been brought from Japan, and is grown successfully in some places in eastern Nebraska. Its leaves are shaped like a three-cornered fan and are a couple of inches broad at the widest part. The veins run from the bottom up to the wide margin. It will interest you to know that Ginkgo trees were once abundant in many places in the world, bnt in geologic times all perished except this species that grows in Japan, so that now we are restocking the world from this Japanese remnant. Deciduous Trees The trees with deciduous leaves may be distinguished in a general way by the following outline key. When you use it always start at the top and work down, being careful to verify each step, making no gnesasa. nor skipping any point. A. Leaves opposite, that is two or three at the same joint of the twig. 1. Leaves in threes, large, heart-shaped Catalpas {Catalpa) have two or three kinds of catalpa trees growing In our rks, but it takes an expert to distinguish them. 2. Leaves in twos, large, divided Into 5 or 9 radiating leaflets. </seg>
            <seg id="p276">276 In some of our parks may be found the HorsecheJtnut with large leaves, and also the Buckeye with similar but smaller leaves. 3. Leaves in twos, medium sized, with 3 or 5 sharp lobes; seed pods in pairs, each with a wing Maples (Acer) We have two or three maples that are common in our parks, viz.: the native Silver Maple (Acer taccharinum) with a silver colored bark to each leaf; the Sugar Maple (Acer taccharum) from the east, with greenbacked, slightly downy leaves; and the Norway Maple (Acer platanoidet) from Europe, with smooth green leaves. 4. I /eaves in twos, large, divided into 3 to 7 pinnate leaflets, seed pods like those of Maples Box-Elders (Acer negundo) 5. Leaves in twos, large, divided into 5 to 9 pinnate leaflet*; pods single (not in pairs), winged Ashes (Fraxinut) We have several species of Ash trees, as the White Ash {Fraxinut amcrtcana), Green Ash (Frazinut lanceolata) and Red Ash (Frax- mui pennsylianica), but they are difficult to distinguish. The Green Ash is the most common kind in Nebraska. Leaves alternate, that Is, only one at each joint of the twig. 1. Leaves not lobed.

I The presence of such modern necessities as gas, electric lights, sewers 1 pavements places many an obstacle in the way of any attempt to iw plants with success in our cities. The stretching of wires for tele - &gt;ne, telegraph and lighting purposes too often Involves the serious ting away of the larger branches of our shade trees, while leaks from i and sewer pipes often are responsible for the death of trees along Bets and in private grounds. It is often a question whether it pays try to grow trees along city streets in open competition with all these Favorable factors. Professor Stone of the Massachusetts Experiment Station has given this matter considerable attention and recently said: "The death of many trees can be referred to illuminating gas. If a leak occurs in the pipe, the gas escapes very readily into the soil, especially if it is porous, and when it comes in contact with the roots they are asphyxiated, and the result to the tree manifests itself very quickly. The symptoms of gas poisoning are most generally a sudden falling of the leaves, a deadened appearance of the bark, due to the collapse of the cambium or living layer, brought about by the asphyxiation of the roots, which results in the rapid death of the tree. In mild instances of poisoning the effect shows only upon one side of the tree, but in general the tree seldom escapes death. We have observed many single trees killed by gas on the private grounds of city residences, without the owner ever surmising what the trouble was; and this last summer we had an opportunity to examine whr le rows of native trees which had died by gas asphyxiation. Some of the trees which we observed were at a distance of fifty feet from the nearest gas main, while others succumbed when not nearer than one hundred feet to the leak in the pipes." Irhe injurious effects of the gases or fumes from smelter plants of ous types upon vegetation and even animals have received much at - ion in Europe from chemists and plant pathologists. In this country investigations of Haywood and others have shown the nature of the ries involved and suggested certain possible remedial or rather pre- Jve measures which could be applied at the smelter which might ely do away with this type of nuisance. In some of these cases large is are rendered unfit for agriculture and streams may become polluted i such injurious chemicals that it becomes unwise to use such water purposes of irrigation. Sediments containing arsenic may settle upon ■ at tome distance from the smelter and thus cattle grazing be made serous — in some cases such grass cannot with safety be cut and em - ed for hay. </seg>

In still another direction attention has been directed to the effects of gases of various sorts upon plants thru the application of etherization in the forcing of certain bulbs. The writer was recently called upon to visit the greenhouses of Mr. Paul B. Floth, of Omaha, to discover, if possible, the cause of the sudden injury or death of a great variety of plants in his establishment. A pre - liminary examination convinced me that the cause was to be found in some leakage from a gas main. The characteristic symptoms were very evident, particularly upon the several varieties of carnations. Prompt search upon the part of the Omaha Gas Company revealed a break in one of their service pipes across the street from the greenhouses affected. (Figure 1.) At the time the surface of the soil was well frozen, forming a sort of a blanket beneath which the gas was free to move laterally In the dirt. The floor of these greenhouses was beneath the street level, as is not uncommon in greenhouse construction, and the gas entered thru the exposed dirt surface forming the south walls of the houses. The effects of illuminating gas and particularly of ethylene, one of the moat important constituents of this illuminating gas, upon carnations has been very critically studied by Crocker and Knight 1908, and some of their conclusions should here be stated. They employed the varieties known in the trade as "Boston Market" and "Pink Lawson." They found that an exposure for three days to one part of illuminating gas in 40,000 parts of air was sufficient to kill all the young buds and to prevent the opening of flowers in which the petals were already showing. They found that an exposure for twelve hours to one part of illuminating gas in 80,000 parts of air would cause open flowers of the carnation to close. They are of the opinion that the gas acts directly upon the buds of flowers and not thru the root system by absorption in the soil as some have thought. These same authors also studied the effect of ethylene upon carnations with even more startling results. An exposure for three days to one part of e'hylene to 1,000,000 parts of air prevented the opening of flowers whose petals were Just showing. An exposure for twelve hours to one part of ethylene in 2,000,000 parts of air was sufficient to cause open flowers to close. Prom these results it is evident that carnations might be injured by quantities of illuminating gas not only too small to smell, but perhaps too slight to be detected at all by the best chemical tests. These same authors have as a matter of fact suggested the use of sweet pea seedlings grown in the dark till etiolated as a fine test for the presence of minute quanti - ties of gas in the air. These seedlings show quite definite reactions when exposed to one part of ethylene in 10,000,000 parts of air. The "Scarlet Glow" carnation was in bud at the time the gas entered </seg>

Styles protruding from buds of "Scarlet Glow" carnation three weeks after gas injury. very closely as Is typical for gas injury to carnations. When examined on February 3, some three weeks after the original injury, this particular variety of carnation showed a very peculiar situation. The styles were projecting from the tips of the buds, now somewhat swollen, but not showing any tendency to open fully. This peculiar feature is clearly shown in the figure (Figure 2). In the other varieties of carnations the buds that had commenced to open remained closed and the calyx dried and shriveled up to form a sharp pointed cover to the apparently dead corolla within. Flowers that were open at the time had their corolla* killed outright Defoliation did not occur on the carnations at all tho on many other species this was the most characteristic symptom noted. For example, the roses showed complete defoliation, as clearly shown in the figure (Figure 3). Varieties of roses in which growth was being forced very rapidly had many of the young shoots very much killed back and all these plants were of necessity discarded. The different sorts of Coleus showed different degrees of defoliation — this varied somewhat with the different varieties. Figure 4 shows the condition of most of the Coleus plants soon after the gas injury, while figure 5 shows the regeneration of new shoots at the base and the apparent recovery of the terminal bud from which some leaves have been formed. </seg>

Narcissus showed a very peculiar form of injury so far as the leaves were concerned. The tips of these leaves became curled up and at the same time assumed a purplish hue. At the same time open flowers were killed outright and in the case of this plant many of the roots now show considerable injury. The outer leaves of the Agave were killed at their tips or in some cases to the bottom. In fact one of the very chacterlstic effects of illuminating gas is the injury it does to the older leaves of plants. This was well shown by such plants as Pandanus, Zamla, Aroides or Calla lily, Abutilon, etc., in addition to those mentioned above. A further fact of interest to the pathologist as well as the professional florist is the apparent increase in the amount of carnation rust following this gas injury. Such gas-Injured carnations (Figure 11) are often said by florists to be "sleepy" — it is possible that in this asphyxiated condi - tion they are not as resistant as normally to the attacks of various parasitic fungi.

            <seg id="p286">286 NEBRA8KA STATE HOBTICULTUBAL SOCIETY. HEATING THE ORCHARD P. H. TROUTMAN, COLORADO. Some of the imi&gt;ortant points to be considered in connection with suc - cessful orchard heating are the movement of cold waves: suitable fuels, and means of handling them: number and distribution of fires; relation of the smoke to the prevention of frost: adaptability of heaters to small fruit plantations and gardens: fuel storage: lighters and lighting: danger poinU to various fruits, and effective means of preventing oils from boiling over. MOVEMENT OF COLD WAVES. Bulletins from the government and various agricultural colleges have discussed this movement in a general and scientific way in such a thorough manner that it is useless to elaborate upon it- in this article. The one |&gt;oint which I wish to bring out is the fact that the movement of cold waves, or more properly speaking in this connection, cold spots or pools, is very irregular. It is very dangerous to depend upon one centra] watchman &lt;n a valley covering an area of several square miles to sound the alarm when the temperature reaches the danger i&gt;oiiit. Here in the Canon City district of Colorado we have known a difference of temperature of from six to seven degrees within one-half mile. The cold in many of our Colorado valleys runs in streaks. You may be per - fectly safe in your own orchard, while your neighbor's crop will be en - tirely destroyed, or vice versa. It is therefore very important that a number of watchmen or automatic alarms be scattered throughout the valley, and in the case of large orchards it is much safer to have a watchman in each orchard. This is a slight additional expense, but the growers who adopt this system will benefit from it. SriTABI.E ri'ELS AND MEANS OF HANDLING Three fuels are principally used in orchard heating, namely oil, coal and briquettes, the latter being a mixture of sawdust, coal tar and other refuse material. Some growers are still using the latter two fuels, but by far the majority of growers in nearly every section of the United States have adopted oil as the best and most economical. Coal is best handled for first installment of heaters by loading from a central storage shed or on wagons driven through the orchard and shoveled directly into the beaters, and for second, third and fourth in - stallments required throughout the night, the best method is to have boxes filled with coal distributed throughout the orchard in close prox - imity to the heaters. In using coal the best that can be obtained should be used. Slack or inferior grades will cause nothing but failure. Where </seg>
            <seg id="p287">287 of labor required and the less heat produced by coal, makes oil in the The best grade of oil is what is known as fuel or smudge oil distillate. Such oil should test a specific gravity of twenty-eight to thirty-two. Many growers make the mistake of getting a cheap residue, with a specific gravity of from fifteen to twenty. This oil will not burn clean and con - tains so little volatile matter that the heat produced is not 25 i&gt;er cent of what it should be. Heavy oil, such as this, ought not be used for orchard Phe best method of handling oil through the orchard is to haul same r in barrels on a small wagon, or in large wagon tanks, driven up down the rows, filling directly into the heaters, either by means of hose attached to the tank or by buckets or pails which can be filled from a spigot in the back of the tank wagon. This is the quickest and most effectual method for handling oil. both for original and additional filling when required at night. RELATION OF SMOKK TO THE PREVENTION OF FROST. will ward off a light frost in the same manner as will heavy clouds. For increase in temperature, however, or for holding the heat in the orchard, after- it is produced by heaters, it is absolutely useless and the grower who expects to save his crop by the means of a blanket ■loke will invariably lose out. Experiments have been made with smoke so dense that men could not stand it, and it was found that the smoke did not have a particle of effect on the thermometers. Then, too, those who depend ui&gt;on smoke for the protection of their crop, will very that the blanket of smoke, instead of being over their own orchard, is over their alfalfa field or their neighbor's orchard, driven there by a light wind that invariably exists during frost fighting. great advantage and in fact the only advantage of smoke is In rding off the direct rays of the sun early in the morning. This is a great advantage, and all orchard heaters should give off a sufficient amount of smoke to accomplish this purpose. Smoke is for the most part unburned carbon and any system of heating that produces more than the ordinary amount of smoke is therefore very wasteful. The ideal way would be to have a heating device that was absolutely smokeless and then, by burning a few barrels of tar in the orchard to produce the desired smoke just before sunrise. Up to the present time no device has ever been invented that was smokeless, regardless of claims made by the manufacturers. Some heaters, however, owing to oxygen-consuming arrangement with the fuel, are more nearly smokeless than others, and these devices hare been found more economical. As an example, the common lard-pail </seg>
            <seg id="p288">288 rully as the most expensive patented heater on the market. A great of heat, however, goes off of such a pot in unburned carbon, making I denser smoke, and by actual tests it has been proved that such a vice will require at least 50 per cent more fuel to create the same lount of heat as some other heaters equipped with an oxygen supply. ADAPTABILITY Or HEATERS TO SMALL FECIT PLANTATIONS AND GARDENS This is a new phase of orchard heating and one that was not thor - oughly developed until a year ago. It has, however, in the past twelve months been thoroughly demonstrated that orchard heating was of untold benefit to truck gardens and small fruits of all kinds. Under ordinary conditions it is more difficult to heat truck gardens and small fruits, as there are no overhang limbs to hold the heat and 90 per cent of the heat escapes before filling its mission. There are several devices on the market, however, that are so de - rtaed that the heat is deflected and spread over the ground in such a manner as to make the heating of small fruits just as effectual and economical as the heating of large orchards. The benefit is really more marked, as a light frost will affect small fruits and truck gardens quicker than it will tree fruits. From personal experience I can heartily recom - mend this system for the protection of currants, strawberries, raspberries, grapes, etc. TXTEL STORAGE. I Coal, if exposed to the air and left in the open, will deteriorate and thin a year be worthless for any purpose whatever. On this account ■&gt;ed« to be stored in a shed. tin the case of oil the best way to store is in a cement cistern. Oil ervoirs made by the following formula have been successfully used in lorado and elsewhere: "For cisterns of not over 5.500-gaIlon capacity •xlO feet), six-inch walls; one sack of cement to eight of sand. First it of plaster, one cement to 3H sand; second coat plaster, one cement 2H sand. Between the coats of plaster, or on inside of all, give a ish coat of hot tar. This prevents leakage of the oil. Allow the cistern stand thirty days before filling, if possible, two weeks at the shortest" A great many people use galvanized iron tanks either on the ground or suspended in the air. Some have the latter so arranged that they can both fill and unload their tank wagons by gravity. This is not the ad - vantage It appears, as the oil when above ground becomes very heavy in cold weather and the flow by gravity is not as fast as when pumped. Unloading from tank cars into the cisterns by gravity is satisfactory, but in loading the oil into the tank wagons for use in the orchard, the quickest and most practical way is to pump it out of the cistern with a double-action harvester pump. By this means a man can fill a 600-gallon tank wagon in about twenty-five minutes. Some use power pumps for this purpose, others use small pitcher pumps. All have been found satisfactory. </seg>
            <seg id="p289">289 HEATING THE ORCHARD. LIGHTXM AND LIGHTING. The most approved method at present is the use of gasoline in lighting the heaters. As this is a dangerous liquid to handle the best means is to use one of the several patented rapid lighters on the market. These lighters are so arranged that by pressing a spring a given quantity of gasoline is ejected onto the surface of the oil. A torch is attached to the lighter which leaves one hand free for the removing of the covers of the heaters. In lighting the heaters not more than 25 or 30 per cent of the pots In the orchard should be lighted at first Usually the temperature drop* slowly, and by watching a number of thermometers situated throughout the orchard, always placed at the furthest point away from any lighted heater, the temperature in the orchard can be controlled to exactly the desired degree. A very successful way of lighting the heaters where 100 to 120 pots are placed to the acre, is to light every other heater in every second row, thus giving twenty-five or thirty heaters per acre. This is sufficient for from two to four degrees rise in temperature. When this is not sufficient, then to light every other heater in the alternate rows, giving from fifty to sixty pots per acre, sufficient for an increase of from five to seven degrees. Then if more heaters are required, light the balance in the second row, and then the balance of the heaters in the alternate rows. By this method of lighting the heat is always equally distributed throughout the orchard. It is a mistaken idea held by some growers that it is best to raise the temperature in an orchard by increasing the amount of heat produced by each heater already lighted. The government in all its reports sounds a warning in this regard and brings out the point very strongly that "there is no need tor great heat locally, but for small fires well dis - tributed." The presence of a large fire creates an upward draft that carries the heat far above the orchard and causes a cold draft to rush in from the sides, replacing the warm air. thus destroying the effect of heating. Numerous small fires well distributed over the orchard do not give a sufficient heat locally to cause any material change in the air currents, thus holding the warm heated air dose to the ground, where it Is desired. Recently there have been a number of experiments with automatic lighting apparatuses. None of these have as yet been perfected, but from present indications there is hope that in the near future there will be a successful automatic lighting apparatus that will be so operated as to cut down the labor required to a minimum and that will enable orchardists having a thousand acres to protect to do so with the few men usually on hand in the spring of the year. ■ </seg>

Fruit under certain atmospheric conditions will stand these temperatures, but in many cases the fruit will be destroyed before the danger point, as given by these tables, is reached. The most successful experiments in orchard heating have been conducted where the temperature was never allowed to get below 32 degrees. Thirty degrees may be safe for peaches and 28 or 29 degrees for apples, but the quality will be far better if frost never touches the bloom. Therefore I strongly urge and recommend that in all instances after the bloom has developed to a sufficient stage as to show pink that the thermometer be kept above 32 degrees. EFFECTIVE MEANS FOR' PREVENTING OILS BOILING OVER. rie cause of oil boiling over is the fact that there is water in the Some manufacturers claim it is due to certain heaters. This Is merely a foolish attempt on their part to advertise their own devices. It is found that any oil containing water will boil over in any heater in which it is ever placed. The most effectual means to prevent oil boiling over is to insist that the oil company drain off the water from the tank t before shipment is made. It is also a wise plan to allow a tank to stand twelve hours after delivery and then to make sure that all water is out of the bottom of the car before empying. Where water gets into a cistern it is wise to dip the oil from the top of the tank and to destroy the last few inches remaining in the bottom of the cistern. There has been no successful means discovered of eliminating water from the oil after it was once placed in the heaters. There is no excuse for water being in the oil if proper precautions are taken by the oil companies. Orchard heating has long since passed the experimental stage. It is now merely a question of dollars and cents. Can the grower afford to run the risk of not only losing his crop every so often from killing frosts, but the impairing of the quality of his fruit which occurs to a greater or less extent every year from slight frost damage? In many cases it has E proved that the better quality of the fruit produced, due to orchard ng, paid for the entire cost of the heating equipment in a single Many sections feel that orchard heating is not required as they seldom if ever have a total failure. This is a mistaken idea, for the improved quality of the fruit, due to the saving of the first bloom that is almost always destroyed by late spring frosts will more than recom - pense the grower for the outlay of money and time that is required in the successful using of orchard heaters. </seg>
            <seg id="p291">291 THE ESSENTIALS OF GRAPE GROWING. I. T. STEPHENS, CRETE, SEB. frhe grape is probably the oldest of domesticated fruits. Doubtless i' was made from it before it was even brought into cultivation: and read that its product was in use in Noah's time. The fruit is so easily grown in Nebraska that we cannot but think that one reason it is not found in abundance on every farm Is because many people believe it requires more than ordinary skill to cultivate. Frequently those who have planted a dozen vines as an experiment have not known the best methods of setting and pruning. Probably three-fourths of the grape vines planted so far and lost have been lost through lack of winter protection. Our habit is to plow the ground in narrow lands, bringing the dead furrows eight to nine feet apart. We then loosen the soil to a consider - able depth by subsoiling, after which we disc and harrow to put the soil in fine tilth. By using as much team work as possible in the preparation of the soil, the manual labor is lessened to a marked degree. A suitable distance for planting a vineyard is eight to nine feet, which gives 605 plants to the acre. We suggest nine feet as the width between the rows in order that it may be convenient to drive in with a hay rack and apply straw for winter covering. Vines should be planted six to eight inches below the general level of the soil. Subsequent cultivation during the season will result in cover - ing them perhaps them perhaps eight inches deeper than they grew in the nursery row. The previous subsoiling allows the roota to run freely, conserves moisture, and enables the vine to make a vigorous growth the first year. If holes are dug by hand without team work, they should be two feet deep and thirty inches across, to give the roots an abundance of room. Any common fertilizer, such as bones, put in the hole, will give the best results; and an abundance of ashes should be applied on the surface of the ground. Posts should be eight feet in length and stand five and one-half feet above the ground. If trained to this height, on at least two wires, the vines will have sufficient light and air. Use strong heavy posts at the ends of rows. Lighter ones may be put between. Number nine or ten wire gives the best results. Piltivation should be often enough to keep the surface loose and iw, and should be continued until mid-August in the young vineyard, latter can be cultivated by horse power; whereas one seldom takes enough time with a few vines to insure success. Where only a few vine* are desired, however, they may be planted close to the walls of buildings and trained to good advantage. They appreciate the south side, and, as a rule, the hotter the weather the better the grape. In marketing our grape crop, we use what is known as the eight pound basket, which holds when carefully packed about seven pounds. </seg>
            <seg id="p292">292 In choosing varieties it is better to consult the Individual tastes of the family. If for the market Its demands must be considered. Moore's Early, Worden and Concord, ripening in the order named, are the best of the blue grapes. Niagara and Empire State are the most universally planted white grapes: Rrighton. Wyoming and Delaware are of choice flavor, but less frequently grown. Within the past few years it has been found advantageous to spray, using Bordeaux mixture to combat fungus diseases. Spraying two or three times is usually sufficient. Those who have only a few vines will find a knapsack sprayer sufficient. For a vineyard use a barrel mounted on a sled with spray pump attachment, it is more effective. LThe Intent of cutting a^ay portions of the vine Is to leave only a Icient number of buds on canes of the current season's growth to give ■uch an amount of fruit the coming season as the age and strength of the vine can support. Pruning should be varied somewhat to suit the habits of different varieties. The stronger growing sorts should have more wood allowed them than the weaker ones. The vines should not be allowed to bear much fruit until strong enough to grow vigorous canes with strong laterals. Thrifty laterals develop fruit buds near the base. These laterals are cut back from four to six buds, depending on the age and strength of the vine. Allow as much fruit to set as the vine can support and grow to perfection. Winter covering is an all Important subject Thousands of vines are lost annually from lack of winter protection. The vines should be re - moved from the wires, pressed close to the ground, and covered with two or three forkfuls of straw. Over this throw sufficient soil to prevent the winter winds from blowing through the straw, which dries the canes. Such protection is useful any winter and absolutely necessary when the winter is unusually cold. </seg>
