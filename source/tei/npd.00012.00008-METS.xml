Nebraska State Penitentiary,

Office of the Warden, j 

To His Excellency, the Governor of Nebraska, and the Honorable 
Members of the Board of Public Lands and Buildings 
of Nebraska : 

Itentlemen — I submit herewith a report of this institution, 
?ring the biennial period from December 1, 1902, to Noiber 
30, 1904. During these two years the penitentiary 
undergone more physical changes than hare been crowded 
&gt; a like period since the establishment of the institution, 
the beginning of the biennium the prison was but little 
•e than a corral, in which were herded nearly 300 of the 
dependents, while the close of the term witnesses res 
that put Nebraska's penitentiary in the list of the model 
al institutions of the country. 

Ii 1902 there were sixty cells for the accommodation of 
inmates; in 1904 there are 294 cells for the housing of 
prisoners, less the six female convicts, who are given light 
commodious apartments on the third floor of the middle 
». Six more cells are to be added under the agreement 
i the company having the last contract, and these will 
e a total of 300 cells, which will, doubtless, be found sufnt 
for the accommodation of Nebraska's recidivists for 
y years to come, as each cell comfortably lodges two men, 
will hold three at a pinch, that I trust is afar. 

It has been a real pleasure to me to see the changes for the 
better in this institution, and I believe that the wisdom of 
the legislature in making ample appropriations for the improvements 
in the prison is visible to even the most casual 
visitor. Aside from seeing to the much-needed betterments 
in the way of cells and additions to the buildings, it has been </seg>

            <seg id="p005">
126 

LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT. 

my task to make the penitentiary grounds more pleasing to 
the eye, for I am firmly rooted in the conviction that the 
morale of the establishment is given strength by dispelling 
some of the gloom of cold stone and cheerless gratings. 

PRISON POPULATION. 

The institution has had a considerable growth in population 
during the biennium, as will be noticed by reference to 
the tables contained in the report of the clerk. It is a question 
as to what has caused this increase; but it is not large 
enough to create any particular apprehension among the students 
of penology, who insist, and rightly I believe, that 
crime is diminishing. It is probably due to merely the growth 
of the state as a whole. 

Here it would not be improper to remark that the reports 
of the penitentiaries of other states demonstrate that Nebraska 
has a smaller per cent of prison occupants than any 
of her sisters. Some of the latter jealously insist that this 
is true for the reason that Nebraska has so few large cities. 
But we are not going to be drawn into any argument. The 
fact, simply, is given. 

There have been during the two years but four escapes fronr 
the instihition, three of them being successful up to the date 
of this report. This is a rather good showing, especially 
when compared to the record of the prior biennium, when 
fourteen inmates managed to reach the zone of at least temporary 
freedom without waiting for the formality of discharge. 
This showing does not suffer, either, when it is 
aligned with the record of the two biennial periods preced" 
mm 
ing the last, when nine and thirteen inmates, respectively, 
effected their escape. The completion of the new cells makes 
any concerted effort at delivery an unlikely occurrence, although 
individual cases of escape are not to be unexpected. </seg>

            <seg id="p006">

STATE PENITENTIARY. 

THE FINANCES. 

Economy has been practiced during the biennium, although 
it has not been allowed to dominate to an extent that 
seriously interfered with the prosperity of the institution, nor 
threatened the welfare of the inmates. It has been the constant 
aim to disburse the public's money in sucn a way and 
for such purposes as would guarantee the largest returns. 

Inference to the financial tables embodied herein will show 
the disbursements have not been comparatively heavy, 
that the per capita cost for maintenance has been as low 
i consistent with safe and conservative management. The 
¦opriation for maintenance for the prior biennium failed 
teet the expenses by $23,015.13, this being the total of the 
:iency claims (f 13,580.58), added to the f 9,434.55 which 
used from the special labor fund, which, by legislative 
:tment, became part of the state's general fund on April 
J03, and, thereafter, unavailable for the maintenance of 
prison. 

I glance at the special labor fund table will reveal that 
ng this biennium the sum of $11,389.97 was earned by 
act labor prior to April 1, 1903; that from said date to 
close of the period the sum of $40,769.15 was derived 
i the same source, and that the grand unavailable total 
ived from convict labor during the two years was 52,-12. 
A deduction of this sum from the aggregate expense 
the biennium will show that the prison has not been a 
it burden upon the taxpayer. The sum received from 
rict labor during the biennium exceeds the income from 
same source in the last biennial period by $7,890.74. 

CONVICT LABOR. 

I he close of this biennium sees in effect the same contract 
the labor of inmates as was in force two years since. This 
js the Lee Broom and Duster Company the right to emir 
not less than 100 men in the manufacture of house 
»ms, whisks, and other products of such establishments. </seg>

            <seg id="p007">
128 

LAND COMMISSIONERS REPORT. 

The average number of men so engaged has been greatly in 
excess of the number specified as the minimum. This labor 
is paid for at the rate of 50 cents for each task, the latter 
varying with the kind of labor and the quality of the production. 
For a man of average intelligence and alacrity the 
task is not great, and its performance after a few months' 
experience does not take all of the working hours. At the 
completion of his task, the convict has the option of returning 
to his cell, or working overtime, if the contractor is disposed 
to permit him to do so. 

The contract with the Lee Broom and Duster Company 
expires April 1, 1905, and the matter of making other arrangements 
for the occupation of the inmates, or of continuing 
the present contract, will then come up for disposition 
by the Governor and the Board of Public Lands and Build- 

THE DISCIPLINE. 

The prison has maintained a fair degree of discipline during 
the past two years, and still further improvement along 
this line will be noticeable as the inmates become accustomed 
to their new quarters. The former lack of cell room materially 
affected the daily routine, which has just begun to again 
become normal. Severity is not a part of the maintenance 
of good order, punishments consisting of isolating the offender, 
reducing the variety of his food to a minimum, and 
taking away his good time. The cruel and barbarous methods 
employed in some institutions are not used at all; nor 
have they even seemed to be required, the great majority of 
the prisoners obeying the rules with cheerfulness. 

As an incentive to good behavior the grade system has been 
adopted, those in the first grade being given the privilege of 
wearing a cadet gray uniform. Continuous excellence in conduct 
for six months is required of the aspirant to the gray 
uniform, while violators of the rules and newcomers are compelled 
to wear the stripes for the prescribed time. The grade </seg>

institutions, and the results so far have been gratifying at 
this prison. 

Eere have been no serious outbreaks among the inmates 
ig the biennium, and the individual cases of insubordin 
have been few and inconsequential. 

SANITARY CONDITIONS. 

The advent of the new cells has, of course, brought about 
sanitary conditions much more desirable than those with 
•s hich the institution was confronted before it was possible 
to give each man suitable quarters. Each cell is provided 
with running water, both in lavatory and closet, and the unsightly 
and unhealthy "bucket" has been relegated to the 
past, where it occupies a rear seat with the whipping post 
and the ducking stool. 

Some improvements in the sewer system of the institution 
have been made, and others are in contemplation, which will 
bring the conditions still nearer to perfection, but, as a whole, 
the situation is satisfactory at the present time. 

The report of the prison physician, hereto attached, shows 
that the prisoners, as a rule, have enjoyed good health, a few 
instances of blood poisoning having proven the most obstinate 
of the hospital cases. The deaths during the biennium have 
been five, the diagnosis of each case appearing in the report 
of the physician. 

THE DIETARY. 

I be abundance of produce grown on the prison farm durthe 
past two years (an itemized list of which appears in 
:ber place) has given to the convicts' table additions that 
; been both healthful and enjoyable to a degree. Beef 
not been produced to a great extent, but fresh pork has 
l supplied very largely, and has done its share toward 
lging the monotony of the prison fare. The food bought 
er contract has been rigorously inspected by the steward, 
has been of a superior quality. </seg>

            <seg id="p009">
130 

LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT. 

A sample bill of fare for one week, excluding turnips, tomatoes, 
cabbage, radishes, and other fresh vegetables, which 
are furnished in their season, shows that hash, bread and coffee 
are furnished for breakfast, while dinner is made up of 
roast beef, baked pork and beans, potatoes, boiled beef with 
gravy, bread and coffee. The supper bill includes oatmeal 
and milk, bread, syrup, dried fruits, rice, commeal mush and 
milk, with tea for a beverage, while pie is often made a part 
of the Sunday evening meal. These dishes are given at intervals 
that afford the greatest change from one day to another, 
and the cooking is superintended with care. 

The inmates now eat at tables in the dining room, while the 
cooking is done in the kitchen, removed from the mess room, 
but connected therewith by a tunnel. This arrangement removes 
much of the odor of cooking from the main building, 
a feature that well repays the re-establishment of the culinary 
department. 

REPAIRS AND IMPROVEMENTS. 

The west building, almost totally destroyed by fire in 1899, 
has been again made habitable, the walls having been reconstructed, 
a new roof put in place, and granolithic floors laid. 
Into the upper part of this structure have been placed the 
laundry and tailor shop, together with the shoe repairing department. 
The convicts' bathroom has also been refitted and 
made more commodious, while the engine room and electric 
light plant have been established in roomy quarters. 

I he installation of the electric lighting plant proved one 
be wisest moves of the biennium. It has not only saved 
ting bills, varying from flOO to |200 per month, but has 
&gt;led me to furnish much better, more abundant, and more 
sfactory service. It has, of course, entailed the employit 
of an addition to the engineer's force; but this increase 
he pay roll is hardly felt in view of the large saving in 
rent bills. The legislative appropriation proved ample 
the installation of the plant. </seg>

being run to the dynamo room, and this has 
marked shrinkage in the coal consumption, for the

with. Another steam saver has proven to be the 
one-half horsepower motor established in the pump 

II new stone kitchen, to which is being added a cold ¦torage 
the same material, has already been mentioned. This 
icture will, I believe, prove an excellent investment, 
it walks have been laid in various places within and withthe 
walls, while the west lawn has been filled in and 
ught np to the grade established by the east lawn, adding 
a little to the exterior appearance of the institution. 

In another place in this report will be found a tabulated 
report of the repairs and improvements, made at practically 
no cost to the state, but aggregating in value considerably 
over |10,000. 

THE LIBRARY. 

Not the least of the disasters incident to the fire of 1901 
Mas the destruction of the prison library. The absence of 
reading matter of any kind was keenly felt, and, although 
efforts were at once made to reestablish the library, nothing 
could be done effectively until the legislature made an appropriation 
for the purpose. At the close of this biennium the 
library is equipped with over 1,500 volumes, in the selection 
of which I was materially assisted by friends of the prison. 
The books for the most part consist of standard works of reference, 
histories and the classics, with a generous assortment 
of the better fiction. Volumes will be constantly added, and 
the library bids fair to become one of the best of its kind in 
the country. The elastic bookcases are used, giving the 
library a uniformity of appearance that is pleasing. 

Although it is perfectly safe to say that there are fewer 
illiterates in this institution than in any other prison in the

LAND COMMISSIONER'S REPORT. 

United States, it has been thought desirable to establish a 
school which the inmates may attend for the purpose of becoming 
more proficient in the "three Rs." Arrangements 
have not been perfected as yet for the commencement of studies, 
but are in a state of incubation. 

I report of the religious work being done, with a view of 
ing the inmates keep in mind those things which look to 
r moral and spiritual welfare, will be found in another 
e. In addition to the chaplain, whose efforts have been 
•getic, several earnest women from this city have materiassisted 
in the work of church service and Sunday school. 
Mig these are Mesdames Beck, Flowers, Hall and Evans, 
wife of the chaplain, and the matron of the prison. 

THE PAROLE SYSTEM. 

I he parole system, which I had the honor of introducing 
this state some ten years ago, is sustaining its reputation 
ji incentive to good behavior, without which it should be 
rely impossible for inmates to get the benefit of this law. 
latter provides that prisoners who are not serving sen« 
for murder in either degree may be paroled at the exition 
of the minimum term applicable to the crime for 
ch they were convicted, and that those serving sentence 
murder may be paroled at the end of twenty years. The 
excludes from the parole privilege those who have served 
rm before in any penal institution. 

During the biennium but five men have violated the conditions 
of their parole by leaving the place of their employment, 
and of these three were recaptured and returned to prison. 
This record appears to show that greater discrimination was 
used in the exercise of the parole law than in the biennium 
preceding, when ten of those paroled made good their escape. 

A table, showing the complete statistics of the parole operations 
during the biennium, will be found in this report </seg>

STATE PENITENTIARY. 

THE FEMALE WARD. 

Nebraska's prison has never held many female inmates, 
and the average for the biennium. (5.6) is about the same as 
that for many years past. But those who have been unfortunate 
enough to be convicted have never been housed as comfortably 
as at present. The ward is located on the third 
floor, rear, of the main wing, where the ventilation and light 
are the best, and where the inmates may be sufficiently isolated 
from the balance of the prison. 

E r hile there is no daily task allotted to the females, they 
orm a goodly share of the necessary mending and repairand 
occupy themselves in keeping their own apartments 
; and tidy. 

The addition of a matron to the official roster was authorized 
by the last legislature, and, while she is fortunate in 
having so small a number under her charge, yet her presence 
is not less of a necessity. The discipline in this department 
has been very good, but one case of insubordination occurring 
that required punishment, the latter consisting of isolating 
the offender and forfeiting a share of her good time. 

CONVICTS' FUNDS. 

The private funds of the inmates, confided to my care, have 
reached an aggregate nearly twice that of two years ago. 
Daring the biennium over |22,000 has been handled for the 
prisoners through the office. When it is recalled that over 
9,000 transactions have been necessary for the receipt and 
disbursement of this sum (an average of less than $2.50 per 
item), some realization may be had of the immense amount 
of work required for the keeping of these accounts. 

An inmate may receive through the office money sent to 
him by his friends or relatives, or he may earn overtime in 
the shops by doing more than his alloted task. During the 
biennium the contractor paid in for such overtime nearly 
|5,000, the total monthly payments running as low as |90 
and as high as $345, the average being nearly (200. The in- </seg>

LAND COM MI SSI ONER S REPORT. 

dividual earnings varied from a few cents to a considerable 
sum monthly. Last year one prisoner earned an average of 
$16.02 per month, while another's earnings averaged f 12. OS 
per month. 

Like persons on the outside, the inmates' financial 
instincts differ materially, some of the men saving their 
money against the day of discharge, others spending theirs as 
fast as it comes in, and wishing that it would come faster, 
that it might go faster. "Order day" occurs once each month, 
and at this time the inmates may order, through the steward, 
whatever non-contraband articles of food or clothing that 
their balance will pay for. 

A SUGGESTION. 

I feel it my duty to urgently recommend to the legislature 
mendment to sec. 32, chap. 86, Compiled Statutes. As it 
stands, this section prescribes severe penalties for the 
ggling in of letters, matches, opium, weapons, and all 
r contraband articles, provided the culprit is "employed 
r about the prison as officer, guard, or employee, in whatcapacity," 
but it fails to interdict such smuggling if the 
ty one be unconnected with the penitentiary. This secshould, 
in ray humble judgment, be so amended that it 
be possible for the officers of the prison to appear as wites 
against any one, whether employee or stranger, whom 
¦ may detect in the act of bringing or sending in articles 
lout the approbation of the warden. 

During the past two years I have detected several acts of 
smuggling and have located the offenders, but have been 
utterly powerless to do any more than warn the guilty ones 
tc keep away from the premises. If this section of the statutes 
be amended as suggested, it will place in the hands of 
the warden a weapon that I know can be effectively used 
against the importation and distribution of harmful drugs 
find other contrubnnd articles </seg>

135 

STATE PENITENTIARY. 

I can not conclude these remarks without expressing my 
gratitude to the Governor for the wise counsel and invariable 
courtesy which he has accorded me, nor can I too strongly 
voice my appreciation of the unfailing friendship and cooperation 
of the members of the Board of Public Lands and Buildings. 
Neither would I feel mentally at ease were I to overlook 
a word of praise for my deputy, Mr. Delahunty, who has 
so ably seconded my efforts toward bringing this institution 
to its present plane, or were I to forget to thank the other 
officers for the parts they have taken, and the guards — "the 
men behind the gun." 

Respectfully submitted, 

A. D. Beemer, Warden.

REPORT OF THE PHYSICIAN. 

NebkasKa State Penitentiary. 
Office of the Physician. 

To the Warden : 

Ihave the honor to submit the following report covering 
biennial period ending November 30, 1904, and its brevurill, 
I trust, especially commend it to your consideration. 
i with some pride that the belief is stated that the records </seg>

            <seg id="p034">

STATE PENITENTIARY. 

of the institution fail to show a smaller death rate than that 
which appears in the hospital table appended hereto. This 
pride is not at all selfish, but is the result of gratification 
over the sanitary and dietetic changes which you have made 
in the prison, and which, in turn, have made possible the excellent 
record of my department. 

I nee I assumed my official duties at this institution, these 
tges hare been constantly going on; the congested eondiof 
the cellhouse has been relieved, the spirit of expanhas 
materialized in the heretofore cramped culinary 
irtment, the bathing facilities have been enlarged, quans 
of disease-breeding and microbe-concealing debris have 
i removed from the prison premises, the sewer system 
been amplified, and healthful conditions made to prevail 
e generally In and about the institution. 

Iich inmate is now housed in light, airy, well-ventilated, 
comfortable quarters, with the most modern of sanitary 
ires at his command, and with the least possible excuse 
contracting illness. Your arrangement for doing the 
ing in a structure apart from the dining room haa 
en a powerful agent for health and comfort, and the 
pulous cleanliness which you demand in all parts of the 
)n has played the funeral dirge for germs of contagious 
infectious disease. 

As is doubtless the case in many prisons, syphilis and 
rheumatism are the more obstinate of the ailments with 
which I have had to contend as physician at this institution. 
Considerable study has been devoted in many penal institutions 
to the prevalence and increase of tuberculosis among 
the inmates, but here I have not had many cases of this sort, 
and those to which my attention has been drawn have been 
as a rule of a mild type. 

It has been my policy not to wait until a malady has become 
fully developed before attacking it, but where I have 
found an inmate in an anaemic condition to take immediate </seg>

            <seg id="p035">
156 


system, and if possible ward off the threatened illness. I 
believe that at this institution more attention is paid to the 
physical well-being of the inmate than in most establishments 
of the kind, and I heartily commend the warden's custom 
in this regard. I believe that money can not more effectively 
be used than in improving the inmate's physical 
condition and in maintaining the improved condition when 
once it is established. 

Iiis argument is advanced, not so much because physical 
are means uninterrupted labor on the part of the in&gt;, 
but because bodily health induces mental tranquillity, 
the latter stands for tractability and lack of nervousand 
a more pronounced disposition to obedience to 
i and regulations. Hence I am strongly imbued with 
belief that discipline becomes a comparatively simple 
«r when proper attention is paid to the physical pros;y 
of the persons under restraint. 

I would respectfully urge upon you the necessity for ening 
the hospital facilities, so that isolation in certain 
s might more readily be accomplished. And I would 
;est that porcelain-lined bathtubs be placed in the hos[ 
at an early date. I do not attempt the relative rating 
leanliness and Godliness, but certainly the former is an 
lute requisite for the successful combat of disease, and 
present facilities for bathing in the hospital are inade- 

Iie female ward is especially to be commended on account 
» perfectly healthy atmosphere and commodious arement. 
And here it is not out of place for me to heartily 
k the matron of the prison for the valuable assistance 
a my department, for she has not only ministered faith' 
to the wants of her ward, but has been ever thoughtful 
le needs of the sick and distressed in other quarters and 
rendered them that aid which is foreign and impossible 
lie attending physician. 

conclusion I wish to seize this opportunity of expressi 
you my appreciation of the many official and personal </seg>

courtesies which you have extended to me, of the valuable 
counsel which you have invariably offered me, and of the 
many ways in which you have made my duties lighter and 
more agreeable. I also desire to extend my thanks to your 
deputy, Mr. Delahunty, and to Messrs. Baumann and Fairfield, 
for the favors shown me in their respective departments. 


Respectfully submitted, 

E. L. Holyoke, Physician.

LAND COMMISSIONER S REPORT. 

REPORT OF THE CHAPLAIN. 

Nebraska State Penitentiary. 
Office of the Chaplain. 

To the Warden : 

The following report is respectfully submitted: 

Kwas appointed to the office of chaplain by the Governor 
July 1, 1903. Accepting the appointment as a call from 
1 to that work, I entered upon my labors immediately 
y the dedication of the chapel, which took place July 5. 

Services have been held every Sabbath morning, the prisoners 
being required to attend unless excused by illness. 
The average number of visitors present has been about fifty. 
The singing has been led by the prison choir. 

Eniost immediately upon taking up the work, a Sunday 
}1 was organized with a membership of about fifty, 
h was later increased to nearly one hundred. A session 
e Sunday school has been held every Sunday. 

As soon as it was made practicable, a mid-week prayer 
meeting was instituted. This was about two months before 
the close of the biennium. The attendance, which is voluntary, 
has averaged about fifty. A number take part in 
prayer and testimony. 

A good interest has been manifest in all of the meetings 
held. Singing seems to be a source of never-failing pleasure. 
In the Sunday school and prayer meeting all join heartily 
in this part of the service. 

fie sacrament of the Lord's Supper has been twice adstered, 
and five persons have been baptized on profesof 
faith in Christ. The Sabbath afternoons have been 
ted to personal work, the distribution of reading matand 
vifriting the sick. 

Eroughout all of our work the object has been to present 
3t as the Savior of men. Some have believed on Him

Nearly everyone whose sentence has expired has been interviewed 
previously, and if he so desired has been met at 
the prison upon his release. Through the courtesy of railroads, 
half -fare rates have been procured for those desiring 
them. 

fppreciation of the services of all those who have conated 
to the success of the work of the Lord is hereby 
efully acknowledged. Through the courtesy of the 
•den, large liberty has been given us in carrying forward 

And now, with thanksgiving unto God, in view of the gracious 
work which He here hath wrought in the hearts of 
men, we* devoutly exclaim : "Thine is the kingdom, and the 
power, and the glory, forever. Amen." </seg>
