            <seg id="p005">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL His Excellency, Adam McMullen, Governor of Nebraska. Sir: Your attorney general has the honor to submit herewith a brief report of the work of his department for the biennium ending January 3, 1929. This report contains a summary of the more important activities of the Depart - ment of Justice. For convenience we have added a supplemental index on state statutes and constitutional provisions which have been construed or cited. The report sets forth a list of cases handled, cases still pending and disposition of cases decided in the various courts, state district courts, state supreme court, federal district court, circuit and supreme courts, commissions, etc. BANKING This department has used its best efforts in the prosecu - tion of violation of banking laws and has cooperated with the Department of Trade and Commerce and the Guarantee Fund Commission wherever possible, believing that such efforts would aid in safeguarding the state banking system. While the supervising of the banks is under the Department of Trade and Commerce and the liquidation and receivership work is handled by the Guarantee Fund Commission in con - junction with the department, still this department has given much time to answering legal questions from said de- </seg>
            <seg id="p006">8 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL partment and said commission and we just prepared an answer to the petition in the case of Abie State Bank v. The Governor and the Secretary of the Department of Trade and Commerce; which action is an attempt to enjoin the Depart - ment of Trade and Commerce from levying an assessment on the banks under the guaranty law of the State for the purpose of paying depositors. LOAN SHARKS During the biennium the attention of this department was called to the fact that two loan companies in the city of Omaha through extortionate contracts and arrangements were feeding on the misfortunes of over three thousand labor - ing people and that said companies in certain instances were collecting interest to the extent of 25 per cent. This de - partment immediately brought suit against said companies in the Supreme Court of the state and has obtained an order from the referee which not only enjoins, restrains and pro - hibits said unfair practices, and usurious rates of interest, but which amounts in substance to an ouster of said com - panies from the state. This is another illustration of the effective work of this department in protecting the public through the equity courts. RAILROAD TAX CASES The litigation involving the taxes of five of the rail - roads of this state has occupied a vast amount of the time of this department. It began in 1921 and was not concluded until 1928. It commenced with the suits filed by the Chicago and North - western and the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha. Later the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy, the Missouri Pacific and the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific also brought suits covering taxes for other years, making altogether twenty -five such suits. The substance of the charges in each of the twenty-five cases was that the railroads were over-assessed while other </seg>
            <seg id="p007">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 9 forms of property, and particularly farm lands, were under - assessed, and that the resulting discrimination was inten - tional. Interlocutory injunctions were granted in all of the cases on the basis that the railroads pay seventy-five per cent (in two cases sixty per cent) of their taxes based upon the assessments. The cases were all referred to special masters for the purpose of taking the evidence and making findings. After protracted hearings two of the masters filed reports. The cases were concluded before the third master filed his re - port. Under the findings and decisions of the masters the railroads were not liable for further payments and were declared already to have paid more, under the order requir - ing a payment of seventy-five per cent of the taxes levied against them, than could legally be charged against them. Some of the railroads amended their petitions and asked that they be granted judgments for such over-payments. Exceptions to the reports of the masters were filed by this department on behalf of the defendant State Tax Com - missioner and the county treasurers. Upon hearing to the court the report of the special masters were set aside, the claim for repayments was denied and the defendants were allowed, in addition to the seventy-five per cent already paid, amounts which aggregated in the several cases upwards of three-quarters of a million dollars. All unpaid costs were taxed to the plaintiff companies. Much pressure and influence were brought to bear upon this department in an effort to get us to settle these cases. Complaint came from different sources because settlement was not made. This department took the stand that under the Constitution we were precluded from settling said cases. In my opinion the state has recovered approximately $800,000 more from the courts by trying these cases than it would have recovered by way of settlement. As indicative of the time and labor involved in the defense of these suits it should be said that the pleadings </seg>
            <seg id="p008">10 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL were long and complicated. Hearings were held before the masters at Lincoln, Omaha, Columbus, Grand Island, Sid - ney and McCook. Altogether there were upwards of 16,000 pages of typewritten testimony and a great number of ex - hibits, many of which were very extensive and intricate. This work was mainly done by the members of the office staff, only one outside attorney being employed for a period. In addition to the foregoing, there was a suit growing out of the taxation of the bridge of the Chicago and North - western over the Missouri river at Blair, Nebraska. The suit was the culmination of much disagreement between the taxing authorities and the owner of the bridge and involved quite a sum. The taxing authorities and the state prevailed. It should also be added that in the years 1927 and 1928 this department gave much time to the Tax Commissioner's office in connection with railroad and other assessments. The railroad tax litigation gave rise to many unusual and difficult situations in the administration of the revenue laws, all of which brought added burdens to this department. ESCHEATS During the past biennium the remaining claimants to the John O'Connor estate, which has been in litigation since 1913, presented their claims in the county, district and su - preme court and were defeated by this department in each. The supreme court again holds that the property belongs to the State of Nebraska, although at present there is an action pending in the Federal District Court seeking to quiet title to certain real estate in certain claimants. The last decision of our Supreme Court is full answer, in my opinion, to that action. In other words, since they were parties in the case just decided by our Supreme Court, and since the county court where the action started had jurisdiction, certainly under all reasonable rules they are precluded from proceed - ing in the Federal court. It is said that this estate amounts at present to approximately |125,000.00, which should be coming to the treasury of the State in the immediate future. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 11 LOCAL SELF GOVERNMENT While in most of the counties of the state, government is functioning about as well as could be expected, in a few of the counties of the state, local government is weak and local enforcement officers seem unable to curb conditions of law - lessness. In many instances we have been obliged to give considerable time to helping local officers in enforcing the law and in getting local government to function. The neces - sity for each unit of government to function properly and thus avoid the duplication of expense and effort cannot be over-emphasized. If the law cannot be enforced in a county by its officers then the county may, for a time at least, be - come a liability instead of an asset and a burden instead of a help to the state. The problem is simplified greatly wherever it is possible to crystallize local law enforcement sentiment behind local government. ANTI-TRUST LAWS In closing my third term as Attorney General, I desire to state that my department has maintained, as far as pos - sible, a strict enforcement of the anti-trust laws of the state in an effort to protect the public against the destructive, unfair, competitive methods of organizations that tend toward monopoly. This work has been carried on notwithstanding the many obstacles and difficulties placed in the way of the depart - ment, directly and indirectly, by those interested in resist - ing such enforcement. However, notwithstanding the efforts of the opposition, some measure of success has been secured through the courts. The destruction of small business and small plants and jobbing houses in the State and the com - petitive methods used" in several industries have been an additional source of economic disturbance and lawlessness. These statements are made in the knowledge that the methods of business have changed and are changing daily, but the laws of our state in dealing with competition and competitive methods should be observed or they should be </seg>
            <seg id="p010">12 REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL repealed. No public officer has or should have the authority to nullify the will of the Legislature as expressed in the laws. No change in business methods and no organization of business, however great, should be so powerful as to be permitted to defy the statutes and laws of the state in which these organizations do business. Among other things, this department has succeeded in curbing violations of the law by the oil industry and has secured a decree in the courts preventing unfair discrimina - tion and the destruction of the independent dealer and the resulting monopoly. It is possible now in the state for an independent dealer to function and in a measure at least to be protected from the unfair discriminations and tactics so frequently practiced heretofore and which have brought un - told injury to the people. The department has succeeded in a suit in the supreme court against several of the large creamery companies of the state which were threatening the business and existence of several farmers' cooperative organizations in the state. The restraining order obtained in this matter halted the unjust and destructive discrimination which threatened their ex - istence and this restraining order has been made permanent. During the biennium a great interstate power trust sought to destroy and prevent the maintaining of independ - ent plants in the state by unfair competition. This com - bination was selling power to the cities of north Nebraska at exorbitant rates and giving poor service and when a city sought to release itself from these rates by contracting with another company to build a plant, the interstate combina - tion discriminated against the new plant in such manner as to threaten its destruction. Tlrisj department grappled with these offending companies and prevailed in the district court and the companies were held to be in a combination in restraint of trade. They were adjudged violators of the discrimination laws of the state. They were held as violators of four sections of the anti-trust laws of the state and the common law as well and the court restrained them from all </seg>
            <seg id="p011">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 13 the acts complained of, saved the competing plant and pro - tected the people from their former condition where they were subject to such rates and service for power and light as the companies might dictate. GRAIN EXCHANGE CASE A case of unusual importance during the last biennium is that known as the State of Nebraska, ex rel 0. 8. Spillman, v. Omaha Grain Exchanye, et al. This case involves the right of the Omaha Grain Exchange to enact and enforce rules which the Legislature found to be detrimental to the farmers of the state and prohibited by law. The law is known as Senate File No. 228, and was enacted by the Legis - lature in 1927. The grain exchange authorities refused to obey the law and upon notice from the Attorney General that the state would seek to oust the corporation and close the exchange if the law was not complied with, the exchange moved to enjoin the Attorney General from enforcing the law, which requires that no grain exchange of public markets may pass a rule interfering with the agreement between the buyer and seller as to the weight of grain shipped in car load lots through a public market within the state. The Omaha market required of shippers using the market to ship Omaha weights which resulted in additional charges against the grain. The farmers' elevators and grain growers gen - erally were interested in the suit which was tried in the district court at Lincoln on the 23rd day of October, 1928.. Judge Stewart decided in favor of the state and sustained the demurrer of the state to the petition of the grain ex - change and held the law constitutional. The grain exchange thereupon appealed to the state Supreme Court. The case is of public importance and will undoubtedly be advanced by the Supreme Court and a decision rendered in the near future. May I suggest that the activities of this department on behalf of the plain people of the state, and my work in the national and international associations of Attornevs General </seg>
            <seg id="p012">14 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL resulted in my being chosen president of the International Association of the Attorneys General at its last annual meet - ing, held in Seattle. I desire to express my deep appreciation for the splendid cooperation and help of Honorable George W. Ayres, Honor - able T. J. McGuire, Honorable Lloyd Dort, Honorable Hugh LaMaster and Honorable Lester Dibble, Assistant Attorneys General, and Freda &lt;\ Rayerlein, Caroline L. Ayer, and Laura J. Mayer, stenographers in the department. No At - torney General ever had a more able or loyal staff. Each member has conscientiously and faithfully performed his duties for the state and each deserves much credit for the notable success of the department in its labors to serve the public. The stenographers of the department, by their loyalty and carefulness to detail, have also materially aided in the success of our work and the effectiveness of the &lt;lc partment. I desire to express to the people of Nebraska my deep gratitude for the many honors conferred upon me. It has been a rare privilege to serve Nebraska for six consecutive years or three terms as Attorney General. It is an honor I appreciate. Eespectfully submitted, O. S.

            <seg id="p074">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 76 AUTOMOBILES— FEE FOR FARM TRUCKS Note: This opinion disregarded by Supreme Court, which affirmed Dis - trict Court without opinion and refuses to write opinion. Schmidt v. Irwin, General Number 26549). December 19, 1927. Honorable R. L. Cochran, State Engineer, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska'. Dear Sir : You ask us to construe the provisions of Section 8379, Compiled Statutes, as amended by Chapter 152, Session Laws, 1927, pertaining to the ascertaining of the weights of trucks, and charges for the registration thereof. The law now provides for the charge of $8.00 on all trucks weighing 3000 pounds or less when loaded to advertised capacity. On trucks weighing between 3000 and 4000 pounds the registration fee is fixed at $15.00. An exception is made in the event the truck is used ex - clusively for a farm track, and where the owner signs an affidavit to that effect, that he will use the truck solely for farm purposes. The rate of $8.00 applicable to farm trucks, within the classification just designated, is $8.00 providing the weights shall not be more than 4000 pounds. On trucks weighing in excess of 4000 pounds the fee is fixed at $15.00 for the first 4000 pounds, plus fifty cents for each 100 pounds in excess of 4000 pounds. In computing the fee for trucks the total weight referred to above includes the weight of the chassis, body and cab, plus the weight of the load when loaded to the advertised capacity. Some confusion has arisen as to the manner of as- </seg>
            <seg id="p075">OPINIONS 77 certaining the weight of chassis, body and cab. The act provides upon this question as follows : "Provided, further, in case the question arises as to the weight of chassis, body and cab, the county treasurer may demand scale weigh - ing 1 certificates; in the event no weighing certificate is presented the county treasurer shall determine the weight of the body and cab by adding 30% of the advertised carrying capacity of the advertised chassis weight to determine the total weight of the truck." The clause pertaining to the adding of 30% is hardly understandable because of the difficulty of de - termining what constitutes "the advertised carrying ca - pacity of the advertised chassis weight." The advertised carrying capacity is easily ascertained, as is also the advertised chassis weight, but when the two are combined it seems quite confusing. If this means that the adver - tised carrying capacity of say 1000 pounds would be added to the advertised chassis weight of say 1600 pounds, and 30% taken of the total, the Legislature should have used the word "and" instead of "of" connecting the ad - vertised carrying capacity to the advertised chassis weight. If on the other hand, it merely refers to the advertised carrying capacity and it was intended to add 30% of that to the advertised chassis weight, then the word "of should have been eliminated and the word "to" used in - stead. On account of this difficulty and since the county treasurers may demand the scale weighing certificates we suggest that until the matter is cleared that the county treasurers do demand such weighing certificates in order to determine with some degree of justice and not merely by guess work whether or not the trucks registered coine within the #8.00 provision or the |15.00 provision, or otherwise.

LD BANKS— ANNEXATION TO CITY— INCREASE IN CAPITAL A state bank organized and chartered to do business in a village or a city of the second class is not required to increase its capital stock in order to continue in business so long as it makes no change in its location and makes no change in its original articles of incorporation. May 11, 1927. Mr. Clarence G. Bliss Secretary, Department of Trade and Commerce, Lincoln, Nebraska. Attention Mr. Marshall. Dear Sir: You inquire whether a state bank organized to do busi - ness in a village or city of the second class and chartei-ed by the State to do a banking business in such city or village, is required to increase its capital stock when such city or village is annexed to a city of the first class or metropolitan city where state banks are required to have a larger amount of capital in order to receive a charter. The correct answer to your question may not be entirely free from doubt, but I am of the opinion that such a bank is not required to increase the amount of its capital stock in order to continue in business so long as it does not change its location and makes no change in its original articles of incorporation. If at any time it seeks the approval of your department to a change in its articles of incorporation, I am of the opinion that </seg>
            <seg id="p077">OPINIONS 79 you may, with propriety, ask that the amount of its capital stock be increased, if, in your opinion, such a change is necessary and proper, in view of the fact that if it was asking now for a charter to do business in the city it could not receive such charter without it had a greater amount of capital than it had at its organization. Permit me to add that what is said herein does not necessarily apply to trust companies for the inhibition in regard to trust companies is to their carrying busi - ness in a city of a certain size without a certain amount of capital, while in the case of a state bank the require - ment is that it shall have a certain amount of capital in order to receive a charter. GWA BANKS— CONVERSION OF STATE INTO NATIONAL A state bank may be converted into a national bank without the con - sent of the Department of Trade and Commerce. July 20, 1927. Honorable Clarence G. Bliss, Secretary, Department of Trade and Commerce, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Bliss: You inquire : "Regarding the right of state banks to withdraw and become national banks, and powers of this Depart - ment in connection therewith, may a state bank con - vert into a national bank without the consent of this Department? "Regarding unpaid losses, Receivers Certificates out - standing and banks in Receivership with undetermined </seg>

"Regarding deposits covered by checking account or time certificates now in a state bank and converted into a national bank, if the national bank should fail before these time certificates or deposits, taken and accepted as state bank deposits under the Guaranty sys - tem, were fully paid or satisfied, would the holders of these state bank deposits or time certificates be entitled to protection of the Guaranty Fund?" I will endeavor to answer the above questions in the order in which they are asked. 1. I am of the opinion that a state bank may be converted into a national bank without the consent or the Department of Trade and Commerce. The Federal Statutes provide that "Any bank incorporated by special law of any State or of the United States or organized under the general laws of any State or of the United States and having an unimpaired capital sufficient to entitle it to become a national banking association under the provisions of the existing laws may, by vote of the shareholders owning not less than fifty-one per centum of the capital stock of such bank or banking association with the approval of the Comptroller of the Cur - rency be converted into a national banking association, with any name approved by the Comptroller of the Currency. "Provided, however, That said conversion shall not be in contra - vention of the State Law." Section 5514, Rev. Stat. U. S. And I know of no statutory provision of this state that the consent of the Department of Trade and Com - merce must be obtained to the conversion of a state bank to a national bank. 2. I am of the opinion that a state bank which changes to a national hank can not be required to do </seg>
            <seg id="p079">OPINIONS 81 more than see that all who are its depositors at the time the change is made are allowed to withdraw their de - posits or consent to the change, and in addition thereto pay to the State Treasurer all moneys held by such bank as its quota of the Guaranty Fund. The law of this state provides that : "Any bank may voluntarily liquidate by paying off all its de - positors in full, and paying to the state treasurer all moneys held by such bank as its quota of the guarantee fund." Sec. 8022, Comp. St. Neb. 1922. The Federal statute docs not in terms provide that a state bank must liquidate in order to be converted into a national bank ; the state law does not expressly state that the consent of the Department of Trade and Com - merce is necessary to authorize such a change and it is unreasonable to suppose that in such a case the bank which changes from a state bank to a national bank will be required to do more to protect the Guaranty Fund than it would be required to do if it were liquidating and going out of existence. 3. Depositors only have a claim against the de - positors' guaranty fund after the state bank in which they have their money deposited has become insolvent and does not have money on hand sufficient to pay them. This being true, if the insolvency does not occur until after the state bank has been changed into a national bank and has ceased to make payments to the bank guaranty fund, I doubt if the depositors can be paid out of the bank guaranty fund. GWA BANKS— DEPOSITORIES OF COUNTY FUNDS In no event is a county treasurer authorized by the law to deposit in any one bank an amount in excess of the amount of the capital stock and surplus of that bank. </seg>
            <seg id="p080">82 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL February 11, 1927. Mr. Robert Rusho, Taylor. Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your inquiry of the 9th instant I will say that under the circumstances outlined in your letter the county treasurer may deposit in your bank with the consent of the county board an amount equal to the capital stock and surplus of the bank, but there is no warrant of law for making a deposit in any greater amount under any circumstances. Chapter 86, Session Laws, 1925, which amends Sec - tion 6193, Compiled Statutes, reads in part as follows: "When the amount of money which the county treasurer desires to deposit in the banks within the county exceeds 50% of the paid capital and surplus in all the banks in such county, then the county treasurer may with the consent of the county board deposit an amount in excess thereof, but not exceeding the capital stock and surplus of any one bank." GWA BANKS— FURNISHING SECURITY WHEN FUNC - TIONING AS TRUST COMPANIES National banks functioning as trust companies are required by the Federal law to furnish similar security to that which a trust com - pany organized under the State law is required to furnish. September 26, 1927. Mr. P. D. Marshall, Chief, Bureau of Banking, Department of Trade and Commerce, Li n coin . Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of the 22d with letter of </seg>
            <seg id="p081">83 OPINIONS E. W. Stearns, Deputy Comptroller to Honorable Clar - ence G. Bliss attached, allow me to say that Sections 8071, 8072 and 8073, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska have reference only to trust companies organized under the laws of Nebraska. They only indirectly affect national banks, which may be authorized under the Federal law to act in certain fiduciary capacities similar to those per - mitted to trust companies organized under the laws of this state, but it seems to me that indirectly national banks which assume to act in fiduciary capacities similar to those permitted to trust companies organized under the state law are affected by the above mentioned sec - tions of the state law inasmuch as Section 11 (k) of the Federal Reserve Act quoted in Mr. Stearns' letter pro - vides : "Whenever the laws of a State require corporations acting in a fiduciary capacity, to deposit securities with the State authorities for the protection of private or court trusts, national banks so acting shall be required to make similar deposits and securities so deposited shall be held for the protection of private or court trusts, as provided by the State law." In other words national banks when they function as trust companies are required, not by the state law but by the Federal law, to furnish similar security to that which a trust company is required to furnish under the state law. GWA BANKS— HEARING OF CLAIMS In connection with the insolvency, liquidation or reorganization of a state bank, a district judge has power to fix the hearing on claims at chambers and in some other county in his district. </seg>
            <seg id="p082">84 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL February 20, 1928. Mr. Van E. Peterson Secretary. Guarantee Fund Commission, State House. Lincoln. Xebraska Dear Sir: In your letter of inquiry of the 15th instant you call our attention to Section 16, Chapter 30, Session Laws, 1925, which reads as follows: "In any proceeding in connection with the insolvency liquidation or reorganization of a bank, a judge of the district court shall have jurisdiction in any county in the judicial district for which he was elected to perform any official act in the manner and with the same effect as he might in the county in which the matter arose, or to which it may have been transferred and he may perform any such act in chambers with the same effect as in open court." You inquire whether it is within the discretion of the court when originally fixing the time and place for the hearing on claims, to fix it at chambers in some other «-ounty. Allow me to say in answer to your question that I am of the opinion the provision of statute above quoted clearly clothes the court with power to hear the matter in some other county in his district, and also to hear it at chambers. You inquire further whether the court may postpone the hearing and change the place of hearing to some other county and at chambers where the place of hear - ing was first fixed at the court house of the county in which the insolvent bank was located. In answer to this question I will say that I know of no reason why the hearing may • not be continued and the place of hearing changed to some other county, if notice of the time of the postponed hearing, and the place, where it is to be held is given to all claimants and other persons interested. </seg>
            <seg id="p083">OPINIONS 85 Of course the place of hearing must be within the judicial district for which the judge of the district court was elected. GWA BANKS— JOINT STOCK LAND BANK BONDS A state bank should not have in excess of twenty per cent of its capital and surplus invested in the bonds of any one joint stock land bank. September 27, 1928. Mr. Clarence G. Bliss, Secretary, Department of Trade and Commerce, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire as to the amount of bills receivable issued in the way of Joint Stock Land Bank Bonds that may be carried by a state bank. Allow me to say in answer to your question that I believe such bonds are like the notes given by any other bank or corporation insofar as the right of any state bank to make loans upon them either directly or in - directly is concerned, hence no state bank should have to exceed twenty per cent of its capital and surplus in - vested in the bonds of any one Joint Stock Land Bank. I See Section 8013, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922.) The bonds of a Joint Stock Land Bank are not gov - ernment bonds in the sense that Liberty Loan Bonds are, that is to say, they are not the direct obligations of the government. A Joint Stock Land Bank although it is in a sense a governmental instrumentality is only such </seg>
            <seg id="p084">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 86 in the same sense that a national bank is an instrumental - ity of the United States Government. I am returning herewith the two pamphlets inclosed with your letter. GWA BANKS— SECURITY FOR DEPOSIT OF PUBLIC FUNDS Security for the deposit of public money in a state bank may be taken if the bank is willing to give it. February 10, 1928. Hon. W. M. Stebbins. State Treasurer, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You call my attention to Section 14 of Chapter 30, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1925, which provides that "Wherever the law provides for the assessment of banks on the basis of the average daily deposits, the deposits which are otherwise secured shall not be included in arriving at such average amount." And you inquire whether in view of the above quoted pro - vision of statute you are justified in taking from a state bank security for a deposit of state money and whether if you do take other security for such a deposit the bank guar - anty fund is released from liability for the deposit thus secured. Allow me to say in answer to your questions : 1. That I am of the opinion that you may take from a state bank, if it is willing to give it, the same kind of se - curity that you may take from a national bank for the security of a deposit of public funds. Such security, if it is in the form of a bond, must be approved in the same way and manner that the security bonds of other banks are re - quii-ed to be approved. </seg>
            <seg id="p085">OPINIONS 87 2. Whether the taking of other security operates to release the Bank Guarantee Fund from liability in case of a loss is perhaps not altogether free from doubt, and I sug - gest, therefore, if you do take other security that it be in kind and amount such as you would be willing to accept as security for the deposit made if you knew the bank guar - antee fund was exempted from liability. GWA BANK— LOANS— TAINTED OBLIGATION Where a state bank charges ten per cent, interest upon a Joan made by it that is secured by a real estate mortgage and further pro - vides that the mortgagor shall pay the tax upon the mortgagee's interest in the real estate mortgaged, the contract is tainted with usury. February 23, 1927. Honorable Clarence G. Bliss, Secretary, Department of Trade and Commerce, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether the law as laid down in the recent decision of the Supreme Court of this state in the case of Stuart v. Durland is applicable to bank loans. In that &lt;*ase the Supreme Court said : "A mortgage which, by its express terms requires the mortgagor to pay the maximum legal rate of interest on the debt which it secures, and, in addition, to pay the taxes upon the mortgagee's interest in the mortgaged premises, is usurious." The law as thus laid down is applicable in the case of loans made by a bank, in my opinion. Where the lender charges the maximum amount of interest permitted by the law and requires in addition that the borrower pay the tax </seg>
            <seg id="p086">88 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL levied upou the lender's interest in the mortgaged real estate, it is apparent that something in excess of the maxi - mum rate of interest permitted by the law is charged. Where a somewhat less rate than the ten per cent interest permitted by law is charged, but the borrower is required to pay the tax on the mortgagee's interest in the mortgaged premises and it afterwards turns out that the amount of the interest plus the amount of such taxes somewhat ex - ceeds the maximum amount of interest allowed by law, a different question is presented. It does not follow in such a case that the contract would be usurious, for it might well be that neither the borrower nor the lender, when the contract was entered into, knew that the amount of interest charged plus the taxes on the mortgage would exceed the maximum amount of interest permitted by the law and our Supreme Court has said : "To make a contract usurious, there must be an agreement be - tween the borrower and the lender by which the latter receives or reserves a greater rate of interest than the law allows. There must be an intent on the part of the borrower to give, and of the lender to receive, interest in excess of the legal limit. Rose v. Munford, 36 Neb. 148. Menzie v. Smith, 63 Neb. 666." If a note tainted with usury is surrendered and a new note is taken for the money actually loaned, together with lcjiiil interest thereon, I am of the opinion that the new note will not be tainted with usury, the rule being that "If the tainted obligation is with the full knowledge and consent of the borrower, finally cancelled or abandoned, and a new obligation, containing no part of the usury, is executed in legal form, and sup - ported solely by the moral obligation resting upon the borrower to pay the money actually received with legal interest thereon, such new obligation ' is valid and enforceable." 39 Cyc. 1002.

November 28, 1927. Honorable Charles Smrha, MMigan, Nebraska. Dear Senator : Section 6885, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, as amended by Chapter 182, Session Laws of 1923, which is a part of the law applicable to the Home for Dependent Children, provides : "The home shall receive such dependent or neglected children of normal and sound mind as are under sixteen years of age and have been duly committed to it by any district or county of this state; and at the discretion of the board of control of state institutions, may receive for temporary care, children under sixteen years of age not so committed to it. In such cases the board shall require the parents or guardians of such 'children to pay the cost of their care and maintenance; and if the parent or guardian of such a child is unable to pay such costs, then no such child shall be received until such cost, or such portion of said cost as the parent or guardian cannot pay, shall have been met or provided for by the county board of the county wherein such child resides." Chapt. 182, Session Laws, 1923. You will observe that children may be received for temporary care at the discretion of the Board of Control even though they have not been committed to the institu - tion by any court, but in such cases either their parents or the county of their residence is required to pay the cost of Their care and maintenance.

GWA BUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS— PLEDGING ITS ASSETS A regulation is reasonable which prevents any building and loan asso - ciation from entering into any contract in the future that will have the effect of pledging its assets for the payment of a definite fixed dividend clearly in excess of that justified by its net earnings. March 19, 1928. Honorable Clarence G. Bliss, Department of Trade and Commerce, State House, Lincoln. Nebraska. Dear Sir: Referring to opinion rendered your department under date of March 6th, you say: "We wish to suggest that in paragraph two, you have referred to the rate of interest which a building and loan association may pay, rather than to the rate of dividends. As money invested in building and loan associations is represented by the issuance of capital stock, the earnings paid on such investments are properly called dividends rather than interest. "In paragraph three, we find that you have referred to the capital stock of a building and loan association as money borrowed. May we suggest that it would be proper to use the words 'money invested in' rather than 'money bor - rowed by'? </seg>
            <seg id="p089">OPINIONS 91 "In your paragraphs five and six, we notice you have referred to the rates of dividends paid by building and loan associations as a contractual rate. We wish to advise that in our supervision of building and loan associations, we have always acted on the theory that they could not pledge their assets for the payment of a definite rate of dividend as it would be in contravention of Section 8094, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which we interpreted as implying that an association could only pay such dividends as its net earnings would permit." Allow me to say in answer to the questions you sug - gest, that when I spoke of borrowed money in my former letter I had in mind capital stock, which was issued by the association with the understanding that the holder should be paid dividends at a certain fixed rate regardless of the earnings of the association. Similarly, when I referred to the rate of interest in paragraph two of my former opinion I had in mind the fixed dividend rate paid upon certain stock issued by such associations. In regard to the matter suggested in the last para - raph of the above quotation from your letter, I will say that I am of the opinion the courts will probably sustain as reasonable a regulation which will prevent any building and loan association from entering into any contract in the future that will have the effect of pledging its assets for the payment of a definite fixed rate of dividend in excess of that justified by its net earnings.

March 6, 1928. Honorable Clarence G. Bliss, Secretory, Department of Trade and Commerce, Lincoln, Xebraska. Dear Sir: You call attention to Section 8083, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which provides that "The department of trade and commerce shall have power to issue permits to and shall 'have general supervision, and control of any and all building and loan associations as in this article defined.'' and to Section 8108, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which provides that "The department of trade and commerce shall have power to make such rules and regulations for the government of all associations of the character denned in this article as may, in their judgment, seem wise and expedient." You inquire whether, in view of the above quoted pro - visions of statute the Department of Trade and Commerce has authority to promulgate a rule restricting the rate of interest which a building and loan association may pay when it pays a fixed rate. Allow me to say that I find no express provision of statute which prohibits the department from establishing a maximum fixed rate which such an association may pay for the use of money borrowed by it, neither do I find any express provision of statute which in direct terms author - izes such a regulation nor any decision of our courts in which the matter is involved. The correct answer to your question is, therefore, not entirely free from doubt. </seg>

GWA CITIES— COM &gt;EM NATION— SEWERAGE RIGHT OF WAY Mayor and city council may purchase or appropriate private property for sewerage. Procedure for appropriation. Februarv 13. 1928. Mr. L. A. Goines, City Manager, Alliance, Nebraska Dear Mr. Goines : We have your favor of the 6th instant directing our attention to Sections 4072 and 4073, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, pertaining to the rights of a city to condemn private property for public use, to-wit: the pur - pose of securing a right of way for a sewerage outlet. These sections of the statute pertain to cities of the first class having a population of more than five thousand and less than twenty-five thousand population. Section 4072 authorizes the Mayor and City Council to purchase or appropriate private property for the use of the city, sewers, etc., and such right of appropriation extends for a distance of ten miles from the corporate limits of such city. This section of the statute was construed in the case of Broirni - field v. City of Kearney et al., 94 Xeb. 419, 143 X. W. 475. </seg>
            <seg id="p092">94 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The following, section 4073, sets forth the procedure to be followed for the condemnation of such property. It pro - vides that when it shall become necessary within or with - out the city to appropriate private property for the use of said city such appropriation shall be made by ordinance. It is the dnty of the council making the ordinance to pro - vide that three disinterested freeholders of the city shall be appointed to assess the damages. After such persons have qualified, viewed the property, they shall make and sign a return to the City Clerk in writing a just and fair assessment of the damages for each piece or lot of property which is so appropriated. This part of the statute has been held valid. The latter part of the statute providing for a second board of appraisers without further notice, etc., has been held unconstitutional. The Constitution of Nebraska provides that private property shall never be taken for public use without just compensation. Another section of the state and federal constitution provides that no person shall be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law. The process of law is outlined by this sec - tion. The board is duty bound to determine the amount of damages to the property owners by the reason of taking the property for such public use. This section was con - strued in the case of WUber V. Reed, 84 Neb. 767, 122 N. W. 53. It is very important that the appraisers shall secure the service of notice upon each of the landowners affected, giving the time and place when they shall meet to deter - mine the amount of damages against the property.

            <seg id="p093">OPINIONS 95 September 19, 1927 Mr. E. ./. Caldirell, Counti/ Attorney, Webster County, Red Cloud, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether or not your county may construct and keep in repair a bridge within a municipality, where the bridge is but fifty feet in length. You call to our at - tention Section 40SO, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which refers to public bridges exceeding sixty feet in length. Even under this section it provides that the county may assist in the construction and repair of bridges within municipalities. In addition, we call your attention to Section 2733, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which provides that the County Hoard may in their discretion, whenever there is sufficient money on hand in the county road fund, build or repair any bridge or bridges within the limits of any incorporated city or village in the county. This seems to afford abundant authority for the construction of the bridge mentioned by you. LD CITIES— CONSTRUCTION OF ELECTRIC LIGHTING SYSTEM It is doubtful if the City Council in a city of the second class has authority to pledge the earnings of a municipal electric light plant over a period of four years to pay for certain improve - ments and extensions to be made to such plants. The cost of construction of an electric lighting system in such a city is not payable out of its water fund. </seg>
            <seg id="p094">96 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL April 11, 1927. Mr. Byron Busby, Clerk, Dear Mr. Busby : You inquire: "Has the City Council the authority to pass an ordi - nance pledging the earnings of a municipal electric light plant over a term of four years (in place of a bond issue) in payment of certain improvements and extensions to the municipal electric light system? "Would it be legal to pay pledges as stated above from the water fund? v The correct answer to your first question may not be entirely free from doubt. Allow me to say, however, that I have some doubt as to the strict legal right of the city council to create by ordinance a valid lien for four years upon a municipal electric light plant for the purpose of paying for the construction of same. The statute provides how the cost of a municipal light - ing system may be defrayed. It says: "The cost of such utilities may be defrayed by the levy of a tax of not to exceed five mills on the dollar valuation in any on© year, for a heating or lighting plant, and of not to exceed three mills on the dollar valuation in any one year for an ice plant, or, when such tax is insufficient for the purpose, by the issuance of bonds of the munici - pality." Section 4397, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. I do not wish to be understood as saying the city council may not use the surplus earnings of a municipal lighting system as they accrue from time to time in paying off indebtedness incurred in the construction of the system. I think it may do that. In answer to your second question, I call your atten - tion to subdivision "0" of Section 4292, Compiled Statutes Wakctield, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p095">OPINIONS 97 of Nebraska for 1922, as amended by Chapter 41, Laws of Nebraska for 1925, which reads as follows: "To provide for the purchase of steam engines or fire extinguish - ing apparatus and for a supply of water for the purpose of fire pro - tection and public use and for the use of the inhabitants of such cities and villages by the purchase, erection or construction of a system of waterworks, water mains or extension of any system of waterworks now or hereafter established or situated in whole or in part within such city or village; and for maintaining the same." In view of the foregoing provision of statute, I doubt the right of the city council to pay expenses incurred in the construction of an electric lighting system out of the water fund — at least, until such time as that fund is not needed as a .sinking fund for the payment of water bonds, or for the payment of running expenses or improvements of the water works system. GWA CITIES AND VILLAGES— CONTRACT FOR LIGHTING PURPOSES A village can not make a valid contract for the purchase of electric current from a corporation when one of its board of trustees is president of such corporation. A village cannot levy more than one mill in any one year for a heat - ing or lighting plant. A proposed village ordinance should be read three times before it is passed. A warrant should only be drawn where the money with which to pay it has been appropriated. June 4, 1927. Mr. K. A. McCall, Village Clerk, Leirelleii, Nebraska. Dear Sir: </seg>
            <seg id="p096">98 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL You say: "At the village election held April 5th one of the newly elected trustees is president and heavy stockholder of the Blue Creek Light &amp; Power Co., a local plant from which the village purchases current for street lighting, the Light Company owning the transmission lines and the village furnishing the lamps only." And you inquire: 1. Whether a contract made between the village and the Blue Creek Light &amp; Power Company will be valid? 2. Whether the village can legally purchase current from the aforesaid power company without first entering into a contract with the company? 3. Is there any limit as to the amount of the five mill levy that may be levied for light purposes? 4. In passing an ordinance where the rules have been duly suspended, and the ordinance passed on the first day read, is it necessary to read the ordinance three times on that day, or does eliminating the two days also eliminate the two readings? I will answer the above questions in the order in which they are asked. 1. A contract for the purchase of gas entered into between the village and the light and power company while the president of the company is a member of the village board of trustees, will be invalid. In an analogous case the Supreme Court of this state has held: "All officers of a city are prohibited from being- directly or in - directly interested in any contract or agreement to which the city, or any one for its benefit, is a party, and such contract may be avoided by the city." Grand Island Gas Co. v. West, 28 Neb. 852. </seg>
            <seg id="p097">OPINIONS 99 In that case the court held, however, that "Payment required. Held, that inasmuch as the city has accepted the benefits of the contract, it must do equity, 'and to do equity the city must pay to the Light &amp; Fuel Co., not exceeding the contract price, the reasonable value of the light received by it, prior to the commencement of the action, with seven per cent interest thereon." 2. I do not think the village can legally purchase cur - rent from the light and power company by a contract, either oral or written, entered into while a member of its board of trustees was the president of the company. 3. I am of the opinion that a city or village can not levy more than one mill in any year for a heating or light - ing plant. The five mill limit was placed in the law when the assessed valuation was one-fifth of the actual valuation. When the law was changed in 1921 so as to make the actual valuation the assessed valuation, what is now Section 5910 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922 was en - acted, which in effect makesi one mill the maximum rate of levy for heating and lighting purposes. 4. I know of no reason why the reading of a proposed ordinance three times may not be dispensed with by a vote of three-fourths of the village trustees, but I think the usual procedure is to merely dispense with the reading on three different days where it is desired to expedite the passage of the ordinance. Reading it three times in one day does not much delay its passage. In answer to your other questions I will say that I am of the opinion a warrant for the payment of money should not be drawn where the money with which to pay it has not been appropriated. I am of the opinion that Section 4416, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, is a valid enact - ment. GWA </seg>

June 9, 1927. Mr. J. F. Bohoe, Village Marshal, Bristoic, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether a village is responsible for the the expense incurred in enforcing a quarantine and for fumigating the residence of a family that has scarlet fever. I assume that the quarantining and fumigation were done in conformity with the rules and regulations adopted by the State Department of Public Welfare. If so, or if they were done in conformity with the provisions of some ordinance of the village, I am of the opinion the village should pay the necessary expenses of same. Section 8223, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides, among other things, that "All necessary expenses incurred in the enforcement of such rules and regulations shall be paid by the city, village or county, for and within which the same shall have been incurred." In the case of Shidier v. York County, 95 Neb. 652, the court said : "A duly licensed physician, acting under the order of the state board of health in quarantining and suppressing a highly contagious disease, may recover of the county, where such disease was prevalent, the actual expenses incurred by him and the reasonable value of his services."

Dear Sir The law which pertains to officers of a village being interested in a contract in which the village is interested is as follows : "Any officer of any village in this state who shall hereafter be interested, directly or indirectly, in any contract to which such village is a party, or who shall enter into any contract to furnish, or shall furnish to any contractor or subcontractor with the village of which he is an officer, any material to be used in performing any contract with such village, shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined in any sum not less than one hundred dollars nor more than one thousand dol - lars." Section 4416, Comp. Stat. Neb. 1922. You will note that this section says "interested directly or indirectly." The determination of the matter of interest would be a question of fact in each particular case. The Supreme Court does not seem to have passed upon this par - ticular section. LD </seg>

June 7, 1927. Mr. Jesse 8. Good, Cozad, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Good : We have your inquiry stating that recently the Village of Cozad lias narrowed one of the streets which results in placing the lot line of the landowner ten feet nearer the center of the street. You have called our attention to Sec - tion 4 of Chapter VIII, page 17 of the Revised Ordinances for 1912 of the Village of Cozad, which provides: "It shall be unlawful for any person, persons, firm or corporation to move any frame building or buildings other than such as are pro - vided for in Section 2 of this chapter, to a place within said fire limits, or to remove such building from one place within said fire limits to another place within said fire limits." Also Section 7, which provides: "Any building placed within the fire limits in violation of these provisions, or moved from one place in said limits to another place therein, or raised in violation of the foregoing provisions, may be condemned by a resolution of the mayor and council and ordered re - moved or lowered, and the owner or person having control of the same shall remove or lower said building within ten days after a copy of said resolution is delivered to such owner or person in charge of the same.

            <seg id="p101">OPINIONS 103 the city ordinances you are prohibited from moving this building ten feet forward to be in line with the new side - walk line. Your inquiry involves the construction of the words "or move from one place in said limits to another place therein." The ordinance gives no special definition to the word "place" and is somewhat indefinite as to just what is in - tended by the use of this word. It is a rule of construction that where no special definition is given to the use of the word that such words shall be given their usual and ordinary meaning. In Webster's Dictionary the word "place" is defined, "A proper or suitable spot or location considering all things." It is further defined as "a locality or spot occupied as a dwelling place or the like." In the case of Brookline v. Hatch, 45 N. E. 756, 167 Mass. 380 (381), 36 L. R. A. 495, the court said : "The word 'place' has a broad signification and applies, not only to buildings, but also to any enclosure, whether covered or not." We have examined your ordinance and giving the word its usual meaning of location, it is our opinion that the ordinance here prohibits the moving of a wooden structure from one location or lot to another location or lot and that such ordinance would not prohibit you from moving your building forward on the same lot or location to attach to the sidewalk. We are returning the copy of your ordinance and photo - graphs of your building. LB </seg>

Allow me to say that in mj r opinion they cannot. If it was desired to reserve an option to pay them off after five years, that option should have been set out in the bonds. It may be that if the bonds were any kind of city bonds other than district paving bonds, the option though not written in the bonds would be implied from Section 4159, Compiled Statutes, but as I read the pro - visions of Section 4159, Compiled Statutes, it exempts district paving bonds from the bonds which are made payable after five years at the option of the city.

GWA CITIES AND VILLAGES— SALE OF ELECTRIC LIGHT DISTRIBUTING SYSTEM A city of the second class or a village may sell its electric light dis - tributing system without a vote of the electors if no real estate is included in the sale and if it has not adopted the initiative and referendum. February 28, 1928. </seg>
            <seg id="p104">106 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Mr. F. R. Kingsley, Minden, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether a city or village can sell its electric light distributing system without a vote of the people? Allow me to say that in my opinion a city of the second class may sell its electric light plant without a vote of the electors, where a sale of real estate is not involved, if it has not adopted the initiative and refer - endum system of government. Section 4252, Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides among other things that "Cities of the second class and villages * * * may * • * convey property real or personal, * * * Provided real property shall only be conveyed by the proper authorities of such city or village when authorized by a vote of the electors thereof." The fact that the law states specifically that a con - veyance of real estate can only be made when authorized by a vote of the electors, but says nothing about such a vote when the subject of sale is personal property, is some indication that a vote is not necessary to authorize a sale of personal property. In most such cases I presume the sale will involve real estate or at least some interest in real estate, such as a lease, for a period of time greater than one year, and where this is so, it is advisable, I think, to have a vote upon the question of sale for it is elsewhere said: "The term 'real estate' * * * shall be construed * * * as embracing: all chattels real except leases for a term of not exceeding one year." Section 5586, Compiled Statutes, 1922. The power of the mayor and city council to act with - out a vote of the people in a city of the first class and in a metropolitan city is fully as great as it is a city of the second class, or a village.

            <seg id="p106">108 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL June 1, 1927. Honorable John M. Paul, Attorney at Law, Harvard, Nebraska Dear Mr. Paul: In your letter of May 26th you say: "I herewith enclose copy of franchise ordinance granted by the city council of Harvard, which franchise grant will expire in fall of 1929. The franchise right ia now owned by the Harvard Electric Company but all the stock is held in trust by a trustee for the Southern Power Company, and the Southern Power Company has in turn sold to the Insul interests. "Now these final owners are starting to construct a high power line through the city and without any further authority from the city other than this ordinance under which they claim have already set several 40 ft. poles along the line which they purpose to use, and over which they intend to carry a 33,000 volt current of electricity. ''I have asked them to discontinue their construction work within the city limits until we can obtain an opinion from your office as to their right to do this. "It is my opinion that the ordinance does not give them the use of the streets for carrying of current other than such as is manufactured by the local plant which is unattached as yet to any outside transmission line. The local plant is a D. C. 220 Diesel engine plant. And no lines over the city carry a voltage in excess of 220 at present. "It is my contention also that the construction of such a high power line through the city imposes a burden upon the city which the franchise does "not contemplate, and the furnishing of electricity from without the city limits is not contemplated by the franchise, and that the </seg>
            <seg id="p107">OPINIONS 109 company lias no right to the streets for such added burden without further grant of right by the council. "Now the local managers of the work have kindly agreed to cease work until we can obtain this opinion from you. I am sorry to impose upon you in this matter, but it is a case in which I am not absolutely sure and so shall rely upon your decision in the matter. "What I am afraid of here is that after franchise has expired that Insul will claim right to continue high power cable over city. Or is it your opinion that when franchise expires and new one is not granted their right to streets will terminate?" In reply will state that it seems the main question involved is whether the franchise holder, whose rights are measured by the franchise originally granted to O. J. Shaw, can legally build a 33,000 volt electric transmis - sion line through the city of Harvard? Franchise grants are strictly construed. The fran - chise in this instance gives the holder the right to build along and over the streets and alleys such electric lines as are necessary and proper to give electric service to the citizens of Harvard. It is clear that the franchise contemplated that the electric energy used would be generated in the local plant. Probably by implication it might be said that the com - pany would distribute over such lines electric energy re - ceived from some distant plant. Electrical engineering practice appears to not re - quire higher voltage on the local distribution system than 110 to 2300 volts. So long as the lines that are built by the franchise holder are solely to serve the citizens of Harvard and not higher or more dangerous voltage is used than is normally regarded proper from an engineering standpoint </seg>
            <seg id="p108">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 110 to serve the citizens of Harvard it would seem that the franchise holder is within his rights. However, when the franchise holder seeks to place upon the streets and alleys of Harvard an electric line that will carry electric energy for other towns, as well as Harvard, he is attempting to place an additional burden on the streets and alleys of Harvard, and one that was not contemplated in the original franchise as evidenced by its context. Further, when the franchise holder seeks to build through Harvard an electric line carrying the much more dangerous 33,000 voltage, and being a voltage not needed on the local distribution system, but desired by the fran - chise holder, because he seeks to serve many towns over a transmission line connected with distant station or sta - tions he is then placing upon the streets and alleys of Harvard an additional burden, and one not contemplated in the original franchise. The Harvard city officials would have the undoubted right under the general police powers to prohibit and bar the use of 33,000 volts or any voltage higher than 2300 to 2400 on the ground of the greatly increased hazard and danger to life and property from the use of 33,000 volts, when a voltage of 2300 to 2400 is the highest needed for the local distribution system. The Harvard officials would be justified in saying to the franchise holder if he desires to use on his lines in Harvard electric energy supplied by his distant station over his 33,000 volt transmission line, he should install a step-down transformer sub-station just outside the city limits, and there reduce the voltage to 2300 or 2400 before entering the city. The Harvard officials under the broad police powers of the city have the right and I am inclined to think it is their duty to require such construction of electric lines as will not unduly jeopardize life and property. </seg>
            <seg id="p109">OPINIONS 111 As stated heretofore franchise grants are strictly construed. The following authorities are helpful and pertinent : "The right or privilege of using the streets for purposes other than those for which the streets are ordinarily used is a franchise, as the right to make use of the public streets for railroad or other like purposes, for the purpose of delivering electricity to consumers, etc." 26 C. J. 1012. "Generally, all that is granted by the grant of a franchise must be found in the plain terms of the grant and nothing passes by im - plication, except where it may be necessary to carry into effect the obvious intent of the grant • * * b u t the mere fact that the state in the grant of a franchise did not foresee circumstances which might arise in the future will not authorize the holder of the franchise to extend his rights thereunder to include a new state of facts. The grantee of a franchise cannot lawfully exercise thereunder rights that are not granted in the franchise, although such rights are of a similar character, and an attempt to do so will cause the grantee to become a mere trespasser." 26 C. J. 1033. (Cases to support above are cited in foot notes, pp. 1033- 1034 of 26 C. J.) In Indianapolis Cable Street Ry. Co. v. Citizens Street Ry. Co., 127 Ind. 369, 24 K E. 1054, 26 N. E. 893, 8 L.

OSS CITY TREASURER— LIABILITY FOR DEPOSIT A city treasurer is liable on his bond for money deposited by him in a bank outside the county that has not given bond for the safety of such deposit. August 24, 1928. Mr. Barlow Xyc, City Attorney, Kearn ey . Xeb raska Dear Sir You say "Sections 414!), 4130 and 4151 provide that the City Treasurer will deposit the funds of the city in banks in the county and these depository banks will furnish their depository bonds to be approved by the Mayor. The banks in Buffalo County are refusing to furnish a de - pository bond and the City Treasurer is at a loss to know what he shall do with the city funds. It has been sug - gested that the City Treasurer deposit the city money in banks outside of the county who are willing to put up the required depository bonds. This, however, is not strictly in compliance with the letter of the law. </seg>
            <seg id="p111">OPINIONS 113 "If you know of any Nebraska decisions affecting this proposition we would be pleased to have them. We would also be pleased to have your interpretation of the three sections cited, especially with reference to the per - sonal liability of the City Treasurer in event he deposits the ciiy funds in banks in the county who refuse to make application for bond." Allow me to say in answer to your letter that I am of the opinion the City Treasurer will be responsible on his bond for any money that he may deposit in any bank that is not doing business in the county and has not given the bond required by the provisions of statute above quoted unless it is a state bank doing business in the county which in my opinion is exempted by a later law from the requirement that it shall give bond. The concluding sentence of Section 8027 which is a part of the bank guaranty fund law provides that "No bank which has complied in full with all of the provisions of this article shall be required to give any further security or bond for the purpose of becoming a depository for any public funds, but de - pository funds shall be secured in the same manner that private funds are secured."

GWA CONGRESS— DEATH OF NOMINEE In absence of Congressional Committee, vacancy can be filled by State Committee. June 23, 1928. Honorable Edgar F. Ferneau, Chairman, State Republican Central Committee, Auburn, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Ferneau : You call attention to the death of the Honorable Melvin O. McLaughlin, republican nominee for Congress in the Fourth Congressional District, and request an opinion from this department with respect to the pro - cedure for filling such vacancy on the ticket. In reply would suggest that Section 2122, Compiled Statutes, 1922, as amended by Chapter 97, House Roll 182, page 276, of the Laws of Nebraska for 1927, among other things provides : "Should a vacancy or vacancies for any office arise for any cause * * * before the elections, such vacancy or vacancies shall be filled by the majority vote of the proper committee of the same political party." If there is a proper and legally constituted congres - sional party committee of the republican party in the Fourth Congressional District of Nebraska I think it should fill this vacancy. If there is no such committee I am of the opinion that the State Central Committee of the Republican party may fill the vacancy. </seg>
            <seg id="p113">OPINIONS 115 Under Section 2119, Compiled Statutes, 1922, as amended by Chapter 108, Session Laws, 1925, a state political committee is clothed with the power to bring an action to determine the legality of the nomination of any candidate for a congressional office. In case there is a vacancy in the list of the party candidates for the office of presidential elector it can fill that vacancy. State v. Wait, 92 Neb. 313. Surely it is not unreasonable to assume that the state central com - mittee has authority to fill a vacancy that may occur by reason of the death of the party nominee for the office of Congress after the primary election if there is no other committee clothed with that power. In this connection I would suggest that it seems the only committees of political parties that are expressly mentioned and their method of creation provided for by the law are the State Central Committee and the County Central Committees. Section 2164, Compiled Statutes, 1922, which at - tempted to repeal Section 2208, Chapter 90, House Roll 323, of the laws of Nebraska for 1919, was suspended by a referendum and defeated, leaving said law of 1919 ap - parently in full force and effect, unless some part of same be repealed by implication. This law provides among other things : "Delegates so elected shall constitute the county convention and from the membership of the county convention shall be organized all necessary party committees for the various political subdivisions of the state, not otherwise provided for, on a basis promulgated by the state central committee. All party committees shall have power to fill vacancies in their committees." Hence, if there is in the Fourth Congressional Dis - trict a proper congressional committee of the republican party, consisting of members of the county conventions in the several counties of the district, and organized on a basis promulgated by the State Central Committee, 1 believe such committee would have the power to act in </seg>
            <seg id="p114">116 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL the premises, but unless there is such Congressional Com - mittee so organized, the power to fill such vacancy in my opinion, as heretofore suggested, is in the State Central Committee. There are perhaps different courses that the com - mittee might take in filling such vacancy. It will be remembered that the last state republican convention gave the state central committee authority to fill all vacancies. In view of the law on the subject and this resolution by the state committee, I believe a court would sustain the committee in making the appointment itself. However, a method which might appeal to the Committee and others concerned and in harmony with the principles of local self government or self determination would be for the state chairman or the state committee to request the chairman of the county central committee in each county in the Fourth Congressional District to call a meeting of the county central committee and have such committee select a representative to act as a congressional delegate from that county to the congressional convention to be held in said district for the purpose of selecting a candi - date to fill the vacancy on the ticket. When such congressional district convention shall have chosen the nominee I would suggest as a further precaution that it would be advisable for the state com - mittee to meet and to ratify such appointment, in fact, it would be well to make such appointment the state com - mittee's appointment. This is one suggested method and a plan that I believe the courts would sustain. There is possibly no course that you can take that will satisfy everybody, but under the circumstances and the law either of the above courses, at least, in my opin - ion, is open to you. OSS </seg>

November 18, 1927. Jlr. Leonard Denstnore, Secretary, Nebraska State Raihcay Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir : I have been asked by the Accounting Department of the State Railway Commission for an opinion as to what items of indebtedness are included in the term "Floating Debt" in the sixth paragraph of Section 5495, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amended by Chapter 171, Laws of Nebraska for 1923, page 405. The chapter relates to annual reports by common carriers to the Nebraska State Railway Commission. The sixth paragraph is as follows : "The amount of the floating debt of the company, with the pur - pose for which the debt was incurred." The fourth paragraph provides: "The amount of outstanding bonds of the company, the date and purpose of their issuance and the rate of interest thereon." The term "floating debt" in the sixth paragraph seems to be used in contradistinction to the term "outstanding bonds" in the fourth paragraph and to embrace all un - secured obligations of the company.

Dear Jack: After investigating the matter referred to in your letter of May 2nd, I have come to the conclusion that corpora - tions seeking dissolution should give the notice provided in the same manner as that required for a change in the Arti - cles of Incorporation. Section 467, Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides: "Every change in any of the above matters shall be recorded and published in the same manner as the original articles are required by law." This undoubtedly refers to a prior section, Section 465, Compiled Statutes, 1922. In the fifth division of this sec - tion there is a reference to the time of commencement and </seg>

Therefore, unless the corporation is becoming extinct on account of the expira - tion of the time for which it was created, we think notice of dissolution should be published in the manner indicated. An oral opinion was given to this effect to the office of the Secretary of State yesterday in answer to an inquiry from other persons. LD CORPORATIONS— FOREIGN— DOING BUSINESS Storage of goods within this state constitutes doing business within the state by a foreign corporation if such storage furthers the business of the corporation. May 14, 1928. Mr. H. A. Earing, Woodland, Ulster County, New York. Dear Sir: In your letter of May 9th you request information on the question whether it will be necessary for a foreign corporation which has not been otherwise obliged to domes - tic-ate, to do so, if it ships to a warehouse in this state a stock of goods for storage. In the case of Tomson v. Iowa State Traveling Men's Association, 88 Neb. 399, it was held : "A single transaction by a foreign corporation may constitute a doing of business in this state within the meaning of the statutes of the state making certain requirements of foreign corporations con - ditions precedent to their doing business in the state, where such transaction is a part of the ordinary business of such corporation and indicates a purpose to carry on a substantial part of its dealings here." </seg>
            <seg id="p118">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 120 If this storage is for the purpose of furthering the busi - ness of the corporation, or is instrumental thereto, we are of the opinion that the coi'poration would be obliged to do - mesticate. We cannot see from the information you furnish us that such storage would not be incidental to the business of the corporation. LCD CORPORATIONS— FOREIGN— OCCUPATION TAX Foreign corporations must pay the corporations. same occupation tax as domestic June 26, 1928. Mr. Frank Marsh, Secretary of State, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir : You state that some foreign corporations are protest - ing against payment of the same annual occupation tax as that provided to be paid by domestic corporations. Upon page 521 of the Reports and Opinions of the Attorney Gen - eral for the years 1923-11)24, appears an opinion written by the writer of this opinion, upon this subject. That opinion held, as we now hold, that foreign corporations are required to pay the same amount of occupation tax as domestic corporations. In support of this conclusion we first call your atten - tion to Section 1 of Article XII of the Constitution of Ne - braska, which, among other things, provides that foreign corporations shall not be given greater rights or privileges than are given domestic corporations of a similar character. Section 684, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides that foreign corporations for profit doing business </seg>
            <seg id="p119">OPINIONS 121 in this state shall pay to the Secretary of State as an an - nual fee the same amount as the annual fee prescribed in the third next preceding sections for corporations in - corporated under the laws of this state. The section referred to is now Section 081, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which provides for the payment of the annual fee or occupation tax upon a basis computed according to the amount of the paid up capital stock as stated in said sec - tion. It therefore follows that all corporations in paying the said occupation tax pay the tax in accordance with the amount of the paid up capital stock as indicated. This applies to foreign corporations. Recently you presented to the writer some authorities from an attorney representing a foreign corporation. These authorities, however, referred entirely to the subject of taxa - tion generally and not to the subject of the license or occu - pation tax paid for the privilege of doing business. The cases cited by that attorney, therefore, are not in point. The following authorities sustain our conclusion : Horn Silver Min. Co. v. W. Y., 143 U. S. 305, 306, 307, 308, 315, 317. General Ray. Signal Co. v. Virginia, 246 U. S. 500. Cheney Bros. Co. v. Mass., 246 U. S. 147. Western Union Tel. Co. v. Kansas, 216 U. S. 1 Alpha Cement Co.. v. Mass., 268 U. S. 204. Baltic Mining Co. v.

S. v. Minnesota, 223 U. S. 335, 344. The first case cited specifically holds that a state has the right to fix the specific license tax proportioned to the amount of the capital of the corporation. It also holds that the foreign corporation has no legal right to complain </seg>
            <seg id="p120">122 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL that it is subjected to the same law with the domestic corporation. It also holds that whether or not the law should be construed to be a tax law or not does not affect the validity of the tax. However the law be regarded, it is the condition upon which a foreign corporation may do business in this state, and this state has a right to prescribe conditions. These conclusions are further sustained by the following authorities : 49 A. L. R. 727. Fire Ass'n, etc. v. N. Y., 119 U. S. 110. New York v. Roberts, 171 U. S. 658. Norfolk d- W. R. Co. v.

LD CORPORATIONS FOREIGN— SALE OF STOCK THERE OF IN STATE A corporation not authorized to do business in Nebraska need not apply to the State Railway Commission for permission to sell its stock in this state. </seg>
            <seg id="p121">OPINIONS 123 June 18, 1928. Mr. Leonard D. Densmore, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir : The question propounded by you in your letter of June 15th has been considered. The question is: "An Iowa corporation, not authorized to do business in Nebraska, desires to offer its own capital stock for sale in this state. Must it obtain the authorization of the Nebraska State Railway Commission therefor?" The opinion of this department is that such authoriza - tion is not required. The term "doing business" as used in Section 676, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amended, seems to refer to an exercise of the functions for which the corporation was created and not to the sale of its own capital stock. No case has been found that covers the question exactly, but the following bear upon it and lead to the conclusion above expressed: Bartlett v. Chateau Ins. Co., 18 Kan. 369. Pavilion Co. v. Hamilton, 15 Pa. Sup. Ct. 389. Galena Min. etc. Co. v. Frazier, 20 Pa. Sup. Ct. 394. Atkinson v. U. S. Operating Co. (Minn.), 152 N. W. 410.

Dear Sir: You say the South Omaha Aerie No. 154, Fraternal Order of Eagles, has applied to your office for a license to conduct boxing and wrestling shows, and that this order, although incorporated in 1905, has failed to pay the yearly corporation tax levied against non-profit corporations. You inquire whether this is sufficient ground for the refusal of a license to conduct boxing and wrestling shows. In answer to your question allow me to say that the law does not make a failure to pay the general license tax ground for refusing a. corporation a license to conduct box - ing and wrestling shows, but you are not required to issue such a license. The language of the statute which clothes your department with power to issue licenses in such cases is permissible rather than mandatory.

There are several questions which have come up for deci - sion as to the method of procedure in disposing of this matter, and it has occurred to the writer no doubt your department is informed on these different points and I would appreciate it very much if yon would hand this letter to the proper officer and would appreciate it very much if the following questions would be answered to the undersigned : "1.

If an original signer withdraws his name, can he afterward sign a Remonstrance Petition, and should it be considered by the County Board? "3. Is a land owner, who resides in town, deriving his income from renting his land to tenants, entitled to sign a petition, or a remonstrance petition?" I will endeavor to answer the above questions in the order in which thev were asked : 1.

            <seg id="p124">126 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL withdrawal of a name is permissible after the petition has been filed with the County Clerk. 2. If an original signer withdraws his name from the petition before it is filed with the County Clerk, I am of the opinion he may afterwards sign a remonstrance and have his name counted, provided he is otherwise qualified to sign the remonstrance. Under the provisions of Section 1, Chapter 1, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1923, as amended by Chapter 55, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1927, one whose name appears as a signer on the original petition (as filed) is barred from having his name counted on a remonstrance. 3. A land owner who is a bona fide resident of the county and actually and actively engaged in farming therein may be a petitioner for the employment of an agri - cultural agent in the county or may sign a remonstrance against same. I doubt, however, whether one whose only interest in farming operations is merely that of a landlord receiving either money or a share of the crop as rent, and without any part in the actual management of the land, is actually and actively engaged in farming. This is a matter, how - ever, that possibly is not entirely free from doubt. GWA COUNTY BOARDS— ASCERTAINING COUNTY POPULATION Population formerly ascertained by the best evidence obtainable. Statute fixed the manner of ascertaining the fact. (Note — This statute held void by Supreme Court.) April 27, 1927. Mr. Carl H. Hoge, County Clerk, Platte County, Columbus, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p125">OPINIONS 127 Dear Mr. Hoge : You inquire how the population of the county shall be ascertained for the purpose of fixing a salary of county officers. Prior to the passage of Chapter 91, page 271, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1925, this department ren - dered an opinion which seems to have been controlling and which held that county boards could ascertain the popula - tion of the county for the purpose of fixing salaries by con - sideration of any evidence which they considered to be good and sufficient evidence to prove the population of the county to their satisfaction. Chapter 91 aforesaid, how - ever, was passed and now provides that the population shall be governed and controlled by the last preceding census taken by the federal government. LD COUNTY BOARD— LEASING ROOMS IN COURT HOUSE County Board may lease rooms in court house only after requirements of the county have been met. Mr. J. W. Fillman, County Clerk, Osceola, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether or not your county board has a right to rent or lease rooms in the court house. Section 851, Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides in set - ting forth the powers of the county, that the county shall have power "to sell, convey or lease any real or personal estate owned bv the county."

            <seg id="p126">128 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Section 852, as amended by Chapter 93, Session Laws 1925, provides that the county hoard shall have power to take and have the care and custody of all the real and per - sonal estate owned by the county and manage the county funds and the county business, except as otherwise spe - cifically provided, and to make all orders respecting the property of the county. Under these provisions of the statute we believe, there - fore, that the county board has the power to lease. We think, however, this power is restricted further by the re - quirement that the county board shall first make due pro - vision for all county officers and employees to the exclu - sion of all other persons, and that the county board can lease only the excess space.

I am of the opinion that this provision of statute is controlling and that the officer is only entitled to receive the fifty cents fee for each lis pendens, even though it may have been entered more than once on the numerical index. If the satisfaction certificate to which you refer is a certificate that a lis pendens is cancelled by court order, I think the same rules applies as to it.

I also agree with him that the county board may order a transfer from the genera] fund to the bond fund of the county under the provisions of Section 1023, Compiled Statutes, which reads as follows: "The county board of any county in the State of Nebraska shall have the power to transfer any unexpended balance or any portion thereof remaining in the county general fund at any time to any other county fund, when the interest of the county seem to demand such transfer: PROVIDED, in no case shall such transfer reduce the amount of said county general fund below the sum of two thousand dollars."

And you inquire whether this bars a county judge who is also the owner of a printing plant and newspaper from contracting with the county for printing the proceedings of the county l&gt;oard or doing other printing or furnishing supplies for which the county is to pay. Allow me to say in answer to your question that in my opinion the statute above quoted does bar the county judge from making contracts of the kind you mention with the county. To this rule there is the possible exception that if the county judge owns the only legal newspaper pub - lished in the county and the law requires that certain no - tices or other things for which the county is to pay shall be published in a legal newspaper published in the county, the owner of the paper, even though a county officer, may contract with the county board for such publication.

Vinsonhaler, 82 Neb. 810, it was held otherwise, but at that time the statute did not provide any fee for the performance of a marriage cere - mony by the county judge. That decision was rendered in 1908. In 1909 the law was amended so as to provide the county judge should receive a fee of $3.00 for the perform - ance of a marriage ceremony. In as much as the court seemed to base its decision in the Vinsonhaler case largely upon the fact that the statute did not provide a fee for the performance of the marriage ceremony by a county judge, I am of the opinion when the law was changed to provide for such a fee it became the duty of the county judges to report such fees.

GWA COUNTY OFFICERS— AMOUNT COLLECTABLE FOR PUBLICATION OF SCAVENGER TAX LISTS March 28, 1927. Allen Printing Company, Allen, Xebraska. Gentlemen : Answering your letter of March 26 relative to the legal rate for publication of notices and particularly pertaining to the publication of scavenger tax lists, we respond by enclosing herewith a copy of an opinion written to Mr. Yale H. Cavett, Bayard, Nebr., dated October 13, 1926, which presents the opinion of this department relative to the compensation for printing scavenger tax lists. In that opinion we call your attention also to the following lan - guage in the next to the last paragraph : "In order to avoid any controversy or litigation we suggest that county boards and county treasurers in caring for the publication of the delinquent tax list should be careful not to exceed the maximum amount stated in Section 6052 in making provision for the compensa - tion of the publisher." This part of the opinion really had no application to the inquiry, but was inserted with the idea of advising county boards not to exceed the statutory compensation fixed by Section 6052, Compiled Statutes for 1922. This section specifically fixes the compensation for the publica - tion of tax lists at the sum of 20c for each description of </seg>
            <seg id="p133">OPINIONS 135 land other than town lots and the sum of 10c for each town lot. There is no provision for competitive bidding in this connection, and Section 0052 in our opinion fixes the com - pensation that should be paid the publisher and leaves to the county board the discretion to select the publisher. Relative to the matter of injunctions, as discussed in your letter of March 2C&gt;, we will say that we do not believe that the notice would be held invalid because of the amount of compensation paid to the publisher, but we are inclined to the belief that an action would lie against the county board for paying more or less than the compensation fixed for the publication of this list. Of course, the matter is not entirely free from doubt until there is a court decision. You realize, of course, that our opinion in this connection must be general and that we are hardly in a position to advise you concerning matters of personal interest only.

OSS COUNTY OFFICERS— INTEREST ON JUDGMENT - PASSPORT FEES Rate of interest on judgment to be collected. Pees collected by county officers in connection only with operation of laws of the United States need not be accounted for by the officer. March 22, 1927 Mr. Edward F. &amp;raf, Clerk of the District Court, Colu mbus, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You write us as follows "The question has been raised by local attorneys and it is alleged by them that where the judgment is based upon written instruments and the interest rate is more than 7% per annum, although the rate is not specified in the judgment, the party obtaining said judgment is entitled to the rate of interest specified in the written instruments and that it is the Clerk's duty to ascertain and collect the same." Answering this part of your inquiry we call your at - tention to the case of Calloway V. Dbty, 108 Neb. 319. At page 324 the court says: "But, besides all this, we do not think that it is necessary that there should be a recital in the judgment that it bear a particular </seg>
            <seg id="p135">OPINIONS 137 rate of interest in order that the judgment creditor may collect in - terest on his judgment, as the statute fixes the rate of interest which the amount of the judgment bears in any given case. While it is the better practice that the court should specify the rate of interest which a judgment or decree shall bear in order to obviate a possible future contention, there is nothing in the law which seems to require that this be done." Following out this conclusion of the court it was held that the judgment in reality bears the same rate of inter - est as the written contract upon which the judgment was founded where the judgment is silent as to the interest. We think the better practice, however, would be for the judgment to be made definite and certain by a mine protunc order. In view of the judgment of the court, however, in Calloway v. Doty, we presume that the interest should be collected in full as provided in the written contract upon which the judgment is based unless the judgment provide otherwise. Answering the second part of your inquiry which is in substance whether or not the Clerk is required to account for fees collected by him in connection with the passport laws we will say that we see no reason why the opinion given by this Department in accounting for naturalization fees should not be applicable. The opinion last referred to was given by the writer to Mr. F. E. Lenhart, Clerk of the District Court at Beatrice, under date of September 25, 1923, and in effect held that the Clerk was not required to account for naturalization fees collected by him inas - much as the fees were collected under the federal law and concerned a matter in which the State was not interested and had no right to legislate. Probably this same opinion would be controlling as to the passport law so long as it was confined to interstate commerce or commerce between nations. LD </seg>
            <seg id="p136">138 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL COUNTY OFFICERS— PAYMENT OF SALARY The statutory provision that no county officer shall draw in one month more than one-twelfth the total annual salary of his office is not applicable in the case of a county superintendent who receives no annual salary, but who is paid a per diem for the number of days he is engaged in the performance of the duties of his office. August 25, 1928. Mr. Leroy C. S pence, County Superintendent, Arthur Co. Arthur, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 20th instant allow me to say that I assume your county con - tains a school population of less than one thousand fire hundred and that the statutory provision regarding the compensation of the county superintendent is as follows; "The county superintendent shall receive not less than seven dollars per day for each day actually employed in the performance of the duties of the office, but the total compensation in this class shall riot exceed twelve hundred dollars per annum." Section 2391, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. If I am right in this assumption, I doubt whether the provision that no county officer shall draw in one month more than one twelfth of the total annual salary of his office applies in the case of the county superin - tendent of your county. As I view it that officer does not receive a fixed annual salary but is paid a per diem for the work done, hence his compensation may fluctu - ate, and strictly speaking, he is not paid an annual salary.

Februarv 18, 1928. Mr. E. G. Reed. Attorney at Law. Kearney, Nebraska. Dear Sir In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 8th instant in re charges of officer where distress warrant for the collection of delinquent personal taxes is placed in his hands, allow me to say that the sheriff can not collect a fee for making a levy unless the levy is actually made nor can he collect commission unless lie has made a sale. The fee of twenty-five cents for issuing the warrant (work that is done by the County Treasurer) is payable, of course, after the warrant is issued whether it is served or not. Whether the sheriff is entitled to mileage where he makes &lt;i trip to serve the warrant but does not actually serve it because the taxpayer concludes to pay without service is not entirely free from doubt. I am inclined to the opinion that he is entitled to mileage at the rate of five cents per mile in such a case but do not know how it can be collected where the tax is paid by the taxpayer direct to the county treasurer, for in such a case the dis - tress warrant will not have been returned, so the treas - urer will have no official notice that anything has been done, under it. If, however, settlement is required to be made with the sheriff after the search warrant has once issued, I am </seg>
            <seg id="p138">140 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL of the opinion that officer will be justified in charging five cents per mile for the distance actually and necessar - ily traveled in making the collection even though the collection is made without actually serving the warrant. I say five cents per mile instead of fifteen cents per mile because so far as the charge of mileage is concerned Section 6012, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, is a special statute as compared with Section 2381, Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which is more gen - eral in its scope and the rule is that "To the extent of any necessary repugnancy between them the special will prevail over the general statute." 36 Cyc. 1161. GWA COUNTY REGISTER OF DEEDS— COMPENSATION Compensation of Register of Deeds is fixed and limited by law. April 27, 1927. Mr. Thomas J. Dredla, County Attorney, Crete, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Dredla: You state that it has been the custom of your county to pay the Register of Deeds $75.00 per year for the com - piling of the mortgage indebtedness record provided for in Section 4960, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. You inquire whether or not this is a proper payment by the county. Answering the inquiry we call your attention to the specific provisions of Sections 4960 to 4963 inclusive, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. The reading of </seg>
            <seg id="p139">OPINIONS 141 these sections indicates to us that it is a part of the official duties of the Register of Deeds to prepare this record. In the absence of additional compensation spe - cifically provided for by statute, it is to be presumed that the compensation of the Register of Deeds as fixed by law shall be his whole compensation for the performance of all duties relating to his office. Section 4960, however, does require the county to furnish the book described in Sections 4960 to 4962 inclusive. No other charge is men - tioned as taxable against the county. LD COUNTY SHERIFF— FEES AND MILEAGE Sheriff is entitled to mileage for transportation of patient to hospital for insane. February 17, 1927. Mr. W. H. Line, County Attorney, Loup City, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of February 10th requests our advice upon two questions: First. Should the sheriff report and pay to the county the $3 allowed him for conveying a patient to the insane asylum, as provided in Section 6930, Compiled Statutes, 1922? We call your attention to a certain part of this sec - tion which refers to personal service of the sheriff in conveying the patient. We do not consider that the mere use of the word "personal" is sufficient to allow the sheriff to retain the |2.00. If you will read further in </seg>
            <seg id="p140">142 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL the section you will note that the commissioners may estimate the probable expenses, of conveying the person to the hospital, including the necessary assistance and not including the compensation allowed the sheriff. An - other section of the Statutes, as you know, provides that the sheriff must make a return of all fees with the ex - ception of mileage and jailers' fees. Inasmuch as it is not specifically provided that he must retain the $3.00 we conclude that he must account for the same, but on the express provision he may retain mileage he may keep without account therefor the mileage earned by liim in that connection. Second. Is the sheriff entitled to mileage where the county board paid the expenses of the automobile used as a conveyance? We respond by saying that Section 6930 provides for the $3.00 per diem and mileage. The section further provides that the sheriff or other person executing the warrant shall accompany the return witli a statement of the expenses incurred and that the excess or deficiency may be added to or deducted from his compensation as the case may be. Inasmuch as the probable expense of con - veying the person to the hospital, including necessary assistance, may be computed and paid in advance, and expenses advanced on such estimate, we conclude that the expenses referred to in the matter of adding to op deducting refer to expenses, excluding the compensation allowed the sheriff. This section states that such esti - mated expenses do not include the compensation allowed the sheriff. We, therefore conclude that the sheriff is entitled to his mileage as personal compensation in addi - tion to the expenses incurred. LD </seg>

Mr. 11'. B. lluinmoti ; Sheriff, Cherry County, \ 'alentine, Xcbraska. Dear Mr. Ilaminon : You inquire whether or entitled to collect mileage in not the county sheriff is multiple amounts, that is, multiply the mileage actually travelled in serving sum - mons by the number of defendants served with summons. We have always felt that the sheriff was underpaid, and he should receive more compensation. This matter, how - ever, . is entirely within the discretion of the Legislature. Thus far, the Legislature has made provision only for the payment of the fixed salaries to be paid the sheriff and for mileage to be retained as provided by Section 2381, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. We are not herein including the compensation paid to the sheriff when he acts as jailer as that is not sheriff's compensation. The supreme court has not specifically passed upon the matter of multiple mileage in a case where the service of summons is involved. The principle involved, however, has been decided adversely to the collection of multiple mileage In the case of County of Lof/an v. Doan, 34 Neb. 104, it holds that the mileage provided is for compensation of the sheriff for each mile actually and necessarily travelled and that he is entitled to receive mileage for the one journey and to allow him again for the same trip would be double compensation which is unauthorized by law. This case also indicates that the fees in this con- </seg>
            <seg id="p142">144 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL nection for service might be apportioned amongst the cases involved. We therefore feel that the county commissioners should be advised to pay mileage only for the actual mile age and actual trips and not to pay double compensa - tion until such time as the Legislature has expressly so provided or the supreme court has ruled otherwise. LD COUNTY SHERIFFS— PROBATION OFFICER Sheriffs are not entitled to additional compensation as probation officers. February 8, 1927. Mr. W. W. Xorton, C aunty Judge, Osceola, Xebraska. Dear Sir : You ask for our interpretation of the provisions of Chapter 94, Session Laws, 1925, pertaining to the appoint - ment of a sheriff as probation officer and his compensation. This act provides for the appointment of probation officers and provides that no probation officer appointed shall receive any compensation for his services as sucli except as in the section or chapter provided. No specific compensation is provided for sheriffs acting as probation officers in counties having less than 20,000 population. We, therefore, conclude that the duties of probation officers, when vested in sheriffs of such counties, are vested iu them by virtue of their office as sheriff, and that they are not entitled to additional compensation. We wish that we could reach a different conclusion as in our opin - ion sheriffs are underpaid, but we cannot do so under the wording of the statute. LD </seg>
            <seg id="p143">OPINIONS 145 COUNTY SHERIFF— REPORTING OF FEES The county sheriff must report and pay over all fees earned whether collected or not. Sheriffs should collect fees in advance or secure the payment of same. Mr. Carroll Thompson, County Attorney, Xance County, Fullerton, Nebraska. Dear Sir: . You inquire whether or not under the provisions of Section 2381, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, the county sheriff is required to account for and pay to the county treasurer the amount represented by all fees earned by him even though the same have not been fully collected. You inquire whether the Sheriff is excused from collection and accounting for any of the fees. The decisions of our state upon this particular sub - ject are not entirely clear, but we call to your attention that Section 2381, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides that the sheriff in his report to the county board shall include all fees collected or earned and the section concludes as follows: "and he shall then pay all fees earned to the county treasurer." State ex rel Antelope Co. v. Miller, 98 Neb. 179, in the syllabus states: "A sheriff is required to report all fees earned by him by virtue of his office which are not especially excepted from his report by statute. His salary is in lieu of fees." In this case, however, the fees were collected but not reported so the case is not so valuable as the syllabus indicates for it does not discuss the question of fees earned but not collected. June 21, 1928. </seg>
            <seg id="p144">146 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENETTAL Bocttchcr v. iMitcasttcr County, 74 Neb. 148, in tho syllabus states: "Ordinarily, under said amendatory act, the clerk extends credit at his peril, and will be required to account for the fees earned by him for official services, whether the same are collected or not." Tbe case last cited is commented upon in Douyhix County v. Vinsotihaler, 82 Neb. 810. In this case the county judge was sued because of his failure to report fees in excess of his lawful compensation which were earned but not collected. It was held that it must appea that the county judge wilfully omitted to charge the pre - scribed fee with intent to evade the law or that he nea gently omitted to collect or secure the payment of said fees. In this case it appears that the law did not spe - cifically refer to the payment over of fees earned. In the law pertaining to the county judge the amount of fees received was the fact uniformly mentioned. Fees earned and not received do not appear to have been re - ferred to in the law. In Section 2381, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, we have the express provision that the sheriff shall pay all fees earned. In the case last cited the court states as follows: "This provision would have been quite unnecessary if the statute were interpreted to require the report of fees earned, and not col - lected. For, if he were required to report fees, whether collected or not, the failure to collect would not evade the law, and the intent, which is made an element of the offense, could not exist." In view of the express provision in Section 2381, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 11(22, that the sheriff must pay all fees earned, we are of the opinion that the sheriff should require all fees to be paid in advance or that he should secure the payment of same to his satis - faction and that he should report and pay to the county treasurer all fees earned. It is possible that the courts might require some element of wilful neglect or negligence before holding the sheriff to full payment of all fees earned as they did in </seg>

LD COUNTY SURVEYOR— ENTITLED TO MILEAGE June 20. 1927 Mr. W. H. Line, County Attorney, Sherman County. Ijoiip City, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether or not a county surveyor who has been placed upon a salary by the action of your county board is also entitled to mileage under the pro - visions of Section 2380. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. We think the courts have made a distinction between fees and mileage and that the intent of the Legislature was to include only fees in requiring the county surveyor to make a report of all fees earned when he was put upon a salary basis. We think the option therefore, was merely as to whether the county should pay fees or salary and that the matter of mileage is not affected by the action of the board. It is our conclusion and opinion, therefore, that the County Surveyor would he entitled to mileage for each mile actually and necessarily traveled in going to and from work. In this connection we call to your attention the fact that Section 2380, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, has been amended by House Roll </seg>
            <seg id="p146">148 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 68. The amendment, however does not affect the questio:: which you put to us. LD COUNTY TREASURER— COMPENSATION March 24, 1927. 0. M. Campbell Co., Inc. Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You call to our attention the fact that the Legislature in 1919 changed the law pertaining to the maximum of compensation to be paid the county treasurer in counties having less than 6,500 population. The Legislature changed the maximum from $2000 to $ 1800. You inquire whether or not this change is effective to the extent that it limited the compensation of the county treasurer to the sum of $1800 during the term of office which he was serving and before the expiration of same at the time the law was enacted. This involves the proposition of whether or not the Legislature has the power to change the compensation of the county treasurer during his term of office. We call to your attention that prior to 1920, Section 19, Article III, of the Constitution of this state, provided as follows: "Nor shall the compensation of any public officer be increased or diminished during his term of office." The Supreme Court of this state in County of Doug - 1&lt;i.s v. Timme, 32 Neb. 272, held that this constitutional limitation applied only to those officers named in the Constitution and did not affect offices created merelv bv Mr. F. A. Myers, </seg>
            <seg id="p147">OPINIONS 149 the Legislature. This case is upheld in State v. Hawstrn, 94 Neb. 445, wherein the court again held that a change could be made and that the provision of the Constitution heretofore cited applied only to constitutional officers. In State v. Vincent, 46 Neb. 408, the court held thai the change made by the Legislature could not have appli - cation as to fees which had been earned previous to the time that the new law went into effect. In State v. Reilly, 94 Neb. 232, it was held that a police magistrate was named in the Constitution and that the Legislature could not pass a law which would be effective to change the term of office of police magistrate during his term of office. In 1920, Section 19, Article III, of the Constitution, was amended by adding after the words "any public officer", heretofore cited, the following words: "includ - ing any officer whose compensation is fixed by the Legis lature subsequent to the adoption hereof." Until the court construes the language of this section there is of necessity some doubt concerning its application. The new language follows the words "public officer" and says "including." The use of the word "including" may refer back to the words "public officer" and a court might say that the additional language does not extend the applica - tion. The compensation of other officers named in the the Constitution whose compensation is fixed by the Legis - lature subsequent to the adoption of the Constitution. It is to be noted that the Constitution does provide for certain compensation for certain state officers until such time as the Legislature shall change the compensa - tion. The compensation of other officers named in the Constitution is subject to legislative action also. As we suggested, until the court construes this language it is not entirely free from doubt. We believe, however, that it was the intent of the constitutional con- </seg>
            <seg id="p148">150 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL, vention to have the reference include all public officers, whether named in the Constitution or provided for l&lt;y legislative action. In other words, we think it was in - tended to change the former application of Section 19, Article III, of the Constitution, so that the compensation of no public officer whose compensation was fixed by the Legislature should be changed during his term of office. This would, of course, not be effective until after the adoption of the amendment to the Constitution, and a law prior to the adoption of the Constitution of 1920 per - taining to an office not named in the Constitution would apparently be subject to the rulings of the Supreme Court as heretofore set forth. There is another line of decisions to the effect that where an accounting has been made with the county board, the same approved and no appeal has been taken, that the money involved may not be recovered by the county.

Each member of the election board shall make affidavit before a qualified officer of the number of hours he has worked. The person making the returns of the elections to the county clerk shall receive two dollars per day, and five cents for each mile necessarily traveled." Sec. 2403, Compiled Statutes, 1922.

            <seg id="p155">OPINIONS 157 Attorney, Imperial, Nebraska, under date of June 24, 1924, as follows: "There would be a difference in our opinion if the county in ques - tion is under township organization. We take it for granted that the county is not under township organization. Section 879, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, provides that one commissioner shall be nominated by each of said districts, but shall be elected by the quali - fied electors of the entire county. This indicates that the nomination would be by each district and would seem to restrict the circulation of the petition to the district in which the nomination is to be made. In fact, so far as the nomination is concerned, it is probable that this opinion would hold in counties under the township organization." The number of signers required is fixed by Chapter 98, Session Laws, 1927. This chapter provides that the number of signatures shall be 200, when the nomination is for an office for a division less than the state and when it is not a township, precinct or ward. It further pro - vides that the number of signatures need not in any in - stance exceed one-fourth of the total number of voters when the nomination is for any office to be filled by th electors of a county, city, etc. Other provisions may be noticed by reading the chapter indicated. We also call your attention specifically to Section 879, Compiled Statutes, 1922, which provides that one com - missioner shall be nominated by each of said districts and shall be elected by the qualified electors of the entire county. This pertains to counties not under township organization. LD ELECTION— COUNTY CONVENTION DELEGATES Delegates to the county conventions may be elected at the primary election. </seg>

Section 2154, Compile Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amended by Chapter 70, p. 208, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1923, provides that "The officer charged with the duty of canvassing the result of such primary shall issue certificates of election to the persons elected delegates to the county convention and shall notify each of the time and place of said convention, which shall be held in the court house, or other suitable place at the county seat, on the third Thursday after the Tuesday upon which the general state wide primary is held, the hour and place to be designated by him. It shall be the duty of such officer to deliver to the temporary secretary the roll, properly certified, showing the name and address of each delegate to such convention, whereupon the convention shall proceed with its organization and transaction of business."

"Are names of delegates to county convention to be placed on primary ballot and how?" I will answer the above questions in the order in which they are asked. 1. The number of delegates to the county conven - tion should be determined by the county committee and should be apportioned upon the highest vote cast at the last preceding presidential election for any one of the party's candidates for presidential elector. Section 2208, Revised Statutes as amended in 1919, provides among other things that "There shall be elected at the primary election * * * dele - gates from each voting precinct to the county convention * * • apportioned upon the highest vote cast at the last election for any one of the party's candidates for presidential elector."

Blank spaces can be left on the primary ballot for the writing in of such names. February 18, 1928. Mr. C. L. Holland, County Clerk, Burt County, Tekamah, Nebraska.

Section 2154, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. I find no provision of statute for the filing of peti - tions of nomination for delegates to the county conven - tion or for the payment of a filing fee for placing the name of a prospective delegate on the primary ballot.

GWA ELECTION— COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL ELECTORS Only electors who reside within that part of the county that pays taxes to support the county high school are eligible to vote at a county high school election. September 25, 1928. Mr. R. P. Tolle, Thedford, Nebraska. Dear Sir In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 21st instant allow me to say that only parties who reside within the part of the county that pays taxes to support the county high school are eligible to vote at a county high school election in my opinion. The statute provides that "Every person, male or female, living in that portion of the county that maintains the county high school, and who has resided in the state for six months and in the county forty days and in the pre - cinct or township ten days and is twenty-one years old, and who owns real or personal property that was assessed in the county in his or her name at the last annual assessment, or who has children of school age residing in the voting precinct of his or her residence, shall be entitled to vote on the questions of establishing a county high school, voting bonds for the same and all other questions relative to the county high school." Section 6403, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. This by implication, I think, bars anyone from voting who does not have the qualifications of an elector set forth in the statutes. </seg>
            <seg id="p160">162 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL I am further of the opinion that the members of the board other than the county superintendent should be elected from that part of the county which maintains the county high school.

GWA ELECTION— DISPOSITION OF POLL BOOKS February 8, 1928. Mr. Frank Marsh, Secretary of State, Lincoln, Xebraska. Dear Sir: We have your favor of the 6th instant inquiring con - cerning the disposition of poll sheets or books for city and municipal elections, and in reply you are informed that Section 2034, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922*, pertains to the disposition of poll books held in connection with a general election. It provides in coun - ties not under township organization that one of the poll books shall be deposited with one of the judges of the election appointed by the judges and shall be subject to the inspection of any elector for a period of six months. In counties under township organization and in town - ships constituting a single precinct the judges are re - quired to make a certificate of the result of their canvass on the poll books and file such certificate with the other poll books in the office of the town clerk.

Section 4290, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides that cities of the second class and villages shall have the power to provide by ordinance the manner of conducting their special and general elections and to appoint judges and clerks for such elections. Section 4318, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides that the general election for cities and villages shall be held on the first Tuesday of April of each year. Section 4320, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides that the city and village board shall can - vass the results of the election. The city or village should regulate by ordinance the manner of disposing of the poll books, ballots, etc., pertaining to such election. LB ELECTION— ELIGIBILITY ON BOAED A delegate to a county convention is not an officer within the meaning of the statutory provision that no one can serve on an election or counting board who is a candidate for office at that election.

Stout, Chairman, Lancaster County Republican Central Committee, 2O.i Nebraska Xtatc Bank Bldg., Lincoln, Xebraska. Dear Mr. Stout: You call my attention to the provision contained in Chapter 95. Session Laws of 1927, which reads as follows: "No person shall be eligible to serve on any election or counting board who is a candidate for any office at such election," and you state that you are of the opinion that the legis - lature in referring to candidates for any office did not mean to include therein delegates to the county convention. I am inclined to agree with your opinion in this matter although the question may not be entirely free from doubt. As I understand it, delegates to the county convention neither give bond as officials nor take an oath of office. I may add that I do not recall any statutory provision for having the names of candidates for that position printed on the primary ballots but the statute seems clear that they shall be elected at the primary election. This can be done, of course, by leaving blank spaces on the ballot for the writing in of names for that position.

Williams, Deputy County Attorney, Albion, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You say : "On September 1, 1928, the resignation of the county superintendent of this county will be accepted by the County Board. The Board would like to know how long an appointee would hold this office if appointed at once, and if an applicant was not appointed at this time could someone be appointed within thirty days prior to the November general election, and if so would the appoint - ment cover the unexpired term of the present County Superintendent. Also could the County Commissioners declare the office vacant for the present and employ some - one to take charge of the office, and then make an appoint - ment within thirty days prior to the November general election.'' Allow me to say in answer to the question you ask that in my opinion the board should fill the vacancy when it occurs or as soon thereafter as they can agree upon a successor. I think the person thus appointed will only hold the office until his successor is elected and qualified. "Vacancies occurring in * * * any public elective office thirty days prior to any general election shall be filled thereat." Section 2245, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. The statute further provides that "Appointments under the provisions of this chapter shall • • • continue until the next election at which the vacancy can be filled and until a successor is elected and qualified." Section 2247, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. See cases of State v. Coleman, 91 Neb. 167, and State v. Schroeder, 79 Neb. 759. </seg>
            <seg id="p164">166 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL It ,is true that in the case of State v.

GWA ELECTION— HIGH SCHOOL BONDS - QUALIFICATION The qualifications of an elector at an election called to vote upon the question of the issue of county high school bonds are set out in Section 6403, Compiled Statutes. June 20, 1928. Mr. W. E. Hill, Attorney at Law, Gaudy, Nebraska. Dear Sir: The correct answer to the question you ask in your letter of inquiry of the 19th instant is not entirely free from doubt in the absence of a Supreme Court decision upon the point involved. I am of the opinion, however, that the qualifications of an elector at an election called to vote upon the proposi - tion to issue bonds for a county high school are set out in Section 6403, Compiled Statutes, 1922, rather than in Section 6271, Compiled Statutes, 1922. Section 6403 is part of a special statute that is only applicable to county high schools, while Section 6271 is general in its scope and the rule is that "Where the general act is later the special will be construed as remaining an exception to its terms, unless it is repealed in express words or by necessary implication." 36 Cyc. 1151-1152. </seg>
            <seg id="p165">OPINIONS 167 Similarly the Supreme Court of Nebraska has said: "It is a cardinal rule of construction that an act whose pro - visions are general will not, unless unavoidable, be so interpreted as to affect more particular and positive provisions of a prior act on the same subject." GWA ELECTION*— JUSTICE OF PEACE A justice of the peace is not nominated at a primary election. December 24, 1927. Mr. Oscar Johnson, County Clerk, Dawes County, Chadron, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire : "Please advise whether justices of the peace should be nominated at the primary election the same as county officers or should they be excepted from operation of primary election as provided by Section 2096, Compiled Statutes, 1922." Allow me to say in answer to the question you ask that in my opinion justices of the peace should not be nominated at a primary election. Section 2096, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, exempts from the operation of the primary election law precinct and township officers and it seems to me that a justice of the peace is a precinct or township officer rather than a county officer. It is true his jurisdiction is co - extensive with the county but he is not elected by the entire county but by the voters of a precinct or township Dawson County v.

In answer to the question which you suggest, allow me to say that in my opinion a state employee does not necessarily lose his legal residence and his right to vote in his home town by coming to Lincoln to stay during the period of his employment, even though that employ - ment may extend over a period of years.

GWA ELECTION— NOMINATIONS TO PILL VACANCY- FILING FEES Filing fees are not required of candidates nominated to fill vacancies after the primary election. July 3, 1028. Mr. Charles Judd, Beatrice, Xcbraxka Dear Sir: In your letter of recent date you state that at a special meeting of the Republican Central Committee held in and for Gape County a party was nominated for the office of Register of Deeds to fill a vacancy in that office. Yon then ask our opinion as to whether or not a filing; fee should be paid by this candidate. Prior to the adoption of our direct primary law in 1907, nomination was made by convention or party pri - mary. There was no filing fee required of candidates nominated by either method. Where, however, the party nominated by primary, it was provided that that party should pay the primary expenses. Upon the adoption of our present primary law it was provided that each candidate for office (with exceptions) at the primary election should pay a filing fee. This provision exists in our law today, practically unchanged, as Section 2113, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, and reads as follows: "Prior to the filing of such petition, and for the purpose of help - ing to defray the expense of such primary there shall be paid to the </seg>
            <seg id="p168">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 170 county treasurer for the use of the general fund, of the county of the candidate's residence, by or on behalf of each candidate, a filing fee as follows: "For the office of United States Senator $60.00 "For state officers, members of congress and judges of the district court 10.00 "For county, legislative and city offices .... 5.00 "No nominating paper shall be filed until the proper county treasurer's receipt showing the payment of such filing fee shall be presented to the officer with whom such nominating paper is to be filed. "No filing fee shall be required from candidates for regents of the state university or presidential electors." It would seem that this section was intended pri - marily to aid in the payment of the primary election ex - penses only. That is, that it cast upon the candidates seeking nomination the burden of the expense of their candidacy, as it cast that burden upon the political party prior to the adoption of the direct primary law. It has for many years, if not always been the law that the ex - penses of the several elections be paid from the several funds of the counties. It is otfr opinion that since this nominee did not place his candidacy before the people at the primary but has been nominated to fill a vacancy since such primary, he should not be required to pay any filing fee. LCD ELECTION— NUMBER OF JUDGES IN PRECINCT The law provides for only two judges of election in precincts where not more than one hundred votes were cast at the last general election. </seg>
            <seg id="p169">OPINIONS 171 November 30, 1927. Mr. Howard Downing, Clerk of the District Court, Fullerton, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 28th instant in re apparent conflict in the wording of Section 1925, Com - piled Statutes, 1922, as amended by House Roll No. 35 passed at the last session of the Legislature as it was when passed by the Legislature and as it was when signed by the Governor, allow me to call your attention to the fact that said House Roll No. 35 amended not only Sec - tion 1925 but also Section 1926 of the Compiled Statutes, and that Section 1926, both as it was passed by the Legis - lature and as it was signed by the Governor provides for two judges and two clerks of election in voting precincts where not more than one hundred fifty votes were cast at the last general election. In other words it provides for two instead of three judges of election just as Section 1925 in its amended form did when it was submitted to the Governor for his signature. This being true I think the number of judges in such election precincts is two instead of three for the rule is: "In case of conflicting 1 provisions in the same statute * * the last in order of arrangement controls." 36 Cyc. 1130. Thus the Supreme Court of this state has said : "Where two sections or portions of the same statute, passed at the same time, are inconsistent with and repugnant to each other, so much so that both can not be enforced, the last section, or last words, will be allowed to prevail and the section or words in conflict therewith held to be repealed."

Dear Sir: You inquire if a petition signed by electors other than himself is necessary to nominate a party as a candi - date for the office of municipal judge in a city having between 40,000 and 100,000 population. Allow me to say in answer to your question that a petition signed by at least five per cent of the electors of the city is necessary in such a case.

This means, I take it, that, although in most re - spects the provisions for the nomination and election of district judges are applicable in the nomination and election of a municipal judge, there must be a petition asking for his nomination signed by at least five per cent of the electors of the city, even though such a petition may not be required for the nomination of a district judge.

The total number of votes cast in these three townships at the general election in November, 192G, was 540 votes. Registration of voters is not re - quired in the district. "1. Utoder the statute, would the petition for such nomination in this district require 200 signatures or 50 signatures, in neither event more than one-fourth of the total number of voters? "2. Would the 'total number of voters' be the total number of votes cast at the last general election? ":{. Election day is November (5th. Counting back thirty days from that day, and excluding that day, the thirtieth day is October 7th, which is Sunday. Would a petition filed the next day, October 8th, be filed within the time limited by statute? "4. In computing the number of names on the peti - tion, should the names of those who failed to show their place of business, residence and address, be disregarded? "5. Should several petitions, filed on different dates, nominating the same person for the same office, be con - strued as one petition?" </seg>
            <seg id="p176">178 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL I will endeavor to answer the above questions in the order in which they are asked. 1. I am of the opinion that the petition should be signed by two hundred voters provided that a petition signed by at least one-fourth of the number of voters that voted in the district at the last general election will be sufficient even though that number is less than two hundred. 2. Ordinarily I think you will be justified in con - sidering a petition signed by one-fourth of the number of electoi's that voted in the district at the last general election to be sufficient to nominate a candidate by peti - tion under Section 2098, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. It is possible that in some situations the vote at the last general election will not be a fair test. 3. I am of the opinion that if the petition was filed on Monday the 8th instant, it was filed in time. (See Monell v. Tauilliger, 8 Neb. 360.) 4. The law requires that each elector signing a nominating petition under the provisions of Section 2098, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, shall add to his signature his place of business, his residence and address. It may be that the courts will hold this provision to be directory rather than mandatory, but I am of the opinion the Clerk will be justified in refusing to act upon the petition where the statutory number of signers have not complied with the statute unless and until the court shall find that such requirement is not mandatory. 5. I am of the opinion that several petitions filed on different dates but asking for the nomination of the same person for the same office may be regarded as one petition, provided there is no duplication of the names of the signers.

One must be a resident of a school district for at least forty days to entitle him to vote at a school district election. A resident in a city does not lose his residence therein by going tem - porarily with his family to the country. October 13, 1927. Mr. Thomas Rawlings, Wakefield, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 12th instanr allow me to say that it takes 60 per cent of the votes cast at the election to carry a bond election in the ordi nary rural school district, but it only requires a majority of the votes cast to carry a bond election in a city school district. The school board cannot raise the amount of the bond voted in either a rural school district or a city school district. The law provides that in a city school district bonds may be issued upon a petition signed by r*r least 51 per cent of the legal voters in said district. (See Section 6605, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922.) If a man residing in the city moves his family out of the city on to a farm for the season but without in - tending to change his residence or have the removal permanent, he remains a resident of the city school dis - trict, and can vote therein. One must be a resident of a school district for at least forty days in order to be entitled to vote at a school district election. The qualifications of an elector at school district elections are set forth in Section 6271, Compiled Statutes </seg>

It takes sixty per cent of the votes cast to carry a bond election in the ordinary rural school district. October 26, 192S. Mr. Thomas J. Ihrdla, Count// Attorney, Saline County, Crete, Xehraxka. Dear Sir: You say: "I am advised that at an election held at a school district in this county, upon the question of voting bonds in the sum of $5,000 there were sixteen votes cast, seven against and eleven for. Out of the eleven at least one or two who voted, were persons who were transferred to the district in which the school is to be erected from another district for school purposes. In other words they belong in another district." </seg>
            <seg id="p179">OPINIONS 181 You inquire whether a person transferred temporarily (o a district for school purposes has a right at a bond election held in the district to which he has been trans - ferred. You also inquire what per cent of the votes cast is necessary to carry a bond election. Allow me to say that the parents of pupils trans - ferred temporarily for school purposes do not have a right to vote upon the question of the issue of bonds in the district to which they have been transferred. (See Section 6524, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922.) It takes sixty per cent of the qualified electors voting upon the question to carry a bond election in such dis - trict. (See Section 366, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922.) I know no statutory provision for contesting a bond election in a school district and am therefore of the opin - ion that the sufficiency of the votes cast to carry the election may properly be raised in an action brought to enjoin the issue of the bonds. GWA ELECTION— SCHOOL DISTRICT QUALIFICATIONS No one is qualified to vote at a school district election unless he has children of school age residing in the district or unless he or his spouse owns real estate in the district or had personal property assessed in his or her name in the district at the last annual assessment. December 13, 1927. Mr. A. H. Berggren, Htromsburg, Xebraxka. </seg>
            <seg id="p180">182 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Dear Sir: It is the opinion of this office that no one is entitled to vote at a school election unless he or she has children of school age residing in the district or owns real estate in the district or owns personal property that was assessed in his or her name or in the name of his or her spouse, at the last annual assessment. The law does not dis - criminate between men and women in this respect. Section 6271, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, as amended by Chapter 78, Session Laws of Nebraska, 1927, prescribes the qualifications of electors at a school district election. It reads as follows: "Every citizen of the United States, male or female, who has resided in the district forty days and is twenty-one years old and who owns real or personal property that was assessed in the district in his or her name at the last annual assessment, or whose spouse owns real or personal property that was assessed in the name of said spouse in the district at the last annual assessment, or who has children of school age residing in the district, shall be entitled to vote at any dis - trict meeting or school election held in any district, village or city. * • * » GWA ELECTION— SCHOOL DISTRICT OFFICER A school district officer elected by drawing lots is a de facto officer, May 29, 1928. Mrs. J. W. Bush, Republican City, Nebr. Dear Mrs. Bash: You inquire what can be done in a case where there are two members of the district school board to be elected under Article VI of the School Laws, and at the election </seg>
            <seg id="p181">OPINIONS 183 where four were nominated one received the highest vote and there was a tie vote on two other candidates for the other position. In reply would suggest that since neither of the iwo received a majority neither of them is elected, and while the state law provides for drawing lots by the State Can - vassing Board where there is a tie on the vote for candi - dates for state office, still the school law does not provide for casting lots to determine a tie vote, and it is doubtful if the law for casting lots would apply in this case. How - ever, if agreeable to the two candidates to cast lots they might do so, and if the one winning should function as such officer during such term, he at least would be a de facto officer and his acts as such would be valid. OSS ELECTION— SOCIALIST PARTY The provisions in the primary law for the nomination of candidates in some other method than election at the primary, have reference solely to offices to be filled by a vote of the electors of the state or some of the subdivisions thereof. August 22, 1928. Mr. G. August- Gerber, 15 East ',0th Street, Xeir York, X. Y. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 16th in - stant, I will say that I have read with interest the able brief prepared by Mr. J. C. Travis of the Omaha Bar regarding the right of the Socialist party to have the names of its candidates for president and vice-president placed upon the general official ballot to be voted for at the November election. </seg>
            <seg id="p182">184 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL I note that Mr. Travis takes the position that cer - tain provisions of the Primary Election Law of Nebraska are unconstitutional. This I am unwilling to concede until the court so holds, but as I view the matter it is not material whether they are constitutional or not for the provisions in the primary election law for the nomina - tion of candidates in some other method than at the pri - mary election have reference solely to offices to be tilled by a vote of the electors of the state or some of the sub - divisions thereof. This makes them inapplicable, I think, to cases where the offices are filled by the votes of the electors of other states as well as of the state of Nebraska. The fourth subdivision of Section 1940, Compiled statutes of Nebraska for 1922, does provide: "The names of candidates for president and vice-president for each political party shall be grouped together, each group enclosed with brackets with one square to the left in which the voter indicates his choice, and the party name to the right according as near as possible to the following form or schedule: WARREN G. HARDING, President, Republican CALVIN COOLIDGE, Vice-President, with a heavy line across the column, separating the group of the differ - ent political parties. No blank lines are to be left for writing in names for president and vice-president." and Section 1918, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amended by Chapter 105, Session Laws of Ne - braska for 1927, provides that "In the year nineteen hundred and twenty-eight and every four years thereafter, at the general election held on such day as congress may appoint, each elector nominated by any party or group of peti - tioners shall receive the combined vote of the electors of the state for the candidates for president and vice-president of such party or group of petitioners, and a vote cast for the candidates for president of the United States shall be the votes of the voter for the electors of the respective party or group of petitioners."

GWA ELECTION— VOTE HY MAIL— SCHOOL DISTRICT The language of the "voting by mail" statute is broad enough to include school district elections. July 31, 1928. Mr. E. C. Din&amp;more, Manager, Peters Trust Company, Omaha, Nebraska. Pear Sir: You inquire whether qualified electors of school dis - tricts can cast a legal vote by mail when voting upon bond questions. I do not know that the question you ask has ever been passed upon by the Supreme Court of this state, hence the correct answer to it is not entirely free from doubt. The language of the statute, however, is broad enough to include school district elections. Thus it is said: "This act shall apply to all elections of every kind held in the State and in case of municipal elections the words county clerk and county herein shall be construed to apply to municipal clerk and mu - nicipality respectively."

October 24, 1928. Mr. Ivan D. Evans, County Attorney, Thomas County, Thedford, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of the 20th instant, allow me to say I am of the opinion that only those electors can vote who reside in the part of the county that main - tains the county high school. Section 6403, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides that: "Every person, male or female, living in that portion of the county that maintains the county high school, and who has resided in the state for six months and in the county forty days and in the precinct or township ten days and is twenty-one years old, and who owns real or personal property that was assessed in the county in his or her name at the last annual assessment, or who has children of school age residing in the voting precinct of his or her residence, shall be entitled to vote on the questions of establishing a county high school, voting bonds for the same and all other questions relative to the county high school." It occurs to me that this by implication forbids those not residing in the part of the county that maintains the county high school from voting upon any question rela - tive to the county high school. I take it that the election of regents is a question relative to the county high school. I may add that the law does not seem to provide any method for segregating voters who are entitled to vote upon the question from those in the same voting precinct who are not. </seg>
            <seg id="p185">OPINIONS 187 If those who are not entitled to vote upon that ques - tion would abstain from voting upon the question of the election of county high school regents substantial justice would be done, but I do not know of any way to insure that only those vote who are entitled to vote upon the question. GWA ELECTION— WITHDRAWAL OF CANDIDATES The Secretary of State is justified in leaving off the primary ballot the names of all candidates required to be certified from his office who have notified him more than twenty-five days before election that they decline to be candidates. March 13, 1928. Honorable W. D. McHugh, Jr. Election Commissioner, '.■ Court Hovm, Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your oral request for an opinion as to the statutory requirements for a withdrawal of the name of a candidate for a partisan nomination for office at a primary election, allow me to say that I have been unable to find any statutory provision that in my opinion either directly authorizes or directly denies the right of a candi - date to withdraw his name from the primary ballot. In my opinion Section 2118, Compiled Statutes, 1922, as amended by Chapter 99, Session Laws, 1927, deals with the right of a candidate to withdraw his name as a candidate at the general election, but has no application to a withdrawal of his name as a candidate for nomina - tion at the primary election. </seg>
            <seg id="p186">188 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL This being true, I am of the opinion that the Secre - tary of State is justified in leaving off his certified list of candidates transmitted to the various county clerks the names of such candidates as have notified him in writing that they wish to withdraw their names from consideration at the primary election. This means, of course, that the notification of withdrawal should reach him at least twenty-five days before the primary election. In like manner where the office is one for which nomination papers are not filed in the office of the Secre - tary of State, I am of the opinion that the county clerk is justified in leaving off the primary ballot as candidates for county offices the names of all such persons as shall request him to do so before the primary ballots are printed. GWA EXECUTIVE OFFICERS— CREATION OF GAME AND FISH BOARD The Commissioners of a Game and Fish Board, if such board be pro - vided, would be executive officers and legislative provision for same must be by a two-thirds majority of members of the legis - lature. (Section 27, Article IV, Constitution.) March 3, 1927. Mr. H. J. McLaughlin , Secretary, Department of Agriculture, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska.

In reply to your inquiry would suggest that previous to 1920 this section, which was originally Section 26, provided : "No other executive state office shall be continued or created, and the duties now devolving upon officers not provided for by this constitution shall be performed by the officers herein created."

OSS FARM BUREAU— APPROPRIATION BY COUNTY BOARD It is the mandatory duty of the county board to appropriate for a farm bureau where the provisions of the law have been complied with. January 17, 1927. Mr. Charles A. Da foe, Count)/ Attorney, Tecmnsch, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire whether or not it is the mandatory duty of your county board to appropriate the amount of money provided for in a petition for a farm bureau. Assuming that the petition is proper in all respects, and that all provisions of the law have been complied with, and that no remonstrances have been filed within the time provided by law, we would say that it is the mandatory duty of the county board to make the appro - priation for the amount specified in the petition so long as it does not exceed the statutory amount. Our Supreme Court has held that it is the mandatory duty of a county board to make such provisions for county agricultural societies which operate county fairs. </seg>
            <seg id="p189">OPINIONS 191 Under the wording of the statute we are inclined to be - lieve that the same rule would apply and that it is made the mandatory and ministerial duty of the board to allow said budget.

Probably should be presented within two years. April 24, 1928. Mr. William F. Spikes, County Attorney, St. Paul, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Answering your letter of April 20th, relative to the validity of a petition for a Farm Bureau, will say that we find no specific provision of the statute fixing the time within which petitions must be presented after the same has been signed. You will notice, however, that the filing of a remonstrance may be on or before the 20th day of September of any second year thereafter. This indicates that the petition may be prepared and filed within the intervening two years. Of course persons signing the petition might withdraw therefrom upon giv - ing proper written notice. LD FARM BUREAU— SUFFICIENCY OF PETITION February 21, 1928. Mr. William F. Spikes, County Attorney, St. Paul, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p190">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 192 Dear Sir: We have considered your letter of February 16th, relative to the proposition of retaining or abolishing the farm bureau. The questions troubling you relate to the sufficiency of the petition or the remonstrance. There is directly involved the question of the right of the man who signs the petition to afterwards sign a remonstrance, and afterwards have his name counted on the remonstrance. The statute answers this particular question as suggested in your letter, and says that the name shall still count on the petition. You next inquire whether or not those who have signed the petition and remonstrance may withdraw from one or the other, respectively, by signing a withdrawal statement. The courts have decided that persons may withdraw any time before the matter is acted upon by the body having jurisdiction to act. The law which we next cite to you does not pertain directly to farm bureaus, but it pertains to the same pro - cedure. Aside from the statutory provision where the names remain upon both the petition and remonstrance and which provides that it shall be counted in that event upon the petition we are of the opinion that a signer of either document may withdraw his name if he does so witli the same formality with which he signed it, and providing the action of withdrawal is taken prior to the time that action is taken by the board or court having jurisdiction. In support of this conclusion we cite the following: ir&gt; C. J. 4:52-433, Hoffman v. State, 1 Neb. Unof. 216; Ai/rrx v. Moan, 34 Neb. 211; State v. Nemalui Co., 10 Neb. 32; State v.

The question you ask is not altogether free from doubt in the absence of a Supreme Court decision upon that precise point. I am of the opinion, however, that it is a felony owing to the general provision of our statute which makes any crime a felony that may be punished by imprisonment in the penitentiary. You further inquire whether a county judge has jurisdiction to sentence for such an offense. In answer to that question allow me to say that if it is, as I believe it to be, a felony, he has no jurisdiction to impose sen - tence for such an offense, but if it is not a felony he has jurisdiction, I think, to impose a sentence of a fine of not to exceed Five Hundred Dollars or imprisonment for not to exceed six months, or both. If the court lacks jurisdiction to sentence a defendant upon such a charge, the sentence as I view it is a nullity and does not bar another prosecution. Allow me to suggest, however, that if the sentence imposed in the case you have in mind was </seg>
            <seg id="p192">194 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL as great as a court having jurisdiction to try the case was required by law to impose, I doubt whether any good purpose will be subserved by attempting to prosecute this party again.

GWA FISH AND GAME— DRAINING LAKES Application to drain lakes or divert water thereof usually must be made to the Department of Public Works. March 17, 1927. Mr. J. J. Baldwin. Baldwin Mercantile Company, Ainsirorth. Xebraska. Dear Mr. Baldwin: Your letter of the loth instant, addressed to the Honorable Dan Swanson, Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, has been referred by him to this Depart - ment for answer. Section 8480, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, pro vides as follows: "No person shall drain, lower or in any manner reduce or divert, the water supply of any natural or perennial lake, if the area exceeds twenty acres at low water stage, or if the lake is of such depth and character as to have more economic importance for fish culture, hunt - ing: or other purpose, than the bed of said lake would have for agri - cultural purposes. Any person, intending: to drain, lower, divert or in any way reduce the waters or water supply of any natural or peren - nial lake, shall, before commencing the construction of any such works for drainage or diversion, make application to the department of public works for a permit so to do." </seg>

The law further pro - vides that any person violating its provisions shall be fined in any sum not exceeding $200 or imprisoned in the county jail not to exceed six months, or both.

Dear Sir : We have your recent letter directing our attention to Section 7341, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, and Section 7344 as amended by House Roll 10, Session of the Legislature for 1927. The former section provides that it shall be unlawful "(b) For any person to kill in any one day in excess of ten prairie chickens or grouse." The amended section provides that "It shall be unlawful for any person to have in his or her posses - sion at any one time in excess of 50 game birds.

LB FISH AND GAME— TRESPASSING Persons may fish in lakes stocked by the state, but have no right to trespass on private grounds in attempt to reach the lake. This rule applies also in case of school lands which are leased, unless otherwise provided by the lease. October 17, 1927. Mr. Saw Schwerin, Jr., Pierce, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Answering your inquiry of the 14th instant, will say that no person has the right to trespass upon privately owned or leased lands for the purpose of hunting or fishing. This department has ruled, and so also has the State Game Warden, that persons may fish in lakes stocked by the State, but that they may not trespass upon pri - vately owned property in attempting to reach the lake. In other words, the State has no control over privately owned property. We believe this also holds good in case of school sections which have been leased, unless the lease has made specific reservation of rights which would permit other persons to cross the lands to obtain access to the lakes.

If it did not re - ceive such vote it is invalid. If one part or item of the bill be raised over the Governor's recom - mendation, but fail of the constitutional vote, it would not defeat other parts of the measure receiving fifty-one per cent of the votes and which are passed as recommended. A distinct and separate appropriation not recommended by the Gov - ernor or made a part of the proposed budget is in "excess of the recommendation contained in such budget," and requires a three - fifths vote.

If the Governor has authority to disapprove any item or items in the general appropriation bill which have been raised above the amount or amounts recom - mended by the Governor. Second. Whether a vote of 51 per cent of each house is sufficient to carry the balance of the appropria - tion bill if approved by the Governor. Third. Would a separate and additional appropria - tion bill carry if it received only 51 per cent of the vote of each house? </seg>
            <seg id="p196">198 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Answering your inquiries in their order, I would suggest that the general rule is that "The authority of an executive to set aside an enactment of the legislative department is not an inherent power and can be exercised only when sanctioned by a constitutional provision." 36 Cyc. 962. Section 7 of Article IV of our Constitution, with reference to the proposed budget of the Governor, among other things provides: "No appropriations shall be made in excess of the recommenda - tion contained in such budget unless by three-fifths vote of each house of the Legislature, and such excess so approved by a three-fifths vote shall not be subject to veto by the Governor." This section would seem to conflict somewhat with that part of Section 15 of Article IV of the Constitution, which provides : "The Governor may disapprove any item or items of appropria - tion contained in bills passed by the Legislature, and the item or items so disapproved shall be stricken therefrom, unless repassed in the manner herein prescribed in case of disapproval of bills." However, the latter section, No. 15, is exactly as it appeared in the old Constitution, while Section 7 was amended by the last Constitutional Convention and later ratified by the people, and being the last word of the people speaking through their Constitution, it would prevail over any conflicting provision of Section 15. In view of the provisions of Section 7 it is my opin - ion that the item so raised would stand or fall upon the question of whether it received a constitutional majority. If it received such constitutional majority it would not be subject to veto, if it did not receive such majority it would fall of its own weight. Answering your second inquiry, may I suggest that if there be certain items in the appropriation bill which have been raised by the Legislature above the recom - mendation of the Governor, and if such appropriation </seg>
            <seg id="p197">OPINIONS 199 bill should fail to receive the constitutional majority necessary to pass such increased items, but did receive a majority vote of the members elected to each house, then in my opinion such other items of the budget which were not raised above such recommendation would carry, especially since it has been held that "Where a constitution provides that no emergency clause shall take effect unless it receives a vote of two-thirds of all the members elected to each house, a bill with an emergency clause having a ma - jority vote will take effect at the time fixed for the taking effect of such bills without such clause." M. K. &amp; T. Ry. Co. v. McGlamory, 41 S. W. 466. Whether an item which has been raised above the recommendation of the Governor and which fails to get the constitutional majority is defeated in its entirety or merely insofar as it raises such recommendation is not free from doubt. The court probably would hold that the greater would include the lesser and that the amount recommended by the Governor would stand if the raised item received a majority vote of each house, especially in view of the holding in State of Nebraska, ex rel. C. D. Casper et al. v. Moore. Auditor of Public Accounts, 37 Neb. 13, in which the court held: "Where a general appropriation bill carrying an item of $15,000 for a specific purpose, was duly passed by both houses of the legisla - ture, but by a clerical error of an enrolling clerk the $15,000 was after - wards changed to $25,000, and the bill was in this condition presented to and signed by the presiding officers of the two houses, and approved by the governor, held, that the bill appropriated $15,000 for the purpose specified therein." and in view of the above holding in M. K. tfc T. Railway Co. v. McGlamory. The safer plan is to recommit the measure if it fails to receive the constitutional majority and reform the same to comply with the recommended budget. While in my opinion the general appropriation bill may properly be divided and voted upon by sections, or </seg>
            <seg id="p198">200 REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL the sections which raise the estimate of the Governor may be segregated and voted upon separately in the com - mittee of the whole, still, I find no precedent for the division of such bill when offered upon its third reading, and, as an extra precaution such bill on third reading, in my judgment, should be voted upon as one measure. Answering your third inquiry as to the vote required for any separate or additional appropriation bill, you are informed that Section 7 of Article IV also provides: "The Governor * * * shall present by message, a complete itemized budget of the financial requirements of all departments, insti - tutions and agencies of the state for the ensuing biennium," and if there be any other appropriation bill distinct and separate from the general appropriation bill based on such budget, it is my opinion that it amounts to an "excess of the recommendation contained in such budget" and such appropriation bill in order to pass must receive a three-fifths vote of each house of the Legislature. OSS HIGHWAYS— ALTERATIONS— DAMAGES Where property of a land owner is damaged by the establishment or alteration of a public highway, the county commissioners should appraise such damage and make just compensation therefor even though such owner files no claim. July 22, 1927. Mr. Max Towle, County Attorney, Lancaster County, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Towle: We have your favor of the 20th instant, inquiring if it is necessary for the appointment of appraisers by </seg>
            <seg id="p199">OPINIONS 201 the Board of County Commissioners as provided for by Chapter 23, Sections 2563 et seq., where no claim for damages has been filed in the establishing or altering of a public highway. Section 2581 provides that when claims for dam - ages are filed the county clerk must appoint three suitable and disinterested electors as appraisers to view the prem - ises and report the amount of damage. In the case of Wcnel v. Box Butte County, 108 Neb. 293, and cases therein quoted, it was held by our Supreme Court that under our Constitution "Private property in Nebraska cannot be taken or damages for public use without just compensation therefor. This rule applies to public authorities exercising the right of eminent domain in establish - ing and opening public highways." It is the opinion of this Department that where a petition has been properly filed requesting the establish - ment or alteration of a public highway and where land is taken in pursuance of such petition, or property of a land owner is damaged by reason of the establishment of such highway, it is necessary that the county commis - sioners award to such land owner just compensation therefor notwithstanding the fact that the owner thereof filed no claim for damages within the time required by Section 2582. If no claim for damages has been filed it is the duty of the board or appraiser to allow damages and if the land owner is not satisfied with the amount of damages so awarded he may then appeal. If the damages are found to be only nominal then nominal damages should be allowed to such land owner. LB </seg>

May 17, 1927 Mr. Wade Stevens, County Attorney, Beaver City, Xebraska. Dear Sir You inquire whether or not the counties have any authority to make expenditures for acquiring right-of - way for federal and state highways in case of alteration, relocation or widening. The act to which you refer is H. R. 340, which amends Section 8335, Compiled Statutes, 1922. and seems to cover merely the relocation, altera - tion or widening of a state or federal highway, straight - ening water courses or channels and obtaining road ma - terials. This act provides that the department of public - works may obtain such right of way for the purposes indicated under the same manner of procedure as is now provided for counties, taking real estate for public use as described by H. R. 341. We are inclined to believe that the powers are limited as indicated by the act, and that it does not refer to the opening of an original public highway wherein the county obtains the right of way, etc. This act provides that the department of public works may take this action, but the act amends only Section 8335. We, therefore, con - clude that the rights and obligations of the counties, except wherein they expressly conflict with the provisions mentioned, are not changed. LD </seg>

January U, 1928 Dear Sir: You inquire whether in the opinion of this Depart - ment a county board or the Department of Public Works has power to condemn railroad right of way for highway purposes. Allow me to say that I am of the opinion that a right of way for a highway crossing may be condemned over a railroad right of way by a county board or by the Department of Public Works, but whether light of way running longitudinally upon and over a railroad right of way may be condemned is another question, and is not entirely free from doubt in the absence of a deoi sion by our Supreme Court upon that point. The rule of law laid down by a standard text hook is that the general authority to condemn land for high - way purposes "does not authorize condemnation of railroad property for a street or highway to run longitudinally thereon." 20 C. J., p. 612. Such was the holding of the Supreme Court of New Jersey in the case of New Jersey Southern R. Co. v. Long Branch Cornr's., 39 N. J. L. 28.

            <seg id="p202">204 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL On the other hand the Supreme Court of Washington has held that "The fact that Congress grants to a railroad company a strip 250 feet wide for a right of way is not conclusive that it is all needed by that company, as against proceedings by another railroad company to condemn a longitudinal portion of it for a part of its right of way; but whether it may be condemned depends on the actual necessities of the occupying company and those of the public service." North Coast Ry. v. Northern Pac. Ry. Co., 94 Pac. 112. Take it all in all I am of the opinion that ordinarily right of way of a railroad company and especially right derived by grant from the Federal Government can not be taken under the power of eminent domain for the construction of a state or county highway running longi - tudinally thereon but that such taking can be done where the land taken is not necessary for the successful opera - tion of the railroad and where by such taking the state or county highway can be constructed at less expense and in a more serviceable and efficient manner.

            <seg id="p203">OPINIONS 205 graveling highways connecting state institutions to the state highways when the institutions are not on said state highways, and where the distance does not exceed eight miles. You inquire whether or not connecting roads thus constructed under this appropriation will be sub - ject to the provisions of the maintenance act, Section 8336, Compiled Statutes, 1922, as amended by Chapter 158, page 402, Session Laws, 1925. We are inclined to believe that the provisions made at page 403, Session Laws, 1925, of thirty per cent of the motor vehicle fees is made solely for the purpose of maintaining the state highway system. We do not be - lieve that the said connecting roads constitute a part of the properly laid out and authorized state highway sys - tem such as to permit said connecting highways to be maintained out of the said thirty per cent maintenance fund. This seems further confirmed by the fact that a specific appropriation was made for the construction of these connecting links, thus recognizing that they were not properly speaking a part of the state highway system. Since these connecting roads are a part of the county roads it is possible that the duty of maintenance might rest upon the county. This, however, is a question con - cerning which you have made no inquiry, and we have not given it any further thought or consideration. LD HIGHWAYS— COST AND MAINTENANCE OF BRIDGES OVER CANALS AND IRRIGATION DITCHES November 15, 1927. Mr. C. G. Perry, County Attorney, Bridgeport, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p204">206 KEPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Dear Sir: You state that there is a controversy in your county relative to the cost and maintenance of bridges over a canal or irrigation ditch constructed across section lines. You present four questions as follows : 1. Does anyone have a priority on section lines? "2. If the canal was constructed before the road was laid out and opened up for travel, who must build the bridges and maintain them? "3. If the canal was constructed after the road was laid out who must build and maintain the bridges? "4. If a drainage district is organized either before or after a road is laid out and opened for travel, who must build and maintain the bridges across the drainage canal?" I think for the purpose of this opinion your first two inquiries may be considered together and your inquiries numbered three and four may be considered together. Bridges to be constructed across highways prior to the time same were laid out as public highways, accord - ing to some authorities, may not be required of canal companies. I !&gt; C. J. 1133, note 30.) However, this is in the absence of express requirement, and does not seem to be covered by statute, such as we have in this State pertaining to section lines. In this state the irrigation companies are required to consider as a part of their charter, the statutes of this state. We, therefore, con - clude that Section 2f»07, Compiled Statutes, 1922, must be considered as a part of the charter or conditions under which irrigation companies are operating. This section provides in part as follows : "The section lines are hereby declared to be public roads in each county in the State, and the county board may whenever the public good requires it open such roads without any preliminary survey and cause them to be worked in the same manner as other public roads." </seg>
            <seg id="p205">OPINIONS 207 This section further provides that any damages claimed shall be appraised and allowed in the manner provided by law. It would therefore seem that any irrigation company that constructs its ditch across a potential section line road does so under the express provision of the statute that said section line is a public road which may be opened at any time by the county board. It is probable, therefore, that the county board at the time of the con - struction of a bridge across the section line has the right and should insist upon the construction of a bridge or an agreement to construct a bridge in the future such as will be adequate when the road is open, and which bridge shall be in conformity with the plans and speci - fications for bridges as required by the county board. In the event that the county board, having knowledge of the construction of a bridge substantially in con - formity with the requirements, but not technically so, should permit the construction of such substantial bridge, it is probable that the county would be estopped to later require the construction of a bridge in exact conformity to the requirements of the county board under estab - lished plans and specifications. We base this conclusion upon the holding of the Supreme Court in State V. Drain - ni/r District, 103 Neb. 7(&gt;3, 174 X. W. 615. We think, therefore, that an agreement should be made relative to the construction of such bridges as provided by Section 27."!4, Compiled Statutes, 11(22. In the event there is no agreement entered into in conformity with Section 2374,. and the district constructs a bridge substantially sufficient, we believe that it would then be the duty of the county to maintain such bridge, providing the bridge has been built under the supervision of the county board, and in accord with the established plans and specifications, or providing the county has been notified of the construc - tion or otherwise become aware of the fact of the con - struction and failed to take steps to take supervision of the construction. </seg>
            <seg id="p206">208 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL If no road had been laid out along the section line it does not seem that there would be any necessity for a bridge, until such time as the county should be about to open the highway. If a bridge was constructed, how - ever, for other purposes than for general use of the highways it is possible that the drainage district or others might have some claim for damages upon the opening of the highway, which should be taken into consideration at the time of the requirement of the construction of a bridge as provided by Section 2734. Answering inquiries three and four we think that if the canal was constructed after the road was laid out that the bridges should be built and maintained under the provisions of Section 2734 and other sections pertaining to the maintenance of bridges. What we have hereto - fore set forth also has application to these inquiries. These questions do not seem to have been entirely set - tled in this state by a decision of our court, which is suf - ficiently broad to cover all your questions. The case which peems nearest in point is the one heretofore cited. Trusting that the foregoing may be of some assistance to you in settling the controversy, I am LD HIGHWAYS— JURISDICTION TO APPROPRIATE LAND The Department of Public Works has jurisdiction to appropriate land for a state highway by the exercise of the power of eminent domain within the corporate limits of a village or a city of the second class. August 25, 1927. Mr. R. L. Cochran State Engineer, State House. Lincoln, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p207">OPINIONS 209 Dear Sir: You inquire whether the Department of Public Works has jurisdiction to appropriate land for a state highway within a village or city of the second class by an exercise of the power of eminent domain without the cooperation of the corporate authorities of the city or village. Allow me to say that the correct answer to your question is not entirely free from doubt in the absence of a supreme court decision upon that point, but I am in - clined to believe that the department is clothed with such power, although Section 4316, Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides : "The city council or board of trustees shall have the care, super - vision and control of all public highways, bridges, streets, alleys, public squares and commons within the city or village, and shall cause the same to be kept open and in repair, and free from nuisances," and in the case of Chicago, Rock Island &amp; Pacific Railway Company v. Nebraska State Railway Commission, although by a divided court, it was held: "Whether the state railway commission has any duty to perform in case the proper municipal authorities wilfully refuse to act in regu - lating railway crossings of streets in cities and villages, or has any supervising power of such crossings to safeguard the passengers and employees on trains, is not involved in this case, and is not decided." 89 Neb. 853. The law establishing state highways recognizes that a part of such a highway may be within the corporate limits of a city or village, and expressly provides that the De - partment of Public Works shall maintain such part as lie within the corporate limits of cities of the second class and villages having a population of not more than four - teen hundred.

            <seg id="p210">210 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL HIGHWAYS— MAINTENANCE OF COUNTY LINE ROADS February 7, 1927 Mr. Geon/e V. Webster Shelton. Xcbraska. Dear Sir : You have made inquiry as to the maintenance and improving of the county line road between Hall and Buffalo counties. Section 259(5, Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides that county line roads shall be laid out and maintained by the counties interested at equal expense. We, therefore, be - lieve, that before the same could be graveled or improved it would be necessary to get appropriate action of each of the counties interested. We know of no law of this state which permits graveling of all the roads in the county. In the absence of a statute permitting such roads to be graveled promiscuously we believe that only such roads as are specifically designated as subject for improvement by the county board, including graveling, may be graveled by action of the respective county boards when the road in question is a county line road. Before such county line road can be graveled we believe that such road would have to be a state or county road, such as is distinguished from the ordinary public road of the county. In support of this conclusion we call your attention to Section 2075, which affords the authority for graveling such roads by action of the county boards in counties having not more than 40,000 inhabitants. This section provides that the county board in such counties has power to create suitable road improvement districts, comprising lands, tracts, and parcels of land abutting on, adjacent to, or in the vicinity of such improvement for the purpose of straightening, grad - ing, draining, graveling or macadamizing or paving any state or county road or any part of such roads within the </seg>
            <seg id="p211">OPINIONS 211 limits of their respective county. Under tliis section you will see that the respective county hoard would have to limit the improvement to the half of the county line road within the limits of their respective counties and would make the assessments accordingly. The procedure is as set forth in sections of the statute which next follow Sec - tion 2675.

Dear Sir: I do not believe that this department lias ever been called upon to render an opinion concerning the width and length of a road which may be constructed under the pro - visions of Section 2564, Compiled Statutes, 1922, which reads in part as follows: "Whenever the county board shall deem it necessary, the width of any public road, at any point where a bridge is to be located and constructed, or some obstruction may require it, may be 100 feet for a distance not exceeding 300 feet on either side from the center of such bridge or obstruction." In our opinion a county board when they deem it nec - essary may construct a public road at a place where a bridge is to be located and constructed, and where some ob - struction may require it may provide that the road shall be 100 feet wide for a length of 300 feet, and not to ex - ceed that distance on either side from the center of said bridge or obstruction.

McVracken, Chief, Bureau of Foods, Drugs and Oil, Lincoln, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p213">OPINIONS 213 Gentlemen : In your letter of May 18th you ask our opinion con - cerning the constitutionality of the gasoline and kerosene inspection law, especially that part of the act concerning the collection of fees for the making of inspections. Section 7456, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amended by Chapter 14, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1923, provides the fees for this inspection. Section 3 of that act provides that a charge of 3 cents per barrel shall be made if fifty or more barrels be in - spected at one time and place. In the case of State of Nebraska v. Standard Oil Com - pany, 100 Neb. 826, it was held that a charge of ten cents a barrel was unreasonable and so much of the old statute which provided for this fee was void. This decision was on the ground that this charge could not be made for revenue purposes but only to cover the cost of inspection. In 1923 in Century Oil Co. v. Department of Ar/rieulture, 110 Neb. 100, our court adhered to its former decision and held that a charge of six cents a barrel for inspection was excessive. In the Standard Oil case above cited the testimony showed that the inspections cost the State approximately fifty per cent of the amount that was annually being collected bv the department. In 1923 the Legislature amended the law reducing the charge for inspection from six cents to three cents. It is our opinion that this amendment is constitutional and that in all probability our court would now hold this charge to be valid. This opinion, however, is based on the assumption that this three cents approximates the cost to the department of making these inspections. If it should develop that the inspections could be made at a cost of a </seg>

LCD INSURANCE— ASCERTAINING LIABILITY OF COMPANY Money received from a policyholder that is not to be returned to him in any event should not be counted as a liability against an insur - ance company. November 26, 1927. Honorable John R. Dumont. Insurance Commissioner. State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In your letter of the 16th instant you call my atten - tion among other things to the provision found in Section 7829, Compiled Statutes, 1922, as amended by Chapter 141, Session Laws, 1927, which provides that for the purpose of determining the insurance reserves of a fire or automo - bile insurance company that "In ascertaining its liability there shall be charged in addition to the capital stock all outstanding claims, and a sum equal to the unearned premiums on the policies in force after deducting reinsurance in authorized companies calculated on the gross sum without any de - ductions on any account, charged to the policyholder on each respective risk from the date of the issuance of the policy," and you inquire whether in making the computation of the amounts of unearned premiums the amount of the policy fees received by the company is considered. Allow me to say that in my opinion policy fees are not counted in or considered in determining the gross </seg>
            <seg id="p215">OPINIONS 215 amount of unearned premiums. I assume in arriving at this conclusion that in case of the cancellation of a policy no part of the policy fee is returned to the policy holder, but that he does receive in such a case a return of a cer - tain per cent of what is known as the premium he has paid. I think in determining the liability of the company it is the purpose of the law to determine the gross amount that would be due the several policy holders in case their policies should all be cancelled so as to require a return in each instance of a part of the premium paid. I do not think it is the intent of the law that money received from a policy holder which is not in any event to be returned to him, even though his policy is cancelled, is to be counted as a liability of the company. (1WA IRRIGATION WORKS— JURISDICTION OF STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The State Railway Commission has jurisdiction over irrigation works, but cannot determine property rights therein. July 27, 1928. Leonard D. Dcnsmore. Secretary, Xebraaka State Railway Commission. Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Answering your letter of July 11th relating to the jurisdiction of the Nebraska State Railway Commission, I will say that it is the opinion of this department that the Commission has jurisdiction to hear and determine the issues in Smith v. Gothenburg IAght &amp; Power Company, Formal Complaint No. 605, in so far as they relate to keep - ing irrigation works in proper repair. </seg>
            <seg id="p216">216 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The complaint alleges that Smith and the other com - plainants are the owners of certain real estate specifically described; that the defendant is a corporation which has appropriated water from, the Platte river, which water is to be applied to the lands included in its appropriation, the lands described in the complaint being comprised in such appropriation. It is also alleged that the canals and other irrigation works of the defendant were not properly constructed ; that they have been neglected and are in bad condition, and cannot properly deliver the water to which the com - plainants are entitled; that the defendant will not sell complainants permanent water rights but charges them an annual rental and that, due to the failure of the defendant to construct its laterals and canals properly, the com - plainants, each for himself, have been compelled to con - struct laterals. The prayer is for an order requiring the defendant to clean out, repair and reconstruct the canals and laterals so as to furnish water to the lands of the complainants. The defendant admits appropriation of the water from the Platte river, but denies, upon want of knowledge, that the complainants own the lands described in the petition ; denies all other allegations generally and pleads lack of jurisdiction of the State Railway Commission to hear and determine the complaint. Defendant also pleads the statute of limitations. Prior to 1913 it was held by the State Railway Com - mission, under an opinion of the Attorney General, that it had no jurisdiction over the maintenance of irrigation works. Mead v. Cozad Canal Co., 5 Nebraska State Rail - way Commission Reports 119. In 1913, an act was passed giving the State Railway Commission control of such works, Laws, 1913, Chapter 254, Page 787 (except those of irrigation districts). The act appears in the 1913 Revised Statutes as Sections </seg>
            <seg id="p217">OPINIONS 217 3381-3385 inclusive. It was re-enacted (with slight modi - fications) in 1919. Laws, 1919, Chapter 190, Pages 833 - 834. In 1921, certain parts of the statute were repealed. Laws, 1921, Chapter 255, Page 869. The remaining portions appear as Sections 8418 and 8419, Compiled Statutes, 1922. They read as follows: 8418. "Irrigation works — repair. Every person managing, own - ing or controlling any irrigation works for the storage, carriage or diversion of water, except irrigation districts, shall keep its headgates, diversion dams, canals and laterals in reasonable and proper repair for the delivery and diversion of water to the appropriators under its canal, and the regulation thereof shall be under the control and direc - tion of the state railway commission." 8419. "Penalty. The penalties provided for the violation of the rules, regulations and orders of the state railway commission in mat - ters relating to common carriers, shall be in force as the rules and regulations with reference to this article." The first ground of attack upon the jurisdiction of the Commission seems to be based upon the use of the term "appropriation", that the section of the statute above quoted refers only to actual appropriators and does not refer to those who have the beneficial use of the water. It appears to us that such a construction is unduly nar - row. In fact, the statute itself uses the term "appropri - ator'" as meaning those who have the beneficial use of the water. The terms "canals" and "laterals" would be mean - ingless unless they were used with reference to those ex - pecting to apply the water to the land. The right to the use of the water for irrigation pur - poses is attached to the land to be irrigated. Farmers Canal Co. v. Frank, 72 Nebraska 136; Dundy County Ir - rigation Co. v. Morris, 107 Nebraska 64. Section 8418 must refer not only to the diversion of the water, but also to its application to the land through canals and laterals. </seg>
            <seg id="p218">218 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The power of the State Railway Commission to fix rates provided by Section 8477 is recognized in McCook Irrigation &lt;£• Water Power Co. v. Burtless. 98 Nebraska 141. The power to fix rates would be of little value if there were no means of requiring irrigation works to be kept in such repair as to insure proper delivery of water. The Commission has heretofore required irrigation companies to keep their properties in order. Bartley v. Gothenburg Light &amp; Power Company, 14 Nebraska State Railway Com - mission Reports 122. It is clear that the State Railway Commission has no power to settle disputed property rights or to determine the ownership of irrigation works. McCook Irrigation d- Water Power Co., v. Burtless. Supra. It may also be true that the State Railway Commis - sion lacks jurisdiction to determine what lands are with - in, and what lands are without the area covered by an appropriation. A mere denial, however, that the several complainants own the lands described in the complaint does not of itself defeat jurisdiction. A justice of the peace has jurisdiction of forcible entry and detainer actions, but has no power to determine cases involving titles to real estate. The mere denial of ownership, however, is not sufficient to divest the justice court of justice. Stone v. Blanchard, 87 Nebraska 1. Under such circumstances, the justice should pro - ceed sufficiently far to ascertain whether or not there is involved a substantial question as to the title of real estate. The State Railway Commission should hear the com - plaint and if it finds there is a substantial controversy as to whether or not the lands described in the complaint are within the area covered by appropriation, it should probably refrain from further action.

HL JURY SERVICE Women can \iot serve on juries in Nebraska. September 30, 1927. Mrs. Lillian M. Jfenne. Merna, Nebraska. Dear Madam : You inquire whether or not women may serve on juries in Nebraska and if they cannot why they may not serve. We will answer your last inquiry first. Women can - not serve on juries in Nebraska because the law does not permit it. The qualifications of jurors are fixed by the statute and Section 9071, Compiled Statutes, 1922, in re - ferring to qualifications of jurors includes only male elect - ors over the age of twenty-five years, etc. LI) LICENSES— POOL HALLS Under certain restrictions and conditions, exclusive licenses to conduct pool halls may be granted. September 26, 1927. Mr. J. M. Paul, Attorney-at-Law, Harvard, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p220">220 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Dear Sir: You inquire whether or not a city of the second class such as Harvard has the right to pass an ordinance limit - ing the issuance of a license to but one pool or billiard hall. In other words, has a municipality a right to grant an exclusive license or franchise? In your letter you refer to Section 4188, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. We think that you in - tended to refer to Section 4183. This section provides that cities of the second class shall have power *to license, regulate or prohibit billiard halls and billiard tables, pool halls and pool tables. This seems to be a broad provision granting entire control over the matter to the municipality. 37 C. J. 183, Section 27, is as follows: "Mere power to license, or to license and regulate, does not con - fer the power to create a monopoly by granting an exclusive license. But authority delegated to a municipality to grant or refuse a license empowers it to grant an exclusive license, although the granting of an exclusive privilege as to certain public places does not prevent the city from granting other privileges as to the same subject matter else - where within its limits." 27 Cyc. 892, Par. 1, states as follows: "It is generally held that state legislatures may grant exclusive franchises even despite general or special constitutional provisions against deprivation of liberty and property, where this is shown in the particular case to be justified as a measure for the safety or interest of the public. But in some few decisions exclusive franchises have been said to be unconstitutional as monopolies, since opposed either to general or special constitutional provisions." We think that if your ordinance should recite that it is against the public welfare of the city to have more than one pool hall operating and so fix the reasons for denying licenses to more than one pool hall as to show that it is for the public welfare not to have more than one, that such ordinance under the provisions of our stat - utes and the powers therein granted would be valid. We think that the recitation as to the public welfare would strengthen the ordinance. LD </seg>
            <seg id="p221">OPINIONS 221 LICENCES— RECIPROCALr— HEALING ARTS The Department of Public Welfare is justified in issuing reciprocal licenses to practice the healing: arts when the state from which the applicant comes and in which he has a license maintains stand - ards to regulate the profession equal to those maintained by the State of Nebraska. November 8, 1927. Honorable Lincoln Frost, Secretary. Department of Public Welfare, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In re power of your department to grant licenses with - out examination to applicants from other states to prac - tice the healing arts, allow me to say that the department is given power to grant such licences under certain con - ditions set forth in Section 39 of Chapter 167, Session Laws, 1927. The first of said conditions is as follows: "1. That the state, territory or District of Columbia from which the applicant comes shall have and maintain standards regulating his profession equal to those maintained in that profession by Nebraska." It becomes important then to determine what quali - fications are required of an applicant to practice one of the healing arts who has not been licensed elsewhere. Section 1 of Chapter 164, Session Laws, 1927, otherwise known as the basic science law, provides: "No person shall be eligible for examination or permitted to take an examination for a license to practice the healing art or any branch thereof, or granted any such license, unless he has presented to the Department of Public Welfare a certificate of ability in anatomy, physi - ology, chemistry, bacteriology, pathology and hygiene (hereinafter re - ferred to as the basic sciences), issued by the State Board of Examiners in the Basic Sciences." </seg>
            <seg id="p222">222 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Section 11 of the same act provides: "Any person who shall practice the healing art or any branch thereof without having obtained a valid certificate from the State Board of Examiners in the Basic Sciences, except as otherwise author - ized by Section 16 of this act, shall be fined not more than One Hun - dred Dollars or imprisoned not more than three months, or both, in the discretion of the court." In view of the provisions of the two sections of Chap - ter 164 above quoted it may be construed I think that the provision of Chapter 167, above quoted, requires that the applicant for a reciprocal license has been practicing in a state which has a basic science law. I do not think, however, that such a construction must necessarily be given to the law when consideration is given to the provisions of Section 8, Chapter 164, Session Laws, 1927, which pro - vides : "The State Board of Examiners in the Basic Sciences may in its discretion waive the examination required by Section 7 when proof, satisfactory to the Board, is submitted, showing that the applicant has passed the examination in the Basic Sciences before * * * a board authorized to issue licenses to practice the healing- arts in another state. * * *" I am of the opinion you are justified in issuing said reciprocal licenses when the state from which the appli - cant conies and from which he or she lias a license, has and maintains standards regulating the profession equal to those maintained in that profession by Nebraska, and in determining this question the law provides that the department shall submit to the interested board of ex - aminers any question that requires the exercise of expert knowledge. GWA LIQUOR— MANUFACTURE OF WHISKEY PROHIBITED The Legislature of Nebraska has limited the manufacture of intoxi - cating liquors to Ethyl alcohol for medicinal, mechanical, scientific and other non-beverage purposes and does not provide for the </seg>
            <seg id="p223">OPINIONS 223 manufacture of whiskey or other intoxicating liquors for medicinal, mechanical or scientific use, however, there is provision for the making and use of intoxicating liquors such as are for sacra - mental purposes and compounding of prescriptions by physicians. January 24, 1927. Honorable Thome A. Browne, Manager, Industrial Bureau, Omaha Chamber of Commerce, Omaha, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Brown : Under recent date you wrote us as follows: "A bill is pending in Congress to permit the manu - facture for medicinal manufacturing purposes of whiskey. The bill provides for two distilleries, one to make rye, and one to make bourbon. These will, I understand, be pri - vate enterprises, that is, financed privately, but will be under close government supervision. Will you kindly ad - vise me whether such a plant in Nebraska would be con - trary to the rule of the state?" We first call your attention to the Eighteenth Amend - ment to the Constitution of the United States. The Amendment provides that the manufacture, sale or trans - fer of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation from the United States and all territory subject to its jurisdiction for beverage purposes is hereby prohibited. You will note that this applies to the purposes of use as a beverage only. It would there - fore appear that where the manufacture, etc., is for other purposes than beverage purposes, that the status of the rights of Congress and the several states remains as it was prior to the adoption of the Eighteenth Amendment. We conclude therefore that all powers relative to the manufacture, etc., of intoxicating liquors have not been granted to the national government. It also appears that insofar as the enforcement of the law relating to the manu- </seg>
            <seg id="p224">224 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL facture, etc., for beverage purposes is concerned that Con - gress and the several states have concurrent powers to enforce the provisions of the Eighteenth Amendment by appropriate legislation. We conclude therefore, that the State of Nebraska, has a right to enact any law upon this subject which is not in direct contravention of the powers of ttte United States and that those powers delegated to the United States refer to manufacture, etc., for beverage purposes only. Inasmuch as Congress has the power to enact laws within the provision of the Eighteenth Amendment we be - lieve that the state would not have power to enact a law which would be in direct conflict with the law of the United States enacted within the delegated power. The State of Nebraska, however, does have the power to enact laws which are in harmony with or which do not directly violate the laws of the United States. We note that the Eighteenth Amendment says noth - ing relative to the manufacture, etc., of intoxicating liquors except as the same pertains to the use of liquors for bev - erage purposes. It would therefore appear that under both reserved powers in the state and the express provi - sion of the Eighteenth Amendment relating to concur - rent powers of the Congress and the states that the State of Nebraska has the power to enact laws pertaining to the manufacture and transportation of intoxicating liquor for medicinal or other purposes so long as such laws do not permit the use of intoxicating liquors as a beverage. In following out these reserved and concurrent powers the State of Nebraska has provided by its statutes: "It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture, sell, keep for sale or barter, give away, barter, exchange, transport, purchase, or to sell or to barter under any pretext, any malt, spirituous, vinous and intoxicating liquors, except only certain liquors for medicinal, mechan - ical, scientific or sacramental purposes by persons specifically author - ized in the manner and to the extent only as hereinafter provided. It shall be lawful, however, for any person to make, keep or sell sweet cider, unfermented wine, wood alcohol and denatured alcohol, and noth- </seg>
            <seg id="p225">OPINIONS 225 ing herein contained shall be construed to prevent the bona fide manu - facture and sale of vinegar." The exceptions in Section 3238, Compiled Statutes, 1922, are set forth in Section 3252, Compiled Statutes, 1922. This section limits the manufacture of intoxicating liquors to the manufacture of ethyl alcohol, and does not provide for the manufacture of whiskey or other intoxicants for medicinal or other use. Since the Legis - lature has expressly provided but the one exception we conclude that it was the intention of the Legislature not to authorize the manufacture of other intoxicants than ethyl alcohol in this state. In reaching this conclusion we have not disregarded the provisions of other sections of the statutes relating to government permits and the use of intoxicating liquor for sacramental purposes, and the compounding of pre - scriptions by physicians. We are unable, however, to con - strue these sections as authority for the general manufac - ture of intoxicating liquors. OSS MARRIAGE— DIVORCE LAWS Februarv 28, 1927. Miss Vivian 8. Higgins, Casper, Wyoming. Dear Madam : Section 1555, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides that a decree of divorce shall not become final or operative until six months after trial and decision except for the purpose of review by proceedings in error or by appeal, etc. Under this provision no person has a right to marry within said six months period.

Douglas County v. liroadwell, 96 Neb. 682. As to the time in which the application setting aside shall be made, we call your attention to Carmony v. Carmony, 112 Neb. 651.

            <seg id="p227">OPINIONS 227 Dear Sir: The laws of Nebraska pertaining to the subject of mar - riage relating to the blood relationship of the contracting parties are as follows, omitting the first three sub-divisions of the statute: "Sec. 1491. Marriages are void: "Fourth. When the parties stand in relation to each other of parents and children, grandparents and grandchildren, brother and sister of half as well as whole blood, first cousins when of whole blood, uncle and niece, aunt and nephew; and this subdivision extends to illegitimate as well as legitimate children and relatives." At the time of the marriage the male must be of the age of eighteen years or upwards and the female of the age of sixteen years or upwards. No person afflicted with a venereal disease or who has been adjudged an embecile or a feeble minded person or a person who is, or has been ad - judged afflicted with hereditary epilepsy or hereditary in - sanity may marry in this state until after sterilization. A license is required to be obtained from the County Judge where the maiTiage is to take place. Before the license is issued the County Judge must require an affidavit from each of the applicants stating that each of them is free from venereal disease. If either of the contracting parties has not attained the age of their majority, twenty - one years, the written consent under oath of the parent or parents &lt;»r guardian or guardians shall be first presented to the County Judge before the license shall be issued. LD MOTOR VEHICLES— DAY OF DELINQUENCY FOR AI'TO REGISTRATION December 14, 1927. Mr. F. W. Hoobler, County Treasurer, Loup County, Taylor, Xebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p228">228 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Dear Mr. Hoobler: Section 8:iG9, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides that renewal of automobile registration in coun - ties having population of 80,000 or less, that the renewal becomes due on January 1st each year and delinquent on February 1st each year. In counties having more than 80,000 the day of delinquency is March 1st. Renewals, therefore, in counties the size of yours must be made not later than February 1st. LI) MOTOR VEHICLES Disposition of five cents collected by County Treasurers for registra - tion. March 24, 1927. Mr. H. »Sf. Wiggins, W iff gin 8-Babcock Co in pa n y Hartington, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire relative to the collection and disposition of the five cents collected by county treasurers for each motor vehicle registration. You will note that this is collected under the provisions of Section 8337, Compiled Statutes, 1922 (Chapter 158), as amended at page 402, Session Laws, 1925, which pro - vides that the county treasurer shall retain from the funds collected for automobile registration five cents for each motor vehicle registration, and that said five cents shall be ac - counted for as other fees passing through their hands. Other fees passing through their hands as county treasurer pass into this fund, and it is our opinion that this five cents should be paid into the highway fund. It thus appears </seg>
            <seg id="p229">OPINIONS 229 that the live cents goes into the highway fund to be dis - tributed and expended as otherwise provided by law. It does not go to the county treasurer personally. The high - way fund is distributed according to the budget, as pro - vided for in the provisions of Section 8338, as amended at page 403, Session Laws, 1925, and as provided by other pro - visions of law pertaining to the state highway systems. We believe this answers your inquiry as to the liability of the county treasurer to account for and pay over the five cents to the highway fund. You call our attention to Chapters 82 and 84, Session Laws, 1923, which amend Section 2379, Compiled Statutes, 1922. Chapter 82 was approved March 9th, 1923. Chapter 84 was approved April 23rd, 1923. Neither of these acts was passed with an emergency clause and therefore both would go into effect at the same time. Chapter 84 appar - ently is the last expression of the Legislature upon the sub - ject involved. Neither act was in effect until three months after the adjournment of the Legislature. We conclude that both acts would be in effect insofar as there was no conflict between them. In the event that there is any conflict be - tween the acts, we believe that the last expression of the Legislature would be controlling and that Chapter 84 would control as to any such conflict. LD MOTOR VEHICLES— OBTAINING LICENSES Auto licenses should be obtained in county of residence of owner. January 18, 1927. Mr. C. G. Perry, County Attorney, Bridgeport, Nebraska, </seg>
            <seg id="p230">230 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Dear Sir: You state that residents of your county go into neigh - boring counties to secure registration licenses for their auto - mobiles. You inquire whether or not this may be lawfully done, and what becomes of the license fees paid to the neigh - boring counties? In our opinion the registration license should be ob - tained in the county where the person actually resides. We do not think that the county treasurers in other counties should issue the licenses. In the event they do so, it seems to us they may be illegally collecting the money. The matter of residence for this purpose, however, is largely one of intention of the person obtaining the license. We presume that considerable difficulty might be encoun - tered in most of the cases. We presume that there has been no large adoption of this method of obtaining licenses. LD MOTOR VEHICLES— PENALTIES Penalties do not apply to newly purchased cars until after 10 days allowed for registration. February 7, 1927. Mr. Isaac RmiscIi, Count)/ Treasurer, KimbalJ, Xebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire "whether or not you should collect a $1.00 fee from those who did not have their automobile registered by February 1st, 1927. This is answered by Chapter 159, Session Laws, 1925. We presume that your county is a county having a popu- </seg>
            <seg id="p231">OPINIONS 231 lation of less than 80,000, and therefore the renewal of registrations becomes due on the first day of January, and delinquent on the first day of February each year. This means that owners of automobiles have a time of grace between January 1st and February 1st, which includes the entire month of January within which to pay the renewal registration fees, and that if they fail to pay before Feb - ruary 1st they are delinquent February 1st. This, of course, does not apply to purchasers of automobiles who are regis - tering their automobiles for the first time and who must register within ten days from the time of purchase or be subject to a penalty of $1.00. Penalties are collectable where the registration certificate for preceding year is not pro - duced. LD MOTOR VEHICLES— PLATES AND LICENSES Registration plates for current year should be carried at all times dur - ing the year. November 29, 1927. Mr. F. W. Hoobler, Taylor, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You inquire when 1928 automobile plates and licenses are effective and should be carried on cars. Section 8369, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amended, among other things provides as follows : "Plates and certificates of registration furnished by the depart - ment of public works as provided hereinafter shall be valid during the calendar year only for which they are furnished or issued."

            <seg id="p232">232 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL operation and that the 1928 plates should be attached to the cars beginning January 1st, 1928. This is a matter of construction of the law and we know of no penalty merely for carrying a 1928 license prior to January 1st if the license has been properly secured. However, no person has a right to escape payment of registration fees for 1927 by securing and using a 1928 license prior to January 1st, 1928. LD MOTOR VEHICLES— REGISTRATION FEES Registration fees for part of a year applies to newly purchased vehicles. August 17, 1927. Mr. W. J. Smith, Deputy Sheriff, Bush ii ell, Nebraska. Dear Sir : The registration fees for motor vehicles is provided by Section 8379, Compiled Statutes, 1922, as amended by Chap - ter 152, page 408, Session Laws, 1927. The law provides that the official registration extends from January 1st to December 31st, inclusive. If the vehicle is purchased on or after April 1st and before July 1st the fee is 75% of the annual fee, and after July 1st and before October 1st, the fee is 50% of the annual fee; if purchased after October 1st and before December 31st, 25% of the annual fee. This applies to newly purchased vehicles. On renewals the regis - tration is for the entire year. Answering your second inquiry will say that trucks with licenses of other states are granted the same rights in this state as are granted by the states from which the foreign truck is registered. By this we mean the rights are reciprocal. </seg>

LD OFFICIAL BOND— DE JURE OFFICER Where an official bond is filed out of time, but is approved by the board whose duty it is to fill the vacancy (there being no incumbent to hold over) and the party enters upon the discharge of the duties of his office, he is a de jure officer. February 10, 1928. Mr. Otto F. Walter, Count;/ Attorney, Platte County, Columbus, Xebraska. Dear Sir : Your letter of the 6th instant has just been received and contents noted. Allow me to say that I have read the opinion in the case of State v. Lansing, id Neb. 514, to which you refer, many times, and know that in that case it was held by a divided court that a vacancy occurred ipso facto if the party elected failed to file his bond within the time provided by law. I am also familiar with the reading of Section 5051, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which provides that "If any person elected or appointed to any office shall neglect to have his official bond executed and approved as provided by law, and filed for record within the time limited by this chapter, his office shall </seg>
            <seg id="p234">234 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL thereupon ipso facto become vacant, and such vacancy shall thereupon immediately be filled by election or appointment as the law may direct in other cases of vacancy in the same office." In the later case of Pascton v. State, 59 Neb. 460, the court again said that the failure of a state officer to have his official bond approved and filed for record in the proper office within the time fixed by statute creates a vacancy in the office, but in that case the court said : "The state may waive its right to oust the incumbent and elect to deal with him as the person entitled to the office." It occurs to me that in the case stated by you the situa - tion is analogous and that by the acceptance and approval cf the bond and by permitting the officer to continue in the performance of the duties of his office the county elected to deal with him as the party entitled to the office.

LD PATENT MEDICINES— SALE OF RAT POISON Rat poison is not a patent or proprietary medicine and may not be sold generally by all merchants. January 3, 1927. Hardware Trade, 2-'f29 University Avenue West, Minneapolis, Minnesota. Gentlemen : You inquire whether or not it is permissible in the State of Nebraska for a hardware dealer to sell rat poisons in original sealed packages. </seg>
            <seg id="p236">236 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ■&gt; Section 8212, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides in part as follows : "* * * who, not being a registered pharmacist shall retail, compound or dispense drugs, poisons or medicines of any kind, or any person violating any provision of this article * * * shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor * * * upon conviction thereof be pun - ished by a fine of not less than ten nor more than one hundred dollars or shall be imprisoned in the county jail not less than ten days nor more than ninety days." The only exception of which we are advised is Section 8213, which provides that nothing in the article in ques - tion shall prevent any wholesale or retail dealers in any business from selling any patent or proprietary medicines.

Section 5947, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, pra vides for a license fee for peddlers, but says that this sec </seg>
            <seg id="p237">OPINIONS 237 tion shall not apply to persons selling their own work, pro - duction, charts, maps, or other educational matter, nor to persons selling at wholesale to merchants, nor to persons selling fresh meat, farm products or plants exclusively. We believe, therefore, that the law would be applicable to persons selling as itinerant peddlers any other articles except those specifically exempted in the list. The statute does not otherwise define peddlers. Words and Phrases gives many definitions for the word "peddler." Some cases therein include persons selling at auction. The term seems to exclude persons having a fixed place of business. Under the provisions of the statute and the definitions of the term peddler we have concluded that unless the per - sons mentioned come within the exemption of the statute in selling their own production, etc., and if they appear itinerantly and at different places, that they are within the statutory definition of peddlers, and are violating the pro - visions of Section 5947, unless they have a license as therein provided. LD PUBLIC GRAIN WAREHOUSES— ALFALFA SEED Alfalfa seed is not grain within the meaning of the grain warehouse law. August 11, 1928. Mr. Leonard D. Densmore, Secretary, Nebraska State Raihcay Commission, Lincoln . Nebraska. Dear Sir: Your letter of August 6th inquiring as to whether or not alfalfa seed has been classed as grain under the public grain warehouse law, duly received. </seg>
            <seg id="p238">238 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL There lias been no ruling either of the Railway Com - mission or of the Attorney General's Department upon the subject up to this time. No authority has been found, al - though careful search has been made. When the word "grain" is used in fire insurance poli - cies it has been given wide import. It has been held to in - clude broom corn, Reams v. Farmers Mutual F. I. Co., 78 Mo. App. 14, and corn and millet hay, Norris v. Farmers Mutual Ing. Co., (55 Mo. App. 632. Flax seed has also been held to be grain in a prosecution for larceny as bailee, State of Minn. v. Coirdmj, 81 X. W. 750, 48 L. R. A. 02. Notwithstanding these decisions, it would seem, in view of the fact that the law contains penal provisions and that the handling of alfalfa seed must be more expensive than the handling of grains generally, hardly probable that the Legislature intended to include alfalfa seed within the mean - ing of the grain warehouse law. It must also be recognized that grains are handled in a manner entirely different from the manner in which seeds are handled. It is more reason - able to suppose that the Legislature considered only the leading cereals, corn, wheat, oats, rye and barley, in enacting the statute. If a bonded warehouseman accepts alfalfa seed and issue his warehouse receipt therefor, his bond, as a common law obligation, would presumably cover such seed. In order to avoid all doubt about the matter, however, if seed is to be covered by the bond, it should contain a direct statement to that effect. The Commission should not undertake to enforce the provisions of the grain warehouse law in cases involving the storage of "seeds.'' As pointed out heretofore to the Com - mission, the recent case of Lexington Mill &amp; Elevator Com - pany r. Browne et «/., renders the grain warehouse law, for all practical purposes, ineffective.

January 25, 1928. Leonard Densmore, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, State House, Lincoln. Nebraska. Dear Sir : Your favor of the 13th duly received. Your first ques - tion is as follows : "Is it necessary for a company which has a license and bond, and a provision in the by-laws that the grain stored for members is not protected by the bond, to furnish a bond covering grain of said members, it being understood that the bond on file is to protect the grain of non-members?" The bond of a company storing grain for both members and non-members should cover all grain of both classes. The proviso of the statute relating to bonds, which proviso reads as follows : "Provided, that any warehouse owned and operated by a coopera - tive company, association, partnership or corporation, which stores grain for more than ten days for members of the aforesaid company, asso - ciation, partnership or for stockholders in such corporation, and for such members only, shall not be required to give the bond aforesaid," covers these concerns which store for members only. If they store for non-members also the bond should cover all grain, both that of members and that of non-members.

HL PUBLIC GRAIN WAREHOUSE LAW— CONSTRUCTION OF STATUTE RELATING THERETO June 18, 1927. Leonard IK Den»more, Secretary, Xebra8ka State Railway Com mission, Lin coin , Nebraska . Dear Sir: In reply to your letter of the 14th, requesting on behalf of the State Railway Commission, answers to the questions propounded by the Wilsey Grain Company, I have this to sav: Question 1. "Can a warehouseman under the Public Grain Warehouse Law, limit the amount of grain he will receive and store?" Answer: Yes. Under date of April 14, 1922, this de - partment advised the State Railway Commission thus : "A warehouseman may designate in his application to what ex - tent his elevator will be used for storage purposes; he may thus set aside a part of his elevator for storage purposes and devote the remainder to his own business." The amount of grain that a warehouseman may take is also limited automatically by the size of his bond. Question 2. "Will it be within the rights of the ware - houseman to make a service charge agreed upon between the warehouseman and the owner of the grain or one who proposes to store under the Public Grain Warehouse Law, </seg>
            <seg id="p241">OPINIONS 241 this service charge to be separate or in addition to any charges prescribed under the Public Grain Warehouse Law?" Answer : No Question 3. "fan a warehouseman lapse his permit or license held under the Public Grain Warehouse Law, either by limitation, or by request to have same cancelled? If so, what will be done with the grain stored? Such a condition could arise where the facilities of the warehouseman were sold while operating as a warehouseman, or failure to secure new permit or license, or through the cancellation of the bond." Answer: There is no provision in the statute giving the warehouseman power to terminate a warehouse eon - tract. It seems that in the absence of special circumstances, the contract will run until the end of the year. In case a warehouse is sold, the owner should make provision for car - rying the storage for the remainder of the year. Question 4. "Where an elevator company or mill, not a Licensed Warehouseman under the Public Grain Ware - house Law, receives grain that automatically comes within said law, can it arbitrarily demand of the owner of said grain to sell same within ten days after the same is received into the elevator or mill and pay the market for same on last date before it automatically goes on storage? Or must the elevator company or mill have posted or give notice in effect, 'that all grain received by the elevator or mill will be settled and paid for at the prevailing market price on the last date before automatically going in storage within the meaning of the Public Grain Warehouse Law?' " Answer: The question is not clear. When a warehouse is not licensed and grain is delivered to it, the presumption of law must be that the grain is sold and not delivered for storage. Presumably the price on the day of delivery would govern. </seg>
            <seg id="p242">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 242 Question 5. "Can the owner of stored grain waive any provisions of the Public Grain Warehouse Law?" Answer: The question is too general. There are many provisions of the public grain warehouse law, and I cannot undertake to answer en masse. If the question be presented with respect to a certain provision, I shall endeavor to an - swer it. Question 6. "Does Terminal delivery under Section 6 of the Public Grain Warehouse Law, mean Terminals within the State of Nebraska?" Answer: The terminals mentioned in the statute are those located in Nebraska. Question 7. "In the event of car shortage, must the warehouseman give preference to the delivery of stored grain where demand is made?" Answer: There is no court decision, so far as I have found, covering this subject. The statutory provision con - tains no exception. It reads thus : "Upon demand, presentation of any receipts, and payment of lawful charges, the grain represented therein, or any part thereof, shall be immediately delivered to the owner, or his order, and the part so delivered shall not be subject to any further charge for storage after demand for delivery shall have been made and facilities for receiving and shipping the same have been provided. In case demand is made for a part only of the grain represented by any receipt, the amount so delivered shall be entered in a proper blank upon the face of said re - ceipt and delivery thereof acknowledged thereon by the person holding said receipt. For any grain not delivered within twenty-four hours after such demand, the warehouseman shall be liable upon his bond, to the owner in damages not exceeding one cent a bushel for each day's delay, unless he shall deliver to different owners in the order demanded as rapidly as can be done by ordinary diligence." Question 8. "Give form of 'Surrender Receipt' where terminal delivery is demanded as prescribed under Section 6 of the Public Grain Warehouse Law." </seg>
            <seg id="p243">OPINIONS 243 Answer: The statute does not provide a form of sur - render receipt. The receipt now in use and prepared under Section 5, may be used by making the necessary change as to place of delivery. Question 9. "Can a warehouseman under the Public Grain Warehouse Law, refuse grain for storage that is out of condition, or where the same will be a detriment, loss or prejudice to other grain in same elevator that has been re - ceived for storage, or that belonging to the warehouseman?"' Answer: A warehouseman may properly decline to re - ceived on storage, or that belonging to the warehouseman?" arisen heretofore and the Commission has ruled that grain unsuitable for storage, such as wheat infested with weevil, is not subject to storage. HL PUBLIC GRAIN WAREHOUSE— HALES OF GRAIN Grain held longer than ten days in an elevator, under a contract of purchase, is in storage if price is not paid. October 6, 1927. Mr. Leonard I). Densmorc Secretary, Nebraska titate Railway Com mission Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Densmore: Your favor of October ~&gt;th enclosing a letter from the Grain Dealers Journal and a clipping from that publication at hand. The clipping contains the following : "Can we have grain delivered to us on a contract where - by such grain would be sold on or before a certain future date by the deliverer at a certain amount under the current </seg>
            <seg id="p244">244 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL option at the time of the sale? Would such grain be con - sidered as stored? What is the Nebraska law regarding such a transaction? What form of contract do you recom - mend for this purpose? — P. B. Mock, Mock Milling &amp; Ele - vator Co., Kenesaw, Neb. "Aus. : When an owner of grain has parted with pos - session to the buyer and the price has been agreed upon without any reservation that the seller could demand the grain back, the sale is complete and the buyer owes the seller money instead of grain. Grain so delivered cannot be con - sidered as stored within the Nebraska law." The answer given is without foundation. It is in direct contradiction to Section 7224, Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska for 1!)22, which reads as follows: "Any grain dealer, person, firm, corporation or association, in this state who receives grain for storage or shipment, or both, may avail himself of the provisions of this act by filing notice of his ac - ceptance thereof with the state railway commission and become thereby a public warehouseman. Any grain elevator or grain warehouse (other than at terminal points, which terminal points shall be designated by the state railway commission) in which grain is held in storage for a period longer than ten days is hereby declared a public warehouse within the meaning of this act, and any grain which has been received at any grain elevator or grain warehouse for which payment has not been made within ten days after the receipt of the same is hereby deemed to be held in storage." The form of contract set forth in connection with the answer above quoted follows such answer and is also un - lawful. This matter has been before the District Court of Lan - caster County and has been decided as herein indicated and appeal is now pending in the Supreme Court. Other prose - cutions will be started immediately in similar cases. HL </seg>

Bliss, Secretary, Trade and Commerce, Capitol Building, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir : In answer to your inquiry of recent date based upon a letter of the Northwest Financial Service, Incorporated, I have this to say : The question is whether or not one conducting a trans - fer warehouse receiving from different consigners shipments of goods to be held by him for transfer is required to procure a license and furnish a bond? Under the statutes there is no separate class known as "transfer warehouses". I take it, however,, that the party interested intends operating a general warehouse. He will, therefore, be subject to Chapter 69, Article I, Sections 7161 - 7223, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. Section 7222 thereof provides, in part, as follows : "Any person, firm or corporation doing a public warehouse busi - ness or advertising himself or themselves as a public warehouseman, as defined in this act, shall be required, before transacting any business as such, to file with the governor, to be approved by him, a bond to the State of Nebraska, with good and sufficient sureties in the sum of not less than two thousand ($2000) dollars, nor more than twenty-five thousand ($25,000) dollars in the discretion of the governor, said bond to be for the protection of all persons or companies who may have goods or property stored in such warehouse. Upon approval of the said bond the governor shall issue a license to the warehouseman upon receipt from the state treasurer showing payment of an annual license fee of one ($1.00) dollar for each warehouse operated, which license shall set forth the location and name of such warehouse, and the indi - vidual location and name of such warehouse, and the individual name </seg>

If it be the intention of the operator of the warehouse to handle grain, he will be governed by Sections 7224 et seq.. and if he desires to operate a cold storage warehouse he will be governed by Section 7498 et seq.

April 15, 1927. Mr. Wade Stevens, County Attorney, Beaver City, Xebnutku. Dear Sir: We have your favor of the 14th instant inquiring if the provisions of Section 2389, Compiled Statutes, 1922, limits the maximum amount which a board of county commission - ers may receive as compensation for such service or whether </seg>
            <seg id="p247">OPINIONS 247 sueli board may receive f5.00 per day to cover the per diem in mileage not to exceed $950.00 in counties having popula - tion of less than 13,000 inhabitants, and not under town - ship organization. You inquire if such restriction or limi - tation applies to that part of such section wherein it reads: "Provided, further, that for each actual day employed in directing road work in his district each member of the county board shall be paid the sum of $5.00 per day, to be paid out of the road fund of his district." In reply we direct your attention to that part of said section which reads: "Members of the county boards shall each be allowed for the time they shall be necessarily employed in the duties of that office, the sum of $5.00 per day and ten cents per mile to be paid out of the general county fund: * * * provided, further, the total maximum amount of com - pensation including mileage and per diem to be paid or drawn by any member of the board, except as hereinafter provided, shall not exceed the following amounts per annum; ♦ * * in counties under town - ship organization, having less than 13,000 inhabitants $600; in similar counties not under township organization $950; and provided, further, that for each day actually employed in directing road work in his dis - trict each member of the county board shall be paid the sum of $5.00 per day to be paid out of the road fund of his district." You will observe that the limitation provided for, the per diem and mileage, is to be paid out of the county gen - eral fund ; the service for road work in the district of a commissioner is to be paid out of the road fund of that dis - trict. It is therefore our opinion that in counties not under township organization, having less than 13,000 inhabitants, each member of the county board shall receive as compensa - tion the sum of $5.00 per day and ten cents for mileage, not to exceed the sum of $950.00, to be paid out of the general fund 1 of the county. In addition thereto a county commis - sioner in such county may receive an additional sum of $5.00 per day for compensation for each day actually em - ployed in directing road work in his district.

August 12, 1927. Mr. Victor Bluet, Staplcton, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Blixt : Allow me to say in answer to your letter of inquiry of the Sth instant that in my opinion the County Treasurer of your county is the legal custodian of the sinking fund raised to pay off the bonds of your school district. Section 375, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides among other things that the taxes collected for the purpose of paying interest on and eventually redeeming school district bonds "shall be and remain in the hands of the county treasurer a specific fund for the payment of interest upon such bonds and for the final pay - ment of the same at maturity." Section 377, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides, however, how the County Treasurer shall invest such part of the sinking fund as is levied after the payment of interest and provides among other things that such fund may be invested in registered bonds of the county in which the district is situated or in bonds of the United States or any interest bearing time certificates of deposit in deposi - tories approved and authorized to receive county moneys, and further provides that the interest on such certificates of deposit shall be credited to the sinking fund from which it is derived.

Allow me to say in answer to the question you ask that your Department does have authority to offer a reward for the apprehension and conviction of any person or persons who violate the provisions of the banking law of Nebraska. Section 8040, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, expressly provides that "The department of trade and commerce is hereby authorized and empowered to offer and pay out of the depositors' guarantee fund re - wards for the apprehension and conviction of any person or persons violating the provisions of this article, such rewards not to exceed in any case five hundred dollars."

April 24, 1928. Honorable E. B. Chappell, Municipal Judge, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You call my attention to the provisions of Chapter 54, Session Laws, 1925, which amended the law regulating the salaries of municipal judges in Lincoln and Omaha so as to provide that each of said judges should receive a salary of three thousand dollars per annum instead of two thou - sand five hundred dollars per annum as theretofore, and you inquire whether the judges who had been elected in .November, 1924, for four year terms are entitled to the in - crease in salary in view of Section 19 of Article III of the Constitution, which reads as follows : "The Legislature shall never grant any extra compensation to any public officer, agent, or servant after the services have been ren - dered nor to any contractor after the contract has been entered into nor shall the compensation of any public officer, including any officer whose compensation is fixed by the Legislature subsequent to the adoption hereof be increased or diminished during the term of office." Allow me to say in answer to your question that in my opinion a judge is not barred from receiving such increase in salary by the above quoted provision of the Constitution. In the case of Douglas County v. Tim me, 32 Neb. 274, it was held that the provision of the Constitution, that the salary of any public officer shall not be increased or dimin - ished during his tenn of office applied alone to those offices which were created by the Constitution and did not apply </seg>
            <seg id="p251">OPINIONS 251 to the office of county commissioner, which was created by the Legislature. The office of municipal judge is not created by the Con - stitution. It is not mentioned in that instrument. It is therefore within the rule laid down in the case of Douglas County v. Timme, supra. It is true that since that case was decided the words "including any officer whose compensation is fixed by the Legislature subsequent to the adoption hereof be increased or diminished during his term of office" have been added to the constitutional provision relating to a change in the compensation of public officers, but I do not regard this as tending in any way to change the definition of the term "public officers" as given in Douglas County v. Tim me, supra. It has reference alone, I think, to those offices which were created by the Constitution without any fixing of salaries in that instrument, but with power given to the Legislature to fix the compensation. I may add that in the case of Doualas Count 1/ v. Timme the Supreme Court cited with approval the Wisconsin case of Martin v. Kalb, in which that court held that "An act of the legislature creating a county court of limited civil and criminal jurisdiction, and fixing the salary of the judge, payable out of the county treasury, may be amended so as to change the salary of the judge of such court during the term for which he has been elected; and the constitutional provision which forbids the 'compensa - tion of any public officer' to be 'increased or diminished during his term of office,' (Constitution, Art. IV, Sec. 26) is inapplicable to such a case." 50 Wis. 178. Tn the recent case of State v. Outr/amic County, 185 X. W. 184, the Supreme Court of Wisconsin approves the rule laid down in the case of Martin v. Kalb, supra, and says further: "Const. Art. 4, Sec. 26, relative to increase or diminution of the compensation of public officers during their term, applies only to officers having a fixed salary from the state." GWA </seg>

            <seg id="p255">OPINIONS 255 under the sixth paragraph of Section 4874 of the Com - piled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which provides among other duties of the Secretary of State "to take charge of and keep in repair and replenish the furniture of the state house, except as otherwise provided." This section is specific in its reference to furniture. However, a court might find that there is some conflict between the above quoted paragraph and Section 7283, and the six succeeding sections, of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which provides for the submission of estimates and the purchase of "all office supplies." Whether "all office supplies" would include furniture without specifically mentioning same is not entirely be - yond doubt in the absence of a court decision. However, it appears that since the enactment of Section 7283, and the following sections, the Legislature through appropria - tions and the Department of Finance, and the officers of the state generally, have considered and treated the same as including the purchase of furniture. It is my opinion that since these sections constitute the last provisions of the Legislature, and that by reasonable inference, it was the intent that the Department of Finance should purchase all supplies, such department is justified in the purchase of such needed furniture and should be sustained in so doing. However, it might be well to obtain, if possible, the sanction of the Secretary of State in the purchase of such furniture, and thereby eliminate any question in the premises.

            <seg id="p256">256 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Gentlemen : You ask this department to answer four or five ques - tions relative to the office of road overseer, and w° will endeavor to answer them in the order in which they are asked. 1. Is there, under the statutes, as they stand at present, such an office as road overseer? This office is one existing by virtue of Section 1912, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922. We also call your attention to Section 2(590, Compiled Statutes, 1922. 2. What is the compensation of a road overseer? Section 2690, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, fixes his compensation at such sum as the township board in counties under township organization, or the county board in other counties may deem just and proper, but in no event to exceed $4.00 per day for all the time nec - essarily employed in the discharge of his duties as road overseer. This fixes the general compensation. How - ever, under the provisions of Sections 114, 188, and 1S9, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska, 1922, specific provision is made for compensation pertaining to filling of pitfalls and old wells, and for which service a road overseer is to receive #2.00 per day and compensation for material furnished, and for his services in the eradication of prairie dogs he is paid at the rate of $3.00 per day together with all expenses necessarily incurred for poison, material and apparatus. 3. What are the duties of a road overseer? Road overseers' duties are so numerous that we will not attempt to quote them, but call your attention to the following sections of the Compiled Statutes, 1922: 113 to 115, 187 to 189, 2638 to 2640, 2691 to 2704, and 4241. 3-a.

Section 2692, Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides that the precinct overseer shall be at all times under the di - rection and control of the county board. 4. Is it not the duty of the county commissioners to approve their bonds? In answer to this question we are assuming that the road overseer's bonds have been in proper form, with suffi - cient sureties, and have been filed with the county board. Under these conditions we believe that it is the duty of the county board to approve the bonds. Section 5043 and Section 50,51, Compiled Statutes, apply to this question. We also call your attention to the case of Duffy v. State, (50 Neb. 812, and the case of State e.v rel v. Willott, 103 Neb. 801-2. These cases held that it is the duty of the county board to so act and if the bond is held up for the refusal of the board, an officer who tenders the bond is not removed from office under the provisions of other sec - tions for having failed to take and have approved and filed his bond.

Martin, rendered July 6, 1912, upon a former and similar application. His objections to a se - curity issue at that time were that the company was or - ganized for many purposes and that the securities would, if issued, cover non-public utility property as well as public utility property. There was no appeal from the decision of the Commission dismissing the former application. The company, however, proceeded to issue securities without authority. The first objection of Attorney General Martin does not seem to be serious. A company may doubtless per - form non-public utility functions as well as public utility functions. The second objection still seems to be valid. The en - tire property is listed in the application. Of course, the Commission has no jurisdiction over anything but the public utility property and such property as may be so intimately connected with it as to be deemed a part of it. It is also noted that the prayer does not show the exact purpose for which the proposed security issue is asked. If permission is granted to issue securities, it should show exactly what property is covered thereby. Appro - priate conditions should also be imposed as to the separat - ing of revenues and expenses in the accounts and such other provisions sh'ould be added as will adequately protect the public utility portion of the property.

The Board of Medical Examiners may make its own examination. January 26, 1928. Dr. H. J. Lehnhoff. Lincoln, Xebraska. Dear Sir : You ask: "Is it within the law for the Board of Medical Exam - iners to accept the inspected examination papers of the Basic Science Board in Basic Science subjects and make such inspection for the basis of our examination in those subjects and not repeat examinations in those Basic Sci - ence subjects?" Allow me to say in answer to your question, that the law regulating the practice of medicine and surgery provides among other things that the applicant shall "2.

Lincoln Frost, Secretary, Department of Public Welfare, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In your letter of May 29th you state that a smallpox epidemic recently broke out in Cortland; that a number of school children were vaccinated and that all school chil - dren had become contacts; that it was ordered that all school children be vaccinated or stay out of school. You call our attention to Section 8223, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, and ask our opinion as to who shall </seg>
            <seg id="p262">262 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL bear the expense of this vaccination, the individuals or the village board of health. It is our opinion that the expense of vaccination should be borne by the individual. It would seem that the intent of Section 8223, Compiled Statutes of Nebras - ka for 1922 would be to deal with general conditions, that is, to eradicate mosquitoes in case of malaria epidemic; seek the cause and correction thereof in case of typhoid epidemic; make the necessary investigations in the case of smallpox epidemic and enforce general rules and regu - lations for the control thereof. In our opinion this section would not be extended to the treatment of individual cases, especially where as in this case, the individual may be vaccinated or stay away from school. Permit us to quote from Bartlett v. Dahlsten, 178 N. W. (Neb.) 636, wherein a physician brought suit to recover for his services under contract to the board of health to diagnose and examine a number of persons during an epidemic to determine the nature of the epidemic. The court said in part : "When a physician performs services of such kind for the county he, of course, ought to be allowed to recover from the county, though the individuals examined and quarantined were not paupers nor a county charge. The obligation of the county rests upon contract, and, though it might be that the individual would be liable, the county is at least primarily liable to the physician." "The right of the duly constituted county authorities to employ a physician in an emergency of this kind seems to us to come clearly within the express authority given to the county to provide and enforce regulations in order to prevent the introduction and spread of con - tagious diseases, and it must be that the examination and diagnosis necessary for purposes of quarantine of contagious diseases is one of the regulations contemplated and intended to be covered by the statute. It would seem in this case that there being no con - tract by the Board of Health that the treatment being in - dividual and optional that the village Board of Health would not be liable for the expense of these vaccinations.

August 22, 1928 Mr. W. J. Braham Superintendent, North Piatte, Nebraska. Dear Sir : In answer to your letter of recent date wherein you ask our opinion as to the legality of the ruling of your local Board of Health to the effect that all children who have not had smallpox or who have not been vaccinated within a period of five years must be vaccinated before re - turning to school in September. Section 4022, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides : "To make regulations to prevent the introduction and spread of contagions, infectious or malignant diseases into the city, and a board of health shall be created, consisting of five members — the mayor, who shall be chairman, a physician who resides permanently in the city, who shall be medical adviser, the chief of police, who shall be secretary and quarantine officer, the president of the council, and one other mem - ber — a majority of such board shall constitute a quorum and shall enact rules and regulations, which rules and regulations shall have the force and effect of law, to safeguard the health of the people of such city, and prevent nuisances and unsanitary conditions, enforce the same, and provide fines and punishments for the violation thereof." The only question that we can see that might arise would be whether or not this requirement is reasonable. We believe in the light of medical science in the year 1928 that the requirement of the Board of Health would un - doubtedly be held by the courts to be reasonable and our opinion therefore is that the requirement is valid and lawful and mav strictlv be enforced.

Dear Sir: The question you present is as follows "Does the Nebraska State Railway Commission have jurisdiction upon the complaint to require railroads own - ing parallel tracks to abandon track of one road and re - quire both railroads to use the remaining track?" The question must be answered in the negative.

February 1, 1928. Mr. Leonard D. Densmore, Secretary, State Railway Commission. State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p265">OPINIONS 265 Dear Sir : In response to your letter of January 31st, concern - ing the inquiry of Mr. W. S. Barlow, I wish to say there is no statutory provision in Nebraska concerning clearance between railroad tracks and adjacent structures. The only provision directly related to the subject is Section 7099, Compiled Statutes, 1922, dealing with wires on highways. Several bills have been presented to the Nebraska Legis - lature in recent years, but none has passed. The State Railway Commission has jurisdiction under the constitution, to prohibit the construction of buildings where sufficient clearance is not provided, but as yet no general order has been entered. I am inclined to think that the power may be exercised in regard to structures now standing, although it should be said neither of these matters has ever been presented to our Supreme Court. A number of very serious accidents indicates the great hazard of having structures so close to railroad tracks as not to afford adequate clearance HL RAILROAD PASS— INSURANCE INSPECTOR An inspector employed by an insurance company, although inspecting railroad property, is not entitled to a pass. October 6, 1927. Mr. C. A. Randall, Chairman, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Randall : The following question was submitted by the State Railway Commission to this department : </seg>
            <seg id="p266">266 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL "Is the furnishing of a pass by the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad Company to an inspector employed by an insurance company which insures property of the rail - road company, the pass being for the use of such inspector in examining such property, a violation of the anti-pass law (Section 5440, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922)." It is understood that while the inspector is an employee of the insurance company his inspection is for the benefit of both the insurance company and the railroad company. As the inspector is an employee of the insurance company and draws his salary from that company, and is not an em - ployee of the railroad company, it is the view of this de - partment that the issuance of a pass is not permissible. The insurance company may charge for the expense of the inspector and bill the railroad company therefor including the sum the inspector may pay in railroad fare.

Kennedy, Holland, DeLacy &lt;£ McLaughlin, Attorney at Law, 1502 City National Bank Building, Omaha, Nebraska. Gentlemen : For the purposes of law enforcement and to save human life and protect property interests we desire to call atten - tion to the matters herein stated and ask that the railway companies give some publicity so far as possible. </seg>
            <seg id="p267">OPINIONS 267 The Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922 provide : "Section 9919. Stealing Ride on Train Unlawful. — Whosoever shall climb upon, hold to or attach himself in any manner to any locomotive engine, railroad train or trains of any character, while the same are in motion or not in motion or stationary, or who may ride, or attempt to ride upon any locomotive engine, railroad train or trains of any char - acter, or upon any part thereof, for the purpose and with the intent of stealing a ride thereon anywhere within this state shall be guilty of a misdemeanor: Provided this section shall not apply to an employe of a railroad company operating such trains, locomotive or cars, nor to any other person having business with or acting under authority of the owner or operator thereof. "Penalty for stealing a ride— Whosoever shall be convicted of a violation of any of the offenses mentioned in the second next preced - ing section shall be punished by imprisonment in the county jail for a period not less than five days and not exceeding thirty days at hard labor or a fine of not less than five dollars and more than twenty-five dollars. "Section 5807.

An appalling number of persons are killed and injured each year while violating the foregoing statute. This num - ber is made up of persons unauthorized by law to ride free upon the railroads. A campaign by the peace officers and railway officers of the state should be inaugurated at once in an effort to put a stop to these injuries. It is found that during the summer season this law is most frequently violated, and generally by those who claim to be coming west looking for work in the harvest or re - turning therefrom.

LD RAILROADS— STREET CROSSING — JURISDICTION OF RAILWAY COMMISSION The State Railway Commission has no jurisdiction over a street cross - ing over a railroad within an incorporated village. October 31, 1927. Mr. Leonard Deitsmore, Secretary, N&amp;bmska State Railway Commission Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Densmore : Your inquiry, whether or not the State Railway Com - mission has jurisdiction over the construction of a street crossing over a railroad, such crossing being on a legally opened street within an incorporated village, has been con - sidered. Under the constitutional provision, Section 20 of Arti - cle IV, creating the State Railway Commission, the Com - mission has a limited control over all highway crossings, whether within or without incorporated municipalities to secure the safety of both passengers and train operatives upon railroads and, it seems, to secure the safety of travel - era upon the highways. This power is recognized in C. R. I. d- P. Co. v. Nebraska S+ate Railway Com., 88 Neb. 239. Same case on rehearing, 89 Neb. 853. Aside from that general power the State Railway Com - mission has no authority over the construction and main - tenance of crossings over railroads within incorporated vil - lages, towns and cities unless the same has been conferred by statute. </seg>
            <seg id="p269">OPINIONS 261 The only statutes relating thereto is the act of 1921, being Chapter 261 of the Laws of Nebraska for 1921, p. 877, Compiled Statutes, 11)22, Sections 5524-5530, inclusive. Section 5 of that act has been alleged to confer power on the Railway Commission to supervise the construction of railroad crossings within incorporated villages, towns or cities. Section 5 (Section 5528, Coinp. Stat. Neb. 1922) pro - vides : "Whenever complaint is filed in writing with the state railway commission by the duly authorized officers of any incorporated village, town or city relative to any crossing- or crossings within such village, town or city, praying for relief from the matters complained of, the commission shall hold a hearing in the manner provided by Article X, Chapter 67, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913 (Article X, Chapter 59), and shall make such order as the facts warrant. The findings of the commission, subject to the right of appeal, as provided in section 6132, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, (5491), shall be binding on the parties to the suit." Does that section confer upon the State Railway Com - mission the same general power, if complaint be made, over crossings of highways over railroads within incorporated cities, towns and villages that it has over such crossings without such municipalities? The answer must be in the negative because Section 5 of the act goes beyond the title and because it is inconsistent with the title. The title of the act is as follows : "AN ACT relating to the construction, repair and maintenance of all crossings of all railways and highways, both private and public; to place the supervision of the construction, repair and maintenance of such crossings outside of incorporated villages, towns and cities under the jurisdiction of the State Railway Commission; to require railways to construct and maintain crossings, gates, signs, signboards and warn - ings at crossings in such manner as the State Railway Commission shall require; to amend Section 3016 and to repeal said original sec - tion; to repeal Sections 3017, 3018, 6042, 6049, 6050 and 6051 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, and to repeal all other acts and parts of acts in conflict herewith." The title contains four clauses. The first relates to the construction, repair and maintenance of all railway cross- </seg>

            <seg id="p272">270 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL ings over highways; the second vests the State Railway Commission with jurisdiction over such crossings outside of incorporated villages, towns and cities; the third provides that railways shall construct and maintain crossings, signs, etc., at crossings, according to rules formulated by the State Railway Commission; the fourth provides for the amendment of an existing statute and for the repeal of cer - tain other sections of the statutes. The third clause does not specify the location of crossings, but simply says "at crossings.' 11 As stated above, the first clause of the title apparently covers all crossings, wherever located, because the word "highway" is employed. That is a generic term comprehend - ing all manner of public ways including railroads and rivers. Boiird of Coniiin^U.'iiers v. Catfetter, (Ind. App. ) 33 N. E. Rep. 980; Union Par. R. v. Com. of Col fax Co., 4 Neb. 450 (456). lint the term "highway" does not necessarily include the term ''street". The latter is generally used concerning thoroughfares in incorporated cities, towns and villages. Gahrstoii H. &lt;k 8. A. K. Co. v. Houston E. Co., 122 S. W. (Tex.) 287; Elliott on Roads and Streets, (4th Ed.), Sec. 1. The cases denning the term "highway'' are not in har - mony with one another, but for the purpose of this discus - sion we shall assume that the word "highway" appearing in the title of the act was used in its broadest sense. That being assumed, the second clause of the title correspond - ingly restricts the powers granted to the State Railway Com - mission, that, is if it was intended by the use of the word "highway" in the first clause to include street crossings within incorporated cities, towns and villages, then by process of exclusion streets are entirely eliminated from the power granted to the commission as it is expressly pro - vided that the supervision, construction, etc., "of such cross - ings outside of incorporated villages, towns and cities" are placed under the jurisdiction of the State Railway Commis - sion. </seg>
            <seg id="p273">OPINIONS 271 The conclusion that the State Railway Commission has no jurisdiction over railroad crossings over streets in cities, towns and villages, by virtue of this statute, is based upon the following considerations: (A) The act, if interpreted as conferring jurisdiction over crossings within incorporated municipalities on the State Railway Commission is broader than its title and inconsistent with its title which specifically restricts juris - diction to crossings outside of incorporated villages, towns and cities. (B) If such construction were to be placed upon the statute, it would require a repeal of other sections of the statute not mentioned in the act under consideration, the act not being complete within itself. Attention is called to the language of the several sec - tions of the statute, t'nder the first section which amends the former act it is made the duty of every person or corpora - tion owning or operating a railroad crossed by a "public road" to make and keep in good repair, good and sufficient crossings. The term "public road" is not as comprehensive as the term "highway" ; it usually refers only to rural cross - ings and not to those within incorporated cities, towns and villages. Trim, d- A. /.'. Co. v. Adams, 40 Tenn. 596. The subject has been expressly passed upon by the su - preme court of this state in the case of Nebraska Tclcphofne Company v. Western In d. L. D. S. Co., 68 Neb,. 772, in which the court said : "Ordinarily, in construing a statute, words should be given their usual and recognized meaning. State v. Byrum, 60 Neb. 384; State v. Weston, 4 Neb. 216. It is only where such construction would be obvi - ously repugnant to the intention of the lawmakers that a different con - struetion is allowable. "Whatever may be the usage in other jurisdictions, we think it safe to say that in this state the term 'public roads' is commonly understood and recognized to apply exclusively to rural highways. It is thus under - stood and used by the people of the state generally, and it is doubtful whether, in the ordinary affairs of life and common conversation, it is ever used or understood to convey the idea of a street or alley of a </seg>
            <seg id="p274">272 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL city or village. This is a matter of common knowledge, and of which this court must take judicial notice. There is nothing in the act itself, nor in the legislative history of the state, that suggests that the legis - lature used the term in any other sense than that in which it is com - monly used by the people of the state. The statutes of the state were before the legislature when the act was passed. In those relating to cities and villages the term 'public roads' never occurs, while in those relating to rural highways it is invariably used, save in some cases where the term 'highway' is used as its equivalent. The statutes in force at that time vested county boards with the general supervision over 'public roads' (Compiled Statutes, 1885, ch. 78, sec. 1), and mu - nicipal authorities with the control of their streets and alleys (Com - piled Statutes 1885, ch. 13, sec. 15, subdivision 24, and ch. 14, sec. 77). At that time cities, as an additional remedy against encroachments on their streets and alleys, had express authority to enact ordinances to prevent the use of such streets and alleys for telegraph and telephone poles and wires, (Compiled Statutes, 1885, ch. 13, sec. 15, subdivision 8, and ch. 14, sec. 39, subdivision 21). "At the same session at which the act in question was passed, an act was passed for the incorporation of cities of the metropolitan class, and another for the incorporation of cities of the first class, conferring upon such cities the power to enact such ordinances (Session Laws, 1887, ch. 10, sec. 50, and ch. 11, sec. 68, subdivision 14), while the au - thority of cities of the second class in that behalf was left untouched. It seems to us that but one reasonable inference is to be drawn from the foregoing, and that is that the legislature had in mind the popular distinction between 'public roads' and 'streets and alleys,' and used the former term in the act under consideration in the sense in which it is generally used and understood by the people of this state, and not in its generic sense as including the streefs and alleys of municipal corpora - tions; because it dealt with the latter in such a manner as to clearly indicate that it regarded them as something separate and distinct from the public roads cf the state." See also City of Central City v. Marquis, 75 Neb. 233. The language of section one also indicates clearly that rural roads are intended and not city streets because it at - tempts to fix the minimum width of the crossing which might or might not correspond with the width of alleys or streets within incorporated municipalities, and further, because it authorizes the State Railway Commission to amend the re - quirements of the statutes as to the kind of material used in constructing crossings which might not be the material specified by a village or city for paving its streets. </seg>
            <seg id="p275">273 OPINIONS Section 2 of the act provides that the State Railway Commission shall have jurisdiction over all crossings of high - ways "outside of incorporated villages, towns and cities. 1 ' Nothing could be plainer than the restriction of the juris - diction granted to the Commission by that language and the whole force of the section is limited by the concluding provision that the Commission shall make such requirements as it shall deem adequate for the protection and necessity of the public, whether passengers on the railroads or travel - ers on "such ways." The only ways that could be intended arc those outside of incorporated municipalities. Section :{ provides that whenever any railroad track shall cross "any such way" in a cut, etc., the Commission shall direct the precautions that shall be taken. While the latter part of the section is in general language and might refer to urban crossings, there is nothing to indicate that it is not limited by the first part which provides for dangerous crossings in "any such way". Section 4 of the act directs that a railroad company shall construct and keep in repair at least one adequate crossing wherever any person owns land on both sides of the right of way. As cities are usually built upon plots of land divided into relatively small tracts, such as lots and blocks, it seems entirely unlikely that the language refers to any - thing but rural crossings. Further, the conditions which the State Railway Commission may impose relating to un - derground crossings and wing fences indicates that the crossings are to be used where livestock is kept. Coming now to Section 5, which it is said confers power upon the State Railway Commission, attention is called to the fact that there is nothing specifically mentioned in that paragraph about which complaint might be made. It simply provides that wherever complaint is filed with the State Railway Commission "by the duly authorized officers" of any incorporated municipality, praying for relief "from the matters complained of" the Commission shall hold a hear - ing and make a suitable order. It is a general principle </seg>
            <seg id="p276">274 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL that jurisdiction must be conferred, if conferred at all, by plain and unmistakable language. There is also an irrecon - cilable conflict between this section and Sections 5125, 5126 and 5135, Kev. Stat. 1913, the same being Sections 4300, 4301 and 4310, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. It is easily seen that a great many matters relating to crossings in cities and villages might be the subjects of con - sideration by the courts that would have nothing to do with the operation of a railroad, at least nothing directly to do with it. Again, the act is broader than its title because there is an attempt to repeal other sections of the statute without mentioning them specifically. Section 4310, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides that cities of the second class and villages shall have power by ordinance to require the lighting of railroad tracks within such cities and villages. Section 4300 authorizes cities and villages to regulate depots, depot grounds, etc., and to regulate the passage of railways through their streets and public grounds. Section 4301 authorized the city or village to regulate the crossing of railway tracks and to provide precautions and prescribe rules regulating the same and to regulate the running of railway engines, cars, etc., and to govern the speed thereof and generally to prevent accidents at crossings. These provisions are directly in contradiction to the provisions of Section 5 of the act under consideration if it be considered that Section 5 grants the power to regulate crossings within incorporated cities and villages to the State Railway Commission. Nor can the provisions of Section 5 be sustained upon the ground that the act in question is complete within itself for Section 6 specifically provides as follows : "The provisions of this Act shall not be construed as a limitation on the powers of the State Railway Commission which have heretofore </seg>
            <seg id="p277">OPINIONS 275 been granted, but as supplemental and additional thereto. The powers herein granted shall not be construed as extending to the projection of a new public highway crossing or to the abandonment of an existing public crossing." (C) The act if interpreted as conferring jurisdiction on the Commission is inconsistent with its title. No one residing the title, which in the second clause specifically limits the supervision and construction of crossings to those outside of incorporated villages, towns and cities, would, from the general language used in the third clause, conclude that the enactment actually intended to give just as much power over crossings within incorporated towns, cities and villages, as without them in case complaint were filed. There is nothing in the subsequent acts, Chapter 167, Laws of 1923, page 397, and Chapter 163, Laws of 1925, page 425, that would modify the views herein expressed. The title of the act of 1!&gt;21 seems to preclude the idea of vesting the State Railway Commission with jurisdiction over crossings within incorporated municipalities and the conclusion of this department is that the subject matter of Section 5 of that act is not fairly within the title of the act and that consequently it was inserted therein in viola - tion of the constitutional provision (Art 3, Section 14) and is invalid. It is easily severable from the remainder of the act and does not seem to have induced the inclusion of any other section of the act. It is our opinion that the invalidity of Section 5 does not in any wise involve the constitutionality of any other portion of the act.

Section 9049 is as follows : "Any person convicted of a violation of any of the provisions of the last two preceding sections shall pay for every offense a fine not less than five nor more than fifty* dollars." There appears to be no statutory provision as to un loading the animals for rest. HL RAILROADS— WATER TANKS— JURISDICTION OF STATE RAILWAY COMMISSION The State Railway Commission has no jurisdiction over a controversy growing out of damage caused by a leaky water tank maintained by a railroad company. December 12, 1927. Mr. Leonard D. Densmore, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p279">OPINIONS 277 Dear Mr. Densmore : Your inquiry of the 6th has been considered. The question is whether or not the Nebraska State Rail - way Commission has jurisdiction of a complaint against a railroad company for allowing a water tank to leak and thereby cause land nearby to become so wet as to prevent its use for fanning. Under the statement of facts submitted the controversy is solely between the complaining land owner and the com - pany. It presents a judicial question which the courts should determine. It is concluded that the State Railway Commission has no jurisdiction in the matter.

July 6, 1928. Mr. A. H. Duxbury, County Judge, Plat ts mouth, Xcbraska. Dear Sir : You inquire : "Does Section 9999 give defendant a right to appeal to the district court where he has entered a plea of guilty and received the minimum penalty, and would the filing of the appeal bond stay the running of the sentence by virtue of said section and without the order specifically suspending or staying the running of the sentence?" </seg>
            <seg id="p280">278 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL In answer to your first question I will say that I do not find where the Supreme Court of this state has ever passed upon it, but the general rule as laid down in a stand - ard authority is that "When a judgment is properly entered on a plea of guilty, it can - not be reviewed either by appeal or by writ of error, since such judg - ment is in effect a judgment by confession." 17 C. J., p. 32-33, §3295. Whether an appeal bond put up in such a case auto - matically stays the running of the sentence is another mat - ter. I am of the opinion, however, that the execution of the sentence is not suspended as a matter of law by the giving of a recognizance for an appeal where no appeal is permissi - ble, but that the defendant who has given the recognizance and secured as a matter of fact a suspension of sentence will be estopped to assert that he was serving his sentence during the time the sentence was suspended.

Section 6477, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. I assume that in making the ruling he did, Superin - tendent Taylor had in mind the provision of the State Con - stitution that "The Legislature shall provide for the free instruction in the com - mon schools of this state of all persons between the ages of five and twenty-one years." Section 6, Art. VII, Constitution of Nebraska. The above quoted provision of the Constitution was cited with approval in the case of Martins v. School District, 101 Neb. 258. In the opinion written in that case it is said : "Statutes pertaining to our public schools should be liberally con - strued to the end that all persons of school age may enjoy their privileges. A rule of a board of education that would prevent plaintiff or any person similarly situated from attending its public schools can not be enforced." GWA SCHOOLS— BOARD OF TRUSTEES— FILING ACCEPTANCE The provision that a school district trustee shall file his acceptance within ten days is directory rather than mandatory and where the acceptance is not filed until after the ten days has expired, but is accepted when filed and the party is permitted to enter and does enter upon the performance of the duties of the office, he becomes a de jure member of the school board. </seg>
            <seg id="p282">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 280 July 19, 1927. Mr. Oscar H. Oakcs, Secretary, Board of Education, Sale in, Xebraska. Dear Sir : Iu answer to your letter of inquiry of the 16th instant allow me to say that Section 0340, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides among other things that those elected as members of the Board of Trustees of a school dis - trict organized under Article VI of the School Law shall "Within ten days after their election * * * file with the di - rector a written acceptance of the office to which they have been elected." A former state superintendent in construing a similar provision of statute in regard to the officers of a rural school district held that "An officer elected or appointed should not fail to file a written acceptance with the director; a verbal acceptance is not enough." This opinion of the State Superintendent has weight for the law provides that "He shall decide disputed points in school law and all such de - cisions shall be held to have the force of law until reversed by the courts." It is the personal opinion of the writer that the require - ment that notice be filed within ten days after the election should be regarded as directory rather than mandatory and that if a party elected files his acceptance within a reason - able time, although not quite within the ten days, he should be allowed to serve. I am of the opinion, however, that if the acceptance is not filed within ten days nor at any time before the term of office should begin, the courts will hold that the old officer can hold over if he wishes to do so.

Children whose residence is else - where, but who are staying temporarily for school purposes in a school district, are not entitled to free tuition in that district. October 8, 1928. R. A. Scott, Secretory, Board of Education, Sutherland, Nebraska. Dear Sir : You say : "With respect to the collection of tuition for this school district, please give us a ruling as to whom should be com - pelled to pay tuition. "We have a number of Mexican beet laborers in this community who own no property and whose home is wher - ever they happen to be and from whom, as we understand it, we have no chance of collecting any tuition. "We have some ranchers living north of Sutherland, who have bought property in Sutherland and have moved their families to Sutherland for the school year and have their children in school. These men claim they should be exempt from the payment of tuition notwithstanding that all their property is assessed in McPherson County and their residence is maintained in McPherson County. "We have other ranchers who have rented property in Sutherland and moved their families here for the school year and claim that they should be exempt from the pay - ment of tuition for the reason that their families are living here nine months out of the year notwithstanding that their property is assessed in McPherson County, and as far as we know thev would continue to vote in McPherson County." </seg>
            <seg id="p284">282 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Complying with your request for an opinion from this office, allow me to say that I think the children of the Mexican beet laborers to whom you refer are entitled to free tuition in your district so long as they and their parents are staying therein. It is their home so far as they have a home. A different situation exists in the case of the ranchers whose permanent home is elsewhere and who only keep their families in the district during the time school is in session. In most such cases I think it will be found they are keep - ing their children temporarily in your district for the primary purpose of enabling them to attend school there. Where such is the case I am of the opinion that they are not entitled to free tuition as a matte of strict law. In this connection, however, I call your attention to the fact that it is the State Superintendent and not the Attorney General who is authorized by statute to decide disputed points of school law. Speaking of the duties of the State Superintendent, the law provides that "He shall decide disputed points in school law and all such de - cisions shall be held to have the full force of law until reversed by the courts." Section 6477, Comp. Stat. Neb. 1922. GWA SCHOOLS— DEPOSIT OF FUNDS There is no provision of statute that requires a school district treasurer to deposit school moneys in a bank or banks designated by the school board. May 25, 1928. Hon. Charles W. Taylor, State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p285">OPINIONS 283 Dear Sir: Referring to Section 6609, Compiled Statutes of Ne - braska for 1922, you inquire: "Does the school board, under the authority of this sec - tion, have the power to compel the depositing of school funds in such banks as pay 2% interest and are designated as depositories?" Allow me to say in answer to your letter that the City Treasurer is also ex officio treasurer of the school district in which the city is located. The law provides that the board of education of a city school district may direct the legal custodian of its sinking funds to invest such funds in the warrants of such district. (See Section 6204, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922.) I find no provision of statute, however, which clothes the board with power to direct the school district treasurer to deposit the district money in any bank or banks. So far as the sinking fund to pay off school district bonds is concerned, the law provides that taxes for that pur - pose when collected "shall be and remain in the hands of the county treasurer a specific fund for the payment of the interest upon such bonds, and for the final payment of the same at maturity." Sec. 375, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. School moneys other than sinking funds to pay bonds can be deposited, of course, in banks to be approved by the school board, and, I think, are usually so deposited, but I do not recall any statute which makes such action compul - sory or that relieves the school district treasurer from liabil - ity on his bond in case a bank fails in which he has school money deposited.

            <seg id="p286">284 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL January 27, 1928. Mr. Charles W. Taylor, State Superintendent, Lincoln, Xcbraska. Dear Sir : In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 26th instant with copy of letter to yourself from the Secretary of the Board of Education of Omaha attached, allow me to say that Section 6653, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which is a part of the law governing schools in metropolitan cities provides that "The board of education shall annually cause to be taken an enumeration of all persons between the ages of five and twenty-one years residing in the district." All persons between the ages of five and twenty years who are residing in the district should be enumerated and no one who is not residing in the district should be enumer - ated. Pupils in the Deaf Institute whose residence is else - where and who are there merely for the purpose of receiv - ing instruction should not be enumerated and the same is true of pupils attending the respective colleges and board - ing schools, but the fact that a pupil is attending a college or boarding or parochial school should not bar him from enumeration providing his residence is within the Omaha school district. It is usually considered that a child under the age of twenty-one years has the same residence that its parents have provided they are maintaining a home, but this is not the universal rule. Where the parents have emancipated the child its home may be elsewhere and this is true even though they may still furnish some aid to the child.

Tayltjr, State Superintendent, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir : Allow me to say in answer to your letter of inquiry of the 12th instant that 1. I do not believe that a pupil over twenty-one years of age is entitled to free high school tuition to be paid by the county under the provisions of the free high school tuition law. 2. It is possible that local school boards with the ap - proval of your office may permit pupils over twenty-one years of age to attend their high schools without the pay - ment of tuition, if they see fit to do so under the provisions of Chapter 82, Session Laws of 1927. Sections 2 and 3 of said Chapter 82 read as follows "Powers of Local School Boards — Courses of Study. — Under this act local school boards and school authorities are empowered to expend moneys for conducting schools and classes in school buildings, in indus - trial establishments, places of employment and other places as may be expedient, for the purpose of giving instruction to foreign born and native adults and minors over the age of sixteen (16) years. Such courses of instruction or study shall include English, history, civics and other subjects tending to promote good citizenship and to increase voca - tional efficiency. "Duties of State Superintendent. — The state superintendent of public instruction shall designate courses of study, approve the selection of teachers, and supervise the instruction in said courses."

February 29, 1928. Mr. W. C. Jacknxtn, Superintendent, Wake field Public Schools, Wake field, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 27th, allow me to say that I regard the primary purpose of the free high school educational law is to provide that children hav - ing the necessary qualifications shall be furnished free tuition in the high schools of the state. As a necessary pre - requisite to the furnishing of such tuition the provisions of Section 6385, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, should be complied with. I have not regarded it, however, as absolutely essential to the furnishing of such free tuition that a parent or guar - dian of a pupil desiring free tuition should make applica - tion in writing to the County Superintendent before the first day of July of the year for which aid is asked. I have regarded that part of the law as in a sense directory and have thought that if the application was made even at a later date, the aid could be furnished, provided, of course, the pupil who asks it has a certificate or statement signed by the County Superintendent showing that he has quali - fications set forth in Section 6385, Compiled Statutes of </seg>

What is said herein is to be regarded merely as an expression of the personal views of the writer upon the subject and not as an official opinion of the department. I may add that the State Superintendent is clothed by statute with power to decide disputed questions of school law which will be in force and effect until the courts give a different construction to the law. GWA SCHOOLS— LAPSED PROFESSIONAL LIFE CERTIFICATE A lapsed professional life certificate issued by a state normal school can be renewed by being indorsed by the State Superintendent. July 30, 1927. Mr. Robert I. Elliott, President, Nebraska State Normal College, Vhadron, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Elliott : In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 20th instant in re renewal of lapsed Professional Life Certificates issued to teachers by the several State Normal Schools by virtue of authority given by Section 6702, Compiled Statutes, allow me to say this section as amended at the last session of the Legislature contains a provision that "No life diploma shall be in force after its holder shall permit a space of three years to lapse without following some educational pur - suit unless said diploma be indorsed by the state superintendent." </seg>
            <seg id="p290">288 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL I am therefore of the opinion that after such a certificate lapses it can only be renewed by being endorsed by the State Superintendent and that it can be renewed in effect in that way. GWA SCHOOLS— NEBRASKA HOME FOR DEPENDENT CHILDREN NOT RESIDENTS OF DISTRICT Children kept in the Nebraska Home for Dependent Children are not residents of the Lincoln school district in such a sense as to entitle them to free school privileges in the district except in cases where their parents are residents of the district. August 27, 1927. Mrs. F. •/. Birss, Chairman. Board of Control. Lincoln. Xcbraska. Dear Madam : I have investigated the question of the legal right of children kept in the Nebraska Home for Dependent Children to attend the public schools of the Lincoln school district and have come rather reluctantly to the con - clusion that the weight of authority is against such right except in cases where their parents happen to be residents of the district. Thus it is said by a standard text book that "Children gathered into a poorhouse or other institution from various places are, in contemplation of law, residents of the places from which they came and are generally not entitled to free admission to the schools of the district in which the institution is located. * * * "Similarly children committed by a court on probation to citizens of a district do not become residents of the district so as to be entitled to free schooling, but remain residents of the district wherein their </seg>

C. L., pp. 626, 626. The Supreme Court of Michigan has said "Under Comp. Laws 1897, §4683, providing that all residents of any school district, five years of age, shall have an equal right to attend any school therein, neglected boys over that age committed to a private corporation chartered for their support, care, and education, whose property was exempt from taxation as a charitable institution, were not entitled to free admission to the schools of the district in which it was located the same as resident children." Lake Farm v. District Board of School Dist. No. 2, Kala- And it was held although by a divided court in a Pennsylvania case that "The residence for school purposes of children committed on pro - bation by a juvenile court to citizens for care is in the district of the residence of their respective parents or guardians, and not in that of those to whose care they are committed, and therefore they are not entitled to free instruction in the schools of the latter district, where the statute fixes the residence of a child in the district in which his parent or guardian of his person resides, although the juvenile court act provides that a dependent child awarded by it shall become the ward of the one to whose care it is committed."

GWA SCHOOLS— REGISTRATION FEE FOR CERTIFICATE A registration fee of one dollar is due for the registration of a cer - tificate or diploma issued by a state normal school. September 13, 1928. Mr. G. V. Casler, Superintendent of Schools, Indinnola, Nebraska. mazoo Tp., 146 N. W. (Mich), 115. </seg>
            <seg id="p292">290 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Dear Sir: Allow me to say in answer to your letter of inquiry of tlie 11th instant that there is an apparent conflict in the laws governing the payment of fees for the registra - tion of teachers' certificates. An act passed in 1925 provides generally that no registration fee shall be charged, while Section 6708, Compiled Statutes, 1922, as last amended by Chapter 86, Session Laws of 1927, provides that a registration fee of One Dollar shall be paid for a certificate or diploma issued by a state normal school. Upon the question as to which provision controls so far as the certificates and diplomas, having the force and effect of certificates that have been issued by the state normal schools, allow me to say that in my opinion the later and more specific provision providing for the payment of a registration fee for the certificate or diploma prevails over the earlier and more general provision that apparently provides that no registration shall be charged for the registration of any teacher's certificate. It is a rule of statutory construction that "Where there is one statute dealing with a subject in general and comprehensive terms and another dealing with a part of the same sub - ject in a more minute and definite way the two should be read together and harmonized, if possible, with a view to giving effect to a consistent legislative policy; but to the extent of any necessary repugnancy be - tween them, the special will prevail over the general statute. Where the special statute is later, it will be regarded as an exception to, or qualification of, the prior general one." 36 Cyc. 1151. I will add that the law in defining the duties of the state superintendent provides that "Decide questions of school law. He shall decide disputed points in school law and all such decisions shall be held to have the force of law until reversed by the courts." Section 6477, Compiled Statutes, 1922. GWA </seg>

The law provides taxes collected for a sinking fund with which to pay school district bonds "shall be and remain in the hands of the county treasurer a specific fund for the payment of the interest upon such bonds, and for the final payment of the same at maturity."

            <seg id="p294">292 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Dear Sir: You say "At the last board meeting a motion was passed authorizing the Normal Colleges to buy indemnity insur - ance for faculty members and employees while on duty. I have a letter today from a party wondering whether the Board is within its rights to do this and pay for it out of school funds." Allow me to say that the correct answer to the ques - tion you suggest may not be entirely free from doubt. I am of the opinion, however, that a part of the funds appropriated for the support of the Normal schools may lawfully be used in purchasing indemnity insurance for its employees including faculty members who are acci - dentally injured while on duty. In the case of Nebraska National Guard v. Morgan, 199 N. W. 557, the Supreme Court of this state held: "The Nebraska National Guard is a 'governmental agency of the state' within the Employers' Liability Law, and an 'employee' thereof is entitled to compensation for injuries received in consequence of an accident arising out of and in the course of such employment" I am of the opinion that by a parity of reason it will be held that the Board of Education of State Normal Schools is a governmental agency of the State within the Employment Liability Law.

Said Section 6854, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provided among other things that "No life certificate shall be in force after the holder shall permit three years to elapse without following some educational pursuit unless the certificate be indorsed by the state superintendent." Section 6854, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, was repealed by Chapter 251, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1919, but this repeal did not affect what is now Sec - tion 6442, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. The provision for the lapsing of certificates by non - user that was incorporated into what is now Section 6442, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, by reference to a like provision in an earlier statute was not repealed by a subsequent repeal of the earlier statute. I am therefore of the opinion that a certificate men - tioned in Section 6442, Compiled Statutes, lapses if the holder is not engaged in any educational pursuit for a period of three years unless such certificate is indorsed by the state superintendent.

GWA SCHOOLS— TEACHING GERMAN LANGUAGE There is now no law in force in Nebraska that punishes the teaching of the common branches in the German language in Nebraska. August 26, 1927. Deputy State Superintendent, Lincoln. Nebraska. Dear Sir : You inquire whether the common school branches may lawfully be taught in the German language in Ne - braska. \ Allow me to say in answer to your question that the state Constitution provides that "The English language is hereby declared to be the official lan - guage of this state, and all official proceedings, records and publications shall be in such language, and the common school branches shall be taught in said language in public, private, denominational and parochial schools." Section 27, Article I, Constitution of Nebraska. To carry out and enforce the above quoted constitu - tional provision the Legislature in 1921 passed an act which is now known as Sections 6457 to 6462, both in - clusive, of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. This act went farther than the Constitution and provided that "No person, individually or as a teacher, shall, in any private, Mr. R. H. Graham. </seg>
            <seg id="p297">295 OPINIONS denominational, or parochial or public school, teach any subject to any person in any language other than the English language." Section 6458, Comp. Stat. Neb. 1922. It will be observed that this goes farther than the Constitution in. that it prohibits the teaching of any lan - guage other than English in the common, parochial and private school, even though it be taught only as a lan - guage while the Constitution does not in express terms prohibit the teaching of another language in such schools but merely provides the common branches shall be taught therein in English. The aforesaid legislative act passed in 1921 by the Legislature was held to be void by the Supreme Court of this state in the case of liiisboom v. State. 110 Neb. 629. in which case the court said : "Chapter 61, Laws 1921, appearing as sections 6457 to 6462, in - clusive, Comp. St. 1922, is void, because it violates the Fourteenth Amendment to the federal Constitution." This decision of the Supreme Court of Nebraska is avowedly based upon the decision of the United States Supreme Court in the case of Meyer v. State of Nebraska, 262 U. S. 390, in which the court said: "A state law forbidding, under penalty, the teaching in any private, denominational, parochial or public school, of any modern language, other than English, to any child who has not attained and successfully passed the eighth grade, invades the liberty guaranteed by the Four - teenth Amendment and exceeds the power of the state." In that case Meyer had been prosecuted and con - victed for teaching German to a child ten years of age in a parochial school. The question, therefore, whether the provision of the Nebraska State Constitution regarding the teaching of the common branches in English in all schools including parochial schools in the state is in violation of the United States Constitution was not directly involved in that case, but regardless of that fact there is now no law in force in the state by which violations of the aforesaid </seg>

January 16, 1928, Mr. J. S. Saults, Secretary, City Public Schools, Gordon, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You say your school district has money lying idle in the sinking fund established to pay off its bonds when due, but that it has no option to pay off these bonds before 1937, and hence can not use the money on hand at this time for the purpose for which the fund was created. You inquire whether $5000.00 of this sinking fund can be transferred to a fund for the construction of a new shop building to be used in connection with the vocational agricultural department of your schools. Allow me to say that I do not believe you can make such a transfer direct, but if you arrange to construct the building and pay the costs of such construction by means of special warrants issued in conformity with the provisions of Section 6605, Compiled Statutes, 1922, you can take up such warrants with the sinking fund provided to pay oft the bonds. </seg>

November 8. 1927. Mrs. Mabel Gillespie, Gretna, Nebraska. My Dear Mrs. Gillespie : We have your favor directing our attention to Section 6508-b, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amended by Session Laws of Nebraska for 1927, House Roll 219, Chapter 84, page 251, wherein the original section was amended as follows : "Provided, that when no other means of transportation is pro - vided and when the child or youth lives more than three miles from the public school house which he or she is authorized to attend by the nearest practicable travelled road, where no free transportation is furnished such child or youth, a transportation rate of five cents per family for each day of actual attendance for each one-fourth of a mile or fraction thereof covering the distance of the residence from the public school house in excess of the three mile limit shall be paid such family monthly by such district on the basis of the record of attendance of such child or youth to be reported monthly by the teacher to the </seg>

And you inquire if this statute as amended contem - plates that a family shall receive 5 cents for each quarter of a mile beyond the three mile limit for each of the children so conveyed to school or if the compensation shall be five cents per family regardless of the number of children so con - veved? In reply you are informed that we have given this statute much consideration and it is our opinion that the compensa - tion provided for herein is the rate of five cents per family conveying a child or children as therein provided to the public school for each quarter of a mile distance beyond the three mile distance to the school. The use of the word ''family" in this statute limits the compensation to be paid for such service to the family so conveying a youth under the provisions of this statute. The compensation is based upon the distance a family is re - quired to transport their child or children in excess of the distance beyond three miles. You will note the language "child or youth" is a use of the singular and plural. The word ''youth' 7 may be used either singular or collectively plural and in our opinion means child or children of each family so compensated regardless of number.

Dear Sir : In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 22nd instant allow me to say that in my opinion a consolidated school district is not required to furnish free transportation to non - resident pupils attending its school under the provisions of the free high school law. I do not understand that the provision found in the sixth sub-division of Section 6385, Compiled Statutes, that "Every non-resident pupil attending any public school under the provisions of this article shall have the same rights and shall be sub - ject to the same rules and restrictions which govern resident pupils attending such public school." is applicable to the question at issue. If it is, and is given n literal construction it will compel the consolidated school districts to furnish free transportation to non-resident rural pupils from their homes or at least from points nearby their homes.

GWA SCHOOLS— TUITION FOR NON-RESIDENT HIGH SCHOOL PUPILS A high school district furnishing instruction to non-resident pupils under the free high school law is entitled to receive from the free high school fund tuition at the rate of three dollars per week for the weeks such pupils attend its high school. August 3, 1927. Honorable Charles W. Taylor, State Superintendent, State House, Lincoln, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p302">REPORT OF" ATTORNEY GENERAL 300 Dear Sir: Under date of July 20, 1927, you wrote this office asking for an opinion as to whether or not a high school district which maintains school for more than thirty-six weeks in a year is entitled to receive from the free high school fund tuition at the rate of three dollars per week for each week that non-resident pupils who are entitled to free high school tuition have been attending its high school, even though such attendance is in excess of thirty-six weeks in one year. Allow me to say in answer to your question that in my opinion such a school district is entitled to receive from the free high school fund payment for each week such non - resident pupil attends its high school even though the num - ber of weeks is in excess of thirty-six weeks in one year. I do not find that the statute fixed thirty-six weeks as the maximum number for which tuition may be paid.

Dear Mr. Taylor You say: "We have a communication, or an inquiry from the County Superintendent of Richardson County, concerning a school site, or rather a plot of ground that has been used as a school site for something like twenty years, but the school district or the authorities of the district have never secured a title or made a purchase of the plot of ground to be owned by the district." </seg>
            <seg id="p304">302 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL and you inquire whether the owner of the land on which the school house was built is entitled to retain the school house built thereon with public money. Allow me to say in answer to your question that I do not believe the owner of the land is entitled to retain the school house. Section 0328, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides that a school district "Shall not in any case build a frame school house on any site for which they have not a title in fee without the privilege to remove the same when lawfully directed to do so by the qualified voters of the district at any annual or special meeting." The above quoted provision of statute is cited in the case of Burns v. School District, 61 Neb. 351, and it was there held that the school house did not pass by foreclosure and sale of the land on which it was situated. I may add, it is possible the school district has acquired title to this land by adverse possession, but that could only be in case it was occupying land under claim of ownership.

Dear Sir: You inquire whether or not the income from the trust fund for state aid relief for soldiers, etc., may be used for clerical help and expenses for administering the state aid relief fund since the passage of Senate File No. 132 and the appropriation bill, House Roll No. 295. Senate File No. 132 amends and repeals Section 6206, Compiled Statutes, 1922, as subsequently amended, and pro - vides that the Board of Educational Lands and Funds may approve the application for employment of necessary clerical employees and the employment and expenses of a competent person or persons to prepare and present meritorious cases of ex-service men for relief before the United States Vet - erans Bureau or the United States Bureau of Pensions, at such reasonable compensation as may in each case be fixed by said board, and provided that no part of same so ex - pended shall be paid out of the Two Million Dollar trust fund or the income therefrom, and further providing that the sum or sums so expended for such purpose shall be paid from any special appropriation by the Legislature for the purpose.

If it were not for the clause "and for expense of administer - ing State Aid Relief Fund" there would be little difficulty in answering your inquiry. By use of this clause, however, it appears to have been the intent of the Legislature to make this appropriation cover expenses of administering state aid relief fund. In all probability it is intended that only the surplus after the administration of state aid relief fund shall be used for the purpose of presenting cases to the United States Veterans Bureau. Senate File No. 132 merely provides for the disbursement of the funds by the organiza - tion, approved by the Board of Educational Lands and Funds. The fund itself appears to be under the supervision of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds. The appro - priation for administration is made to that board. We have very reluctantly come to the conclusion that the |17,000 must cover all expenses of administration of the state aid relief fund, for we know that there will be little or nothing left for the presentation of cases to the United States Veterans Bureau and Pension Bureau. We have thought there might be some possibility of ruling the other way after considering Section 35 of the appropriation act, H. R. 295. This section reads as follows: "The income from the bonds for Soldiers' Relief during the bien - nium ending June 30, 1929, together with any unexpended balance on June 30, 1927, is appropriated for expenditures under the provision of Chapter 40, Laws of Nebraska, 1921." Unfortunately for the construction of the law favor - able to the payment of the expenses of administering the fund out of the income, Chapter 40, Session Laws, 1921, has been repealed and was amended by other acts, and finally amended by Senate File No. 132. Therefore, Senate File No. 132 seems to be controlling, and we are forced to the conclusion as I have stated. We believe that many claims which might have been referred to the United States Veterans and the Pension Bureaus will not have to be of necessity taken care of by the state aid relief fund, and </seg>

Dear Sir Action taken by a municipality by ordinance or by special election upon any subject including Sunday base - ball in our opinion would continue to be in effect until such time as it is changed either by an ordinance or by different action taken by special election. In support of this con - clusion we call your attention to Article 5 of Chapter 46, beginning with Section 4425, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1!&gt;22, pertaining to the enactment of ordinances, etc. Section 4443, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides as follows: "The mayor and city council shall have no power to enact a law which shall in any manner alter, modify, impair or render nugatory ordinances which have been enacted by a direct vote of the voters of such city under the provisions of this article, except by a yea and nay vote of two- thirds of the city council; Provided, however, no such vote shall be taken within one year from the time of its enactment."

December 27, 1927. Mr. C. G. Perry, County Attorney, Bridgeport, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Permit me to say in answer to your letter of inquiry of the 20th instant that I am of the opinion that Chapter 13, Session Laws, 1927, authorizes the county board of a county having less than .~)0,000 population to levy so much as one-half mill to assist the county agricultural society of such county provided such society, the premiums paid by it and the permanent improvements owned by it, warrant such aid, and provided, further, the amount of the levy does not exceed |&gt;4,000, and the total amount levied by the county board including the levy to aid the county agricultural so - ciety does not exceed five mills on the dollar of the assessed valuation of the county, unless the excess levy is author - ized by a vote of the electors of the county.

G. Fechner, County Treasurer, Stanton County, Stanton, Nebraska. Dear Sir : In answer to the question asked in your letter of re - cent date I will say that in the case of the ordinary tax sale certificate which has been issued to some individual who has paid the taxes thereon so that it does not matter to the public whether the tax lien is ever foreclosed, I think the county treasurer should cancel the sale in conformity with the provisions of Section 6097, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, and that it is not necessary thereafter to note that tax sale on the treasurer's books or to make any further reference to the taxes included in the tax sale. In fact, in any such a case the taxes are paid at the time the tax sale is issued and the only effect of undue delay in demanding a deed or foreclosing the lien is to bar the purchaser from his right to be reimbursed, but where the purchase is made by a county or some municipal subdivision of the state so that the sale is merely a paper sale and neither the state nor any political subdivision of the state has actually received its share of the taxes, I am of the opinion there should be some notation to show the taxes have not been paid and are still a lien against the land in addition to the statutory cancellation certification set forth in Section 6097, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. The Supreme Court has heretofore said : "The county's lien for taxes is not devested by the failure of the county to foreclose its tax lien within the time limited by statute, but the county may again purchase at tax sale for the years covered by its prior purchase."

January 23, 1928. Mr. Ed. H. Hoare, Monroe, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 19th instant, allow me to say that in my opinion the county treasurer is charged by law with the duty of collecting delinquent per - sonal taxes. Section 6010, Compiled Statutes, 1922, pro - vides: "The county treasurer is hereby required, during the month of December of each year after the personal taxes for the year have be - come delinquent, to notify by mail all persons of the amount of their delinquent personal taxes, and that unless the same is paid by February 1st next following, distress warrant will be issued therefor.

Distress warrants shall be issued against all persons having delinquent personal tax for each year, and each such warrant shall include all delinquent personal taxes of the person against whom issued, unless such person shall, on or before February 1st, file vith the treasurer an affidavit that he is unable, by reason of poverty, to pay anv such tax, in which case distress warrants shall not issue until ordered by the county board." And Section 6005, Compiled Statutes, 1922, provides: "Upon delivery to the county treasurer of the tax list, as herein provided, all personal taxes levied in the county shall be charged to him and he and his bondsmen shall be liable therefor, unless the same are collected or he shall show a compliance with the requirements herein made."

September 27, 1928. Mr. John L. Riddell, County Attorney, York County, York, Nebraska. Dear Sir : You say: "York County owns eighty acres of land and farm build - ings thereon for use as a poor farm. The County Board of Supervisors desire to enlarge the buildings on said county poor farm at a proposed cost of eight or nine thousand dollars. "They have on hand, or will have the first of March, from the sale of other lauds belonging to the County, a sum of approximately twenty-five thousand dollars."

The correct answer to the question you ask is not en - tirely free from doubt in the absence of a Supreme Court decision upon the point involved. I am of the opinion, however, that the provisions of statute regarding the levy of a tax and the appropriation of money for the purpose of acquiring a county poor farm and erecting buildings thereon found in Section 5156 to Section 51G2, both inclusive, of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, prevail over the more general provisions of Section 854, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, </seg>
            <seg id="p313">OPINIONS 311 so that in any event the county board may appropriate at least Two Thousand Five Hundred Dollars for that purpose without submitting the question to a vote of the electors. In the instant case the county already has a poor farm and buildings thereon and the appropriation, if made, will be, as I understand it, for the enlargement of buildings already in existence rather than the construction of new ones. This being true, and it being also true that the county board has a right under the provisions of Section 5158, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, to levy and collect a tax not exceeding one per cent ( two mills in view of the limitation imposed by Section 5910, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922) on the taxable property of the county and to appropriate the same to the purchase of land for a poor farm and the erection and furnishing of buildings thereon, I am inclined to the opinion that where the county already has the money available for such purpose without making a levy, it may appropriate in excess of Twenty - five Hundred Dollars without submitting the question of the appropriation to a vote of the electors, for the purpose of enlarging the buildings upon a poor farm owned by it. As already suggested, however, the question is not entirely free from doubt, and for that reason it may be prudent to either submit the question to a vote of the electors or to wait until the Legislature in unmistakable language has authorized the County Board to make such an appropria - tion without submitting the question to a vote of the elec - tors.

Greenleaf, County Assessor of Douglas County, Nebraska, in which he inquires whether he, as County Assessor, has power to make correction for 1928 where he finds that real estate has been erroneously assessed. Allow me to say the correct answer to Mr. Greenleaf's question may not be entirely free from doubt, but I am of the opinion the assessor has power to make such a change in the assessed valuation where it is clear the assessed valua - tion for the preceding year was erroneous. Section 5963, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, provides among other things that "The county assessor in addition to the other duties provided by law shall revise annually the real estate assessment for the correction of errors."

            <seg id="p315">OPINIONS 313 Dear Sir: Allow me to say the correct answer to the question you ask may not be entirely free from doubt in the absence of a supreme court decision upon the precise point involved. I am of the opinion, however, that the kind of property you mention may properly be assessed at their actual value on the first day of April of the year in which the assess - ment is made. In determining their actual value the asses - sor will, of course, take into account the fact that they are liable to injury by frost or some other untoward occurrence. The law provides that "Nursery stocks, growing or otherwise, in the hands of nursery - men, shall be listed and assessed as merchandise." Section 5936, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. It may be urged that cut flowers and potted plants are not nursery stock and in the strict sense of the term that may be true, but I see no reason why they may not be as - sessed separate and apart from the land just as much as a nursery stock can be. It has been held by an Ohio court that "Growing plants and floral stock cultivated for the purpose of sale, and which the owner treats as merchandise, to be sold to whomso - ever may apply, are personal property and subject to be returned and taxed as such."

In 1925 we wrote the county judge at Wilber, Nebraska, to the effect that we believed that each person would be entitled to an exemption of $500. The writer personally is still inclined to that view, although the matter seems to be somewhat in doubt in view of the decision of the Supreme Court in the matter of the Estate of Rudge, 114 Neb. 335. This case holds that unless the bequest is expressly excepted under the provisions of the inheritance tax law that it is subject to the tax. The Supreme Court, however, in that case did not expressly refer to the matter of exemption, but held that bequests to a cemetery and a church was liable to the tax. The question of the amount did not seem to be called into question. The law in question, Chapter 187, Session Laws, 1923, provides that property bequeathed shall become subject to the tax. Inasmuch as different rates are applicable to dif - ferent sums we presume that the rate might be the tax as provided for the bequest coming within its respective class, and that the $500 exemption applies only to estates where the whole amount or value of the estate is less than $500. This matter is not entirely free from doubt until the court expressly passes upon it.

Section 9042, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, pertaining to moneys and properties exempt from execution to disabled soldiers, sailors and marines is as follows : "In addition to the exemptions now provided for by the code of civil procedure, there shall also be exempt from levy and sale upon execution or attachment, to every resident of the State of Nebraska, who became disabled in the service of the United States as a soldier, sailor, or marine, all pension money hereafter received and all property hereafter purchased and improved exclusively therewith, not exceeding two thousand dollars in value, and belonging to such soldier, sailor or marine.

Dear Sir: Allow me to say in answer to the question asked in your letter of inquiry of the 5th instant that the provisions of Section 6097 of the 1922 Compiled Statutes relative to the cancellation of tax sale certificates are not broad enough to authorize the County Treasurer to cancel judgments en - tered under Section 6108 and following sections of the Com - piled Statutes. You will note that Section 6097 only authorizes the County Treasurer to cancel tax sale certificates in cases where the owner of the certificates has failed either to de - mand a deed or to commence an action to foreclose the tax lien within five years from the date of the sale. Where a judgment has been entered under Section 6108 et seq. it is entered of course in an action brought to fore - close the tax lien, so the conditions under which the can - cellation of a bond is authorized by Section 6097 do not exist in a case where the tax sale has been foreclosed.

This act provides an occupation" tax measured by 2 cents per gallon for the number of gallons used or sold by such dealer. It is, therefore, our opinion that no refund shall be made for any gasoline purchased prior to July 24, 1927, under the exemption provided for in Section 9, Chapter 172, page 451, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1925, unless the claim for such refund was made within thirty days after the pur - chase of such gasoline and in addition thereto a showing be made that such gasoline has been consumed or used for the purpose of operating and propelling tractors and combines, prior to the 24th day of July, 1927.

Whether this statute would be constitutional as applied to privately owned irrigation works may well be doubted, but I am of the opinion that it will probably be held to be constitutional as applied to the irrigation works of a public corporation. GWA TAXATION— LEVY Levy of taxes should be only for items in the estimate. April 4, 1927. Mr. Ben H. Burritt, County Attorney, Abwivortk, Nebraska Dear Sir: You state that a petition signed by at least fifty-five per cent of the legal voters of Brown County was presented to your county board requesting that the county board make </seg>
            <seg id="p323">OPINIONS 321 an annual Jevy not exceeding five mills for the purpose ol providing a fund for the erection of the court house or jail. Your county commissioners neglected to include this item in your annual estimate made in January, 1927. You now inquire whether or not your county commissioners have au - thority to proceed with the erection of the public buildings when an estimate of the expense was not made as required by the 6th paragraph of Section 854, Compiled Statutes, 1922. State v. Lincoln County, 18 Neb. 283, holds that coun - ties and county boards can only exercise such powers as are expressly granted by statute, and such grant of power must be strictly construed. This case further holds that the county commissioners have no authority to issue county bonds for the purpose of raising money to build a jail, and a vote of the people of the county instructing them to issue such bonds will confer no authority so to do. In Ee H. R. 284, 31 Neb. 505, it was held that the ques - tion of issuing bonds must be submitted to the people in the way provided by statute, and they cannot be issued upon a mere petition for the issuance thereof signed by a majority of the electors of the county. It therefore appears that the statutory authority for levying, assessing and collecting taxes must be rather strictly followed. Section 5 of Article VIII of the Constitution pro - vides that county authorities shall never assess taxes the aggregate of which exceed fifty cents per $100 actual valua - tion, except for the payment of indebtedness existing at the adoption of the new constitution, unless authorized by a vote of the people of the county. It is apparent that where a vote of the people of the county is required that a petition does not amount to a vote of the people of the county, as such petition may not have been presented to every voter in the county and every voter does not have opportunity to vote for or against the proposition. We, therefore, conclude that if the five mill levy in question would in the aggregate make the county levy ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p324">322 REPORT OP ATTORNEY GENERAL ceed the constitutional limit, that then and in that event an election would be required and the board would be justi - fied in refusing to include the five mill levy in its January estimate. If, on the other hand, the question of exceeding the constitutional limit is not involved, we believe that the expenditure of the five mill levy for the purpose indicated could be authorized in the manner indicated by the statute. When so authorized it would of course be the duty of the county board to include such item in its January estimate. This the board failed to do, and the sole question now is whether or not the levy can be made and the taxes collected to erect the building. We call attention to paragraph six of Section 854, Com - piled Statutes, 1922, which specifically provides among other things that no levy of taxes shall be made for any other purpose or amounts than are specified in such estimate as published. Inasmuch as we find no authority for excluding the levy in question from the estimate, we conclude that collection of the tax should be deferred until publication of the estimate including such levy may be made in accordance with law. You will note that a severe penalty is provided in the event that the members of the county board shall make an excessive levy of matters not included in the esti - mate. LD TAXATION— LEVY FOR COUNTIES, CITIES AND VILLAGES The general levy for village or city purposes (in a city of the second class) cannot exceed five mills on the dollar of the actual valua - tion. The general levy for county purposes cannot exceed three and one - half mills on the dollar of the actual valuation unless an excess levy is approved by the electors. </seg>
            <seg id="p325">OPINIONS 323 August 19, 1927. Mr. Lloyd H. Jordan, County Attorney, Sheridan County, Rushville, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Jordan : In answer to your letter of inquiry of the 17th instant allow me to say that the general levy for village or city purposes (in a city of the second class) cannot exceed five mills on the dollar of the actual valuation. It is twenty per cent of twenty-five mills. ( See Sections 4280 and 5910 of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922.) The general levy for county purposes can not exceed three and one-half mills, except possibly a greater levy may be sanctioned by a vote of the electors. The levy to estab - lish a sinking fund to pay off bonded indebtedness or the interest on same is not included, in niy opinion, in the gen - eral levy of a city or village or of the county. The tax to maintain a street lighting system should not exceed a levy of one mill annually on the actual valuation. The levy for the library fund shall not exceed one mill per annum upon the actual valuation. The levy for the amusement fund should not exceed six-tenths of a mill on the actual valua - tion unless a larger levy is authorized by a vote of the elec - tors, in which case the levy for such purpose may be one mill on the actual valuation. (See Chapter 40, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1927.) The levy for park purposes may be as high as six - tenths of a mill per annum. I do not recall any specific provision for the levy of taxes for streets and alleys in cities of the second class and villages except the provision in Sec - tion 4282, Compiled Statutes, that the expenses of same shall be paid out of the general fund and shall not exceed eight and one-half mills, (one and seven-tenths mills of the actual valuation). </seg>
            <seg id="p326">324 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL A city of the second class or village may levy a tax of not to exceed four-tenths of a mill upon the actual valua - tion for the support of a voluntary fire department, (Sec - tion 4391, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922), and a tax of five mills (one mill on the actual valuation) for cemetery purposes. I See Section 4493, Compiled Statutes.) I do not recall any specific provision for the levy of a water tax except to pay the interest on and to redeem water bonds. The correct answer to the question as to what city or village levies must be considered a part of the general levy for city or village purposes may not be entirely free from doubt. I do not believe, however, that the sinking fund levy or the levy to pay interest on bonded indebted - ness should be considered as a part of the general city levy. The general county levy should not exceed three and one-half mills on the dollar except perhaps in cases where a greater levy may be authorized by a vote of the electors. I think all the county funds enumerated in your letter with the possible exception of the Agricultural Society Fund should be regarded as a part of the general fund of the county. GWA TAXATION— LIEN OF CHATTEL MORTGAGE A chattel mortgage given before the first day of November of any year creates a lien on the property mortgaged that is superior to the lien of the personal taxes for that year. October 6, 1928. Mr. Carl Anderson, Imperial, Nebraska. Dear Sir: Speaking of the collection of delinquent personal taxes by means of a distress warrant, you inquire: </seg>
            <seg id="p327">OPINIONS 325 "If I levy on chattels and they are in mortgage, does the mortgage have to be paid first, if the mortgage has been given after the tax assessment. The way I have it I can take anything and sell it for taxes, mortgage or no mortgage. Am I right?" Allow me to say in answer to the question you ask that in my opinion the lien of a chattel mortgage given before the first day of November of any year takes precedence over and is superior to the lien of the personal taxes for that year. If the mortgage has been given after the tax came due, then the property can be seized and sold to satisfy the tax lien without reference to the mortgage, but if the mortgage was given before the taxes became a lien, then I am of the opinion that whoever buys the property when it is sold to satisfy the lien of the taxes, will take it subject to the lien of the mortgage. GWA TAXATION— RAISING VALUATION OF TOWNSHIP A County Board of Equalization may raise or lower the valuation of the property in an entire township, where it is equitable to do so, without giving: notice of such proposed change to the individual property owners. July 16, 1927. Honorable T. E. Williams, State Tax Commissioner, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In re question raised by Mr. Shultz of Scribner as to the power of a county Board of Equalization to raise the valuation of an entire township without giving notice, allow me to say the Supreme Court of this state has held that "Where the value of property, as returned by the assessor, as to an entire precinct is relative too low, it may be raised by the board of </seg>
            <seg id="p328">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 326 equalization without notice previously given to property owners." Lancaster County v. Whedon, 76 Neb. 763. I am therefore of the opinion that a County Board of Equalization is not required to give notice of its proposed action to the individual taxpayers of a township or pre - cinct before it raises or lowers the assessed valuation of all the property in the township in conformity with the provisions of subdivision numbered "Third" of Section 5972, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. GWA TAXATION— REFUND OF OCCUPATION TAX To entitle one to a refund of occupation tax paid, demand must be made for such refund in the way and manner set forth in the second subdivision of Section 6018, Compiled Statutes. July 2, 1928. Mr. C. F. Galloway, County Attorney, Sounders County, Wahoo, Nebraska. Dear Sir: In your letter of June 28th you say, among other things, that "It is my opinion that inasmuch as the County has paid over part of said fees to the state that the farmers must not look to the county but to the State re such refund, and it is my further opinion that it is very doubtful if they have any just claim even. "I would also appreciate hearing from you at your con - venience as to whether or not the County Treasurer should issue farm truck registrations for |8.00 now. It is my opinion that for the present the law is as laid down by the recent Supreme Court decision, therefore the Treasurer can properly do so." </seg>
            <seg id="p329">OPINIONS 327 Assuming that the recent decision of the Supreme Court regarding the registration fee to be paid by the owner of a farm truck stands as the law, I am of the opinion it will be difficult for the owner of such a truck to recover such excess from the county. In the case of Shue v. Village of Silver Creek, 98 Neb. 551, it was held that in order for one to recover money paid pro tanto as an occupation tax a demand for such refund must be made in the manner set forth in what is now the second subdivision of Section 6018, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. This means that a demand in writing for such refund must be made within thirty days after pay - ment is made. I presume there are few, if any, cases where this has been done. In any event, the county would be liable for no more than its proportionate share of the excess payment. I am of the opinion that as the law now stands the Treasurer will be justified in accepting |8.00 as the regis - tration fee for all farm trucks that weigh less than four thousand pounds exclusive of load, but in view of the fact that a motion for a rehearing will probably be filed in this case, I suggest that the receipt show that the |8.00 registra - tion fee is accepted upon the condition that if the court modifies its decision heretofore rendered, the right to claim the additional sum due is not waived. Any words in the receipt for the fee that suggest the idea herein expressed will be sufficient. GWA TAXATION— SALE OF REAL ESTATE All delinquent special assessments, as well as all delinquent real estate taxes should be included in a tax sale of real estate. June 10, 1927. Mr. K. A. Cornish, County Treasurer, Polk County, Osceola, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p330">328 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Dear Sir : You say that in October, 1926, the city officials of Osceola levied a special assessment against the abutting real estate for graveling certain streets in that city; that it was then too late to have said assessments placed on the tax rolls for the year 1926; and that the city attorney now insists that said special assessments be placed on and made a part of the regular real estate tax rolls for the year 1927. You further say : "All previous special assessments levied by the various cities of this county have been made up in a separate book from the regular tax rolls, and has been advertised and sold at each sale date following the delinquent date of the various assessments." You inquire whether it is possible to sell real estate at tax sale for only the regular real estate taxes levied against it and without including in the sale special assessments against said property that are unpaid and delinquent at the time of the sale. Allow me to say in answer to your question that all delinquent special assessments, as well as all delinquent general real estate taxes should be included in my opinion in a tax sale of real estate in this state. The statute provides : "That wherever power is now given by the revenue laws of this state to the county treasurer of any county in this state to sell real estate, on which the taxes shall not have been paid as provided by law, it shall include the power to sell said real estate for all the taxes and special assessments now levied or hereafter levied by any county, mu - nicipality, drainage district, or other political subdivision of the state, and all provisions of said revenue law, now in force with reference to the collection of taxes shall apply with equal force to all taxes and special assessments levied by said county, municipality, drainage dis - trict or other political subdivision of the state." Section 6101, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. </seg>
            <seg id="p331">OPINIONS 329 And the Supreme Court has held : "A tax sale is invalid where it was not made for all delinquent taxes against the land with interest and costs." Medland v. Connell et al, 57 Neb. 10. The special assessment for graveling all comes due at one time and is not payable in installments like an assess - ment for paving. I do not regard it, therefore, as a vital matter whether it is entered in a separate book or on the regular tax list, although I think it would be more con - venient to have it entered in a separate book. Here in Lin - coln they have no special assessments for graveling, but they do have special assessments for paving and sewers and for sidewalks. The assessments for paving and sewers are payable in installments. The special assessment for side - walks all comes due at once. I understand assessments for sidewalks are placed on the regular real estate tax rolls and that assessments for paving and sewers are entered in a separate book. Permit me to add that in my opinion a taxpayer may pay a special assessment without paying the general taxes levied against real estate. Section 5598, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, as amended by House Roll Xo. 590, will expressly so provide on and after July 24, 1927. Said Section 5598, as amended, reads in part as follows : "The treasurer shall receive from any taxpayer at any time, the amount due on account of special assessments of any kind including those levied for the use of any irrigation district whether other taxes on the same real estate are paid or not. In such case the tax receipt shall plainly show exactly what assessments have been paid and shall show that no other tax on said real estate have been received by said treasurer." GWA </seg>

March 9, 1927. Mr. L. A. Robertson, Harvard, Nebraska. Dear Sir : You inquire what amount your city council may levy to buy fire equipment. We call your attention to Section 4210, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, which pro - vides that such purchase may be made and appropriation made therefor. In this connection we call your attention to 51 Neb. 870, 93 Neb. 704, 72 Neb. 518, in connection with Section 4287, which last mentioned section provides that occupation taxes may be levied; also Section 4375, which provides for disposition of all money received on special assessments. Section 4391 provides the city council in cities and board of trustees in villages having only volunteer fire depart - ments or companies may levy a tax annually of not more than four-tenths of a mill on the actual valuation of the property within said city, etc. Inasmuch as Section 4391 was enacted in 1921 at the same time that Section 5910 went into effect, it would seem that the Legislature contemplated a levy to the extent of the authority indicated by Section 4391, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922.

            <seg id="p333">OPINIONS 331 The law does not provide for the sale of land at a scavenger tax sale for an amount greater than the amount of the decree plus interest, penalty and costs. October 1, 1928. Mr. Isaac Rough, County Treasurer, Kimball County, Kimball, Nebraska. Dear Sir: You say that your county is about to hold a scavenger tax sale and you ask "Can the owner of the property bid on his own property at this sale? "Can the property be sold at this sale for more than the taxes plus the interest and cost of sale?" I will answer the above questions in the order in which they are asked. 1. No, the owner of real estate is not a proper party to bid on his own property at a tax sale in my opinion. 2. I find no provision in the statute for the sale of any land at a scavenger tax sale for an amount greater than the amount of decree plus interest and costs. The law ex - pressly provides that "At every sale by the county treasurer under this article, the highest bidder shall be deemed to be the person who offers to pay in cash the amount of the decree, interest, penalty and costs due on any parcel of land or lot at the date of the sale, * • •" Section 6122, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922. The law expressly provides that the purchaser may pay the tax for an interest in an undivided portion of it, but I find no provision for paying more than the decree finds due upon any tract plus interest thereon and costs.

            <seg id="p336">332 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL TELEPHONE COMPANIES— CHARGES FOR USE IN HOTELS No charge for use of telephones in guest rooms in hotels being specified in tariffs, a charge therefor should not be made. October 6, 1927. Mr. C. A. Randall, Chairman, Nebraska State Railway Commsision, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Mr. Randall : As you know, I have been in communication with the Northwestern Bell Telephone Company in regard to the additional charge made by hotels on long distance calls from guests' rooms. This practice is not authorized by anything in the tariffs and is clearly unlawful. I suggest that the Commission notify the telephone company to direct the hotels to cease making such charge and if the practice is not immediately discontinued that an order should be issued against the telephone company to show cause why private branch ex - changes should not be immediately removed from the offend - ing hotels. HL TELEPHONE COMPANIES— COMMON CARRIERS A telephone company, although small and not conducted for the pur - pose of earning dividends, is a common carrier if it serves non - stockholders for hire and conducts long-distance service for hire. </seg>
            <seg id="p337">OPINIONS 333 July 14, 1928. Mr. I. J. Devoe, Chief Accountant, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebraska. Dear Sir : Your favor of July 9th duly received. In it you state: "I have conferred with Chairman Randall on the mat - ter I am submitting to you herewith, the application of the Walnut Grove Telephone Company for authority to increase rates. "It was my thought, after reading this application, that it was very similar to the Cotesfield case in which the su - preme court decided that the Commission had no jurisdic - tion. The Commission would be pleased to have an opinion in regard to this matter in order that we may have some - thing tangible upon which to base future jurisdiction over small telephone companies." In 1922 there was an application before the Nebraska State Railway Commission in which permission to reduce rates was asked. The prayer of the application was granted and the rates were reduced. In the opinion in th.it proceed - ing the Commission briefly described the character of the company and its operations as follows : "Applicant company is a tiny company, supplying service to one hundred thirty-five subscribers, one hundred thirteen of whom are stockholders and twenty-two non-stockholders. The company advises that it is desired to operate as economically as possible, and with no thought of return upon the investment. Among its fixed expenditures are $75.00 per month for switchboard operator and switching fees in two different towns. The secretary also receives $2.00 per month for "his wages. Any monthly balance is used in paying taxes, insurance, miscellaneous charges and maintaining the company's properties." No material change appears to have taken place since that time. There are now 140 subscribers, one hundred twenty-five of whom are stockholders. There are thus fif- </seg>
            <seg id="p338">334 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL teen subscribers who do not own stock. The non-stockhold - ers are charged the same rate as the subscribers are charged. The company also does toll business from which it appar - ently receives a small revenue. There was no opinion by the Supreme Court in the Cotesfield case. Your question is, I take it, whether or not the applicant company is a common carrier. It is a common carrier. Sec - tion 5483, Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, defines a common carrier as follows : "The term 'common carriers' as used herein shall be taken to in - clude all corporations, companies, individuals and associations of indi - viduals, their lessees or receivers, appointed by any court whatsoever, that may now or hereafter own, operate, manage or control any rail - road, interurban or street railway line, operated either by steam or electricity or any other motive power, or part thereof, or any express company, car company, sleeping car company, freight and freight line company, telegraph and telephone companies and any other carrier engaged in the transmission of messages or transportation of passen - gers or freight for hire." The fact that this company calls itself "mutual" and the further fact that it is not operated as a money making concern do not alter its legal status. The company actually charges for the use of its facilities, that is, it operates for hire and is a common carrier under the statute. It there - fore falls under the jurisdiction of the State Railway Com - mission. Size does not affect legal principles. A small telephone concern actually doing a public telephone business and charging for it falls within the definition of the statute, as well as does the largest carrier by railroad in the state. The application should be heard and determined by the Com - mission.

Dear Sir : Your telegram of today addressed to the State Rail - way Commission was delivered to this department for atten - tion. There is no power under the statutes for an incorpor - ated village either to own or to operate a telephone exchange nor is there any provision authorizing the issuance of bonds for the construction or equipment of a telephone exchange.

Dear Sir: Further answering your inquiry as to vacancies in town boards as set forth in your letter of February 1st, we call your attention to Section 2244, Compiled Statutes, 1922, which says that in township offices vacancies are filled by the town board, but where the offices of the town board are all vacant the clerk shall appoint, and if there be no town clerk the county clerk shall appoint. This section seems to place the authority to fill the va - cancy in the town board. This conclusion is further supported by the case of State v. Taylor, 26 Neb. 580, which holds exactly in ac - cordance with the quotation from the statute. We be - lieve the opinions we formerly sent you hold the same, and that the court said in the decisions therein cited that a supervisor is a township officer. This, of course, would make the same ruling applicable to a member of the town board. LD </seg>

Mrs. Elizabeth Emery, County Superintendent, Sioux County, Harrison, Nebraska. </seg>
            <seg id="p344">340 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Dear Madam : In answer to your recent inquiry wherein you ask our opinion as to whether or not a Board of Education is in any way responsible for the doctor's bill of its Smith-Hughes teacher who cut his thumb on a buzz saw, we will be unable to give you a positive answer. The law at this time on this point is uncertain. The Workmen's Compensation Law applies to the State of Nebraska and every governmental agency created by it. Section 3656, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, par. 3, provided, however, that "It shall not be construed to include any person whose employ - ment is casual or not for the purpose of gain or profit by the employer." Under this section our court in a very thorough discus - sion in the case of Ray v. School District of Lincoln, 181 N. W. 140, held that a janitor of the Lincoln schools did not come within this act and that the school district was not liable for his injury because, while the school was an agency of government, it was not carried on "for the pur - pose of gain or profit by the employer." Since this decision was handed down by our court this section has been amended. Section 3038, par. 3, of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922, now reads as fol - lows : "It shall not be construed to include any person whose employment is casual and which is not in the usual course of the trade, business, profession, or occupation of his employer. * * *" The law as amended omits the qualification "for the purpose of gain or profit" and it seems that possibly the Legislature had in mind making the law applicable to such a situation as the present. It is our understanding that the Lincoln School Board, since its favorable decision in Ray v. School District of Lincoln, has taken the attitude under the new law that it is liable for injuries of teachers and employees. </seg>
