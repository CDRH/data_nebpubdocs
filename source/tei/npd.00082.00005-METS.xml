            <seg id="p006">Fiftieth Annual Report On March 31, 1887, the legislature of Nebraska accepted the provisions ot the federal Hatch Act, which provided for the establishment of agri - cultural experiment stations m various states. That date marks the birth of the Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station. Fifty years have now elapsed and it is proposed to prepare a special circular dealing m a general way with the growth and accomplishments of the Experiment Station dur - ing this period. This circular will be printed sometime during the current year. In general plan, the following Report is similar to those of the past several years. Extensive treatments of projects and results are not included. vv t i Cmpt 1S made as m thc two P revious reports to cite and abstract all published material related to each project and to give a brief report of progress. Thus the reader has a guide to the complete reports of investi - gative work, and also a brief summary of results. As m the past two reports, the year covered is the calendar year rather than the fiscal year. This is true of all parts of the report except the lunTsO IS?™ 1 "' C ° VerS **"' b ° m July lf 1935 ' to The work of various departments m the Station is not reported ex - clusively m the sections under the different subject matter headings. More than one department cooperate on many of the projects and this sort ot inter-departmental cooperation is not mentioned. Cooperation between the station and various divisions and bureaus of the United States Depart - ment of Agriculture is mentioned. The drouth of the past year seriously interfered with much of the work, but on the whole satisfactory progress was made on most of the projects. Emergency programs have continued to absorb some of the station s research time. A few members of the staff have been loaned for temporary periods to various governmental agencies, and other staff mem - bers devote considerable time to projects and programs m connection with the newer features of the national agricultural program. The trend of the P **a r*™ 1 ?™? 65 rc P onalizin g experimental work has been continued and the Nebraska station has cooperated with other stations and the federal government m the establishment of a regional soybean laboratory, and m studies of land use. In addition the Station has continued to cooperate with several governmental agencies m other phases of agricultural development. Research work on land use is reported for the first time m the present report. r AGRICULTURAL ENGINEERING Tractor tests.— Testing of tractors at the Nebraska Experiment Station is carried on m accordance with the Nebraska tractor testing law. During the season of 1936, 28 tests were completed. This number is greater than tor any testing season since 1920, the year tractors were first tested In 17 years 266 tractors have been tested and 87 of these, according to manu - facturers' reports, are on the market </seg>
            <seg id="p007">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station . Fourteen of the tractors tested in 1936 were of the crawler type and j fy\ V 9 *- Seven of the *»«*&gt;« tested used distillate three used tlurd-grade gasoline, and nine used 68-70 octane gasoline A new fuel economy record for carburetored tractors (112 belt horsepower hours per gallon) was established. Two tests were made on both steel wheels and 2£ bc / r t ? rc \ and two were made on rubber-tired tractors only. Bulletin 304, Nebraska Tractor Tests, 1920-1936, January, 1937, 40 pages and large summary sheet, summarizes the tests on machines that are now on the market. Carlton L. Zink is the engineer in charge of the tests and C F Adams is the assistant The board of tractor test engineers is composed of E. E. Brackett, C. W. Smith, and L. W. Hurlbut. Methods of processing feeds.— Considerable work has been done on feed grinding and grinding equipment in connection with the study of electrical power on Nebraska farms. Results of this study and considerable other material have been included in Bulletin 302, Processing Feeds on Nebraska Farms, by E. E. Brackett and E. B. Lewis, October, 1936, 24 pages. The bulletin includes data on the performance of feed grinders of different types, presents a classification of degrees of fineness, along with the recom - mendations of Nebraska farmers, discusses the value of various ground feeds for different kinds of livestock, and presents comparative costs of grinding with tractors and electric motors. Methods of cooling milk on the farms.— Studies in cooling bottled milk by spray and by cold diffusion, and milk in cans by Hydro-Vacuum and spray equipment, coupled with cream line, bacteria, and flavor studies have been completed and results are being prepared for publication Heating water for livestock.— The use of an electric soil heating cable for warming drinking water for milk cows has given satisfactory results and the effect of water temperatures on the rate and economy of gain of nogs is being studied under controlled conditions. Electrically heated hotbeds for farm use.— Two seasons of work have been carried out on this project. The following methods of supplying heat namely manure, hot air, hot water, and an electric soil heating cable, have been compared. This work is being continued. Insulated electric brooders in uninsulated poultry houses.— More tests will be necessary for definite conclusions on this work. Promising results have been obtained and the method seems economical. Work is beine continued with four types of brooders. Performance of rubber tires on tractors.— Traction of pneumatic tractor tires has been given further study during the past year. Five sizes of tires were compared on a very sandy field and on hay stubble. Very little if any additional traction was noted as due to cross section, apart from weight but eight pounds of inflation pressure was considerably better than 16 pounds on both footings. Bindweed eradication machinery and other farm equipment.—Cultiva - tion was continued on an infested field near Walton, Nebraska, where summer fallowing of bindweed ground was begun during the summer </seg>
            <seg id="p008">Fiftieth Annual Report of 1934. To date, 68 cultivations have been given this area and on some portions the bindweed has apparently stopped growing. The field has always been cultivated promptly when the weeds showed above the surface. The field will be planted to checked corn in 1937 and follow-up work will be done. An improvised automobile hay sweep which was tested first in 1935 was further improved. The sweep head was arranged so that it could be completely detached and carried on the chassis. Some study was also made of hay stackers and multiple rake hitches. Studies of haying equipment were made in fields in Holt and Dawson counties. ANIMAL DISEASES Swine erysipelas among Nebraska hogs.— This project was completed and the findings have been published in Research Bulletin 84, Swine Erysipelas, by L. Van Es and C. B. McGrath, August, 1936, 48 pages. The bulletin is an extensive study of the nature of swine erysipelas and problems connected with that disease, based upon the literature of countries in which for many years it has been a persistent problem, and also upon observa - tions and reports in and from localities, such as Nebraska and other states, where the disease has more recendy become problematical. A survey reported previously has shown that among outbreaks of acute swine diseases in Nebraska that have been investigated, about 24 per cent have been found to be due to swine erysipelas. Work on a new project dealing with the nature of certain phases of this disease will be carried on during the coming year. Immunity studies on hemorrhagic septicemia.— The final report on this project is Research Bulletin 87, The Immunizing Value of Commercial Hemorrhagic Septicemia Aggressins, by L. Van Es. and J. F. Olney, November, 1936, 16 pages. Various conclusions were reached; in general the evidence showed that there is no reason to believe that commercial hemorrhagic septicemia aggressins can be depended on as a means of protection of livestock actually exposed to B. bipolaris infection. Previous research bulletins have been published on this project and the actual work for the most part was completed several years ago. The influence of environment on certain poultry diseases. — Work on this project has been practically completed. A manuscript on the develop - ment of a sanitary type of chick feeder has been prepared and final reports on other phases of the project will probably be prepared during the coming year. During the year some initial attempts to determine the feasibility of a serological method to reveal healthy carriers of fowl cholera will also be concluded. Study of a proposed method for the active immunization of swine against hog cholera.— Results thus far indicate that by the method pro - posed swine may be rendered actively resistant to hog cholera without the use of serum. Because many other phases and possibilities must be con - sidered before any recommendations can be made, the project will have to be continued for a considerable period. </seg>
            <seg id="p009">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Diagnosis of materials submitted by veterinarians, farmers and others. — During the year 1936 a total of 7,011 specimens were examined and reports were returned to the senders. AGRICULTURAL CHEMISTRY Preparation and study of the cereal glutelins. — Experimental work con - sisted of preliminary efforts to establish suitable methods for investigating the "lipoid-protein" complex of gluten. The complex is so unstable, chemically, that its complete isolation may prove impossible. By certain physical methods of protein fractionation it seems possible, however, to separate a fraction containing the complex in a relatively high concentra - tion. It is apparently destroyed in the usual methods of drying bio-colloids by treatment with strong alcohol or acetone, followed by ether. A summary of the present state of our knowledge of the nature and identities of the wheat Hour proteins has been published as a supplement to the September, 1936, issue of Cereal Chemistry, entitled "The Wheat Flour Proteins," by M. J. Blish, pp. 16-23. Enzymes of wheat flour as related to flour grade and baking character - istics. — Further studies have been made of the nature and properties of the factors governing the conversion of raw starch to sugars by amylases in wheat, both germinated and ungerminated. Much additional informa - tion has been gained as to the number of individual factors involved, their nature, and methods for their isolation and study. The problem is ex - tremely complex, and it involves at least two or more enzymes acting in conjunction 'with certain non-enzymic activators and inhibitors. A paper entitled, "Identification and Measurement of Factors Governing Diastasis in Wheat Flour," is in press and also one on "Temperature Effects in the Preparation of Wheat Amylases." Two distinct types of maltose fermentation "activators" have been dis - covered, and are being investigated. These activators stimulate maltose fermentation by yeast to a. remarkable degree. There are at least two types of these activators. One is found in varying amounts in wheat flour, being most highly concentrated in malted wheat flour. It is non-enzymic, dialysable, and resistant to heat. The other, which seemingly is far more active, has been found only in dried yeast preparations. Although more active, it is unstable to heat unless in the dry condition. A report is being prepared for publication. Two articles were published, as follows: "The Present Status of the 'Standard' A. A. C. C. Baking Test," by M. J. Blish, Cereal Chem. 13:728 - 30, 1936; "Effect of Pressure on Rate of Gas Production in Yeast Fermenta - tion," by R. M. Sandstedt and M. J. Blish, Cereal Chem. 13:789-90, 1936. The nature of herbicidal toxidty.— Further study of the acid-arsenic spray treatment for destruction of bindweeds was greatly handicapped by the drouth. The weeds did not reach a state of luxuriant leaf growth, which seems to be an essential requirement if the treatment is to be effec - tive. Early-season treatments were ineffective. Either there was insufficient </seg>
            <seg id="p010">Fiftieth Annual Report penetration of arsenic into the roots, or the plants acquired a tolerance to - ward arsenic, or both. Some later treatments, after a September rain, were more effective. Thus far it must be considered doubtful that the treatment will ever be practical for handling by the average individual farmer. There are too many technicalities in making and handling the solution, and it is highly corrosive to all types of spraying equipment thus far developed. When applied under favorable conditions, however, it has distinct values, and may be profitably used when handled by trained and experienced operators. Physico-chemical studies on the nature of cold resistance in crop plants. — Preliminary work is under way, and has thus far. consisted chiefly of establishing methods of greenhouse and laboratory procedure. Comparative efficiency o£ various proteins in poultry feeding. — Two lots of chicks were fed rations differing only in the source of the calcium. One lot received the calcium as the carbonate and the other as the sulfate, 1.5 per cent of calcium being contained in each ration. The phosphorus con - tent of the rations was 0.77 per cent, making the calcium-to-phosphorus ratio 2:1. By means of comparative slaughter tests no differences were detected in the utilization of nitrogen, calcium, and phosphorus by the chicks of the two lots. The rates of growth were also identical. It was therefore concluded that the two calcium salts studied can be used inter - changeably in the mixing of starter rations for chicks when it is desired to increase the calcium content of the mash. A lot of ten newly hatched poults was fed the ration containing the calcium sulfate addition to com - pare their response to that of chicks. Their rate of gain was the same as that of the chicks. A comparison of the response of two lots of chicks fed rations with the same base but mixed with different concentrates is now under way. The concentrate in one case is made of equal parts of meat scraps and fish meal; in the other it is mixed from equal parts of meat scraps, fish meal, and soybean meal. The concentrates form 15 per cent of the ration in each lot and 85 parts of an identical base make up the remainder. No marked differences appeared in the growth rates of the chicks on the two rations, but final conclusions cannot be drawn until the analytical work is completed. Research Bulletin 83, The Effect of Variation in the Calcium-to-Phos - phorus Ratio on the Utilization of Nitrogen, Calcium, and Phosphorus by the Growing Chic\, by C. W. Ackerson, M. J. Blish, and F. E. Mussehl, May, 1936, 12 pages, reports a study of the net retention of nitrogen, cal - cium, and phosphorus by three lots of chicks fed rations differing in the percentage of calcium contained. It was found that increasing the amount of calcium in the ration decreased the retention of calcium but that no significant change in the retention of nitrogen and phosphorus occurred. There were no significant changes in the percentage composition of the chicks or of the gains made by them. </seg>
            <seg id="p011">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station DAIRY HUSBANDRY Growth studies of dairy cattle. — A large volume of data has been accumulated throughout the years of this project. Data on one phase have been analyzed and published as Research Bulletin 82, The Effect of Preg - nancy and Parturition on the Weight of Dairy Cows, by R. F. Morgan and H. P. Davis, March, 1936, 24 pages. In all, 656 gestation periods of cows of four breeds and of various ages were used as a foundation for this report. Gains in weight before and after calving, losses due to calving, and other weights are recorded, and various relationships of the weights are analyzed. Studies of vitamins. — In three experiments with rats, corn silage of three kinds (A. I. V., with addition of molasses before fermentation, and ordinary) were tested for vitamin A, and it was found that in each experiment the acid silage contained somewhat more vitamin A than did the molasses silage, and that the ordinary silage was decidedly inferior to the other two in vitamin A. Milk produced by cows receiving these silages as the only roughage ranked in the same order of vitamin A potency as did the silages. On the other hand, when a good grade of alfalfa hay served as the only roughage, the milk produced contained more vitamin A than did that of cows fed the acid silage as their only roughage. Studies on the vitamin content of cheese of various types are now under way. Manufacturing and preserving cheese. — The work on ripening of cheddar cheese in cans has been continued with consideration given to tem - peratures and periods of time. The results of work previously completed were published in Bulletin 303, The Manufacture of Neufchatel and Cream Cheese, by E. L. Reichart, October, 1936, 16 pages. The experimental work on the influence of starter, rennet, and acidity on the finished product, and the effects of fat content of raw material, homogenization, and tem - perature and time of cooking curd are reported, and directions for making the cheeses in the small dairy manufacturing plant and on the farm are given. Babcock testing. — Studies of variation in procedure have been con - tinued. Circular 53, Babcoc\ Testing and Other Methods of Analyzing Dairy Products, by L. K. Crowe, June, 1936, 40 pages, was published especially for those who want a convenient handbook on testing methods for milk, cream, skimmilk, buttermilk, whey, ice cream, and butter, and in addition other methods of analysis, arithmetical examples, and other useful information are included. The circular replaces Circular 35 and contains a brief summary of results published in Bulletin 246, entitled "Testing Ice Cream for Butterfat." Factors affecting milk quality. — Some work done on methods of cool - ing milk on farms is reported under the heading, Agricultural Engineer - ing. An attempt is being continued to determine the influence of the individual cow in the herd upon milk quality, and toward this end the College herd has been divided in an effort to establish a herd free of </seg>
            <seg id="p012">Fiftieth Annual Report mastitis. Of the eight animals originally placed in the herd (August, 1934), only one remains, and 31 heifers have been added and eight of these have been removed. A manuscript entitled Judging Quality in Dairy Products, by P. A. Downs, February, 1937, 44 pages, will be published early in 1937 as Cir - cular 54. This circular outlines a procedure by which quality in milk, cream, butter, ice cream, and cheese can be accurately judged. It is designed to aid producers and consumers and also schools in which courses in dairying are taught. Curd character of milk. — Over 1,000 samples have been studied at present, and a large number of additional samples must be included before significant results can be obtained. Factors affecting reproduction in dairy animals. — Several phases of this project have been advanced. One phase has had to do with the influence of wheat germ oil on females with reproductive difficulties; another has dealt with the influence of prolan on bulls; another with artificial insem - ination; and a fourth with number of services required for conception. Results thus far obtained are not sufficiently conclusive for publication. FIELD CROPS AND SOILS Corn improvement. — In the corn breeding work, 260 new lines from an original 2,000 lines were advanced one generation. Of these, 205 were advanced to the fourth generation, and seed of approximately 50 Fi single crosses between some of them was made for the first time. These new hybrids will be tested in 1937 in comparison with standard hybrids. The yield tests on the Experiment Station farm and in five of the six principal out-state tests were complete failures because of the drouth. A test on one outlying farm made an average yield of 18.6 bushels per acre. In this test, 26 hybrids averaged 213 bushels per acre, compared with 11.7 for the average of 10 open-pollinated varieties. The five best hybrids yielded 25.5 bushels, which was 71 per cent higher than the average of the five best varieties. The five commercial hybrids that are certified in Nebraska, namely Nebr. 252, 238, 110, 362, and Iowa 939, averaged 21.3 bushels, compared with 13.7 bushels for Krug, a standard variety. The average yield of these five certified hybrids during a three - year period is reported by T. A. Kiesselbach in the 27th Annual Report of the Nebraska Crop Growers' Association under the title, "How Corn Varieties and Hybrids Yielded the Past Season." Nebraska growers produced about 2500 bushels of certified commercial hybrid seed in 1936. Single-cross seed stocks are available from the 1936 crop to supply seed growers for the production in 1937 of about 1500 acres of hybrid seed fields. Winter-wheat improvement. — This work is in cooperation with the Division of Cereal Crops and Diseases, U. S. Department of Agriculture. Compared with other standard crops the yield of winter wheat was very </seg>
            <seg id="p013">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station superior in 1936. In the field-plot variety tests, a Turkey selection (Nebr. No. 1063) gave the highest yield, 34.2 bushels per acre. During the last four years this strain has had an average yield almost equal to Cheyenne, the highest-yielding variety, and has shown resistance to bunt or stinking smut and apparently acceptable quality. A selection from Cheyenne, selected for cold resistance in the controlled freezing studies, was entered in the plot tests and yielded only slightly less than Cheyenne. This selec - tion, in addition to being more winter-hardy than Cheyenne, is also very resistant to smut. In the nursery, progress is being made on developing a rust-resistant Cheyenne. Several hundred selections of Hope X Cheyenne were ad - vanced into preliminary yield tests. Lack of a stem rust epidemic prevented additional rust readings this year. It is known, however, that most of these selections are resistant to rust and smut and from the large number available some agronomically valuable lines should be found. Controlled freezing studies showed rather definitely that defoliation of field-grown winter-wheat plants in the early tillering stage reduced cold resistance. The decrease in survival was approximately in proportion to the degree of defoliation. These results may have some bearing on the question of pasturing winter wheat. Publications during the year: C. A. Suneson and Geo. L. Peltier, "Effect of Source, Quality, and Condition of Seed upon the Cold Resistance of Winter Wheat," Jour. Amer. Soc. Agron. 28:687-93, September, 1936, and "Effect of Defoliation upon the Cold Resistance of Winter Wheat," Jour. Amer. Soc. Agron. 28:807-9, October, 1936. Spring small grains. — The drouth of 1936 affected the yield of oats, barley, and spring wheat more adversely than winter wheat. Early matur - ity was a distinct advantage. For example, the three latest varieties of oats, Green Russian, Markton, and Swedish Select, ripening July 13, averaged 7.8 bushels per acre compared with an average of 26.5 for the three highest-yielding varieties, Brunker, Columbia, and Burt, which ripened July 1. Of the oat varieties which have been tested nine years or longer, Iogold and Nebr. 21 led with yields of 7 and 5 per cent higher than the standard Kherson variety. Certified seed of these two is avail - able commercially. A group of newer, early-ripening selections which have been outstanding in yield during periods of four to seven years may be reported as follows, with Kherson regarded as 100 per cent in yield: Brunker 123 per cent; Nebr. Burt 529, 118; Nebr. Burt 520, 115; and Tro - jan, 110 per cent. Of these four, the two Burt selections are superior in strength of straw and stem-rust resistance and are being increased for more extensive farm trials. The three highest-yielding varieties of barley in the 1936 station tests were as follows: Spartan, 9.6 bushels per acre; Club Mariout, 8.0; and Flynn, 63. Of the varieties that are extensively grown and certified in this state, Spartan leads with a 7-year average yield of 33 per cent higher than Common Six-row, while Glabron and Comfort are second and third </seg>
            <seg id="p014">Fiftieth Annual Report with yields of 29 and 22 per cent greater. The Spartan and Glabron arc smooth-awned and especially lodge-resistant. The highest-yielding spring-wheat variety (Kearney) on the station farm in 1936 yielded only about one-fourth as much as standard varieties of winter wheat. The new stem-rust-resistant variety, Thatcher, ranked second with a yield of 7.8 bushels, which was nearly as high as Kearney. Ceres and Komar, which are grown as Nebraska certified varieties along with Thatcher, ranked third and fourth with yields of 7.4 and 7.6 bushels per acre. Results over a period of years justify the conclusion that these three spring wheats are the best now available for Nebraska conditions. The Lincoln tests have been corroborated by results at the Box Buttc Experimental Farm, which is in the heart of the main spring-wheat region of the state. Alfalfa improvement. — Field tests conducted at Lincoln and in the Platte Valley, in cooperation with the Division of Forage Crops and Dis - eases, U. S. Department of Agriculture, though interrupted somewhat by drouth continue to show the superiority of the Hardistan and Turkistan varieties where conditions are favorable for development of the bacterial wilt disease, such as in the subirrigated valleys and under surface irri - gation. Under upland conditions Grimm, Cossack, Ladak, and northern - grown Common are the most suitable varieties now available. Ladak also has some bacterial wilt resistance but not as much as Hardistan. Previous reports have outlined the development of selections and selfed lines in gradually increasing numbers that are strikingly resistant to bac - terial wilt. It is now possible to indicate one further step, that of initial seed increase of desirable new types. Last year's report indicated that plans had been completed whereby seedlings could be started in the winter at the U. S. Western Irrigation Substation at Bard, California. This was done in the late fall of 1935, and plants were transplanted to western Nebraska in the spring of 1936 for seed production. A considerable amount of seed was obtained from these isolated blocks in the fall of 1936, in some instances as much as 25 pounds from less than 1,000 plants, or at the rate of more than 10 bushels per acre. Forty-six such isolated blocks produced seed; some were of single strains and others of two or more together for natural crossing. A plan has been worked out by the Alfalfa Improvement Conference composed of all interested alfalfa workers in the United States, whereby promising strains will be cooperatively tested throughout the country wherever it is thought they may be adapted. Details of this plan are given in the mimeographed report of the Fourth Alfalfa Improvement Confer - ence, by H. M. Tysdal. Thus it will be possible to test Nebraska strains not only in Nebraska but in other states, to compare them with the strains being developed at other institutions. Sweet-clover improvement. — Sweet clover investigations, inaugurated in 1935 in cooperation with the Division of Forage Crops and Diseases, U. S. Department of Agriculture, include: (1) improvement of sweet </seg>
            <seg id="p015">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station clover through selection and breeding; (2) studies to determine the best methods of planting small seed lots in limited field areas to secure accurate seeTvS? 6 Sf ; ff (3) T ° f • VariedeS £ ° r com P arati ve hay, pasture, and seed yields; (4) effects of cutting treatments in first and second years on hay, pasture, and seed production; and (5) seed increase of promising varieties. r ° Selection and breeding work has been expanded. A breeding nursery of several thousand spaced plants has been established. The material in this nursery includes a wide collection of forms of Melilotus from foreign and domestic sources. Particular emphasis is being placed on selection of individual plants for inbreeding which by colorimetric determination appear to be low in coumarin content, the bitter principle in sweet clover. Genetical and cytological studies related to the breeding of sweet clover are being undertaken Artificial light in the greenhouse is being used to break the biennial habit and cause flowering early. Management of permanent pastures and native meadows.— Grass im - provement work was inaugurated in 1936 in cooperation with the Division of Forage Crops and Diseases, U. S. Department of Agriculture. Green - house studies are being conducted with 16 cultivated and native foraee grasses to determine the most feasible methods of establishing plants from seed and producing seed in the greenhouse for hybridization work. Large Afiu V Pa u C ' P d P L 3ntS ° f SeVCral s P ecies are k^g established in the held tor the purpose of selecting superior strains. Eleven cultivated and eight native forage species were seeded in com - parative tests during the fall of 1936 on an irrigated field at the North Plane substation. The purpose is to study these species under grazing conditions; Tests over several years have shown that certain cultivated TE^pfJL SU " essful ',y L seeded into ** subirrigated prairie meadows meadows S3nd hU1S ' r " ultin S in "materially improved Experiments concerning the eradication of the more serious and com - rnon perennial pasture weeds by mowing at proper times are being con - tinued. Studies indicate that the seeds of certain weeds germinate readily while others germinate only after exposure to low temperature Grain and forage sorghums.— The yield of sorghum was greatly cur - tailed at Lincoln by drouth, as was the case with corn. Of 32 varieties tested 19 yielded no grain, while eight grain sorghums averaged 1 37 bushels per acre and three forage varieties averaged 1.87 bushels of seed F u r aC^J A. sor S hums &gt; however, showed far greater endurance of drouth than did the corn, with respect to forage yield. The standard variety, Krug corn, yielded 030 ton of silage per acre containing 70 per cent water, whereas 28 varieties of sorghum averaged four tons of silage per acre. Climatic conditions favored the early-ripening varieties. The old standard Black Amber cane yielded 6.03 tons of silage per acre On an air-dry basis corn yielded 0.11 ton, compared with Amber sorghum 213 tons, Early Sumac 1.81 tons, Waconia Orange 1.92 tons, Atlas sorgo 1*28 </seg>
            <seg id="p016">Fiftieth Annual Report tons, and Juicy Pink kafir 1.77 tons. The sorghums have definitely proved more productive of silage and more dependable than corn over a long period. The more dependable grain yields of grain sorghums south of the Platte river in recent dry years have resulted in an increasing acreage of this crop. A wide range of types is included in the varietal tests. Among the grain sorghums, Pink kafir, Kalo, and Early Kalo may be regarded as standard late-, medium-, and early-maturing varieties, whereas Atlas, Early Sumac, and Black Amber are corresponding forage types. As an average for the last 12 years, in which drouth has been severe in five, kafir has yielded 30.4 bushels of grain per acre, compared with 263 bushels for corn. Miscellaneous new crops. — With increased interest in industrial use of farm crops, many inquiries are received concerning the possibilities of soybeans and Jerusalem artichokes. Owing to the severe drouth, soybeans yielded only two bushels an acre at Lincoln in 1936. As an average for 28 years the yield at Lincoln has been 16 bushels per acre, compared with 37.2 bushels for corn, 30.7 bushels for winter wheat, and 44.3 bushels for oats. Soybeans have come to be regarded as a soil-depleting crop when harvested for grain or for - age, and not a satisfactory substitute for alfalfa or clover for soil-building purposes. Grown as an intertilled crop they leave the soil rather loose and bare and are often conducive to excessive erosion. Their yield and price have not proved sufficiently high to induce farmers of this state to grow them in place of other standard crops. It now appears that the expansion in soybean acreage will occur in states farther east, where more acid soils occur. The Illini and Manchu varieties have given most favorable results here. Interest in Jerusalem artichokes has centered about their possibilities in the manufacture of industrial alcohol. This crop has been tested by the Experiment Station in various parts of the state. The most popular variety, the Improved French White, has averaged a yield of 4.25 tons of fresh tubers per acre during five years at Lincoln. Under conditions of favorable irrigation or subirrigation, yields of 12 tons per acre have been produced in some years in western Nebraska, whereas the yields have commonly been very low on dry land. In 1936, the tuber yields in various tests at several substations were as follows: Lincoln, 0.4 ton; North Platte, 0.5 ton (estimated); Valentine, 0.0 ton; Alliance, 1.4 tons; and Mitchell, 4.4 tons with two inadequate irrigations early in the season. At present there is no profitable industrial market for artichokes, and it appears that they cannot compete with other standard livestock feed crops. The feed value of the tubers is fairly similar to that of potatoes. Weeds. — A bindweed research project in cooperation with the Division of Cereal Crops and Diseases, U. S. Department of Agriculture, was in - augurated in April, 1936. The experimental field work is being carried on at York, Nebraska. The objectives are to discover general principles from which control methods may be developed and to make comparisons </seg>

            <seg id="p021">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station of practices believed worthy of consideration. The investigations include: (1) the trend of organic root reserves under cultivation; (2) effect of time of beginning cultivation on control; (3) frequency of cultivation; (4) wheat and rye as fall competitive crops; (5) alfalfa, sweet clover, and grasses as perennial and biennial competitive crops; (6) sorgo, sudan grass, and millet as summer competitive crops; (7) time and manner of apply - ing sodium chlorate; (9) rate of applying chlorate; and (10) comparison of other herbicidal treatments with sodium chlorate. The work is to be continued for several years. The results of the studies on the eradication of bindweeds from blue - grass lawns, carried on during the past two years, has been published in the Journal of the American Society of Agronomy ("Eradication of Bind - weed in Bluegrass Lawns," by R. C. Kinch and F. D. Keim, 29-30-39) The results indicate that bindweed can be eradicated from the lawns by pulling and by judicious use of sodium chlorate without materially affect - ing the bluegrass sod. i Pj. C s y stCmatic effort t0 eradicate bindweed on Experiment Station land has been continued with good results. A combination of chlorate used in fence rows and small inaccessible places and clean tillage in fields has proved effective and practical. Outlying crop experiments on Nebraska farms.— The Box Butte Experi - mental Farm affords opportunity for testing varieties and cultural practices with corn, sorghum, winter wheat, spring wheat, oats, barley, and other crops In cooperation with the Agricultural Extension Service, tests with all of these crops are conducted on farms throughout the state in coopera - tion with the farmers. Through such practices, the merits of new, promis - ing crops can be checked further before seed is distributed for commercial production. Soil moisture.— Contour furrowing and basin listing have been found effective in increasing the storage of rainfall in the soil. In one experi - ment, undisturbed barley stubble stored 2.1 inches of moisture in the upper three feet of soil during a period when the rainfall was approxi - mately six inches. In another portion of the same field, where the soil had been worked with a soil chisel on the contours, three to four inches of moisture were stored. In another experiment on corn stubble land, the soil chisel was ineffective, but basin-listed land stored 3.8 inches of moisture while the undisturbed land stored 2.8 inches. Restoration of organic matter in soils.— Some investigations have been completed on the rate and nature of decomposition of various organic materials when added to soil (Carrington clay loam top soil) under field of Sh • ' m thc nitr ° gCn content o£ the mi «ure ot soil and organic material indicate that considerable fixation of nitrogen occurs during the first few months after the organic material is added The : addition of one per cent of alfalfa hay, sweet clover hay, alfalfa K? -f lks &gt; P raine hav ' r hoise manure result «l an increase in the total nitrogen content of the mixture during the first two months </seg>
            <seg id="p022">Fiftieth Annual Report With horse manure, alfalfa roots, cornstalks, and prairie hay there was a further small increase during the second two-months period. From then on, all mixtures slowly decreased in nitrogen content, but there was very little change during the second and third seasons after the addition of the organic materials. The addition of one per cent of corn-cob meal or of wheat straw to the soil resulted in a slower fixation of nitrogen, which continued for a longer time. By the end of three and one-half years, the nitrogen contents of all the soils to which the organic materials have been added were close together (0.172 to 0.177 per cent) and were slightly higher than in the check soils (0.165 to 0.170), to which no organic matter had been added. The check soils showed practically no change in nitrogen content during the three and one-half years. New experiments have been begun, with soil from the Station farm at Lincoln. (Carrington clay loam) and North Platte substation soil (Holdrege very fine sandy loam). The materials added were wheat straw, prairie hay, horse manure, alfalfa hay, and cornstalks, each at the rate of one per cent of the dry weight of the soil. Volume-weight determina - tions are being made on these mixtures at the time of sampling, as an index of the influence of the organic material on the physical condition of the soil. All of the added materials decreased the volume weight to some extent. The alfalfa hay and wheat straw had had relatively less effect than the other three materials at the first sampling, six weeks after they were added. Volume-weight determinations will be repeated at intervals. Nitrification in Nebraska soils. — Nitrification studies have been made, cooperatively with the U. S. Department of Agriculture, on the soils of the irrigated crop rotation plats at the Scottsbluff Substation at Mitchell. The capacity of the soil to supply nitrate to the crop is low in the plats that are continuously under the same crop and in those under short rota - tions in which no legume is included and no manure applied. Sweet clover or alfalfa in the rotation, or the application of manure, results in larger nitrate production and higher yields. Soil samples from the fertility plats at Lincoln, taken in 1936, are being used to determine the influence of manure and commercial fertilizer upon the nitrification rate. Manure has been found to increase appreciably the nitrification rate of the soil, but the commercial fertilizers have had no significant effect. Commercial fertilizers, manure, and lime. — A summary has been made of the data on the influence of commercial fertilizers, manure, and lime on the yields of crops on Carrington clay loam at Lincoln. As an average over the 16-year period, potash has had no measurable effects upon the yields of corn, oats, wheat, or alfalfa. Superphosphate at the rate of 16 pounds of phosphorus pentoxide per acre has increased the yield of wheat three bushels, of oats four bushels, and of alfalfa 500 pounds per acre, but has had no measurable effect upon corn. The effects of phosphate j </seg>
            <seg id="p023">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station have been entirely seasonal. The four-year average increases in yield have ranged from 0.9 to 4.7 bushels of wheat and from none to 73 bushels of oats. On land that has not been in legumes nor been manured in recent years, sodium nitrate has produced appreciable increases in yields of wheat and oats, but as a rule the increase has been insufficient to pay the cost of the fertilizer. On land that has been in alfalfa or has been manured recently, the sodium nitrate has shown no significant effect on yields of corn or small grain. It has caused small but consistent decreases in the yields of alfalfa hay. Where manure has been applied, 6 to 8 bushels "more wheat, 8 to 12 bushels more oats, and 500 to 600 pounds more alfalfa hay per acre have been produced. The increase in the yield of corn from the use of manure has not exceeded 3 bushels, as an average over the 16-year period. The highest yield of corn has been obtained on the plat receiving the largest amount of manure, 18 tons every four years. It is evident that this amount of manure has had no serious overstimulating effect on the corn, on the average. Overstimulation, when it has occurred, has been most serious on oats. Lime has been more effective than manure on alfalfa. Lime alone has been practically as effective as lime and manure together. On land that has not previously been in alfalfa, lime has increased the yield of alfalfa hay 1500 pounds per acre as an annual average over a four-year period. On land that has been in alfalfa for several years, where subsoil moisture has been seriously depleted, lime has had no significant effect. Lime has in occasional years caused increased yields of oats and wheat, but on the average has had no significant effect on these crops nor on corn. Factors affecting permeability of soils. — Studies are in progress on the permeability and tilth of alkali clay pan soils. During the season of 1936, calcium chloride, gypsum, sulfur, and manure were applied to field plats growing sugar beets, alfalfa, and sweet clover. Because of the lack of rain and the low supply of irrigation water, yields were not obtained on most plats. Better stands of sweet clover were obtained on the calcium chloride plats, and the yield of sugar beets in one field was increased by this treatment. Other studies showed that treatments with the above chemicals greatly increased the permeability of the soil. A mole drainage implement was used in conjunction with chemical and manure treatments, for the purpose of opening up the daypan and allowing the applied materials to penetrate to a greater depth. The imple - ment was run at a depth of 18 to 20 inches. Beneficial effects on the stands of sugar beets and sweet clover were noted. A special subsoiler was constructed for channeling the soil between sugar beet rows before irrigations to a depth of six to eight inches. The plats treated absorbed more water, remained moist longer, and pro - duced larger and better-shaped beets than those tilled in the usual manner. </seg>
            <seg id="p024">Fiftieth Annual Report Phosphorus studies.— Laboratory studies have been continued on the availability of phosphorus in alkaline soils as determined by leaching them with a dilute alkaline buffer adjusted to the pH of the soil. This method was used' to study the effect of organic matter decomposition upon the availability and fixation of phosphorus by alkaline soils under laboratory conditions. Such crop residues as alfalfa tops, alfalfa roots, sugar beet tops, potato t4ps, and wheat straw increased the available phosphorus in all the soils studied; however, manure was much more effective in releas - ing available phosphorus. In general, the increases were greater for the materials having a higher phosphorus content. The increase in available phosphorus also depended upon the ability of the soil to fix phosphorus as it was released from organic materials. The calcareous soils fixed con - siderably more phosphorus than the noncalcareous. Additions of urea and ammonium sulfate caused a large increase in available phosphorus in the noncalcareous soils but had no appreciable effect on the calcareous. ■ Phosphorus studies have been completed on the soil samples taken in 1935 from the rotation plats of Field K. at the Scottsbluff Substation. Available phosphorus and pH determinations were made, and the results will be compared with those obtained from samples taken in 1925 and with others taken at the beginning of the rotation experiments. Phosphorus studies are in progress on soils sampled from the fertility plats at Lincoln and from the old dry-land rotation experiments at North Platte. The study on the absorption of phosphorus by sugar beets from phos - phate-deficient soils has been completed. Beets were taken from phos - phated and unphosphated plats at regular intervals during the season, and the sugar content of the roots was determined. Calcium, magnesium, phos - phorus, and nitrogen determinations were also made on both tops and roots. This work was in cooperation with the U. S. Department of Agri - culture. FRUITS AND VEGETABLES Orchard culture. — During the past year studies of soil moisture have been extended and sampling has been done at points sampled one year earlier. Between July 31; 1935, and August, 1936, soil in the block of Delicious apples lost the equivalent of 8 to 10 inches of water. This loss occurred almost entirely below the 15-foot level and largely below the level of 20 feet. From some preliminary studies it appears that apple tree roots cannot extract quite all the soil water above the hygroscopic coefficient; at least dying Grimes trees had not done so. Since nearly all the fruit at the Union apple orchard was destroyed by spring hail little information has been obtained during the past year on yield. The increase in tree diameter has, however, been noted. The soil under the mulched area of the vine - yard is still filled with moisture to field capacity, but in the area under cultivation considerable loss has occurred. A brief report of cultural studies will be published in the 1937 report of the American Society for Horticul - tural Science and the Nebraska Horticultural Society. </seg>
            <seg id="p025">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Fruit breeding. — Some observations were made on the effect of hot, dry conditions on varieties. The small-fruit plantation has disappeared except for some rows of black raspberries, and many of the tree fruits suffered severely. None of the strawberries survived. Root systems of fruit plants. — The drouth has seriously depleted the top-worked orchard at Lincoln and a portion of the trees are being removed in hopes of prolonging the lives of the remaining trees. The root sys - tems are being studied to determine the distribution of roots and their behavior as they approach the roots of adjoining trees. The major part of a study of young apple tree root systems at the Union fruit farm was concluded in 1936. The results of this study will be published as a research bulletin, and some phases of the work will be continued for a few years. Experiments with! vegetables. — On the loess soils near Omaha asparagus has been found to be extracting moisture to a depth of 20 feet, an old bed having removed practically all available moisture from the top 10 feet. In the more impervious soils at Lincoln asparagus has not penetrated beyond the 10-foot depth. Variety tests, including 50 varieties of tomatoes, have been tested at Lincoln, North Platte, and Mitchell for earliness and ability to set fruit in hot weather. Further studies have been conducted to determine the relationship of specific gravity to phloem/xylem ratio and to sugar content. Storage of potatoes. — This project has been continued as in previous years. Research Bulletin 88, Cellar and Cold Storage of Mechanically Damaged Triumph Seed Potatoes, by H. O. Werner, December, 1936, 64 pages, reports the results^of experimental work continued over several years at Alliance, Nebraska. The most satisfactory storage is storage in a damp cellar, one that is moist when the potatoes are stored, because wound healing takes place best in a highly humid atmosphere. Cold stor - age in the fall and during later periods, as compared with continuous cellar storage, and storage of whole and damaged tubers that had been exposed to varying periods of outdoor weather were observed under various storage conditions, and other phases of the general storage problem were included in the investigations reported. Nutrition of the potato. — An effort is being made to determine the extent to which the tuberization capacity of a variety of potatoes can be predicted by tests under conditions where temperature, day length, and nitrogen level are controlled. Chemical analyses have been made of potato tubers to determine the effect of size, nitrogen nutrition, day length, and temperature upon the carbohydrate composition of potato tubers. An article entitled "Morphological Response of the Potato to Abrupt Environ - ment Changes," Amer. Potato Jour. 13:150-55, 1936, by H. O. Werner, reports results of this work. Crop rotations, including potatoes, on dry land in western Nebraska. — This work is carried on at the Box Butte experimental farm in Box Butte county. During the drouth season of 1936 satisfactory. crops of potatoes </seg>
            <seg id="p026">Fiftieth Annual Report were produced when potatoes followed summer fallow and poorer yields following corn or beans, whereas after small grain the potato crop was a' failure. These results and data from a number of commercial fields show that the dry-land yield of potatoes in 1936 was dependent upon the mois - ture stored in the soil at plant-emergence time. Potatoes were found capable of growing a fair crop from stored moisture, but in doing so they removed most of the moisture in the top five feet of soil. An article entitled "The Relation of Rainfall Distribution, Crop Rotation, and Soil Moisture to the Yield of Potatoes at the Box Butte Experimental Farm," Ann. Rpt. Nebr. Potato Imp. Assoc. 1936, by H. O. Werner, discusses this work. Potato breeding. — Cooperative arrangements have been made with U. S. D. A. and the University of Minnesota. Numerous promising seed - lings and foreign stocks have been grown. Several thousand seedlings are being raised in the greenhouse, and promising recently-introduced varieties are being tested. Methods of testing seedlings according to stand - ardized technique are being developed. HOME ECONOMICS Gas stoves. — The results of the first part of the comprehensive study of gas stoves are given in Research Bulletin 86, A Study of Selected Types of Domestic Gas Stoves, by A. E. Baragar, November, 1936, 72 pages. It was found that efficiency of the surface burners depends upon size and kind of utensil, upon the construction of the burner, and upon the type of stove top and grate construction, and it was further found mat efficiency could be changed by modifying any of these factors. The average efficiency for the best type of surface burner was 44.5 per cent, while the lowest average efficiency, 33.5 per cent, was obtained with the stove having the heaviest top and grate construction. Flue-gas analyses have shown that some burners produce excess carbon monoxide if the gas rate is not care - fully adjusted. Some of the automatic lighters would not function properly and the construction had to be modified. It was found impossible to predict the performance of an oven from information obtained from other ovens. With 43 per cent of the ovens tested, the oven temperature did not agree with the dial when set at 400. With thermostats adjusted so that oven temperatures agreed with the dial set at 400, only 14 per cent of the ovens could be turned as low as 300° F. Heat loss for gas ovens was found to be 4 to 5 times as great as the loss from, electric ovens. Considerable work will be done in addition to that reported in Research Bulletin 86 and an additional report will be published some time in the future. In addition a popular circular will be prepared. Pressure cookers and methods of canning. — Most of the technical work has been concerned with the blow-off of the safety valve, tightness of seal of the cover, and the gauges. The results will be ready for publication sometime during 1937. </seg>
            <seg id="p027">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station ■ P ha f ° £ *"" stu&lt;J y consists of a survc y °f canning methods used by Nebraska homemakers for non-acid foods. This material has been tabulated and summarized. Records show that the amount of foods canned by pressure cookers increases as altitude increases throughout the state, and that the percentage of spoilage is less for all non-acid foods processed m the pressure cooker, with the exception of meat. Records from Nebraska women on methods used for canning meat, with the amount of spoilage, are now being summarized. The cooking quality of dry beans— Results obtained in this investiga - tion have been published as Research Bulletin 85, Some Factors Affecting *"« Cooking Quality of the Pea and Great Northern Types of Dry Beans by Edna BSnyder October, 1936, 32 pages. The results show that the cooking quality of the types of beans studied is determined almost wholly py the structure and composition of the seed coats, which contain varying amounts of pectic material in the form of pectic acid or pectates and of calcium; and by the hygroscopic quality of the mycropyle and germinal area, which varies in different beans. Some factors that influence cooking are as follows: Scarification of seed coat reduces cooking time; storage conditions with high temperatures and low humidity produce hard shells; solutions of hydrochloric and acetic acid and of calcium and magnesium chlorides and sulphates harden the^eed coats; solutions of sodium bicarbonate and ammonium salts of oxalic, citric, and tartaric acid soften them; solutions of sodium and potas - sium sulfates and chlorides are without effect. Place of origin and size are apparently without effect on cooking quality. Use of lard in cake making.— A household method has been devised for the use of lard in cakes, which produces a cake with good texture and volume, and in addition masks the flavor of the lard and is also very simple. A report on this method will be published in the near future Home and commercially prepared white bread and rolls.— Reports from Nebraska homemakers who have kept records of the ingredients and costs of materials used in bread have been tabulated and summarized. A report will be published sometime during the coming year. Study of relief activities in seven Nebraska counties.— The information obtained in this study covers the years 1927 to 1934 and was collected about two years ago. It will be published as Research Bulletin 89 in February, 1937. Family life studies.— Data for the comparative study of young people from farm, village, and city homes in regard to certain possible relation - ships between character and personality adjustment and home and family influences were obtained by means of a battery of tests and questionnaires which were administered to over 1,950 young people of Nebraska. These young people range between 12 and 18 years of age. Some 1,348 of them attend high school in ten representative towns of from 600 to 1,350 popu - lation. The remainder live in the city of Omaha. About half of dwse </seg>
            <seg id="p028">Fiftieth Annual Report in the rural group live in the small towns and their fathers arc not directly engaged in farming. The others come from farm homes. Information of two general sorts were gathered. First, information concerning the home environment and certain aspects of the family life of each subject was obtained. The other sort of data has more directly to do with the subject himself and was obtained by means of a set of character and personality tests. The tests and questionnaires are at present being scored and the results tabulated. INSECTS, RODENTS, AND BIRDS The chinch bug, Hessian fly, and other injurious pests. — Following the 1934 drouth, which was very destructive to that year's second brood of the chinch bug, the studies of chinch bug barriers conducted in 1934 to learn the principal reasons for the occasional failure of such barriers and methods of avoiding such failures had to be suspended in 1935, and while there were some local chinch bug troubles in Richardson, Pawnee, and Nemaha counties in 1936 and a few barriers were constructed, these were not sufficient to permit the resumption of these investigations. A survey made in November of 1936 revealed a rather heavy infestation in Richardson, Pawnee, Nemaha, and Otoe counties, with light to moderate infestations in parts of Gage, Johnson, Lancaster, Cass, and Sarpy counties, indicating that conditions may favor resuming these studies in 1937. The damage by the Hessian fly so prevalent in the" years 1929 to 1932, making possible detailed life history studies through field observation stations, became greatly reduced with the decrease in Hessian fly popula - tion beginning in 1933, and this decrease, accentuated by the drouths of 1934 and 1936, has necessitated the suspension of the life history studies during the last four years. A survey made in June, 1936, showed a maxi - mum infestation of only six and an average infestation of only one per cent of the stems, in southeastern Nebraska, while in south-central and southwestern Nebraska the Hessian fly population was even less, averaging only 0.3 per cent for the whole of southern Nebraska. This indicates little serious trouble in the winter wheat crop sown in the fall of 1936, and probably continued suspension of these studies through 1937. During 1936 attention was given to the infestation of the alfalfa weevil in northwestern Nebraska, following the discovery of a new area of in - festation north of Harrison in Sioux county, in 1935. It was found that the pest wintered well in that region in 1935-36, and that these overwin - tered adult weevils maintained a high population until adults of the new generation appeared in abundance in June, by which time the parasites had become very scarce and the weevil population still further increased. This increase was cut down in July by the drouth and poor vegetative growth. A survey made in June showed that the weevil had extended from Sioux county into Dawes county, Box Butte county, and Fall River county of South Dakota. On the other hand, there was not much, if any, further extension of the older separate infestation in extreme southwestern </seg>
            <seg id="p029">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Sioux and northwestern Scottsbluff counties. The existence of the infesta - tion has been known since 1928. A study was made on the wintering of the corn-ear worm in south - eastern Nebraska in 1935-36. Late in September, 800 of these larvae were placed in eight cages, and in mid-November 90 per cent of them were present as living pupae in two cages, but in mid-April of 1936 all of the pupae were dead in two other cages, and no moths emerged from the remaining four cages, indicating that the insect completely failed to winter successfully. Very few moths were flying in June and July, and no dam - age was reported in 1936 except a little on sweet corn early in the season. Much attention was given in 1936 to the flat-headed apple-tree borer, which continued its destructive progress on the principal shade, ornamen - tal, and fruit trees of the entire state during that season. Data on the life history of the species were accumulated, and the fact of increasing parasitic control established. Some progress was made in 1936 on studies of the boxelder plant bug and on the control of blister beetles and flea beedes. Grasshopper control. — Grasshopper abundance and injuries, which abated in 1935 as compared with 1933 and 1934, flared up again to new heights in 1936, in conformity with the indication of the grasshopper egg survey made in 74 Nebraska counties in the fall of 1935. Eggs overwin - tered with a very low mortality, and about May 6, nearly a fortnight later than normal, they began to hatch all over eastern Nebraska, and continued hatching out over the state in large numbers during the greater part of May. Crop damage began before the close of May in southeastern Nebras - ka, and continued to increase in area and intensity, until by mid-July 83 of the 93 Nebraska counties had reported serious losses, running much higher than in 1934. During 1936, over 2,500 tons of dry bran, mixed with appropriate amounts of arsenical poison and water, were used by over 30,000 Nebraska farmers. Studies were continued on better methods of preparation and spreading of poisoned baits for grasshoppers throughout the season. A noticeable loss of bird life, especially during July, caused by drouth, was erroneously blamed on the grasshopper bait, and a special study was made as to the effect of the use of such baits on the bird life of the state. The results were reported in the Nebraska Bird Review for October, 1936, by M. H. Swenk, and confirmed similar studies made elsewhere that these baits, properly spread, do not poison birds. The damage by grasshoppers in Nebraska in 1936 was greater than in any year since the pioneer days. Damage to field crops of all kinds, and wild hay, pasture, and range grasses, is estimated to total over $11,500,000, and it is further estimated that nearly $2,300,000 worth of crops were saved by the poisoning campaign, a figure that would have been at least three times as large except for the destruction of crops later by the drouth. In September and October, approximately 1,000 Nebraska farms covering all parts of the state were checked for grasshopper eggs, and a heavier </seg>

It would appear that only very unfavorable weather during the winter of 1936-37 and the spring and early summer of 1937, can prevent a serious grass - hopper infestation this year. Distribution, life history, and means of control of the common Nebraska cutworms. — Since the publication, in 1935, of the results of the studies on the identification of the species of cutworms and army worms that attack corn in Nebraska, effort has been concentrated on a further elaboration of the life histories, food habits, and distribution of the twenty-three species included in the published study, especially in relation to a possible applica - tion of these data toward better methods of control. Studies of insects attracted to light traps. — Work along this line was begun in 1933 in connection with the study of the life histories of Nebraska cutworms, and in 1936 was expanded to form a separate project, involving a detailed study of the nocturnal activity of the adult moth stages of not only the various species of cutworms, but also of other moths, especially of economically important species, and of May beetles (adults of white grubs), click beetles (adults of wireworms), and other pests the beetles of which are attracted to lights. These light traps are run throughout the season, and thus the season of flight and relative abundance in different years and at different times is determined. In 1936, light traps located at Lincoln and at the Scottsbluff Substation yielded over 100,000 moths captured, most of which have been classified as to species, involving 167 species, of which 124 are members of the cutworm family. Moths of all of the more injurious species of cutworms, and many of those of lesser importance, were caught, and these will serve as a basis of life-history investigations. Control of potato flea beetles and potato psyllids. — In 1936 this project was conducted at the Scottsbluff Substation. Neither flea beetles nor psyllids occurred in any great numbers in the potato fields; hence the seas - on was a poor one for making control studies. The flea-beetle population remained about stationary at a low level from July 15 to September 1. The greatest number of psyllid nymphs occurred on July 15, but even this maximum was very low, only about 12 per cent of the plants show - ing nymphs on the early plantings. Eggs were first observed on July 12 and were about as numerous as nymphs in mid-August and early Sep - tember. Even in mid-September, adult psyllids were comparatively scarce. The spraying data concerned were largely valuable in determining the effect of die spray materials on the plants, the numbers of flea beetles and psyllids being too small to indicate any insect control value of the spray experiments or to affect the yield data. A brood study of the codling moth in southeastern Nebraska. — In 1936, as in 1934, drouth and the heat affected both the population and seasonal history of the codling moth. The population of this pest was greatly decreased in 1934, recovered in 1935, and was again severely set back in 1936. The winter of 1935J6 was extremely disastrous to hibernating larvae, </seg>
            <seg id="p031">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station and of 689 larvae placed under observation in the insectary in the fall of 1935, 676, or over 98 per cent, died before April 23; while of 186 larvae and two pupae found under bands in the orchard on April 24, 169 larvae were dead, indicating a survival of only 8.6 per cent in the open. The small number of larvae and pupae surviving on April 24 suffered a further mortality of over 10 per cent before May 16. Owing to the low populations the life-history data secured were often disarticulate or fragmentary. Pupae were found from April 24 to June 6, and spring-brood moth emergence began on May 11 and continued to June 10. The first egg - laying took place on May 30, and continued to June 16. The eggs observed to hatch in the insectary were all between June 10 and 15, though larvae were found under bands in the orchard on June 8. First-brood pupae were found from June 13 to July 25, and first-brood moths emerged from June 21 to August 7. Second-brood eggs were found from June 30 to July 18, the drouth producing an egg mortality of over 82 per cent. Second-brood larvae were found from July 21 to October 8, and second-brood pupae from July 26 to September 4. Nearly 50 per cent of the second-brood larvae entered hibernation. Second-brood moths were emerging from August 7 to September 14. Eggs of the third brood were deposited from August 14 to October 7, chiefly between August 16 and September 25. The observed hatching period of these eggs extended from August 22 to September 12. Principal biological factors determining the population level of the} Bob-White Quail in Nebraska. — The data already secured under this pro - ject in 1934 and 1935 have been under analysis in 1936, as well as some - what augmented. Control of rodents and other injurious mammals, — As in 1935, the work under this project was largly concentrated in further studies of the control of the common mole. The problems of control of pocket gophers, prairie dogs, ground squirrels, and jack rabbits continued to receive atten- UOn * LIVESTOCK. FEEDING In the section on livestock feeding at Lincoln, reference is made to mimeographed circulars by their numbers.

Cottonseed cake, tankage, and 37 per cent protein soybean cubes as supplements to a silage ration. — This test was the third conducted by the Nebraska Experiment Station upon mixed-feed supplements for cattle and the series has included 12, 22, and 37 per cent protein products, feeds which are products of commercial feed mills and are sold to ranchers and feeders of Nebraska in large quantities each year. One lot was fed upon </seg>
            <seg id="p032">Fiftieth Annual Report silage alone. The test was run 145 days with steer calves. The silage was made from drouth-damaged corn and contained no grain. The daily gains were as follows: for the lot fed cottonseed cake, 1.63 pounds; for the tankage lot, 1.66; for the soybean cubes, 1.51; and for the lot fed silage alone, 133 pounds. There was no noticeable difference in the condition of the catde at the end of the experiment, with the excep - tion that the calves fed silage alone did not show the bloom, growthiness, or flesh of the other three lots. (Mimeo. Circular 160.) Corn silage vs. corn and weed silage. — The results of this test are recorded in Mimeo. Circular 160, along with the report on protein sup - plements. The weed silage was approximately 50 per cent weeds and 50 per cent corn and neither of the silages contained grain. The two lots consumed almost the same amount of dry matter per day, thus showing no difference in palatability of the silages. A gain in the lot fed straight corn was 0.35 pound per head daily greater than the gain in the lot fed weedy silage and this difference was noticeable in the condition of the cattle at the end of the test. The test shows, however, the practicability of using weed-damaged corn as silage. Grainless silage, cottonseed cake, and a half-feed of corn for yearling and calf heifers. — This experiment was conducted to test the results of a similar trial reported a year ago (Mimeo.

In a general way the results resemble those of the previous test. The table on page 27 summarizes the averaged results of the two trials. (Mimeo. Circular 161.) Finishing yearling and calf heifers after a wintering ration of silage,, cottonseed cake, and limited amounts of corn. — This experiment represents the finishing period of the experiment reported above in Mimeographed Circular 161. All lots were similarly fed. but marketed at different times. Both the calves and yearlings that were fed grain during the winter made larger gains than those not fed grain. They consumed more grain per day even though fed for a shorter period. However, they were getting practically a half feed of corn when the finishing period started. Both lots of yearlings gained faster but also required more feed per unit of gain than did the calves. The lot of calves wintered with corn was fed 56 days, and the lot wintered without grain was fed 92 days. On the market the two lots were of equal value in weights, carcass grades, and finish. With the yearlings no grain in the winter proved more practical than with the calves. Lot 4 (see above) gained 26 pounds per head more than Lot 3, but Lot 3 con - sumed only 14.4 bushels of corn, while Lot 4 consumed 28.1. Lot 3, how - ever, ate 14 pounds more cake and 1.9 tons more silage. There was little to choose between the calf and the yearling from a corn-requirement standpoint. The calves required longer feeding and this difference in length of feeding period about offsets the difference in daily corn requirements. There was little difference in total gain produced between the yearlings and calves. The amount of silage required to pro - duce beef under these methods favored the calves by approximately 25 per cent. (Mimeo. Circular 162.) Cottonseed cake, tankage, and soybean cubes as supplements to corn and alfalfa for fattening yearling steers. — This experiment, in addition to comparing the above-named supplements to a corn and alfalfa ration, was planned to test the effect of the protein level in the winter ration upon sub - sequent summer gains. There were five lots of 10 head each of yearling steers. The test continued over 174 days, April 25 to October 16, 1936. All lots had been fed grainless silage during the winter for a period of 145 days. All but one of the lots had a protein supplement in addition to silage. Of the supplements fed, cottonseed cake proved the most valuable. While cake and soybean cubes produced a unit of gain at practically identical costs, the cake produced slightly more gain, 442 pounds as against 428 pounds for the cubes. Tankage proved less valuable than either cake or cubes, producing 304 pounds of gain or 16 pounds less than shelled corn and alfalfa. Feed requirements for both corn and alfalfa were higher in the tankage lot than for either the cake or cube lots. The </seg>
            <seg id="p034">Fiftieth Annual Report relatively poor showing of tankage in this trial is not in accord with pre - vious trials. It is possible, however, that the tankage used was of poorer quality than that in previous tests. The tankage proved unpalatable and particularly certain sacks of it. Of three tests conducted by the Nebraska station with tankage for cattle, this is the only one in which the cattle objected to eating it. (Mimeo. Circular 163.) The seeding and carrying capacity of temporary pastures. — This test marks the conclusion of a five-year project planned to secure data on the comparative value of temporary and permanent pastures. Although the drouths of 1934 and 1936 seriously interfered, records were kept and while not included in the five-year average they will be reported. The Red Polled steer and beef production.— Experiment in progress. Five steers and one Red Polled heifer from the purebred herd at the Valen - tine substation were fed corn and alfalfa individually. As each animal reached 900 pounds in weight it was slaughtered and detailed carcass studies were made. Four more such cattle are now being fattened for similar studies. Sufficient data are not available at this time to warrant a report (When completed, results are to be published in Mimeo. Circular 159.) Molasses vs. corn for fattening yearling heifers. — Experiment in progress. This experiment was planned in order to find a substitute for high-priced grain and to help answer some of the many questions upon the value of molasses. No detrimental effects or digestive disturbances have been noted from feeding large amounts (15 pounds daily) of molassses. Wintering heifer calves upon silage and varying amounts of molasses, cottonseed cake, and corn. — Experiment in progress. Six lots of heifer calves were started on test December 1, 1936. The results of this test will be reported in Mimeo. Circular 165. Full-feeding pigs on Sudan grass. — Eight lots of 14 pigs averaging 83 pounds were full-fed on Sudan-grass pasture, each lot having approximately 0.66 acre of forage. All rations as well as a simple mineral supplement were self-feed free choice. Corn constituted the grain ration of all except Lot 8, which was fed ground barley. The pigs were started on test on June 11 and continued for 85 days until September 4, at which time all lots were self-fed corn and tankage free choice for an additional 30-day period.

Practically without exception, those lots which had made the smallest gains during the first period made the largest gains during the second period, indicating that the rations used during the first period and not chance were responsible for the results noted. Soybean oil meals manufactured by different processes for dry-lot pig) feeding. — Five lots of ten 84-pound pigs each were fed in dry lot for 98 days from January 4 until April 11, 1936. Yellow shelled corn was self - fed free choice in each lot as well as a simple mineral supplement made up of bone meal 2 parts, ground limestone 2 parts, and salt 1 part. For a protein supplement, an equal-parts mixture of soybean oil meal and tank - age (Lots 2 and 4) was compared with a mixture of tankage two parts, soybean oil meal one, and alfalfa meal one (Lots 3 and 5), as well as tankage alone (Lot 1). In one series (Lots 2 and 3) new-process soybean oil meal was used and in the other (Lots 4 and 5) expeller process.^ The protein supplement was self-fed in every case.

The "trinity" or "trio" mixture in which soybean oil meal was substituted proved as effective as the standard mixture in which linseed meal was fed. Emergency drouth rations for pigs. — Experiment in progress. Nine lots of pigs (10 head per lot) were started on feed on November 26, 1936, to compare various combinations including from 10 to 30 per cent of molasses. These rations are being compared with a corn-and-tankage check ration. In one lot molasses beet pulp has been added. Water consumption is being measured to three lots. These lots receive the same ration, but the water is provided at three temperatures, 40°, 60°, and 80° F. Short-tailed Hampshire sheep. — In the fall of 1936 eight Hampshire yearling ewes were mated to their sire, U. of N. 350, a Hampshire ram born in 1933 with a tail about one-half normal length. The lambs from this mating should be born about February, 1937. This will be the first crop of inbred lambs sired by U. of N. 350. All his first-cross offspring had normal tails with the exception of one ewe lamb with a twisted, kinky tail. Corn and alfalfa hay rations for fattening lambs. — This is the second trial of a test in which eight groups of western feeder lambs were fed </seg>
            <seg id="p037">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station rations varying in amounts of corn and alfalfa hay. The daily gains for all the lots were in proportion to the daily intake of corn, regardless of a variation of one-fourth pound in the daily intake of alfalfa hay in some of the lots. The most rapid daily gain per lamb, 037 pound, was pro - duced in the lot self-fed corn and alfalfa hay mixed equal parts, but it was not produced with the greatest efficiency in the use of corn and alfalfa. The most efficient lot of lambs were hand-fed and limited to a maximum allowance of 15 pounds of corn and 15 pounds of alfalfa hay per lamb each day. They made a daily gain of 035 pound and required 42 pounds less corn and 74 pounds less alfalfa hay to produce 100 pounds of gain than the fastest-gaining lambs. The lot of lambs limited to a maximum ration of 15 pounds of corn and 125 pounds of alfalfa hay and making a daily gain of 031 pound were slightly more efficient in the use of their corn and alfalfa than the fastest-gaining lot of lambs. The results of the trial are in general agreement with the first trial. (Mimeo. Circular 328.) Dry-lot summer rations for native lambs. — Native lambs born the last of March, 1936, and weaned the last of June were divided into three groups to test three dry-lot summer rations for fattening native lambs. The feed - ing period was divided into Phase 1, from June 30 to August 29, when the three groups received different rations, and Phase 2, from August 29 to October 8, when the three groups of lambs received the same ration. Phase 1 covered a period of very hot weather. It is generally believed that corn alone during hot weather is an undesirable concentrate because it tends to "heat" the animals too much, thus causing them to make poor gains. The rations for this phase were: Lot 1, shelled corn, linseed meal, and alfalfa hay; Lot 2, shelled corn and oats equal parts, linseed meal, and alfalfa hay; and Lot 3, oats, linseed meal, and alfalfa hay. The lambs receiving the shelled-corn ration made the largest daily gain and were the most efficient in the use of their feed. The lot receiving corn and oats was second, and the oat-fed lambs were third in daily gain and feed utilization. During Phase 2 the three lots were self-fed cracked corn, lin - seed meal, and cut alfalfa hay. The lambs in Lot 1 continued to make the fastest gains and the most economical use of their feed. (Mimeo. Circular 332.) Farm flock performance. — The first report on this project was on a flock of aged western ewes. The second report deals with a flock of ewes raising their first crop of lambs. The ewes were sired by a Southdown ram and were dropped by the aged ewes making up the farm flock in the first report. They were bred back to Southdown rams, thus producing a crop of three-quarter-bred Southdown lambs in the spring of 1936. Data collected covering one year of production are available for comparison with the data collected on the flock of aged ewes maintained the previous year. In general the young flock of ewes were more efficient in the use of their feed. (Mimeo. Circular 331.)

The test is still in progress and will close about the first of April, 1937. A Nebraska farm sheep survey. — In the fall of 1935 a survey was made of farm flocks of sheep in Nebraska. Mailed questionnaires and a field representative were used to gather information on the size of flocks, lamb crop, prices paid for rams, lambing dates, market weight of lambs, amount of pasture land, drenching practices, feeding practices, lamb-management practices, size of farms, sheep losses from dogs, and other related subjects. In addition to this the criticisms of commission firms selling Nebraska native lambs are summarized. (Mimeo. Circular 330.) Injection of serum from a pregnant mare to induce earlier conception of ewes. — Serum was injected into purebred Hampshire, Shropshire, and Rambouillet ewes, and an equal number of ewes served as a check group. No differences in date of lambing were obtained. Further" trials will be made. PLANT DISEASES Pathological and physiological aspects of alfalfa and other crop failures in Nebraska. — The work on determination of wilt and cold resistance of alfalfa selections, ranging into the eighth selfed generation, together with a few varieties and strains, has been continued, and some increase in seed of some of the more promising alfalfas has been obtained. In addition some work has been done in a continuation of the study on heaving of soil as it freezes. Ice lenses of varying thickness have been produced, and their influence on roots remains to be determined. Considerable work has also been done on cold resistance of winter wheats (reported under Field Crops and Diseases) and some work on vernalization. The latter work has shown that vernalization is not a practical measure for Nebraska, since yields from activated seed wheat have proved lower than those from fall-seeded wheat. The work on cold resistance is in cooperation with the U. S. Department of Agriculture. Survey of the 1935 rust epidemic — From a state-wide study of the rust epidemic of 1935 it was concluded that the losses directly due to heat approximated those due to stem rust, if all the grain crops are considered, and that the severity of the epidemic was increased by a combination of factors that do not often combine favorably for the spread of the rust. A report of the survey has been published in the Crop Reporter of the Bureau of Plant Industry, U. S. D. A., by G. L. Peltier, M. Yount, and C. A. Suneson, Supplement 91, pp. 1-18, May, 1936.

The data collected during the past seven years on the occurrence of scab in the rotation plots at the Scottsbluff Substation have also been pub - lished by R. W. Goss in the American Potato Journal, 13:91-96, April, 1936, under the title "The Effect of Irrigated Crop Rotations upon Potato Scab." The data cover a study of the effects of the length of rotation and of the preceding crop, particularly beets and alfalfa, and of crops with and without manure, upon the development of scab and the yield of marketable potatoes. The study of soil factors in relation to scab and to the development of the causal organism has been discontinued and the results are being pre - pared for publication. Cooperation with other stations and the U. S. Department of Agriculture in the development of resistant varieties has been arranged, and at present some 250 different varieties, hybrids, inbreds, seedlings, and selections are being tested in the greenhouse. (See also under Fruits and Vegetables.) The bacterial blights of beans.— The testing and selecting of varieties and strains of beans tolerant of, or resistant to, common blight (Phyt. phaseoli) and halo blight {Phyt. medicaginis var. phaseolicola) has been continued in both the greenhouse and field. About ten promising selections have been made from about 9,000 plants inoculated during the past year, and hybridization is being tried in an effort to combine resistance with odier desirable characters. Potato disease survey and preliminary account of the disease known' among growers as "hay wire."— The annual report of the Nebraska Potato Improvement Association for 1936 contains an article by R. W. Goss entitled "A Review of the Disease Problems Confronting the Nebraska Grower of Certified Seed Potatoes." The author discusses date covering the years 1931 to 1935, which were obtained from the certification records of approximately 10,000 acres of potatoes entered annually for certification in western Nebraska. The report also contains a preliminary account of the occurrence and symptoms of the disease known among growers as hay wire." A few tests of the "hay wire" disease have shown that it can be transmitted by grafting and that it probably belongs in the virus group of diseases. A new disease of privet.— A pathogenic fungus has been isolated and morphological and pathological studies of the fungus arc being made. The disease has been discovered only recently in Nebraska. Tests of elms for resistance to Cephalosporium wilt.— The elms under investigation appear to be chance hybrids between the susceptible TJlmus americana and the resistant U. pumila. POULTRY Nutrient requirements for growing chicks and poults.— Work during the past year has dealt entirely with poults. In several standard rations for growing turkeys which have been developed at this station, the protein </seg>
            <seg id="p040">Fiftieth Annual Report supplements included were equal parts of meat scraps, fish meal, and dried buttermilk. The reduced supply of dried-milk by-products during the past three years has brought many inquiries for substitutes for this in - gredient. Several experiments with the same basal ration supplemented with the same number of protein units indicated that a combination of equal parts of meat scraps, fish meal, and soybean oil meal is very efficiently used by growing poults. This change in the standard rations has resulted in materially lower production costs for turkey growers. Bulletin 298, Protein Requirements for Finishing Turkeys, by F. E. Mussehl and C. W. Ackerson, April, 1936, 8 pages, contains reports of three tests designed to yield data on the best-adapted protein levels for the ration of turkeys from five months of age until marketing. The feeding periods were six weeks. A 16.2 per cent protein level for the entire ration was compared with 21.0 in the first test, and 14.5 with 183 in the last two. The lower levels proved as productive as the higher in each case, and much more economical. Additions of iron to a standard ration for growing turkeys. — Six lots, three of which contained 59 poults and three contained 64 poults, were fed a standard basal ration, the iron content of which was found to be 229 parts to a million, and in four of the lots additions to the iron content were introduced. The reduction in hemoglobin content of the lots receiv - ing iron and iron-copper additions cannot yet be satisfactorily explained. Notwithstanding that relatively large numbers of poults were used in each lot and that environmental factors were under excellent control, these experiments must be considered as only a beginning in the study of a very important problem. Effect of fineness of grinding on the palatability of poultry feedstuffs. — The whole ration for a flock of hens was prepared in a way to provide three finenesses, and these were placed before the hens so that palatabil - ity could be judged by the extent of consumption. In one instance the corn, oats, and alfalfa were ground through a one-eighth-inch screen and the other ingredients were included without any processing other than that ordinarily given them. In another instance the whole ration was ground through a one-sixteenth-inch screen, and in the third the whole ration was ground through a one-thirty-second-inch screen. A hammermill grinder was used. Consumption of the coarser feed was 270 pounds, compared with 175 and 115 for the finer feeds. Follow-up work with both chicks and a breeding flock will be done. Use of pigweed seed in a ration for chicks. — Ground seed of pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus) was substituted in a ration for chicks in place of soybean oil meal. The ration in which the substitution was made has in many trials been shown to have a high biological value. Analysis showed that the pigweed seed contained 15.3 per cent protein. As a protein supplement the seed was found to be equivalent to soy - bean oil meal, on an equal-protein basis, when used as in this ration in combination with meat scraps and fish meal. The trial showed that pig- </seg>
            <seg id="p041">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station weed seed to the extent of 20 per cent of the ration produced a good growth rate. Comparative value of rye, cooked rye, and wheat in poultry rations.— Three lots of 80 chicks each were fed ground rye, rye cooked two hours at 15 pounds of pressure and then dried and ground, and ground wheat, as a part of rations that were uniform in size of particle and also uniform in protein level. The test revealed that 20 per cent of rye in a chick ration is practical, and that there is no advantage obtained from cooking the rye. The ration containing the wheat produced slightly the best gains. The values of different qualities of alfalfa in a chick ration.— Three qualities of alfalfa— choice, No. 1, and No. 2— were used in lots of 145 chicks each, and the results indicate that only the best grades of alfalfa should be used under ordinary price conditions. RURAL ECONOMICS Farm organization and farm costs.— This project utilizes the farm account book for obtaining information upon the different systems of or - ganizing the farm business in the various areas of the state. The books are placed with farmers who are interested in the project, and at the close of the year the reports are summarized and returned to their owners. Summaries are made by counties and districts. Each cooperating farmer is able to compare his record with the average for all the farms in his county from which records for the year have been received, and with a selected group of the farms with the better incomes. For the year 1935 1,220 books were received. Some of the data obtained from the records since the beginning of the P™&gt; ect * re used in Preparation of a bulletin manuscript entitled 1 / 1 , ( r , , ect of the Slze of Farm u Pon Income." This will probably be published sometime during 1937. Cost of producing farm crops.— Many of the men who keep a farm record book keep also a cost-of-production record on one or more crops. They are a valuable aid in establishing the most profitable system of farm management for the individual farm. For the crop year 1935, 112 farmers completed cost-of-production records for wheat, 176 for corn, and 42 for potatoes. Cost of marketing corn and wheat in Nebraska.— Financial statements nave been obtained from cooperative elevators since 1920, twenty elevators have submitted annual statements every year since 1922, and other cle - 2T- f" bmmed st fements for a part of the years since 1920.

Tabulation of the data is about completed and pre - paration of a manuscript has been started. Farm mortgage foreclosures in Nebraska. — Complete data upon farm real estate transfers have been received from the following counties: Boone, Cass, Cuming, Dakota, Dawes, Frontier, Gage, Hamilton, Harlan, Lan - caster, and Valley. The data include the acres transferred, the considera - tion for each transfer, the type of deed given, and the terms of transfer — whether mortgage or cash. Particular attention is being paid to farm mortgage foreclosures. Tabulation of the data is well advanced. It is anticipated that work on a manuscript will be started as soon as the manuscript upon tax delinquencies is completed. Adjustments in fanning by regions and type-of-farming areas from the standpoint of adjustment and planning, including land conservation. — The thirteen type-of-farming areas in Nebraska have been studied in a general way. Station Bulletin 299, Factors Determining Type-oj-F arming Areas in Nebraska, by L. F. Garey, May, 1936, 32 pages, deals with the factors determining area boundaries and with such factors as soil, climate, economic conditions, and other influences, which make one type of farm - ing most profitable in one area of the state and another type in another area. Changes in crop and livestock production since 1910 are discussed and each of the thirteen areas in the state is described briefly. Economic and social effects on farms of a definitely designed program of soil conservation. — This project is cooperative with the Soil Conservation Service and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics of the United States Department of Agriculture. A farm business study has been made covering the soil demonstration areas in Boone and Otoe counties and the soil conservation camp in Gage county. Information was obtained on 159 farms in Boone, 80 farms in Otoe, and 105 farms in Gage county. Soil maps of each farm are to be provided by the Soil Conservation Service, from which it will be possible to study the relationship of certain soil features to income. Data are being tabulated, but no definite results from the study are available. Prices, volume o£ production, and purchasing power of farm products. — A manuscript is nearing completion which deals primarily with govern - mental efforts to fix the prices of coffee, rubber, and sodium nitrate. Prices received for commodities sold by farmers have been obtained by counties for the period from July, 1932, to date. The data are being averaged, so that an average price received by counties will be available monthly and yearly for the 25 commodities which constitute the source of the major part of the farm income in Nebraska. UTUJZATION OF LAND The two projects reported below are carried on in cooperation with the Land Use Planning section of the Resettlement Administration, as pro - vided for in a memorandum of understanding. </seg>
            <seg id="p043">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Revision of preliminary soil groupings (soil classification).— The pri - mary object of this project is to reconsider the preliminary groupings and to evaluate soils more carefully with respect to use and productivity. Soil surveys had previously been completed for all except eight sand-hill coun - ties and preliminary groupings of the soils as mapped in the field had been made on a basis of general productivity and use capabilities. Work is under way and will probably be complete for fourteen southeastern counties by the end of June. The general procedure is as follows: 1. Present land use and rotation by soil types are determined by sampling the various 1936 County Agricultural Conservation Association schedules and farm maps. 2. Soils as mapped in the county soil surveys are evaluated in terms of slope groups, erosion classes, and other conditions through a sampling of the farms mapped in detail by the Soil Conservation Service and from the physical inventories developed in connection with the areas selected for special study. 3. The productivity of each soil type and its respective conditions for the major crops are estimated, county by county, and the separate ratings are combined into a composite rating. 4. On the basis of these ratings and by comparison with state and national standards, the soils are regrouped. It was generally believed that at least the broader inherent differences in soil types were recognized by farmers in their crop rotations. Prelimin - ary sampling suggests that such differences are seldom recognized. Fuithcr - more, preliminary measurements and summarizations of soil types by slope groups and erosion classes for twenty or more farms per county suggest that such measurements may be safely extended to a county basis. With rotations, slope groups, erosion classes, and other conditions determined for the various soil types through such sampling, it will be possible to derive more significant soil ratings. Such ratings should prove very useful in all phases of land-use planning and in appraisal and assessment work. Detailed studies of soil, land classification, land use, and farm organiza - tion in selected areas.— This project involves detailed physical, economic, and social surveys with the objectives of defining proper and effective land use, determining the type and size of farm organization most likely to prove successful, and suggesting ways and means for bringing about the desired adjustments in selected areas. The usefulness of this type of approach has not yet been fully determined. The field work for one area of 36 square miles in Furnas county has been completed and the results are now being summarized and interpreted. A summary of the physical survey shows that 64 per cent of the farm land is crop land. With respect to the crop land, 71 per cent of it is well suited to arable farming. Continued cultivation of the remainder, or 19 per cent of the entire area, may be questioned from both the conserva - tion and economic viewpoint. A tendency was noted for the smaller farms not only to be less well suited to arable farming, but also to show a </seg>
            <seg id="p044">Fiftieth Annual Report relatively greater misuse of land. It is believed that the conclusions and interpretations derived from this area may be applied in a general way to a much wider area. STATE SERUM PLANT The extreme drouth and shortage of feed in 1936 resulted in the shipping of a great number of pigs out of the state, thus reducing the hog population below that of 1935. During the year only sporadic outbreaks of cholera occurred in the state, none of which showed a tendency to be - come epidemic. Demands for serum were reduced as a result of these con - ditions. The State Serum Plant experienced no difficulty in meeting demands for serum and virus and kept a moderate supply in storage for an emergency. The policy of buying the main supply of serum subject to retest and of manufacturing virus was continued. Serum retailed for 55 cents per hundred cubic centimeters throughout the year, and virus re - tailed at $1.50 per hundred cc. A report of the sales by months follows, together with the financial statement for the year ending January 1, 1937. Scrum and virus sold by months during the year 1936: Serum Virus cc. cc.

            <seg id="p045">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station NORTH PLATTE SUBSTATION No material change was made in the organization of the projects at the North Platte Substation during the past year. Much of the work is cooperative with the Division of Dry Land Agriculture, U. S. Department of Agriculture. Space was provided for two grass nurseries for the Soil Conservation Service and a project cooperative with the U. S. Department of Agriculture for the study of native and cultivated grasses under irriga - tion was begun. Weather conditions during the year were characterized by extremities of both heat and cold. Precipitation was about forty per cent below the average. Dry-land crops and tillage. — Progress was made in the laying out and reorganization of the areas of the plats and 'fields to be used for dry-land work. Dry-land crop work was relocated in 1934 because v of the transfer of land to the Platte Valley Power and Irrigation district. The new land was uniformly cropped in 1935. A major change in the reorganization of the work was the inclusion of a much larger proportion of grass than was previously planned for. Of the 390 plats, 128 are in rotations that are related to the utilization of grasses. One series of 36 plats was seeded to grass in 1936 and four plats each year will be broken up during the next nine years in order to determine the effects of the persistence of the sod. In another series of 36 plats, four will be seeded each year for nine years and all will be broken up at one time to determine the effects of age on the quality of sod. Crop varieties. — Cheyenne led the winter wheats with a yield of 17.1 bushels. Other leaders were Ceres spring wheat, Club Mariot barley, and Brunker oats. Early Kalo was again the high producing grain sorghum. All corn yields were too nearly complete failures to be used for varietal comparisons. Bulletin 297 (North Platte Series No. 38), Grain and Forage Sorghum Varieties at the North Platte Substation, by L. L. Zook, March, 1936, 12 pages, reports results from tests of twenty varieties of grain and forage sor - ghums during periods of varying length since 1924. The varieties are described briefly and their strong and weak points are mentioned. Black Amber gave the highest yield of forage in 1936. During the same year 26,000 pounds of seed of Early Kalo, high-yielding grain sorghum, were produced for distribution. Pump irrigation. — During the season of 1936 the total irrigation costs per crop unit were 3.6- cents per bushel of potatoes, $331 per ton of alfalfa, 58.5 cents per ton of corn silage, and 58.5 cents per ton of sorgo silage. Yields were: potatoes 400 bushels, alfalfa 5 tons, corn silage 8.9 tons, and sorgo silage 103 tons per acre under irrigation. In June, 1936, Bulletin 301 (North Platte Series No. 39), Pump Irri - gation at the North Platte Substation, by Harry E. Weakly, 12 pages, was published. Previous reports on pump irrigation were made in 1928 and 1932 and the new bulletin contains annual and average records for the </seg>
            <seg id="p046">Fiftieth Annual Report years 1925-35. The tables show comparison of yields on irrigated and un - irrigated land, increase in yield from irrigation, and costs of increased yields. Feeding steers on native grass and alfalfa pasture. — The results obtained were similar to those of previous years. Steers fed on alfalfa pasture com - pared favorably both in rate and economy of gain with similar steers fed either on native-grass pasture or in dry lot. Barley feeding experiment. — Five lots of steers, wintered on silage, alfalfa, and different protein supplements, were full-fed for 196 days on alfalfa hay and the following grain rations: ground No. 2 corn, ground No. 4 barley, a mixture of % ground corn and % ground barley, a mix - ture of Vi ground corn and % ground barley, and a mixture of l /j each of ground corn, ground rye, and ground barley. These rations all proved satisfactory. From the results of this one test, the mixture of ground corn, barley, and rye was approximately equal to the ration of ground corn. The ration of ground barley produced 0.25 pound per head per day lower gains than the ration of ground corn and required approximately 11 per cent more grain and 20 per cent more alfalfa per unit of gain. The mixtures of corn and barley ranked between the rations of corn and barley in rate and economy of gain secured. All lots sold at the same price. Wintering steer calves. — For steer calves alfalfa hay and silage proved superior to alfalfa hay alone and the addition of one-third pound of cotton - seed meal per head daily to a ration of alfalfa and silage resulted in more rapid and more economical gains. Rations of silage full-fed, sup - plemented with one pound of either cottonseed meal, linseed meal, solvent - process soybean oil meal, expeller-process soybean oil meal, or 0.67 pound of either digester or dry-rendered tankage produced satisfactory and economical gains. Soybean oil meal, fish meal, and Wheatland Milo for fattening hogs. — Mixtures of tankage and either expeller or solvent-process soybean oil meal proved as efficient as tankage as a protein supplement fed with shelled corn to fattening hogs. At least in dry lot, both types of soybean oil meal are deficient in mineral matter when fed as the sole protein sup - plement and the solvent-process meal was unsatisfactory also because of lack of palatability. As one-fourth of a supplemental mixture containing soybean oil meal, fish meal was approximately equal to 60 per cent digester tankage when fed with shelled corn to fattening hogs. Wheatland Milo was more palatable than shelled corn and produced slightly more rapid gains. Approximately 12 Vi per cent more feed was required per unit of gain by the pigs fed ground milo than by pigs fed shelled corn. Gains with whole milo were as rapid as those with shelled corn. They were slightly lower than gains made by pigs fed ground milo, and in addition required approximately 13 per cent more grain per unit of gain. </seg>
            <seg id="p047">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Pasturing dairy herd on alfalfa.— For the third year, the Holstein dairy herd was grazed on alfalfa pasture with satisfactory results. The herd was maintained on the same basis as in former years. Forestry and horticulture.— Bench-land trees and shrubs survived the hot, dry summer with comparatively little loss. An exception was the 50-to-60-year-old cottonwoods that were a feature of the Substation grounds. Age and maturity were doubtless contributing causes. Of the larger trees 23 were removed and milled, producing 4,800 board feet of dimension lumber, and a large quantity of firewood. Devastating losses occurred in the hillside and canyon plantings of evergreens. These plantings had been moderately successful over a period of about ten years, previous to the 1934 and 1936 drouths. In various locations the losses are now complete. Red cedar and western yellow pines are outstandingly superior in survival to other species used The old orchard, injured by hail in 1932 and further by recent drouth years, is in poor condition, and a small amount of poor-quality fruit was produced. The orchard planted in 1935 made good growth. Good seedline stocks of Cotoneaster, selected Chinese elm, and small lots of conifers and perennials are on hand for trial and replacements. SCOTTSBLUFF SUBSTATION Work at this station is carried on in cooperation with the Division of Western Irrigation of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. The project on crop rotations is the most extensive work done. Work is also done with vegetable crops and with lambs and dairy cattle. Variety tests, manure experiments, and breeding work with sugar beets is carried on here by the Bureau of Plant Industry, Division of Sugar Plants, U.

            <seg id="p048">Fiftieth Annual Report Crops include alfalfa, potatoes, sugar beets, beans, corn, oats, spring wheat, winter wheat, and sweet clover. In the older rotations manure has exerted the greater influence on sugar beets while alfalfa has produced a greater response in the oat and potato crops. The differences between yields from the short untreated rota - tions and the untreated continuous cropping have not been significant. During 1936 the yields of potatoes and small grains were severely affected by shortage of water and high temperatures. Apparently the adverse climatic conditions affected the yields of small grains and potatoes much less in the plots treated with manure and alfalfa than in the un - treated rotations. Manure was apparently responsible for an increase of 22.8 bushels of potatoes per acre, 7.6 tons of sugar beets per acre, and 8.6 bushels of oats, and alfalfa increased the yield of potatoes 47.2 bushels, sugar beets 6.1 tons, oats 7.0 bushels, corn 3.2 bushels, and wheat 9.4 bushels. Manure and alfalfa together increased potatoes 44.7 bushels, beets 9.9 tons, and oats 4.0 bushels. The 19-year average influence of manure has been almost four times as great for- potatoes as the influence in 1936, about the same for sugar beets, and over twice as great for oats. As a 19-year average alfalfa has increased the yield of corn 23.6 bushels, wheat 9.9 bushels; and alfalfa and manure together have increased the yield of potatoes 135.4 bushels, beets 8.0 tons, and oats 32.7 bushels per acre. The use of hogs in pasturing the third-year alfalfa plat and the corn plat in one of the rotations begun in 1912 and the use of pastured sweet clover in one of the rotations begun in 1920 have proved successful both as a means of improving crops and maintaining livestock. In the ten sweet - clover rotations begun in 1926 sweet clover has not proved highly prac - tical as a green-manure crop for sugar beets, but the opposite has been true for potatoes. As a pasture crop the sweet clover in these rotations has yielded large returns. Immediate and residual effects of different quantities of manure in producing sugar beets. — A series in which the total amount of farm manure applied during five years was the same (30 tons), but where the time and amount varied from an initial application of 30 tons to five treat - ments of 6 tons each, the differences in yields of beets were not significant. In another series where the treatment ranged from five 6-ton to five 30-ton treatments, or total for the five years of 30 to 150 tons per acre, there has been a consistent tendency for yields to increase as the manure applied has been increased, but at the same time the value per ton of the manure has decreased. Beet yields indicate that applications greater than 12 tons per acre annually are impractical for a period of five years or more under continuous cropping with sugar beets. In addition, the percentage of sugar has declined with the increase of manure. It is apparent that the residual effects of large applications of manure may be best realized by proper cropping in future years. </seg>
            <seg id="p049">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station Variety tests of oats, corn, hybrid corn, and Jerusalem artichoke. — Severe weather and lack of sufficient irrigation water seriously impaired these tests. Nebraska 21 produced 40.6 bushels per acre, the highest yield of oats. Seven of the nine corn hybrids produced higher yields than the standard eastern-Nebraska variety, Krug. The four highest-yielding hybrids were: No. 238, 43.6 bushels; Iowa 939, 42.4; Funk 220, 38.9; and Nebraska 252, 37.7 bushels per acre. The improved French White variety of Jerusalem artichoke yielded at the rate of 4.4 tons per acre. The lowest-yielding artichoke variety yielded 1.1 tons per acre. Lamb-feeding experiment. — Three hundred lambs were started on test in November, 1936, and were divided into 10 lots. The main purposes are to determine the value of corn fodder and corn stover, soybean meal and cottonseed cake, cull beans, cane molasses and Jamestown beet molasses (after the barium treatment has been applied), need of high-protein feeds with good alfalfa and beet tops, and possibility of feeding a ration consist - ing entirely of beet by-products. The work will be continued three years. Dairy work. — The dairy herd has been increased and improved recently and at present a feed trial is being run on two lots of cows for the pur - pose of comparing beet tops and alfalfa. Vegetable variety tests. — Tests have been under way on varieties of almost thirty common vegetables during the past six years. The results of these tests were published as Bulletin 300, Vegetable Variety Tests at the Scottsbluff Substation, by Lionel Harris, June, 1936, 28 pages. Annual and average yields are tabulated for beans, cabbage, cauliflower, sweet corn, eggplant, peppers, onions, peas, spinach, and tomatoes. Work on date of planting has been done during the past year. VALENTINE SUBSTATION Work at this substation has continued much as in previous years. Severe drouth reduced crop yields. Field crops. — Variety tests have been continued on the hard land north of the station. No winter wheat or rye was harvested in 1936. The soil was so dry during the fall of 1934 that the seed did not germinate. This makes four successive crop failures for winter wheat. Spring grains were damaged by rust. The yield of Marquis was 3.8 bushels, which was almost 5 bushels under Kearney and 3.5 bushels under Ceres. Trebi for the first time was the high-yielding variety of barley, making 162 bushels per acre. Oat varieties averaged 245 bushels per acre, with Burt 11 the highest. Sorghum crops. — Twenty varieties of grain and forage sorghums were seeded at the station and to the north on the hard land. On the hard land Amber, Orange, and Early Sumac averaged over three tons per acre. Greeley, Early Kalo, and Sooner matured considerable seed. Beef cattle. — Three lots of calves have been wintered on prairie hay with tankage, soybean meal, and cottonseed cake as supplements. A sec- </seg>
            <seg id="p050">Fiftieth Annual Report ond phase o£ the test will be carried out to determine what effect the winter supplement may have upon summer gain. The project dealing with the effect of winter rations on the development of breeding heifers and the subsequent effect of winter ration on the per - centage of calf crop, birth, and weaning weight of calf has progressed to the weaning time. The heifers wintered on prairie hay plus one pound daily of cottonseed cake during each of the winters showed a net gain of 40 pounds more than heifers fed cake during the first winter only, and 110 pounds more than those fed cake only during the second winter. A fourth lot of heifers was wintered on a summer-grazed range with cake and what hay they would clean up. While their net gain was only two pounds more per head than that of heifers wintered in a small corral, their calves weighed 11.6 pounds more at weaning time and less breeding trouble was encountered. There was no appreciable difference in the birth weight of the calves from the four lots. For heifers that calve as two-year-olds, the results show that greater return resulted from feeding the supplement the first winter and not the second, because those fed cake during the first winter were 70 pounds heavier at weaning time than those fed cake during the sec - ond winter. However, their calves were 30 pounds lighter than those from heifers which received the supplement the second winter. Dairy. — The project with general-purpose cattle which was started this year has made but little progress because of breeding troubles and mas - titis. Four of the Red Polled cows have completed a year's lactation with fat records of 235 and 328.5 pounds. Several of the milking Shorthorn cows give promise of reaching 300 pounds. Poultry. — A flock-testing project with turkeys was begun to demon - strate the approximate extent and influence of differences in flocks. One hundred eggs from each of eight flocks were incubated together and the poults raised together. At 25 weeks the turkeys were dressed, graded, and weighed, and the length of breast was measured. The poults from the various flocks were identified by markings and are referred to below as lots. Considerable variation has existed throughout the project. The fertility of lots varied from 80 to 95 per cent. In hatchability the lots varied from 31 to 69 per cent and the percentage raised ranged from 42.6 to 93. Within lots the birds grading prime averaged heavier than those grad - ing choice. However, -at 25 weeks of age the percentages of prime birds were greater in the lighter-weight lots. Between lots there were 20 points of difference in the percentage of prime birds. While there appeared to be a direct correlation between average weight of bird and the length of breast by lot, there was a wide individual varia - tion. The toms in five of the lots averaged 7 inches in length of breast. The hens averaged from one-half to one inch shorter than the toms. Meadow project. — Clovers seeded on sub-irrigated meadow did not survive the drouth. The water level in the subsoil dropped in many valleys </seg>
            <seg id="p051">Nebraska Agricultural Experiment Station to the low level of 1934, resulting in the loss of some stands obtained in the spring of 1935. Shelter belt. — A new planting of seedling trees was made to replace the 22-year-old planting, in which only about 10 per cent of the trees have survived the drouth. BOX BUTTE EXPERIMENTAL FARM At the Box Butte Experimental Farm, located near Alliance, four types of investigations are under way: (1) field crops, (2) potatoes, (3) soils, and (4) plant diseases. These are under the direction of members of the tech - nical staff at Lincoln. In addition various rotations are being studied in relation to yields, soil moisture, fertility, and disease — and this is the only dry-land experiment station where these four phases are being studied in one experiment. Besides serving as an experiment station the farm pro - vides, foundation seed stock for potato growers of western Nebraska and also a place for testing and increase of adapted grains. From these latter activities a large portion of the funds necessary to run the farm is derived. In a test to obtain comparative figures on spring and winter wheat, the three best varieties of spring wheat have yielded 14.8 and the three best winter wheats 14.0 bushels per acre, during three years in which crops have been successful. Komar and Ceres have proved the best varieties of spring wheat, and Thatcher, which proved resistant to rust in 1935, will be tested further. Two new Turkey selections of winter wheat (C. I. 10016 and 10015), which during three years have averaged 14.1 bushels in yield and proved resistant to stinking smut, merit consideration for cer - tification. Cheyenne has proved well adapted to northwestern Nebraska. Spartan barley, which has proved superior, is now available commercially. Four Dawes county varieties of corn in 1935 yielded an average of 22.3 bushels per acre and excelled other local varieties in 1935, and also varieties from other areas. Kalo, the best grain sorghum, yielded 15.8 bushels, Cayuga soybeans 7 bushels, and safflower 462 pounds per acre in the same year. Probably 80 per cent of the Triumph potatoes now being certified in western Nebraska are grown from stock that was once on the Box Butte Experimental Farm, and the farm is used for the testing of new lines of potatoes as they are being developed in a nation-wide breeding program. The rotation experiments have already shown that potatoes should not follow small grain but should rather follow corn or beans, which take less moisture from the soil, and that summer fallow yields the best results over a period of years. Sweet clover has been found entirely impractical. The experiments on the various phases of the raising of potatoes, including such problems as time and depth of planting, cultural practices, storage, and other matters, have been in progress during the past several years. Some are not yet complete and others have been completed. The study of plant diseases has been largely confined to the potato crop. The following lines have been undertaken, with special attention </seg>
            <seg id="p052">Fiftieth Annual Report to scab, rhizoctonia, and fusarium wilt: (1) comparative study of seed treatments, (2) effect of time of planting and various cultural practices, (3) chemical treatments of the soil, (4) effect of crops preceding potatoes, (5) soil factors that influence the presence of the, disease-producing organ - isms, and (6) the testing of new varieties for resistance to these diseases. The windbreak plantings supply opportunity for study of methods of planting and caring for trees in the dry-land areas. Many new varieties of trees and shrubs are being tried and some appear promising. The fed - eral horticultural station at Cheyenne, Wyoming, uses the farm for test - ing ornamental trees and shrubs imported from remote places. ADDITIONAL LAND, BUILDINGS, AND EQUIPMENT During the year two modern greenhouses were erected, each 28 x 100 feet, under glass, with proper head house facilities, the approximate cost being $19,890.00. The greenhouse space was assigned to crops and soils and to take care of certain lines of investigation cooperative with the United States Department of Agriculture. . At the hog unit of the Havelock farms, a utility barn costing approxi - mately $1,200 was erected. This will take care of the housing of the team assigned to this unit and afford room for feeds, mixing, and storage. PUBLICATIONS OF THE STATION— 1888-1936 A complete list of the publications of the Nebraska Agricultural Experi - ment Station has not been published since 1923, when such a list was included in the Thirty-sixth Annual Report. The present list of Station bulletins and circulars is almost twice as long as that one was, and it has been felt necessary to omit the press bulletins and circulars, which were listed then, because those two series were discontinued many years ago. Extension circulars and bulletins have also been omitted. An attempt has been made to maintain a reserve supply of Station publications, since for the most part these contain original reports of in - vestigative results. Among the following bulletins and circulars only about a hundred are available for general distribution, and these are publications that have been issued recently. The reserve supplies that have been main - tained are available to libraries and technical workers; reserve supplies of numerous earlier bulletins are now practically exhausted. BULLETINS 1.
