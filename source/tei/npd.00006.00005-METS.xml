January 17. Meeting called to order by Mr. John Skinner, and the roll called by the Secretary, Mr. E. A. Pegler. Mb. Skixneb : As the President of our association is not here, I will state that presiding at a meeting is altogether out of my line of business. I would consider it a favor if some one would move the suspension of the rules, and Dr. Gaiser be called to fill the chair. If nothing can be done, I will do the best I know how. I understand Mr. Havens has sickness in his family which keeps him away. On account of his absence the President's address will be omitted. The next paper on our program is "My Observations on the Poultry Industry in Old Mexico," by Mr. E. P. Mickel, but as Dr. Peters, who has a paper for us to-morrow evening, can not be here then and wishes to deliver his address this even - ing, in exchange with Mr. Mickel, we have consented to make the exchange, and we will now listen to Dr. Peters on </seg>
            <seg id="p007">6 PBOCBEDINGS OF THE « DISEASES OF POULTRY. Mr. President, Ladies, and Gentlemen: I indeed feel flattered to be placed on the program to talk to this honorable body, as I am very much interested in the industry that you gentlemen either pursue as a fancy or for commercial interests, and, looking at it as a business proposi - tion or as that of a fancier, the diseases of these little crea - tures cuts a great deal of figure in raising good stock; and especially, as has been stated before, for commercial inter - ests it is very essential to be acquainted with the diseases which poultry are heirs to. As an introduction I may say that to successfully avoid diseases among poultry there are about seven points that are essential and ought to be followed to the very letter. The first is, that war should be waged on vermin continually; second, that good food is given at all times. By this we mean that no sour food is allowed in the premises for any length of time ; third, that water be very carefully kept pure and in clean vessels; fourth, that you have coarse lime, grit or gravel, charcoal, and the like always before the animals; fifth, that all houses are cleaned with disinfectants at least once per week; sixth, that all fowl houses have perfectly tight roofs and are devoid of drafts; and seventh, that food is not allowed to decay in the houses or in the yard. With these rules laid down it is more than probable that a great many diseases can be avoided. Disinfection is one of the most essential things to be studied and considered. By thoroughly disinfecting the premises and knowing what is meant by this we can avoid diseases to a great extent, and if the diseases are on the premises they may be much sooner eradicated. The fowl </seg>
            <seg id="p008">7 jV coSA SKA STATE PO IJ LTft x A^yM^i A r | T^Op^ house should be thoroughly cleansed with hot water to which carbolic acid is added and a solution of chlorid of lime, that is, one pound of chlorid of lime added to the whitewash is spread on the walls and on the roof. The runs and the vessels should be thoroughly washed out with carbolic acid once a week so that they are not allowed to become sour, and during the summer months, when soft food is adminis - tered, I should judge it would be necessary to do this at least twice a week: The drinking vessels should likewise be cleansed as often as possible, and in the drinking water a weak solution of permanganate of potash should be added. Have a 3 per cent solution made at your drug store and add this to the drinking water until it is slightly purple in color. This is as good a stimulator as can be used. Fleas. — Fleas are a very troublesome pest to the poultry fancier for they are the ones which keep the animals awake at night and no doubt are the accessory cause of diseases among fowls. They are found in the crevices of the perch and in the cracks behind the paper in the fowl houses and will annoy the fowls at night, and if this keeps up for any length of time the fowls become very weak, and stop laying, and sh"w general signs of unthriftiness. The same is true of lice. Lice generate very rapidly, and it is estimated by one writer that in one week they generate about 125,000, and that they cause a very heavy loss. For these two pests it would suffice to anoint the premises with some cheap oil, for these vermin are so constructed that they breathe merely through pores, and this oil will stop up the pores and in that way suffocate them ; but as an additional precaution whitewash is used, one pound of chlorid of lime to four gal - lons of water. This administered to the perch and fowl house in general will not only destroy these but will destroy </seg>
            <seg id="p009">8 8 PROCEEDINGS OF THE the mites and ticks, for it is known that it is very much easier to eradicate the flock of the two former than it is of the two latter, for these have air sacks and must be destroyed through fumes; and we have found the best remedy for this mite, for it is a sucking parasite — the others are not, is chlorid of lime injected into the hidden places which will kill them, and if they are on the fowl kerosene emulsion should be used. One pound of soap and two gallons of water are boiled, and to this you add one-fourth pint of kerosene. After the soap has been thoroughly boiled in the water, remove it from the fire, and add the kerosene, and mix the oil thoroughly in the soapy solution, and be very careful that the oil does not float on top or you will meet with disastrous results. This has been found very effective for the mites and ticks. Mange. — This disease affects the feathers only and part of the legs. The parasite that causes this disease does not pro - duce any itching, but just eats the feathers at the base and leaves a bare spot, and it also produces a limy mass on the legs of poultry. This can easily be avoided by dipping the fowls in kerosene emulsion. If only the limbs are affected anoint the same with some oil and loosen the crusts. Gape Worm. — The gape worm is not very common in this state. It is a parasite, a very small thread worm, which ad - heres to the mucous membrane of the windpipe. The fowls which it affects become exhausted in a very short time, be - cause these worms multiply very rapidly, and in a very short space of time they have stopped the air passage of the wind - pipe, and the fowl walks around the yard with its mouth open, gaping for breath. The remedy for this is to take a quill of a feather, dip it into turpentine, and insert it down the throat into the windpipe, making a few turns and ex- </seg>
            <seg id="p010">9 pelling the worms. Care should be taken that these worms are all gathered up and burned, as, should they be allowed to drop on the floor or the ground, other fowls are likely t&lt;&gt; take them up, and in that way become affected also. It has of late been asserted that the earth-worm is the cause of this trouble. For further details on this subject I would re - fer the readers to Bulletins 70 and 74 issued by the Ken - tucky Experiment Station, Lexington. Moulting. — During the moulting time the fancier seems to have the greatest loss, for at that time there seems to be the greatest disturbance among the flock. You will find that at this time the causes are poor roosting and sleeping places, hens filled with lice and not receiving the proper care. If there is any time during the year when they need care it is this period, and if you provide proper places for them and supply them with proper food a great many diseases will be avoided. It is well during this period to feed with various kinds of food. Supply them varieties, such as an onion occasionally chopped in the food. Administer small quanti - ties of raw meat or cooked meat, and it is well to give them in the drinking water the well-known Douglass Mixture. As a tonic use one which is composed of one ounce of sulphuric acid and one-half pint sulphate of iron in two gallons of water. This solution is very beneficial as a tonic for the fowl, especially during this time. Bumble Foot. — This is a disease that exists to some ex - tent in the state; however it is nothing that spreads very rapidly, and it is considered a purely local disease. It is mostly found among the heavier breeds. It has been sup - posed that bumble foot was caused by having the roofs too high from the ground and that the roosts were not round. However, these theories have been vigorously attacked, and </seg>
            <seg id="p011">10 PfiOCEEM THE it is now known that bumble foot can be seen in fowls that are not allowed to roost, and therefore must come from a bruise received in the yard, such as stepping on a stone or something sharp. This yields to treatment if the calcareous matter is removed and a bandage applied. Kickets. — This is a disease that is caused by the fowls not having enough of mineral matter in the bones, such as sul - phate of iron, and appears mostly in flocks that are not fed a balanced ration, and such food should be used as will, when digested properly, form the bone material. Food composed of lime, such as oyster shells, should be used. Constipation. — Constipation arises from various causes, such as improper food, high fever, and the like. The remedy for this is caster oil in small doses, calomel, half to two grains mixed with a little butter and made into a pill, glauber salts in small doses, and epsom salts. Soue-Head. — Sore-head has litn'n quite prevalent in this state of late years. The direct cause of sore-head is as yet a iny.steBy. It has been found that it exists in various condi - tions. Lately the North Carolina Experiment Station drew attention to the fact that it probably was a southern dis - ease. This I do not know. They also made the statement that it was probably due to impurities of the blood, that the blood was either too rich or of a sluggish nature. We would be inclined to think that this is the case, for sore-head has yielded readily to treatment. We have had the best result by applying alum water. Zenoleum has been very effectual in the treatment of this disease. We have also been success - ful with carbolixed vaseline and thioform applied to the same. The North Carolina Station Bulletin gives the full report and says it yields to the treatment of pine tar, blue stone, carbolized vaseline, iodin, and axle grease. The fowls </seg>
            <seg id="p012">11 NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION under our care and treatment were considered cured from five "to nine days with the chemicals named. Alum water seemed to be the better one to use, but we give these medi - cines simply to show that when the crusts are removed and either of the chemicals applied, of which one surely ought to be on the premises, you can save the fowl, and we would ail - vise you in addition to add a little sulphur in the food dur - ing the time of treatment, which we have found very mater - ially adds to the recovery. Diarrhoea. — Diarrhoea may be produced by over-feeding, bad food, filth, poisons, and by being allowed to eat certain weeds. In the first stages it is advisable always to give a physic, either sweet oil (and add to the same a small amount of linseed meal), or use this decoction: calomel from one - half to two grains, opium from five to ten drops, or thioform from one-half to two grains; but in this disease it is also well to note the cause, and if it come from bad food, decayed food allowed to be around, or vessels that are in poor con - dition, dirty, etc., they must be immediately cleaned. Roup. — This disease has attracted a great deal of atten - tion. It is a disease that is very troublesome alid seems to be contagious. The sick ones should be removed from the well, and as a rule one must investigate the cause. It may be caused from the introduction of another affected fowl, or it may be caused by the animal contracting a cold, for very often the fowl houses are not made tight and there is a draft, and the fowls, contract a cold in that way very easily. It is claimed that overcrowding produces roup, but even if overcrowding produces it, it does not more so than colds, be - cause overcrowded houses would certainly cause colds as well as drafts would. The department has for the last year made an antitoxic serum which we inject on the comb of • </seg>
            <seg id="p013">12 PROCEEDINGS OF THE the fowl or in the skin under the wing. The treatment con - sists of the using of antitoxin the same as we do in human beings for diphtheria, that is, thoroughly swabbing of the throat and nasal passages with a solution of boric acid, keep - ing the fowls in a warm and comfortable place, and inside of ten days they should recover. Fowl Cholera. — This is a disease that is very difficult to distinguish, for we have so many that are similar to fowl cholera, and it is for this reason that all these various types are classified as one under the name of chicken cholera. Dr. Salmon of the Bureau of Animal Industry was the first man to discover the germ of this disease, and he made very suc - cessful experiments in this line. Vaccination against this disease has been practised but has not been found successful. This department practised vaccination in various ways since 1894. In 1896 we experimented with a vaccine made in this manner: the animals were vaccinated with a virulent cul - ture, and when these animals were immunised they were killed and the blood carefully collected in sterilized vessels. Sterilized blotting paper was then saturated with this blood and allowed 4o dry in the air. This vaccine was then ready for use, and the application was as follows : with a small in - oculating needle the skin under the wing was pricked, and a small piece of blotting paper was moistened with water that had previously been boiled and allowed to cool. From this blotting paper we took particles of blood, and this was inserted under the skin or was introduced in the comb of the animal. Mr. W. H. Griffith, of Zanesville, Ohio, states that he has vaccinated with this vaccine about two thousand animals and has been very successful. We have been very successful here with our laboratory experiments, and our vaccinated animals never died, but chicks would die if inoc- </seg>
            <seg id="p014">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION 13 ulated with cultures. We have vaccinated only a limited amount over the state, but expect to do more in this line in the near future, but where we have vaccinated we have had excellent success. This vaccine can be secured free of charge by addressing the University Experiment Station, Geo. E. MacLean, Director. I have now given you the description of diseases of poultry that have come under our notice of late years. Any ques - tions that may be asked will be cheerfully answered. DISCUSSION Following paper by Dr. 'A. Peters. Dr. Peters : Now, if you have any questions you wish to ask, I will be pleased to answer them. Db. Gaiskr: Q. How long, Doctor, is this vaccine sup - posed to hold good? A. Once is all that is necessary, provided you vaccinate after they are three or four months old. That is about the time I vaccinate, or even younger. If you vaccinate when they are very small, I would advise you to re-vaccinate when they are six or seven months old. Q. I have a very valuable fowl that has a cankered throat. While it lives and is a little better, it is not a well and per - fectly healthy bird. Db. Peters : If you could bring the bird to the laboratory I would treat it for you. I could send you some antitoxin. I would advise you to get the antitoxin and inject it under the wing. I think it would relieve it in a little while. The more you treat it with caustic, the faster the canker will grow. You should not scrape it, for the more you scrape it the more it will grow. The antitoxin should be used under the wing or on the comb. </seg>
            <seg id="p015">14 PROCEEDINGS OF THE Q. Speaking about sore-head, about the worst case I ever had was in the shape of a canker, where the side was en - tirely gone. I tried about everything I could to cure it, but I could not do so.. Finally the bird became blind, and the disease broke out in one of its feet. Db. Peters: That is substantially as I said, that we be - lieve it is impurities of the blood. It breaks out in any part of the body. I have had it break out under the wing or on the side of the body. Q. In such a case, I suppose, about the best thing you could do would be to kill the bird? Dr. Peters : O, no ; with a little sulphur you can fix the head in a few weeks. Q. In regard to canker in the throat I have an old bird which has been bothered for some time. Dr. Peters : The larger per cent of cases of canker of the throat would bother you. The more you use caustic, the worse it is. If I use antitoxin it cures it better. It would surprise you to learn how quickly it drops off like scales. Q. Do you believe that roup is caused altogether. from cold houses, drafts, or anything of that sort? A. I didn't believe it the last time I talked to you, but I do now. Q. I have some respect for your knowledge and experience, but some of us who raise chickens, and give you fellows at the Experiment Station pointers, differ from you. I have found that fowls that have been overfed and gotten out of condition will take cold much easier than those that have been otherwise cared for. A great many farmers' chickens roost on trees right out doors. As far as they are concerned, however, they would not take cold as soon if they were in good condition. </seg>
            <seg id="p016">15 NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION Db. Peters: I believe that you are right in certain things, but I would rather not have chickens raised that way, and not housed unless they could be housed properly. Suppose they roost high and then overhead there was a draft; that would not do. Those out in the trees will acclimate them - selves to the condition. I have a fine driving horse. He can not stand having a draft on him without a blanket. If a farmer wants to take care of his chickens he must have a good house or none at all, for otherwise they are bound to take cold. Whether it is roup, diphtheria, or whatever it is, it takes the chickens off and reduces the profits. I don't want any one here to think I am talking these chicken dis - eases from my own little laboratory, but I am talking it from the experience gained from making 60 per cent of all the institutes that have been held over the state. Whenever I go to these institutes I hear the people complain, and if I have time I. go out to their chickeu houses, and I see just what is wrong. I don't want you to think I am making the experiments entirely at the Experiment Station, but I go over the state where I meet the people. Dr. Gaiser: Q. I think overfeeding and overcrowding cause very much more trouble than the other things. Dr. Peters: I say to you that when your chickens have a bad draft, they can not stand it. Dr. Gaiser: I would rather have all the windows open and have a draft on them than to have them closed up and have them overcrowded and overheated. Dr. Peters: I don't know that I would be in position to recommend that. I would not have too many chickens in one house; and I would try not to have too many on the roost. If you overcrowd your chickens, then when they come out in the morning they are very warm. They are bound to </seg>
            <seg id="p017">16 PROCEEDINGS OF THE take cold. You should keep in their house just about a cer - tain number, and keep the house at a certain temperature; and if you do that and avoid drafts, I do not see why you should be troubled with tour. De. Gaiseb : The average farmer and poultry-raiser has not enough house room for the number of chickens he raises. Dr. Peters: If a business man wants to go into the chicken business, or any one, to make money, he must put his hens in a warm place or he will not make any money. On that score we have to advise them. If he wants to go into the business of raising so many of them each year, as a great many farmers are doing, and making a living from their eggs by taking them to the market, he must provide a warm place for his fowls. We advise them to give the fowls room, and in the next place not to have any draft, and not to over - crowd them. Mb. Weht: I would like to state that bumble foot is not caused from high roosting, I think. I am troubled with it among my fowls. I believe it is caused by bruises otherwise received, and it does not come from high roosting. Dr. Peters : I would not want to state that bumble foot is caused expressly from high roosting. I was led to make the statement from what I saw at two yards, one at Ord and the other at Arcadia, where the heavy birds were roosting up high. I saw them get down. I believe 80 per cent of this flock was troubled with bumble foot, and I could not help thinking that that was what caused it. Mr. Skinner : Next on our program we will have a little talk from Mr. L. P. Harris, on </seg>
            <seg id="p018">* NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION 17 HOW MANY BIRDS SHAI^L WE KEEP AND HOW HANDLE THEM FOR PROFIT? A poultry-fancier is an artist in his line, with an eye for the beautiful, an eye for forms and for color as well. He should be a student and lover of nature. He must be an enthusiast, a specialist devoted to one breed — one variety He must breed poultry because he loves his birds. The ar tistic dressmaker takes no more pains or pride in the fit or finish of the robe she turns out of her shop than the fancier does in the perfection of every feather in the plumage o his pets. The show room is where we make the fancier. It is where the germ must be conceived and fostered ; there is where the enthusiasm first starts. There it is that the prospective fan - cier decides between the different varieties; there the smouldering spark of enthusiasm is fanned into a flame or snuffed out forever. The show interests him for or against the industry. There he settles in his mind whether he will select the common market scrub and follow in the footprints of his ancestors or whether he will take the icell-bred supe - rior thoroughbred, and come into the ranks of the progress- He is at the cross-road, and our show-room is the gi&lt; board that will direct him right or wrong. The impressions received there are lasting. Let us see that the sign-board is not weather-beaten and indistinct lest he interpret it wrongly and be lost to the fancy. If he sees at the exhibition nothing but first-class stock — the pick of many — his ideal is placed high, and he will find no pleasure in inferior stock. This show educates him to an appreciation of the value of a good bird, and the price that a few months previous would have seemed fabulous and outrageous to-day does not strike </seg>
            <seg id="p019">18 PEOCEEDINGS OF THE him as anything above the ordinary. It is the associations thrown around him and the impressions made that brings this about. If there are no poor birds for him to examine, he quite naturally considers all outside below the standard of the show unfit for breeding purposes, and this is what you want. When he reaches this point you are in a fair way to have a fancier that will be a benefit to the industry. His ideal is high ; his aim is for the top. But will he gain this impression if he sees a large show partially filled with good birds and the balance a lot of culls that any farmer would be ashamed of? Will such a show elevate his ideal or will it tend to lower it? It will lower it every time. He will consider the poorest he saw at the ex - hibition good enough to start with, and he is going to start at the bottom and work up. But remember, fellow fancier, and would-be fanciers, that the best are none too good to start with. That rare quality known as common-sense is of the highest service in the poultry yard. So many failures have been recorded in the past that many are prone to look on poultry-farming on a large scale as one of life's impossi - bilities. Before we attempt to breed fancy poultry we should serve an apprenticeship of greater or less length according to our diligence and application and our aptness in learn - ing the primary cause of failures is an overload of self con - ceit and a lack of common-sense. i When we become afflicted with ''hcn-fcccr" we should above all else keep from getting out of our head and keep our pulse as near normal as possible; if we do not our heart will fail us, if nothing more serious happens to us. If we have had but limited experience in the management of poul - try, we should feel our way carefully along this strange road. It is far from being a smooth thoroughfare; it has </seg>
            <seg id="p020">19 lots of nps and downs, and filled with lots of obstructions. At each turn we are liable to meet with appalling difficulties; therefore it is best to start on our journey with but one breed, and, if a beginner, with but one pen or yard, until we become acquainted with every nook and turn on the route. We must note carefully everything that happens in the poultry-yards that is out of the usual line, and also note the effect. We will gradually gather a valuable store of ex - perience, and an "ounce of experience is worth a ton of theory" no matter how fine it may seem. After breeding one pen for a season, we may be better prepared to extend our yards another season and breed on a larger scale. Your yards must be roomy. A small yard 8x10 feet or 12x20 feet is altogether too small to keep a pen of thoroughbred fowls in during the laying season. More than nine-tenths of the trouble of eggs not hatching can be traced to the nonsensical idea that birds can and will thrive in small pent-up yards. A yard for ten hens and a male should contain, at least cal - culations, one-fourth of an acre, this to be divided into two yards and be kept covered with green forage, such as rye, oats, wheat, or millet ; and when one yard gets bare have the other ready to turn onto. As your flock increases in size, colonize; place pullets in one yard, chicks in a second, and never put more than from thirty to fifty in a place. Fifty birds should have one-half acre of ground for a yard. Roomy yards and roomy houses pay large profits on the investment. I do not mean by roomy houses those that are built high be - tween joints, but those that give the largest space on the ground to a fowl. Those great large tall houses have caused many a fancier to "cuYse" the chicken business, and to sell or destroy the plant, while if he had used a little sound sense </seg>
            <seg id="p021">20 PROCEEDINGS OF THE in building houses he would have profited well on his invest - ment and encouraged others to do likewise. Houses need not be expensive. If you have plenty of money it is all well enough, but if your means are limited, build plain, cheap, warm houses, and put the surplus cash into better chickens if they can be found. Raising poultry has attained that degree of importance that it is no more sneered at as a trifling occupation, and the poultry-raiser who does not now feed his flock with a definite idea or pur - pose is greatly behind the times. The day of haphazard feeding and the lazy man's method are fast becoming ob - solete. The feeding of poultry has now become almost a science. The main idea used to be that anything is good enough to feed to poultry. Now they are fed in a very rational and intelligent manner. One routine of feed is given to produce eggs, while a different course is followed to produce flesh, and the fact has become established that different breeds require different diets to produce the same effects. In feed - ing fowls the best success is obtained by feeding a variety of feeds or grains. Another very important item to be considered, if you are in the business for profit, is the question of advertising. This, like all other branches of the work, must be done judi - ciously. If no advertising is done at all you need not look for profits, as your neighbors will not buy fowls or eggs enough of you to pay for the salt you feed them. On the other hand, they will buy of the other fellow who runs a half-page, advertisement way off in some distant state, even if his fowlB are far inferior to yours. I have seen birds bought in the far East at f 5 each, and a goodly amount paid on the same for expressage, that if you would offer to your </seg>

The larger and more attractive your ad - vertisement appears the more stock you will sell, as it is the large flaming ad that gets the trade; but it is useless to spend from $50 to |200 advertising $25 worth of stock for sale. Qood sound sense must be used in advertising as in all other parti of the business. When you offer anything for sale do not try to underbid your brother fancier, as in nine cases out of ten you will not make a sale, as most buyers have the opinion that the more they pay for a bird or setting of eggs the better it is; in other words, it is of no account unless a big price is paid or to be paid. A setting of eggs you ask a dollar for will be more eagerly sought after or bought if you ask $3 or $5 for it. The same is true in selling birds. This may seem strange, but did not P. T. Barnum say the American people liked to be humbugged. Twenty-six years of the fancy-poultry business has taught me that the saying is only true, and if you do not sell them the stuff some other fancier will.. So put on a face and close your eyes and put on a price. You never will get it unless you do. It's the profits we are after and not the fun. In closing let me recapitulate by saying, if you are an amateur start with one yard of some good variety you like. As you become acquainted with the habits and care, you can increase the number of yards. If, after a time, you have plenty of room and means and can give your time to the husiness you can try two or more varieties. The profits will depend on their care, your methods of handling, the prices you demand, and the amount of advertising, and how done. w </seg>
            <seg id="p023">22 PROCEEDINGS OP THE Mr. Skinner: What is the further pleasure of the meet - ing? Dr. Gaiser : 1 would like to have a few words from the chairman. I don't like to see him get off so easy. I would like to call your attention to the program. You have omitted a speech by yourself, on "The Feeding and Housing of Grow - ing Stock." I believe you can give us some pointers along that line. Mr. Skinner: If I am chairman of the meeting, that ought to be a whole lot. I was in such a state of mind at the time I took the chair that I think I overlooked that part of the program [Laughter]. We have heard from Dr. iaiser and Dr. Peters about housing stock. When Mr. Peg - r wrote to me sometime ago about choosing a subject for is evening, I felt that I was incompetent, and that I could )t say anything that would do you any good, and I wrote m t# that effect. I told him that I did not know very much, at what I did know was very little, and what I did not low would fill a big book, about like the family Bible, tien He wrote me and insisted on my stating what I knew, id that it would be all right. So I consented; and, selfish i it might be, the thought came in my mind, "You don't low very much anyway, but you go down there and tell em something, and then the boys will tell you what you ►n't know and what they do know. I have had a good al of trouble in feeding and housing growing stock, so I ill take that for my subject, and I will go down there and 11 my experience. I may probably get some help." I know at there are men here who know ten times as much about is subject as I do. • I would like to ask in the first place of the people who are here, who of them are in the business as a business, and do </seg>
            <seg id="p024">23 NEBBA8KA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION • not make a dollar, or anything else, to raise their hands. [One man raised his hand.] Thank the Lord for that man. My idea is to find out what kind of a crowd I am talking to. I want you now as many of you as are in the business and do not care a continental whether you make a nickel out of it or not to raise your hands. [No hands up.] Now how many are in the business for the pleasure and who figure to get enough out of it from the sale of their stock to keep them just moving along? [Several hands up.] Now there is another class — those who are in it for all there is to be made of it! [Several hands up.] I have had a great deal of trouble in the past with feed. I was raised among poultry, but at that time I was a boy, and I thought more of the pleasures of life than I did of the chickens. My father was in it, and I did not pay so much attention to it until the last six or eight years. Many things I might have learned that I did not learn. Consequently, six or eight years ago, I started out at the beginning. I got it into my head that eggs were a great thing for feed. I used to see my mother feed chickens, and being in the store I saw a good lot of cracked eggs. "Now," I said, "here is my chance to get eggs, 1 ' and I fed eggs to beat the world. I would boil them hard, chop them up, m\&lt;\ feed them to the chickens. There are people to-day who advocate eggs for chickens. In England, where they used to feed eggs, they have been selling them this fall and winter at fifty cents a dozen. You can depend upon it that, where eggs cost fifty cents a dozen, they will feed eggs sparingly to chickens, and that the hens do not get enough of the eggs to hurt them. I first found out that eggs were bad things for chicks by my wife neglecting to feed one of our brood of chickens. The brood was way off some distance from the others. I thought she </seg>
            <seg id="p025">I'RCX 24 was, perhaps, too lazy, but I would ask her, "Have you fed those chickens anything way down there?" And she says, "Why, no; they are way off there; they are too far off, I am not going down there to feed them." They got very little. Those chickens did better than any chickens I had that year. Afterwards I got hold of the Uudd catalogue and also a brooder book, and it contained plans for making a brooder. I do not know whether it was in the book or in the circular that he spoke of feed for chickens, and he spoke of eggs in particular, and he said. "Feed e^jjs as you would poison." "Well," I said, "I will try it," and I fed them sparingly. There is another thing I have found out, and that is about soft feed for chickens. I don't care if it is in dry crumbly state, but don't feed soft food to chickens. I believe they Vill positively do better for three or four weeks on hard, dry bread and hard, dry feed. Millet seed and cracked corn are good. Sift out the fine and sift out the coarse, and feed that. I find that oatmeal is good, also rolled oats, if you don't feed too heavy. Kaffir corn I And is very good feed; and Milo maize, is about the best feed I have found for growing stock. I would not feed any soft feed at all. Perhaps they might like a little tonic, !&gt;^i I would not give much. Chickens like a little variety and tonic, but I don't believe in much of that Then there is another thing in connection with feeding, and that is not to overfeed. Chickens need lots to eat, but at the same time there is such a thing as stuffing them too much. It is wrong to be feeding chickens all the time and feeding them more than they can eat all the while. I would rather keep chickens just a little bit hungry. That is the best way I think. In order to do that when I go to feed them, I find something they like best. I feed that in the chaff, and </seg>
            <seg id="p026">25 NEBRASKA STATE POULTEY ASSOCIATION what they don't like so well, I feed on a board, where they can see it. They will work hard for the feed they like best. Do not put it rn too much litter to worry them. Cut straw is the best litter for little chickens. Another thing for chickens, I don't believe in overfeeding, but at the same time I have a pen which was a brooder house, with chickens farther away from the place. I made some self-feeding troughs, so I would not have to attend to them so often, as I was very busy and did not have time to take care of them. I made these feeding troughs and kept cracked corn in them all the time. They became surfeited, and did not like it so much. When I went out to feed them they were hungry for something to cat. I don't believe generally in that way of doing business, but that outfit of chickens was the best I raised that year. I put fifty in the brooder, and they grew faster than any chickens on the place. . Now, about housing. I did not prepare any paper. I have never thought much about it. I am just giving this talk from my experience. I have got every kind of a house that ;i man e\er thought of [Laughter]. I started out about four years ago and knocked everything I had to pieces and made a lot of little coops for hens and chicks. There are not two alike. I am not much of a car - penter, but they are about two by four, on the ground. I thought they would be nice, so I painted them. Mr. Re - porter, are you putting this all down? I thought I told you about this last year [Laughter]. Well, I will tell you what is the matter with those coop*. Every time I want to examine them for lice, I would have to get down on the ground, on my hands and knees, and reach back to the far corner to get those chicks. I could not reach down there in the coop for the chicks. I would have to lay down and </seg>

When they grew larger I generally put ten or fifteen with a hen in a coop And when it rained in there they would take cold. That is too many to be put with one hen. The coops that I have made since that time have been made so that I can go right into them and sit down on a chair if I want to catch the chicks and examine them, and I fount that much better. Every coop that I shall make after thia will be made so that I can walk right in, and in such a on* you can put about thirty, and it will last quite a long while Well, I believe that is about all that I know about this busi ness. I am sorry that I could not have done better for you DISCUSSION. Q. I understood you to say that when you wanted to reach . in for chicks in these coops, that you had to get down on your hands and knees, and you said that they would sweat in there at night. Now, I would like to ask you, why they would sweat in a damp house? Mr. Skinner: I would like to tell you after the rain falls — it sometimes rains up in Washington county — the ground would become damp, and they would sweat in those coops; that is what I meant. I would like to say further, another year I intend to put a floor in every one of those coops of brick. I can get brick and lay them loose, close together. and fill with six inches of sand, and they will be perfectly dry, and then set the coop on them. A farmer put me on to that [Laughter]. Q. I would like to ask you if sand is not too cold for small chicks? Iwould like to have bare ground for my coops. If I had brick, I would pat a little warm dirt over them. Mb. Skinner : Probably, that would be better. </seg>
            <seg id="p028">27 NEBRASKA STATE POULTBY ASSOCIATION Dr. Gaiseb : I have a long house and have concrete floor, and I found it did not pay. When I build again, my floor shall be dirt floor. It is the cheapest. If it becomes foul, we can dig it up and throw it out. I think there is no warmer floor than a dirt floor. Mr. Skinner : I would say, Doctor, that I thought of that. The brick floor is very good. When you get through or wish to move the coop you can take it all up and move it. Mb. Bushnell : My house is of brick. You never need to take the floor up for lice or rats. There is nothing warmer than brick. You can keep them clean, and that floor is all right. Mr. Skinner: This farmer I spoke of having the brick floor in his chicken house, had a young daughter ten years old. He told her last spring that she could have everything she could make off the chickens, if she would look after them. She sold, this summer, in poultry and eggs, between fifty and sixty dollars' worth, besides what they used in the house. He had hardly made anything out of the chickens previously, but he told her that the chickens should be hers, and that he would build a poultry house when she earned money enough to build one, but she must make it out of the poultry business. She kept putting money into the bank until she had fifty or sixty dollars. "Now," she said, "we have enough to build that poultry house," and that is the house that he made. He thought it would be a good idea to have a brick floor. It is double boarded on the outside, and sealed in - side. He has got a loft overhead. He made it about seven feet high to the ceiling, and then the loft is high enough so that he can put in a load of straw. Every day that girl goes up in the loft and throws down some fresh straw for the </seg>

Mr. Pegler : I move that a committee of three be appointed by the chair to consider suggestion in the By-laws to report at the business meeting, Thursday evening. Seconded and carried. The chair appointed on that committee O. D. Talbert, A. Lemen, and L. P. Harris. On motion the meeting adjourned until Wednesday even - ing. SECOND SESSION. Wednesday Evening. The chairman rapped the meeting to order, and said: "I now have the pleasure of introducing Mr. E. P. Mickel, who will talk to us on MY OBSERVATIONS OF THE POULTRY INDUSTRY IN OLD MEXICO. Mr. Chairman, Ladies, and Gentlemen: I hardly know why the secretary in making up his program called on me to take a share in this evening's proceedings. I suppose he thought I could say something that would be for the edification of the chicken craft. One does not have to go to Mexico to get new ideas, though it may be that I can entertain you for a few minutes along the lines mentioned by Brother Pegler. The poet who wrote "Backward, turn backward, O Time, in your flight" was never in Mexico. If he had been, he never would have writ- </seg>
            <seg id="p030">29 NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION ton it, because one only has to cross the border line which the Mexicans call Rio Grande Del Norte, in order to be turned back at least a hundred years; and the farther into the coun - try one goes, the more time is turned back, and by the time he reaches the City of Mexico, he has turned back all of three hundred years. There are no solid facts in regard to the poultry business in Mexico that I could give you. What I shall tell you may be amusing- and entertaining, but as to being instructive, it is out of the question. My first contact with the poultry business was from living on the border line at El Paso. The manager of the defunct Poultry News undertook to make my residence in that far-off country. The information got down into Mexico by some unknown method that there was a man in El Paso who knew everything about chickens. The Mexican's idea of chickens is crude. One day as I was sitting in the office, the agent of the Wells Fargo Express Company from across the river in Jaurez came in and, laying down fifty dollars in gold, wanted to know if I could deliver him a couple of fighting cocks. I told him it was too short notice and I could not do it. He told me that there was a cock fight to come off in Chichuchua, the next day, and that if I could not furnish him a couple of fighting cocks before that time for that amount of money he did not think I was much of a chicken man. One gathers the idea that the country down there has been buried for a long time. The customs of the people are all what we would term "back numbers.'' They plow with a forked stick yet ; American or improved farm implements are almost unknown — not entirely unknown, because American enterprise is endeavoring to introduce these modern imple - ments into the country, but it is up-hill business. &gt;To people </seg>
            <seg id="p031">30 30 PROCEEDINGS OF THE who hare been educated in one channel for from three or five hundred years, it is hard for them to take on new ideas or anything that is a change from their accustomed manner of doing things. In the City of Mexico there is held a fair, or as we term it an agricultural exhibition, once each year, and it was my good fortune to attend one. They are held annually at a little suburb of the City of Mexico, some three or four miles out, which is reached by a tram- way. They are in that way trying to educate the people up to modern ideas. When a Mexican or Spaniard builds anything, he first builds a wall around it. His first idea is protection and after that he will beautify it as much as he can. This show is attended every year by the President of the Republic and his entire cabinet, escorted by at least two. or three companies of the regular army. It is held in a little place not much larger than one of our city blocks, and is surrounded on all sides by a high wall. The front of it has recently been rebuilt of brick, but the rest of it is built out of adobe, or sun-dried brick, and cemented on the outside. Around the four sides of this enclosure, you will find booths, or rooms, more prop - erly speaking, and in the center is the court or "patio," as they call it, in which the exhibits are shown. In connection with the show at that time there is a poultry exhibit, and I want to say to you that there was as fine a poultry exhibit as I ever saw in my life, but they were all from the States. Barred Plymouth Rocks, White Rocks, Silver Gray Dorkings, Langshans, Brahmas, Light Brahmas, and Buff Cochins. There was only a single pair or Dorkings. It attracted a world of attention. People came and looked, and wondered at the enormous and beautiful chickens that were on exhibi - tion there. I remember distinctly that the White Plymouth </seg>
            <seg id="p032">31 NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION Rocks were of the empire strain because a placard bearing this information was posted up in a conspicuous place Those who exhibited them were Mexicans and took a great deal of pride in that part of the exhibition. I might as well state that there was also an exhibition of thoroughbred cattle and some few sheep, but it was all nicely arranged and everything was clean, while flowers and plants decorated the whole enclosure both inside and out, and one of the famous military bands of that country furnished de - lightful music at intervals during the entire time. It was a very pleasant place. I mention this to show that they are making some strides in the way of thoroughbred poultry. One day as I was going to work I came across a trio of real thoroughbred Mexican poultry. There was a Mexican sitting on the curb, and he had three fowls, two hens and a cock, and he was offering them for sale. A chicken always attracts my attention, and, as these were a little out of the usual run, I stopped and looked at them, and having an in - terpreter with me, I questioned the Mexican in regard to his chickens. He stated that they were positively pure thoroughbred, and he knew it because he raised them him - self. They were something like a cross between a Langshan and a Light Brahma, and he wanted at least two dollars for the three chickens. I did not purchase. He went on and gave me the particulars about the chickens and what part of the country they came from, and stated that he had trav - eled some 250 miles to bring those three fowls to the City of Mexico to sell them. Eggs are a universal food in Mexico, but I think on the question of marketing them they might be able to give us a few points. When we have eggs to sell, or buy, we go to the store and ask what price they are per dozen, or what they are </seg>
            <seg id="p033">32 PROCEEDINGS OF THE paying per dozen, and we pay that price per dozen. If the Mexican has eggs to sell, he sells so many for a "riel." That would l&gt;e equal to twelve cents of their money and about five and one-half of our money. If the eggs are large and nice looking, you can probably get six. If they are small, he will probably sell you eight. If they look a little dirty and are not very nice, you might get nine. But he sells them a&lt; cording to the way the eggs look; according to the size am condition. You can not buy them any other way. You ca not buy them by the dozen. You would have to buy on riel's worth. He would not give anything off in quantity If you wanted a great quantity, he would not KU them a all, and he would give you as a reason that if he sold thei all out to you he would not have anything else to do the balance of the day. Eggs are brought to market, not as we take them, but all put in together like you would bunch potatoes, and a man carries it either on his back, or has two cases strapped on the side of his burro, and he goes around and peddles them from house to house. You can go to the general market and buy if you choose, but thev are great hands to peddle eggs. They come in very nice shape. Gen - erally the eggs you buy are fresh and wholesome. Chickens are brought to market, as a general thing, swun over the back of a burro, tied by their legs, one bunch o either side, and the owner and his entire family walkin behind. Usually they have about half a dozen chickens to sell at one time, but if they had only two it would take th whole family to come to town to sell them; and the proba bility is that they will spend the larger part of the mone they receive in getting full of Polque, the native drink, an&lt; go home happy. There are a great many turkeys there, but they are not </seg>
            <seg id="p034">33 NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION such turkeys as we have in this country. They are more like a wild turkey. They are small and thin, but their flesh is very nice. They are brought into the city every morning driven like herds — like a herd of sheep. A man walks be - hind them with something like a whip, a long stalk, probably four or five feet long, with a lash on the end. He cracks this lash around tho turkeys, and they drive just like sheep. He brings his herd up to market, and if you come along and want to buy one he steps into the bunch and picks one out for you. They seem to be very tame and docile, and they sell for probably, if the money were worth as much as ours, 60 or 75 cents each. Ducks and geese are quite plentiful, although they, like the other fowls there, are not of the improved breeds. The Vigii is a long canal that was built some two or three hundred years ago — I don't know how long — in order to bring the water from lake Xochimilco fifteen miles down to the city. Along the Viga is what is termed the floating gardens of Mexico. These are spots of ground about as big as this room, surrounded on all sides by water. It is from these floating fields along the Viga that the City of Mexico obtains a supply of fresh vegetables during the entire year. It is in this kind of an atmosphere that a duck and a goose will flourish. It is interesting to see them coming down the Viga with their boats loaded down with the produce they raise, propelling their boats with a long pole. They will pile the stuff on so high that the water will wash over the side of the boat. Forage, grain, and wood are all brought to market in the same way. Mexicans are of a very peculiar character. They can not appreciate a joke. As illustrating the character of the Mexicans, I might tell you a story that is told of a section </seg>
            <seg id="p035">34 PROCEEDINGS OF THE of that country that is noted for its wisdom. It was said at one time that the City of Lagos was in danger of having a visit from the federal officers from the capitol. There was a mud-hole in front of the council chamber three or four feet deep, which was always full of water and mud. It was an eye-sore to the people and caused a great deal of com - plaint. The City Council, or Village Fathers, were called together to devise some means of having the hole removed. After holding various sessions in regard to it, they came to the conclusion that that hole should be moved to the out - skirts of the towa; that if they had to have a hole of that character in the village they did not want it in front of the city hall, and they finally offered a reward of one hundred riels to anyone who would propose a successful method of removing that hole. Finally a bright native came along and said he could do it. They told him he could undertake it, and if he succeeded he should be rewarded, but if he failed he would be sent to jail. But he undertook it. And he did it by digging a hole by the side of the hole to be moved, and threw the dirt into the first hole. Then he dug a. third hole and threw the dirt from it into the hole lie first dug, and he proceeded in this manner until he had removed the hole to the outskirts of the city, and, it is useless to add, he re - ceived his reward [Applause]. </seg>
            <seg id="p036">35 NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION A HISTORY OF THE NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION. By I. L. Lyman. The Nebraska State Poultry Association was a legitimate outgrowth of the old Southeastern Nebraska Poultry Asso - ciation, an organization that flourished in a few counties of this state during the early '80's. This society held its fire show at Pawnee City in 1884, with Capt. J. E. White, o Chicago, as its judge. Their next exhibit was at Sterling in 1885, with J. Y. Bicknell, of New York, for judge. . And the next show was at Tecumseh in 1886, with the veteran I. K. Felch as the judge. It was at the Tecumseh meeting, I believe, in 1886, that the scope of the association was enlarged to the dignity o statehood, and the name changed to the present designation and the place of the next winter show was selected as Lin coin, the state capital, for January, 1888. The first Presi dent of the State Association was a gentleman named Me Coy, residing at Sterling, and the Secretary-Treasurer was Gbrham F. Betts, of Lincoln. , * Shortly before this show was to begin I remember "that Mr. Betts dropped in at my office one day, and with a sweet persuasive smile succeeded in the amicable exchange of one of his season tickets, for that show, for one of my glistening silver dollars ; and one day not long thereafter I turned over my business affairs temporarily to an assistant and visited the display that was gathered in the old skating rink on M street. There I found the show in full blast and J. R. Megahan in full swing as a volunteer committee on recep - tion, or general floor walker, and, while he flaunted no badge or emblem of authority, yet he came blandly forward and </seg>
            <seg id="p037">36 36 PROCEEDINGS OF THE very courteously and agreeably did the honors as host for the occasion. I do not now remember who judged this show, but who - ever it was had a snap, for he found the exhibit so scant in numbers, and so indifferent in quality, that his work was soon over, and he had left town before I had found time to visit the collection, or become acquainted with its member - ship and management. I discovered before I left the hall that day that all was not serene or harmonious among those composing the so - ciety; that there was an element of factionalism running through the proceedings, and, as I went al&gt;out among the groups of coops, I heard expressions from one side or the other that boded no good for the future of the organization. Before the annual meeting for 1888 — which had been ar ranged for State Fair week — was due, 1 had enrolled m name in the membership of the State Association, and hai been made acquainted with some of the inside history and heart-burnings of the society. To those of us who assemble on that September evening in Gorham F. Betts' coal office to hold the fourth annual meeting, it was unfolded durin the report of the officers that in order to meet deficiencies — a deficiency is not a new or unheard of situation in the his lory of this association — in order to meet deficiencies o revenue at the previous show, a debt of $100 was hangin over the society in the shape of a bank note, which had bee made and endorsed by Mr. Betts and John It. Megahan jointly, and the next question was, What would the associa tion do about it? The irrepressible conflict engendered by a strong faction - alism broke forth in all its fury, and compliments were passed with a freedom and facility surprising to the newer mem- </seg>
            <seg id="p038">37 bers. One division of the fraternity proposed to disband the association, repudiate the obligation involved in the bank note, and let the two indorsers take care of the paper as best they could. The other section foresaw the inevitable end of the association in such a step, and proposed to pro rate the debt among themselves, wipe off the slate, and start anew. This was done on the spot, and, although the opera - tion called for some rather heroic sacrifices on the part of those who favored the scheme, the money was raised in five minutes, the obligation was met in full, and the Nebraska State Poultry Association was preserved in its integrity for further usefulness and effort, although nearly one third of its inembershii) withdrew their names and support from its further existence. At that meeting John K. Megahan was elected Secretary and Treasurer, and at once set about picking up the scattered threads, and organizing the fanciers in this state towards the formation of a strong and aggressive society. In De - cember of that year a very creditable and financially suc - cessful show was held at Lincoln, with about 600 birds on the entry list* It was at this show I first met S. L. Roberta — that upright and incorruptible judge, whose thorough study of the science and philosophy of judging poultry made him invincible under criticism, and inspired all exhibitors with the conviction that their birds were passing under the searching eye of a born exjK'rt, who could give a lucid reason for every mark on his score card, whose face lighted up with a true fancier's delight when perfection of points came into his hands; an ideal judge, who scorned deception, and de - lighted to acknowledge and reward merit, and whose entire record in the show-rooms of this state was one of strict im - partiality and equal justice to all comers, with leniency, if </seg>
            <seg id="p039">38 PROCEEDINGS OF THE any, towards the new and perhaps weak exhibitor, who only needed the encouragement of a kindly judge, in the opening effort, to make of him an enthusiastic and successful fancier. The year 18S9 was one of almost phenomenal growth for our association, and of active preparation among its mem - bers. The new management was working with unbounded zeal towards a magnificent show for the succeeding winter. The State Board of Agriculture was invaded, and they do - noted a hundred dollars towards the enterprise. The Lan - er County Agricultural Society was visited, and they promptly voted another hundred dollars to the same object. A number of fanciers clubbed together and supplied another hundred, to be put up as a gold sweepstake for the highest scoring pen of any breed in the show room, and with this then princely sum secured, in addition to entry fees and gate receipts,- Secretary Megahan proclaimed to the world a liberal premium list, to be dispensed under the judgment of the world-famed Felch. The result was a marvel to the most hopeful. Beautiful birds fit to grace any company came from all parts of our own state, from hitherto un - heard of fanciers in oujr own borders, and from as far east as Massachusetts and as far west as the Rocky Mountains, to enter the contest for that elegant purse of shining gold. It was there and then that first appeared in our show-rooms such well-known and valued fanciers as Geo. Osterhout, L. P. HarriSj Albert Lenien, Will Armstrong, S. S.

It was a revelation to Nebraska fanciers themselves, and to all our people, and especially so when they saw Judge Felch writing scores on Nebraska birds with 95£ and 96 for foot - ngs. It is worthy. of note that it was a Nebraska pen of Nebraska raised birds that outscoml the East and the West with a total of 189$ good honest points. From that memorable exhibit the Nebraska Association can easily and justly date its entrance among the foremost and famous poultry societies of this country. From the impulse then given, the fraternity in this state has sprung into vitality and power, confidence and success. The later history of the Nebraska Association is familiar to most of you. C. M. Lewelling came into the ranks in 1892. and at once assumed a position of influence among the members, becoming President in that year and active with those who desired to incorporate the society and try for a state appropriation. The matter of incorporation was ac - complished in November of 1892, with C. M. Lewelling, Geo. W. Osterhout, John It. Megahan, J. M. Armstrong, Albert Lemen, and myself as incorporators. A suitable bill was prepared and introduced ra the legislature at its session o 1893, and, thanks to the efforts of the incorporators, ably assisted by Hon. C. D. Casper, of Butler county, in the house, and Senator Dale, of Phelps county, in the senate the bill, legalizing the State Poultry Association as a state society, and appropriating one thousand dollars per year for its use and benefit, was passed and became a law; the appropriation becoming operative for the first time in con - nection with the annual exhibit at Kearney in 1894. Since its establishment as a state institution, the associa - tion has drawn to its membership the strong and active </seg>
            <seg id="p041">40 PBOCEEM THE poultry-fanciers of the state, in goodly numbers, and both of the essential elements of any society worth belonging to — the radical and the conservative 1 — have found a welcome and a place within its fold. Its stockholders are numbered in the hundreds, and to include them all in this sketch would be impossible, but 1 can not forget that there have been leading spirits in its management whose services have been conspicuous and valuable. Who can measure the influence for good exerted at critical times by the cool, clear business sense of (Jeo.Osterhout? Who can estimate the effort towards growth and development and success that results from the fiery, impulsive, and impetuous nature of Albert Lemen? The one a balance wheel that prevents the other, the steam engine, from running away with itself, and leaving a train of disasters behind. Among those who have carefully weighed the responsibilities and possibilities and amenities involved in this society, and acted for its welfare both wisely and incessantly, may l&gt;e mentioned E. E. (Ireer, II. 0. Young, Henry J. Smith, Casper Dice, E. I'. Mickel, F. B. Donis - thorpe, E. C. Worden, W. A. Irwin, W. O. Southwick, Dr. A. Gaiser, John Skinner, E. A. Pegler, W. II. Haven, L. P. Harris, Dave Larson, ( 'harles Koss, L. L. Fisher, and several others (not to tire your patience). It was due to the motive energy of some of these men, es pecially, and their power to ]&gt;ersuade and convince, tha the State Board of Agriculture was informed a few years ago that the poultry interests of this growing state coul&lt; not longer be put off with the oljseure box of a poultry house on the old Fair Grounds at Lincoln. The Hoard paid bee to the organized voice of the State Poultry Association, an&lt; quadrupled the dimensions and capacity of the poultr building, besides extending the scope and enlarging the sum </seg>
            <seg id="p042">NEBBASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION 41 of the poultry premiums, until the poultry exhibit resulting from these efforts became the leading and most popular feature of their September fairs. It was the organized de - mand of the State Poultry Association that secured a new building on the Omaha grounds, more than double the size of the enlarged building at Lincoln. It is the organized in - fluence of the State Poultry Association and its annual ex - positions, such as the one now in progress, that has set hundreds of Nebraska artisans and farmers to thinking on the superiority of thoroughbred over mongrel blood, and has made fanciers of hundreds more who will not admit the fact even to themselves. It is this association, composed of such men as I have mentioned and their compeers in the poultry fraternity, who will keep the purposes of this organization pure and unde - filed from the intrusion of party politics and factional dis - cord, and eventually redeem our fair farms and fields from the reign of mongrelism ; and they will look with satisfaction on its proud record when Nebraska homes shall teem with the pure and beautiful in their outdoor life, as they already do in their indoor realm. IS NEBRASKA KEEPING UP WITH THE PROCESSION? By Theo. Hewes. Ladies and Gentlemen and Members of the Poultry 'Asso - ciation : I want to tell you people that I am not going to deliver a long speech. This is not my first attempt at addressing an &gt; </seg>
            <seg id="p043">42 PROCEEDINGS OF THE audience. I remember one time, in Missouri, my friends in - sisted that I should place in nomination a man for the office •of constable. I at once began thinking over and framing the great speech that I should make, and how the news - &gt;apers afterwards should point the finger at me and say, 'There is the man who nominated so and so for the office &lt;&gt;f constable," and I even thought of how my friends would come to me and congratulate and talk over the matter. I started to place the man in nomination, but before I got through the sheriff had him arrested. I also remember an - other occasion that resulted no better for the parties in question, and myself in particular. So, I tell you now, that if I fall down I don't want you to feel that you are the first audience that ever witnessed such a spectacle [Laughter]. Is Nebraska "keeping up with the procession"? She is, undoubtedly, judging from the returns of last November election. In regard to the Nebraska Poultry Association, I presume that is the head of Mr. Pegler's program. In look - ing over the past, I find that I have judged as many birds as any man in the state meetings, taking the state shows and state fairs into consideration; and I do not know but that you have the largest exhibit that I have attended. The ex - hibit of 1896 was probably larger in point of numbers, but not in point of superior birds. I don't think you have ever held a convention that wil compare with the present exhibition. I don't wish to flatter you because others have good birds, but when birds score so many points one year and the next year score much higher the birds must be a good deal better. Take the Ligli Rrahmas class: I have just come out from Chicago show and I say to you that I have scored better birds here to-da\ than I did in Chicago, in cockerels and pullets and cock </seg>
            <seg id="p044">NEBRASKA STATE POULTRY ASSOCIATION 43 and hens. They are better, no doubt, many of them, than those in Chicago. Take another class, Plymouth Hocks: while the class is bettor than last year, I do not think it is as good a show as the Chicago class, especially with the males. In Golden Wyandottes I find the quality generally is better than last year. If a breeder scores higher points one year he can do it again because of your experience. The utial feature is to breed stock and depend upon your head and not upon your pocketbook. I believe you have in Nebraska quite as many experienced breeders as can be found in any one state in the West. In the East, however, they have more experienced bird fanciers because they have better opportunities of learning from each other. In the West we are handicapped, especially those who are breeding one variety. Here you are unable to go and see the other breeder's birds, and the consequence is that you buy "sight and unseen," and you may or may not get what you like, while in New England a few hours' ride will take you to the other fellow's flock and you can see for yourself, and in that way do not take any chances. In that respect I think those people are ahead of us collectively. There are more chances to help one another. If we judges cut on this point and that without some excellent strong reason for it, you will stop us and ask us about it. Nebraska breeders know how their birds stand. It shows that you are all progressive and looking out for the best interests of the bird you are breeding. I do not see anything else but success for the Nebraska Poultry Association so long as you keep that green-eyed monster out of your association. No matter who is your Secretary, let his efforts be appreciated. Do all you ean to kelp him. Do justice by the man in that office, not because of the individual, but for the purpose of always </seg>
            <seg id="p045">44 PROCEEDINGS OF THE having harmony and making things better. I can not see rhy the Nebraska State Poultry Association with one thou - sand dollars a year appropriation can not be the best asso - ciation in any of the western states. This exhibition is bet - ter in many points, and the next year ought to be still better. People do not hesitate to come to your shows. When you elect your officers this year abide by the decision of the ma - jority, and work for the interests of the association in every way. Let every member begin now to work for the success of the meeting to be held next year. If you do, you can secure an exhibition of three thousand birds at your next annual show. You know that with that many birds, even at twenty-five cents, you will pay out and have money left. I believe the way you are working along the line of harmony is the best way. What judges I have met are all very anxious to get back into Nebraska to judge. Why? "Because," they say, "they are gentlemen; they take us out and treat U8. They carried my grip down to the train; they are a good - natured lot of fellows. y&gt; Xf you continue working along the line of harmony and the lines I have suggested, I am satisfied you will make a success of the Nebraska Poultry Association in Nebraska, and that your association will be superior to any association in the West. I thank you for your kind and patient attention [Applause]. Mr. Lemex : With the permission of the chairman, would like to make a motion that a committee of five be ap pointed to wait upon the claims committee in both houses of our state legislature, and ask that the printing bill be paid out of the deficiency appropriation. The motion is seconded and carried. The chairman appointed on the committee: Dr. Gaiser, I. L. Lyman, Lemen, Pegler, and Wert. 44 PBOCEEDIJ </seg>
            <seg id="p046">Me. Theo. Hewes : If I am permitted to make a motion, I would move you, Mr. Chairman, that it is the sense of this meeting that all color disqualifications be eliminated from the standard. The motion is seconded. Mr. Hewes : I will say that I have made this motion simply to get an expression of the Nebraska State Breeders on the subject. The question was discussed at length at the Na - tional Fanciers' Association at Sherman House in Chicago recently, and it was voted four to one in favor of eliminating all color disqualification. My idea is that every day every judge is doing wrong in putting the ribbons in front of a cage that has color disqualification. It is not so much a question of breeding them out as it is of getting them out. If they are not bred out, they will get them out in some other way, aud will pull them out. I believe a more intelligent standard will be reached if we allow those defects to come in with - out disqualification and discount them in proportion to whatever valuation we might place upon them. As an illus - tration I saw as fine a Cochin pullet as ever was exhibited and there were a few black feathers. They were enough to disqualify the bird. They were in the back. The bird had been injured in some way and those feathers came there. An - other exhibitor had by the side of this Cochin an old scrub that had, none of those disqualifying feathers, and the scrub bird got the premium. As long as we judges throw out a worthy bird on account of one or two little feathers we are doing an injustice to the business and making a show for the trickster and not for the every -day breeder. If we breed our birds and make the standard so that they can all come in on the same footing, we make an improvement. Take, for ex - ample, the Buff Cochin; there is a bird without color dia- </seg>
            <seg id="p047">46 PROCEEDINGS OV THE qualification. People are not going to breed that color dis - qualification. It is not the intention to do it. It is not the intention to insist on doing it. When they have some trifling mistake, and ten thousand of them have, it is wrong to turn them down just for one disqualifying feather. It is one of the questions that will come up at the next revision meeting for discussion. The motion being put, was carried. On motion the convention now adjourned until to-morrow evening.
