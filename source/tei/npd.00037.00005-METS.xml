            <seg id="p003">186 OLLU^ \j Dlfc.-N.N1AL. ltt.1 UK 1 Or NEBRASKA SOLDIERS' AND SAILORS' HOME rHis Excellency, Honorable John H. Morehead, Governor, and to the Honorable members of the Board of Commis - sioners of State Institutions, Howard Kennedy, Henry Gerdes and Silas A. Holcomb: Gentlemen: I have the honor to submit my report for the biennium ending November 30, 1916. The physical condition of the Home has been greatly improved. The grounds have been cleaned up and put in good condition. The "Main Building," size 65 by 200 ft., 4 stories high, and containing 68 large rooms has been cleaned, painted and plastered where needed, and put in general good sanitary condition. The large dining room in the "East Frame Building" has been cleaned and painted and also three other rooms. kThe dairy barn has been very much improved. The lch cows have been put on a plank floor, and the stanchions ve been improved to make them comfortable. They have been numbered and each cow is put in her own place accord - ing to number. Her milk is weighed and a record kept there - of. In this way all the unprofitable boarders have been weeded out. The large driveway had a plank floor, under which was a space of about two and a half feet, wherein was an accumu - lation of slush and filth. The floor has been removed and the space filled in with boiler cinders, leaving the dairy barn in a good sanitary condition. The "Farm Cottage" containing nine rooms has been cleaned, painted and put in good habitable condition. There Burkett, Nebraska </seg>
            <seg id="p004">THE BOARD OF COMMISSIONERS 187 was no place to take care of the farm implements. To over - come this we moved the old ice houses, put a four foot brick foundation under them and also joists and a floor for a room overhead for storage. We now have an implement shed or rather house 20 by 120 ft., which, we believe, will be ade - quate. There was no adequate store room for goods and sup - plies such as men's clothing and ladies' goods and furnish - ings. To overcome this we took the old trunk room 20 by 60 ft., which was unfinished and a dumping place for trash ; put this upon a good foundation ; finished it in good shape ; painted and shelved it ; and also put in steam heat and elec - tric lights. It now makes a commodious store room, rat and mouse proof. There was no barber shop on the place. A barber's chair at the end of one of the halls was inconvenient and without sanitary conveniences. To remedy this we took an old paint shop that was useless and moved it upon the main walk, tributary to all parts of the "Home;" finished it in good shape, and put in hot and cold water, electric lights and steam heat. It is a great convenience to the members and brings the State $100 per year in rent. The little church was in very poor shape. There had been a fire in the church by reason of which the walls and ceilings were black and dingy. It has been cleaned up, calci - mined and is now in good condition. There was no enter - tainment except card playing and other games. We now have a picture show twice a week with good orchestral music which tends to the better temperament of the old folks. The care of the members, food, clothing and other neces - saries have been good and ample. There is a general spirit of good fellowship pervading the "Home" that is gratifying. The hospital under the care of Dr. J. A. Waggener is in good shape, the help is obliging and pains taken with the patients. The sanitation of the place is well cared for and there is general contentment among the patients. The hos - pital on the outside was in a poor condition, we have painted both the brick and woodwork and it is now in presentable </seg>
            <seg id="p005">188 SECOND BIENNIAL REPORT OF condition. We have enlarged and improved our garden fa - cilities to such an extent that we are able to furnish all the garden produce necessary for the "Home." Our statistical report will give the extent of this industry. There is under contract, but not completed, a new system of steam conduits, which will effect a great saving in fuel, as the present system is such that we have to heat too much of the outdoor. Now, honorable gentlemen, I want to express to you my utmost satisfaction for the uniform kind and courteous treatment received at your hands, and the careful attention you have given to the necessities of this "Home" in every de - tail. The "Home" will show to any one, who may see fit to investigate, the results of your good management of this in - stitution. While it has been liberal it has been very eco - nomical. Yours truly, J. F. Walsh Commandant. Burkett, Nebraaka, November SO, 1916. </seg>
