            <seg id="p006">6 No institution lies closer to the people than does the school. This is especially true in rural communities. Since the schools are of first concern they require a large share of time and money for their proper functioning. It is evident that the people do not want to take &amp; backward step but are desirous that their educational system be well abreast of their economic development. In no other way can there be an educational system meeting the need- of the people. The State Department appreciates the responsibilit ment of the schools. In most cases these have been made with special consideration of up-to-date standards. The awakened con - sciousness of an intelligent people and the cooperation of superintend - ents and teachers have made achievement possible. For this the State Superintendent is grateful and is inspired to work with renewed zeal for further advancement in education. INTRODUCTION ministration of the school.-. No effort has been spared to pu:-h for- ward educationally, and extend as far as possible equal educational opportunity. Nebraska measure- up in possibilities to every ideal and purpose for a steady, consistent educational growth. We have a -tate rich in material resources, and a people intelligent anil pro.-perous. While there has been no outstanding development, there have been a number of gratifying achievements. Through the excellent -ervices of our university, collets normal schools and teacher.-' colleges, and high schools, higher professional standards have been attained \&gt; ■ elementary courses of study emphasizing the essentials of a comma* school education, with an organization and a program peculiarly adapted to the rural schools, have been completed and are now being used with excellent results. The rural high school idea has gained ground and the dream of a high school within the reach of evei ] and girl is not beyond probability of fulfillment. With the easing off of the financial stringency of a few years ago the last biennium has witnessed a substantial growth in physical enlargement and improve- </seg>
            <seg id="p007">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 7 SCHOOL HOUSE PLANS The plans that are offered are a few of the very many that could be accepted as standard. The plans suggested here need not be followed exactly. Variations suggested by convenience, economy or taste may be made just so the essential features of light, heat, ventilation, seating and sanitation are kept in mind. The welfare of the child is of first importance and is the determining factor in school hou.se construction. The school house should be as beautiful, as substantial, and as well planned for its purpose as any building in the community. When the building contains features that are neither beautiful nor useful it is ex - travagance. The buildings are designed primarily for school purposes, hut with proper adjustments may be made suitable as community centers also. All class rooms should be lighted from the left of the seated pupils. Rear light is permissible if the windows are placed high, not nearer than six feet from the floor. The room should have the direct sunlight some time during the day. For this reason the east or west light is best. The south exposure should be avoided as far as possible. North ex - posure is good if the light can enter from the west also. The rooms are heated by ventilating room heaters or basement furnaces. The northwest corner of the room is the best location for the room heater. The best shape for the school room is that of a rectangle, the length being from one-fourth to one-fifth greater than the width. The size will depend upon the number of pupils to be provided for. There should be not less than fifteen square feet of floor space and two hun - dred cubic feet of air space for each seated pupil. A room thirty feet long, twenty-three feet wide, and twelve feet high will seat thirty-five or forty pupils; one twenty-seven feet long, twenty-one feet wide, and eleven and one-half feet high will seat thirty pupils; and one twenty - four feet long, nineteen feet wide, and eleven feet high will seat twenty - four pupils. A space five or six feet wide in the front of the room should be reserved for the teacher. The teacher's desk should be In the front of the room. The stairways should be as accessible as possible. The treads should be not less than eight inches wide, and the risers not more than seven inches high. The stairways should be not less than three feet wide with one side rail. The basements should be well lighted and ventilated, and as free from fire hazard as possible. Fuel and furnace rooms should be walled up separately and the walls made of brick or concrete. The basement should be not more than three or four feet under the ground level. This will make excavation for window area unnecessary. Provision should be made for heating the basement. </seg>
            <seg id="p008">8 be !\ ou All measurements are inside and therefore allowance should made for outside walls and partitions. The room measurement- pi are the most economical in the use of lumber. No class room sh be more than twenty-three feet wide. </seg>

This arrangement will enable the teacher to have control over the cloak rooms and will provide a safe and clean place for books and supplies. The stove is replaced with a ventilating heater and the room seated with single desks. This remodeled building will meet the requirements for standardiza - tion. A new building of this simple plan will cost about $2,000. </seg>

The lower plan represents a building without a base - ment and provides for a class room, 21 feet by 27 feet, two cloak rooms, each about 6 feet by 9 feet, and a book room of about the tame size. The room is to be heated by a ventilating room heater. $2,500 will be near the co«t. The upper plan shows a building somewhat larger and should be built with basement.

SCIENCE STUDY high school course should include at least two years ice. The work for the first two years, ninth and mprises two of the four courses outlined below. These are strictly elementary courses which introduce the pupil ience study. It makes little difference which course comes first in ■riculum. The scientific method should be employed in present - h course.^. The courses should be made interesting and practical, h the pupil with a fund of information concerning his every day life. The work in these courses should be so organized that they will not duplicate one another. Care should be gi\en to the selection of the text. In these courses much attention should be given to laboratory and ield lessons. Mere reading courses in these subj,. . will not meet he requirements of approval. AGRICULTURE The course is planned for one semester but may be expanded into two semesters of work. Where two semesters are devoted to it the first should take up the work of soils and field and garden crops; and the second animals and farm management. Much of the work should be observation and experiment and the readings of references and bul - letins. There should be different kinds of texts available. This will cious habit of assigning page lessons from a given text. id t Below is found a list of units of work, briefly outlined, limiting the course in agriculture. The pupil &lt; should make a farm survey of the most importamt units studied. THE COURSE Soils: Formation, kinds, improvement. The Growing Plant: Conditions, germination, propagation, function of roots, stems, leaves. Corn: Seed selection and storage, enemies and methods of control, harvesting, marketing, types and varieties, judging, test, cultural methods. Small Grains: Names, purposes, methods of handling. Forage Crops: Names, purposes, methods of handling. Plant Diseases: Principal ones, damages, methods of control. </seg>
            <seg id="p026">26 Insects: Life history, damage, method of control. Fruits and Vegetables: Kinds, varieties, purpose, propagation, plant - ing, cultivation, storage. Farm Animals: Types and breeds, uses, feeding, judging, improve - ment, housing, marketing. Dairy Production: Dairy breeds, judging, feedintr, housing, record.-, testing milk and cream, marketing. Poultry: Value, purposes, housing, feeding, culling, incubation. Birds: Names, recognition, protection, economic value. Farm Management: Choosing a farm, planning the farm, cropping systems, farm accounts. Farm Sanitation: Location of buildings and wells, waste disposal, heat, light, water. Roads: Drainage, hard surfacing, care, BOTANY For the smaller high schools it is recommended that only one semester be devoted to the study of botany. This should be given durins the second semester. • No attempt has been made to cover the whole field of botany. Tr essential phases only are stressed. The work may be done with a min mum amount of apparatus. While a compound microscope is desirab it is not required. There should be two laboratory periods each week. These should be double recitation periods when necessary. There should be three recitation periods a week. The library should contain several refer - ence books on botany. Work in botany should be based largely on laboratory and field essons. The student finds out many things for himself and uses the )ook for reference and as a supplement to his own work. As a rule he teacher should demonstrate the experiment before the class or a small group of pupils may plan and carry out one experiment and another group another, giving all pupils an opportunity. Each pupil should keep a notebook giving an accurate account of what was done, what happened, and his own conclusions. These notes should form the basis of the class discussions during the recitation period. THE COURSE Seeds- Dissect seeds and study the parts. Make drawings of seeds and of their parts. Test for starch. </seg>

Pupils should press and mount specimens of plants studied. The individual herbarium is not nece?*ary. GENERAL SCIENCE Care should be taken not to duplicate th* course in Physical Geography in this course. You will note that but a few units are of - fered in this course. These should be carefully studied and made as complete a? they appear in the following outline. This course will re - quire much laboratory work. Note the suggestive equipment given in the list for general science. The more difficult parts may be demon - strated by the teacher, but in most cases the pupils will be able to perform the experiments and apply the principles. </seg>

Unless a graduate of an accredited school, a can' didate for admission must be prepared to take examination in those subjects in which entrance credits are desired; provided that graduates of non-accredited four-year high schools may be excused from taking the academic examination by passing an intelligence test with a stand - ing that shows ability to do the work of a college freshman. "Accredited" schools are such as are found to meet the "Standards of Accredited Schools" to a degree that meets the approval of the Uni - versity Committee on Accredited Schools. Standards of Accredited Schools 1. Not less than thirty units required for graduation. 2. At least three teachers, including the superintendent, giving full time to instruction in the high school; provided that in schools having junior-senior organization, at least two teachers, including the superin - tendent, shall give full time to instruction in the senior high school, grades 10-12 inclusive. 3. The minimum academic and professional preparation of at least fifty per cent of the high school teachers equivalent to four years be - yond a four-year high school course. In determining this equivalence, two year= of successful teaching experience closely related to the sub - jects to be taught in the high school will be considered equivalent to one year of higher academic preparation. In schools having junior - senior organization, at least fifty per cent of the teachers in the senior high school, in no case fewer than two, shall meet the academic and professional provisions of this standard. All who instruct in grades to 12 inclusive shall be legally qualified to teach in high schools. 4. Laboratory and library facilities adequate to the needs of in - struction in the subjects taught. 5. The location and construction of the buildings, the lighting, heating and ventilation of the rooms, the nature of the lavatoriea, corridors, closets, water supply, school furniture, apparatus and methods of cleaning such as to insure hygienic conditions for both pupils and teachers. 6. Efficiency of instruction, acquired habits of thought and study, and general intellectual and moral tone of the school such a.&lt; to justify confidence in the work of the school. </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 There is but one list of schools fully accredited to the Universit of Nebraska. A tentative list is issued early in the school year, base. on detailed reports received by October 1. It is subject to change oi .)! data obtained later in the year.

All high school teachers, including junior high school teachers, must hold the high school city state certificate (Uni. Extension News, Vol. 3, No. 51) (Uni. Extension News, Vol. 3, No. 51) </seg>
            <seg id="p083">OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION 83 North Central Association of Accredited High Schools (Uni. Extension News, Vol. 4, No. 6) 1. Thirty points required for graduation. Minimum of three teachers full teaching time in academic sub- jects. (a) The minimum attainments of a teacher of any academic sub - ject, and of the supervisors of teachers of such subjects, shall be equivalent to graduation from a college belonging to the North Central Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools. Such requirements shall not be construed as retroactive. (b) The minimum professional training of a teacher of any academic subject, and the supervisors of teachers of such subjects, shall be eleven semester hours in education. After September 1, 1925, this requirement shall be fifteen semester hours in education. This additional rquirement shall not be construed as retroactive. Factors conditioning the efficiency of instruction are: (1) The pupil-teacher ratio, as shown by the average daily attendance. (2) The number of student hours per teacher. (3) The number of students in a class. The Association recommends the following as norms: (1) Pupil-teacher ratio, 25 per teacher. (2) The number of classes taught by the teacher, 5 daily. (3) The number of students in a class, 25. An average attendance in excess of 30 pupils per teacher, or more than one hundred sixty pupil-hours per teacher per day, or more than six periods per day for any teacher shall be considered as a violation of this standard. For interpreting this standard in connection with laboratory work in science, and in connection with study room supervision, a double period may be counted as the equivalent of one class room exercise for teachers of academic subjects, provided that no combination of such work amounting to more than thirty-five periods a week be required of any teacher.
