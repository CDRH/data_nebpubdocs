            <seg id="p007">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL State of Nebraska, Legal Department. Lincoln, Nebraska, January 4, 1923. To the Hon. Samuel R. MeKelvie, Governor of the State of Nebraska, Lincoln, Xcbraska. Sir: Pursuant to law I am herewith submitting a report of my acts and doings as Attorney General covering the |H*riod from January 6, 1921, to January 4, 1923. The vari - ous doings of this department may be set forth under the following headings: Appropriations The present appropriations made for the maintenance of the State's legal department are adequate and sufficient to carry on the work of the department. In normal times they might be materially decreased, but during the present disturbed condition of affairs large appropriations to the law enforcement agencies are a precaution that may well be taken. It is impossible to estimate a week in advance what emergencies may arise necessitating a considerable outlay of money to enforce the law or to adequately pro - tect the State's interests. Advisory Work Under the law the Attorney General is the official counsel for all of the departments of the state government. 7 </seg>
            <seg id="p008">I REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL With the abolition of boards and commissions and the substitution of executive departments, I have constantly noted an increasing tendency to consult with the legal de - partment on all matters of importance. The result has been that the legal department has shared the more serious troubles of almost every department of the state. The burden of this advisory work may lte estimated from the fact that the number of advisory opinions written during the last two years run into the thousands, and seem to grow year by year. Public Utilities Thanks to the very efficient work of Mr. Lainaster, who has been counsel to the state railway commission dur - ing the last two year*, many of the burdens of public utility litigation have l&amp;#187;een lifted from the other members of the office. However, the last three months have seen suits begun by the Burlington Railroad and the North western Railroad contesting their taxation levies for the year 1922. Both roads claim that their properties are over-valued for the purposes of taxation. I am glad to report that in the United States District Court decrees have been entered in favor of the State against both these corporations. The amount involved in this litigation amounted to more than a million dollars of the State's revenue. The Northwestern Bell Telephone Company are now engaged in a suit in the Federal courts testing the validity of an order of the State Railway Commission fixing a rate schedule for the Company. This litigation is. at pres - ent, pending without determination. Fraudulent Stock Promotions The years 1919 and 1920 brought to Nebraska the greatest era of wildcat promotion enterprises that the state has ever seen. The years 1921 and 1922 brought </seg>
            <seg id="p009">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 9 the depression and collapse of these enterprises. A little invent igat ion sufficed to convince me that a large number of these concerns were conceived in fraud and foisted upon the public by misrepresentation. Therefore, at my sugges - tion, the District Court of Douglas County convened a grand jury in September, 1921, of which I personally assumed the role of prosecuting attorney. Ultimately, there were thirty-seven men indicted by this grand jury on charges of embezzlement, fraud, conspiracy, etc. In Janu - ary, 1922, because of the conditions of affair* exposed in Douglas County, a similar grand jury was convened in Lancaster County, as a result of which more than a score of other persons were indicted on similar charges. Pol - lowing these events, on representations made to the United States Department of Justice, Federal grand juries have been convened, as a result of which more than one hundred jH'tsons, including practically all of the persons indicted in the state courts, have been indicted in the Federal courts for using the mails to defraud. The preparation of these cast's for trial, and trial of them, is a task much greater than might be supposed. Two cast's have l&amp;gt;een tried in Douglas County, the shortest of which consumed four weeks. A similar amount of time will probably be required on most of the others. The result has been that I had determined to accept the suggestion made by the Attorney General of the United States that these cases should be tried in the Federal courts rather than in the state (((Hits, because in the Federal courts the defendants are not entitled to a separate trial, and it is possible to try ten or even twenty -five defendants in one case, greatly minimizing labor and expense. This situation is more fully treated in the legislative recommendations following this report. It will suffice to say that so far as it has been possible to do so I have endeavored to make business in Nebraska obey the law. I have endeavored to illustrate to the people that no man is so large in the field of business or the field of corporate finance that he is not amenable to the law. </seg>
            <seg id="p010">10 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Irrigation Litigation The protection of the rights of water users in Ne - braska, as against the encroachment of states higher up the stream, is one of the great problems of the state at the Cent time. The general situation is set forth in my rt rendered to you two years ago. Since that time the Supreme Court of the United States has handed down a decision in the Colorado-Wyoming litigation sustaining in large part the position of the state of Wyoming as against the state of Colorado, completely negativating the doctrine of Colorado that Colorado is the absolute owner of all the waters of interstate streams and can do with them as she will. The result of this decision may well l&amp;#187;e to precipitate EMisivc litigation between Nebraska and Colorado and oming over their encroachments of the waters of the mblican River and the North and South Platte Rivera. This litigation is, of course, tremendously complicated and expensive and will result in great delay. Early in 1921 the State of Colorado, through its legislature, duly pro - vided for the appointment of a commission to arbitrate, if possible, the claims of adjoining states in the waters of streams arising in Colorado. This Colorado commission, in conjunction with commissions from six other states, has at last arrived at a complete interstate treaty govern - ing the rights of the Colorado rivers. Colorado is now proposing that Nebraska appoint a similar commission with authority to enter into an interstate treaty, defining the rights of Colorado and Nebraska in the streams in ques - tion. Pursuant to that general plan, informally and with - out authority of law, Mr. Robert H. Willis, Chief of the Bureau of Irrigation, Department of Public Works, State of Nebraska, and myself, as Attorney General, were ap - pointed to confer with the Colorado commission. Thig we have done from time to time, going into the various controversies as best we might. The result has been that an interstate treaty between Colorado and Nebraska is in the process of preparation, and it is hopeful that it may </seg>
            <seg id="p011">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 11 be submitted to the Nebraska legislature" of 1923. I am thoroughly convinced that if any fair understanding can be arrived at, that the treatment of this subject by an interstate compact is, by far, the most satisfactory and orderly method of dealing with it, saving both labor and expense and giving that harmony of administration which is necessary to the successful use of this water. The de - velopment of large projects lower down the Platte River at Gothenburg, Lexington, Kearney, Holdrege, and Hast - ings, has been carefully considered by the legal department in all of the work it has done in this very important field. Prohibition The enforcement of the prohibitory law is one of the great problems of the day. I am convinced that just in proportion as it is enforced, just so long will we have good government, and that just so far as there is a general disinclination to enforce the law or to violate it, that we are undermining the fundamentals of good government. For that reason, we have constantly been on the alert to aid and encourage the enforcement of prohibition. The last legislature materially amended the prohibitory law. The constitutionality of the amended law was questioned. The District Court held the law unconstitutional. The state legal department appealed the matter to the Supreme Court which upheld the constitutionality of the act. The legal department, during the last two years, has drafted most of the new prohibitory legislation and has earnestly sought, by co-operation with state and local officials, to make more effective law enforcement. Americanization The 1919 session of the Nebraska legislature passed an Americanization program among which was the now famous Siman law. This act aimed at prohibiting the </seg>
            <seg id="p012">12 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL teaching of foreign languages to young children, stopped the holding of foreign language public meetings, and raised materially educational standards of the state. It will be recalled that this act was attacked in the courts and later sustained. The 1J)21 legislature passed what has be - come known as the Reed-Norval act, together with several collateral measures providing a still more complete pro - gram of Americanization, attempting to force private and parochial schools to the same requirements as public schools, retaining the prohibition against foreign languages, to - gether with other acts, all primarily intended to create better American citizens, to familiarize America's children with the English language and with American ideals first, to prevent so far as possible having these young people grow up in America under the domination of a foreign lan - guage and foreign custom and ideas. This Americanization program has also l&amp;#187;een bitterly attacked. It lias been my duty to defend it and it has so far l&amp;gt;een sustained in the Supreme Court of Nebraska. The complaining parties are now preparing to appeal it to the Supreme Court of the United Htates. It is worth noting that there are more than a dozen other states who have adopted a similar pro - gram of Americanization and that the great majority of these programs have lieen sustained by the courts as Iteing thoroughly within the constitutional power of the legis - lature, and each tending to promote the "peace, morals, and welfare of the community". Legislative Recommendations Immediately following this rejtort are set forth a series of recommendations which may well be transmitted to the legislature for their consideration. Each of them is self-explanatory. Conclusion The last two years have been a particularly trying time for one in public office, especially for one in an office </seg>
            <seg id="p013">REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL 13 &amp;#171; charged with the enforcement of law. The financial de - pression of 1920 and 1921 has left its imprint on the affairs of the banks, insurance companies, corporations, railroads, private individuals, and almost every phase of state activity. The many problems that have arisen are without precedent. In many places it has been necessary to hew a new path. This I have tried to do, with the sole purpose of protecting the rights of the state and of her people, enforcing the law impartially and consistently, fre - quently in the face of most intense opposition and the ut - most pressure that could be brought to bear against law enforcement. The compensation can only come from a s&amp;#171;'iis&amp;lt;' of having at all times done the utmost in the con - scientious performance of duty and the service of the people. It is with that sense upon me that I am ex - pressing nay appreciation of the uniform courtesy and co - operation that has at all times existed between yourself, us Governor, and the legal department of the state during the four years that I have had the pleasure of presiding over that department.

            <seg id="p015">LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS </seg>
            <seg id="p016"/>
            <seg id="p017">To t)u lion, Smnud R. McKelvie, Governor of the State of Nebraska Lincoln. Nebraska. Nil- Two years ago in my biennial report I took upon myself the responsibility of suggesting certain measures of statutory law to the legislature in the form of four letters to the Governor. The measures carefully outlined at that time were: 1. A new Bureau of Securities act. II. An act providing the lowers, duties, and procedure of the Board of Pardons. III. An act regulating the head - lights on automobiles. IV. An act providing for a State Bureau of Investigation and Identification. I have had the satisfaction of having all of these recommendations enacted into statutory law, and have watched their operation during the last two years with much interest. In the main, I believe they represent progress in their various fields. I have, therefore, deter - mined that there are some other legislative recommendafions which ought to Ik* submitted by me at this time and called to the attention of the legislature. They are as follows: Abolition of the Right to Separate Trial The state law provides, at the present time, that when two or more are indicted for conspiracy, or for a joint offense, that each of them may claim the right to a separate trial. This has been the rule since the beginning of the state, and in the great majority of cases it is a right which ought to be protected. Later developments, how - ever, have caused' classes of cases to arise where this right to separate trial is simply an obstruction in the path of justice. This is particularly true of the modern indictments 17 </seg>
            <seg id="p018">1* REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL for conspiracies of one kind and another. The most glaring examples exist in Douglas County at the present time. A grand jury there has indicted some forty people charged with various kinds of financial crimes. These indictments run in groups. For instance, all the officers of a company may be charged with a conspiracy to do a particular thing. The evidence against all of them may be identical and yet, under the present law it may be necessary for the state to produce the identical evidence six or eight or ten times against separate defendants. 1 sit no harm that could come, under those circumstances from compelling the de - fendants to stand ;i joint trial. There is, for instance, one case of the docket of the District Court of Douglas Count v. tried by my office, the trial of which cost, approximately, Ten Thousand Dollars, for witnesses, auditors, expenses of judges, juries, etc. There are four other men charged with exactly the same offense, against whom all of this evidence will ultimately be used. The trial of this matter consumed almost five weeks. Is there any reason why the five defendants should not have been tried at the same time, with the same Ten Thousand Dollars, instead of spending twenty-five weeks and Fifty Thousand Dollars? *I was glad to note that the Nebraska Bar Association at its meeting in Omaha, December 30th, passed a resolu - tion favoring the change which I am herein proposing. The rule suggested is not new. It has long been the law in the Federal courts. I earnestly suggest that the Federal law ought to be adopted in a state statute which provides, in substance, that when two or more persons are indicted jointly, or for conspiracy, that it rests in the discretion of the trial court whether or not they are entitled to separate trials. A General Criminal Savings Clause This is a most important recommendation. We have on our statute I&amp;gt;ooks a general statute which provides that whenever the legislature shall change the statutory law </seg>
            <seg id="p019">LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS 19 all actions, rights of action, or rights, that may have been accrued under the old law, shall be saved and protected under the new. It is my opinion that this applies to crim - inal eama, but the matter is in litigation in the courts and is open to some question. Almost every session of the legislature finds a tampering with some phase of the criminal code. Kach time a change is made it leaves open to question whether or not the change has not excused all previous offenders. Certainly the legislature never intends to do this, but in the eyes of the law and under the rules of law a change in the statute may imply this intention. Therefore, it seems to me that an act ought to be passed providing, in substance, that wherever a crim - inal statute is enacted that changes any pre-existing crim - inal statute, that all crimes and offenses committed under the old law are saved and may be prosecuted as though the old law had not been amended or repealed. Miscellaneous There is a conflict between Sections 5159 and 5272 of the 1913 Revised Statutes. Section 5159 provides that it requires a majority of three-fifths of the electors voting to enable the issuance of bonds, while Section 5272 pro - vides that authority may be granted by a majority vote of the qualified electors of the city voting on the propo - sition, etc. There is a conflict between Sections 1925 and 1926 of the 1922 Compiled Statutes, as these were amended by Chapter 192 of the 1921 Session Laws, which statute pro - vides for an election board of eight members, while the other provides for an election board of nine members. Section 6192 of the 1922 Compiled Statutes provides that the interest on all funds deposited by the county treasurer shall go to the general fund of the county. Pro - vision should be made whereby interest on school funds shall go to the school district to which the funds belong. </seg>
            <seg id="p020">20 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL There is a conflict concerning whether initiative and referendum proposals should be submitted on a ballot separate from the ballot on which the names of the partisan candidates for state offices appear. The Maple ballot following Section 1941 and Section 2283 of the 1922 Com - piled Statutes would indicate that the initiative and refer - endum proposals should not be submitted on a separate ballot, while Section 1940 of the 1922 Compiled Statutes indicates that such proposals should be submitted on a separate ballot. This conflict should l&amp;gt;e eliminated. The time when referred acts of the legislature, which have been introduced by the people should become laws is not absolutely plain. The expression in Section 2286 of the 1922 Compiled Statutes "Completion of the Canvass" should be amplified by showing whether the action of the State Canvassing Board or the canvassing by the legislature is referred to. In addition to this no definition can be found in the constitution or statutes of the constitutional majority of those voting- The majority necessary to sustain a referred act of the legislature should 1m* made definite and certain. Sections 9824 to 9S28 inclusive of the 1922 Coin - piled Statutes have l&amp;gt;een held unconstitutional bv our state supreme court. However, a statute from another state, which was very similar, was later carried to the United States supreme court and sustained. Therefore, this statute should either be repealed, as it is now not in force, or reinacted. A girl, sixteen years of age, was committed to the Girls Industrial School at Geneva under Section 117:? of the 1922 Compiled Statutes. The officers allowed her to spend one night at home before being taken to the institution, and before she was returned to the custody of the officers she was married. The court released her under Section 1182 of the 1922 Compiled Statutes, which provides in part : "In no case shall a child be confined after he or she shall have reached the age of majority.'' It would </seg>
            <seg id="p021">LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS 21 be well for the legislature to enact a law to provide that the marriage of a ward of the slate would Ik* absolutely void unless permission was secured from the proper authority. It would seem that the proper authority in the case of wards of most of the state institutions should be the Board of Control, and the wards in the penitentiary and the men's reformatory should get the consent of the State Pardon Hoard. The situation could be remedied in another way. The legislature might provide that the marriage of a person under the age of 21 years, who was a ward of the state, would not end the minority of such person. (Note Sections 7383, 7:?7!&amp;#187; and 1252, 1922 C. S. are in conflict.) The majority which is necessary to change a county organization from supervisor to township form of govern - ment is not the same as the majority required to change a county organization from the township to the supervisor form of government. Section 889 of the 1922 Compiled Statutes provides that when the question of township organization is submitted that a majority of the voters are necessary to carry the election, while Section 980 of the 1922 Compiled Statutes provides that the township supervisor system may be discontinued by a majority of the electors voting on the question of continuance. Section 7408. of the 1!)22 Compiled Statutes provides that the officers making arrests and serving warrants for violation of the fish and game law shall be entitled to one - half the tines imposed and collected for violation of the act, while Section 5 of Article VII of the present Con - stitution of Nebraska provides: "All fines, penalties and license moneys, arising under the general laws of the state, shall belong and be paid over to the counties respec - tively, where the same may be levied or imposed, and all fines, penalties and license moneys arising under the rules, by-laws, or ordinances of cities, villages, towns, precincts, or other municipal subdivision less than p county, shall belong and be paid over to the same respectively. All such fines, penalties and license moneys shall be appropriated exclusively to the use and support of the common schools in the respective sub - divisions where the same may accrue." </seg>
            <seg id="p022">22 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL Anti-Discrimination Law We have on our books a statute that, in substance, prohibits individuals or corporations who are engaged in buying products over the state from paying more at one place than they do at another, for the purpose of stifling local competition. This statute was aimed at the old practice of large business interests paying a high price for products at places where there was competition and so eliminating that competition, and paying a low price at a place where they had a monopoly of the field. The last two years have seen much complaint that this statute is being violated. At the same time, the statute itself is none too clear. It is very difficult for the state to prove the motives that actuate these variations in prices. It also is difficult to interpret the statute as to whether its violation must be long standing and continuous or whether the mere violation for a day constitutes an offense. So far as I am aware, there have been no convictions under the present act. I suggest that it should l&amp;gt;e redrawn. made definite, clear and positive in its provisions. I be - lieve it will have a salutarv effect in nianv lines of com - merce and will protect many local industries. Increased Penalty on Criminal Violations The task of enforcement of prohibitory legislation is difficult at best, and it seems to me that the punish - ments under the present law are not severe enough. Espe - cially is this true of first offenders who are in the class of professional violators. It will be recalled that the customary penalty in these circumstances is only $100.00 and costs. It seems to me that this ought to be increased to a severe sentence, even for first offenders, where the offense is the selling of liquor or the operation of distilling apparatus where the same is being used for the purpose of making sales. In other words, on the professional boot - legger, whether he be manufacturing or selling, it seems to </seg>
            <seg id="p023">LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS 23 me a jail sentence ought to be imposed, while the private individual not in the professional class, for mere possession, might be left with the present penalty. The enforcement of prohibition constitutes the big problem of both the state and federal governments, at the present time. If law and order are to prevail, if the government is to continue to function, ultimately this law and all others must be enforced, and whatever may be done to encourage its enforcement and to minimize its violation should receive the careful consideration of all legislators. Deposits of Public Funds in Banks It will be recalled that the present laws provide that a county treasurer may only deposit in a state bank an it mount equal to fifty per cent of the bank's capital. This statute is a remnant of the old law before we had the bank guaranty fund. It served a useful purpose at that time, and it may still be useful, but I find a firm iK'lief among both the county treasurers and the bankers that so long as public funds and all other deposits are protected by an adequate guaranty law, that there is little reason for the restriction on the treasurer's deposits. It is also true that repeatedly during the last two years various county treasurers have almost of necessity exceeded this limit. For instance, the situation has not been unusual where the county funds which the treasurer was required to deposit somewhere exceeded more than half the capital stock of all the banks in the county. Certainly this general situation should receive some attention. Expediting Justice There is too much delay in the procedure under the criminal code. It is possible for a criminal case, which is bitterly contested, to take more than two years from the date it is begun until a final judgment is rendered in the </seg>
            <seg id="p024">24 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL supreme court. This is too long. It ought to be possible to complete the entire procedure in not exceeding three months. Certainly six months is long enough in any event. I believe there is too much time given the defendants to file appeals and prepare transcripts. The present law allows a definite time after the end of the term at which the judgment or verdict is rendered. Quite frequently in the smaller counties in the state the court has only two or three terms a year. It is Incoming customary to not adjourn these terms but to leave one of them open until the next begins. The result is that quite frequently it is three or four months after judgment in the district court before the defendant makes any move towards perfecting his appeal to the supreme court. I see little reason why the defendant should not l&amp;gt;e required to proceed with his appeal within thirty days after judgment is rendered in the district court, instead of allowing him three months Ser the adjournment of the term. This general problem speeding up justice in the criiuiiiiil courts is u matter ich might well be made the subject of an exhaustive inquiry during the next two years. It is one of the Eikest points in American jurisprudence, a place in ch we are much inferior to most of the other civilized ntries. I think we are over-technical and over-careful of the rights of the defendant, and too little interested in the rights of the state. Conclusion The foregoing recommendations are submitted to the legislature with a sincere belief that their enactment into law will not only make the task of law enforcement simpler. but will be of real service to the people of Nebraska in protecting their rights against malefactors of one kind or another.

Note: The following recommendation regarding changes in the corporate laws, was submitted to me by Mr. Jacobson, who for four years has been counsel to the Bureau of Securities. Because of its length and of its importance, it is being printed separately and proper credit being given to its author. CLARENCE A. DAVIS. The statutes of the state pertaining to the organiza - tion and conduct of general corporations, found prin - cipally in Chapter 12, Compiled Statutes for 1922, are badly in need of revision. These statutes in the main were enacted many yean ago. But few changes have l&amp;#187;eeii made notwithstanding the fact that conditions have changed very materially. The state has just lately reached the stage where its business interests are quite generally utilizing the corporate method of doing business. Cor - poration laws properly drawn and in accord with existing conditions arc of great importance to the state at this time. Practically a complete revision of the existing stat - utes will 1k&amp;#187; necessary in order to bring this about. The present statutes are indefinite in many respects, confusing and with conflicting and duplicate reports to be made to different offices and officers. The administration of the law at the present time is committed to several state offices or officers, unduly adding to the confusion and difficulty of operating a corporation within the law and of enforcing the law. By way of illustrating the situation, attention is di - rected to the following sections of the Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for 1922: Section 441 requires that the company publish a full, fair and detailed statement of the condition of the com - pany. Section 471 require* the company to publish notice annually of the amount of all existing debts of the cor - poration, providing further a penal liability upon stock- 2.". </seg>
            <seg id="p026">M REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL holders for the failure to publish the notice. Section 480 requires that the notice published under Section 470 with affidavit in proof of publication attached shall be filed with the county clerk's office within ten days from the date of the last publication of such notice. No such filing is required of the notice published under Section 441. Both notices cover practically the same ground and serve prin - cipally to confuse those persons charged with the active conduct of the company's business. Article 3 of Chapter 12, which includes Sections 4S1 to 485, seems to be a special statute authorizing the in - corporation and operation of manufacturing companies. Special provisions are made for the organization and opera - tion of this class of corporations, which seems to be entirely unnecessary and to serve no particular purpose. For in - stance the date of the annual meeting of stockholders is fixed upon the first Monday in .January. The statute ap - parently does not contemplate filing the articles of incor - poration of such companies with the local county clerk. The statutes also fix the minimum amount of stock which must be subscribed before the company may com - mence operations, whatever the language means. No practical reason seems to exist for this special stat - feand in fact its provisions do not seem to l&amp;gt;e generally wn or in any event are not generally regarded. It is to be noted that the last two sections, that is Sections 484 and 485 of this statute have to do with labeling binder twine and fixing a penalty for the failure to label. Section 462 fixes the maximum indebtedness which a corporation may incur at an amount not exceeding two - thirds of the capital stock. No specific penalty is attached for the violation of this statute and it is very generally disregarded, instances having been noted where a corpora - tion's indebtedness is five or six times the total amount of its capital stock when under its statute the maximum should have been not to exceed two-thirds of the capital stock. </seg>
            <seg id="p027">LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS 27 Article 5 of this chapter, Sections 494 to 497 inclusive, apparently is a special statute authorizing the incorpora - tion of a company for the purpose of holding real estate, issuing bonds thereon and borrowing money for the use of said corporation. This statute and its purpose are not clear and apparently cannot be ascertained either from the statute itself or the use which has been made of same, which has been negligible by reason of the uncertainty of incorporating and operating a business under- an indefinite statute. That some sort of a statute of this character ig necessary and of considerable importance is clear when the fact is considered that the only authority for Nebrask; - corporations to hold real estate is limited to such real es - tate as may l&amp;gt;e necessary for the legitimate business of the corporation. A further illustration of the situation may be found in Sections 577 to 585 relative to the incorporation and ojH*ration of detective associations. This statute is also entirely indefinite and uncertain, subject to all sorts of construction and subjected to all sorts of uses. This stat - ute is utilized quite generally by a certain class of in - dividuals who professionally operate this character of busi - ness. Illustrations of this sort could be continued at great length but these are sufficient to show just what the situa - tion is. Added to this is the fact that the administration and enforcement of the corporate law is committed to so many different offices and officials, which adds further dif - ficulty and confusion. One dealing with corporations in Nebraska must do business with the office of the secre - tary of state, the county clerk, the state auditor, the state treasurer, the secretary of the department of trade and commerce, the attorney general, the bureau of securities, the register of deeds, the tax commissioner and other of - fices and officials. In fact in some instances in single transactions it is necessary under the present law to deal with two or more offices. </seg>
            <seg id="p028">2x REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The Constitution of the State. Section 1, Article lL\ directs the Legislature to provide by general law for the or - ganization, regulation, supervision and general control of all corporations. In order to carry out the injunction of the Constitution in an effective and satisfactory manner it will l&amp;gt;e necessary to revise the corporate statutes in the light of existing conditions, cutting out duplication of re - ports, contlictions in authority, clarifying and making the provisions thereof definite and certain and clearly applic - able to the class or character of business to l&amp;gt;e incorpor - ated and oj&amp;gt;erated thereunder, and the administration ami enforcement insofar as possible committed to one depart - ment, officer or office. The Securities Act found in Seel ions SI 14 to S14JJ in - clusive. Compiled Statutes of Nebraska for I!t22, should Ik - amended in certain respects. Section 8115 pertaining to exemptions should Ik* broadened somewhat and certain exemptions clarified. This section should contain in addi tion to the exemptions already found therein an exemption for securities listed upon the New York, Boston, and Chi - cago stock exchanges. This exemption of course does a\va.\ with the possibility of the Nebraska law eliminating any fraud which may l&amp;gt;e found in such securities, however the minimum of fraud is found in the securities listed upon these exchanges. It seems clear that these securities are of Ruch character that qualification of same upon these ex - changes should warrant unrestricted trading in same. Certain of the exemptions stated in this section might be clarified and made more definite and certain : for in - stance, sub-sections "f" and "j" pertaining to non-profit bearing securities issued by Itenevolent organizations and the sale of securities by the individual owner thereof. Where a foreign concern conies into the State of Ne - braska for the purpose of selling its securities and for this rrpose only it appears that the law might well be amended such fashion that the power of attorney filed bv such foreign corporation for purposes of service of process might </seg>
            <seg id="p029">LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS 29 well be limited to the service of process in actions growing out of the siile of securities. The law should l&amp;#187;e aiuended changing the fee basis entirely. Fees should l&amp;gt;e charged upon the basis of the amount of securities authorized to l&amp;gt;e issued and sold. The usual charge is fifty cents j&amp;gt;er one thousand dollars worth of securities with a minimum charge of ten dollars and a maximum charge of one hundred dollars. Also the fees for making of copies of the record and documents filed should l&amp;#187;e raised very materially. All fees collected should be reappropriated for the use of the department, which would reduce the net cost to the state very materially and make the operation of the department a negligible factor insofar as taxation is concerned. An addition should l&amp;gt;e made to the act by proper amendment providing for the registration of dealers in se - curities as such, that is the registration of persons or firms engaged in the business of buying, selling and handling se - curities which are exempt from the provisions of the Se - curities Act. Two primary reasons exist for this: first, in order to prevent good securities l&amp;gt;eing handled in a fraudu - lent manner, and second, to give the legitimate dealers pro - tection from unfair competition. Such registration should lie obtainable upon proper application made setting out the qualifications of the dealer, his experience, reputation and character, both as to personal and business, the class of se - curities handled, location and such other information as the department might require. A proper fee should be charged for the filing of such application and the registration. The registration should be effective for one year from the date of entry and renewable upon further application made. It is to be noted that this is the demand of securities dealers in other older and more populous states dealing more generally in securities than is done in Nebraska. The suggestion is that of the dealers themselves for the two principal purposes above enumerated and apears to be worthy and practical. </seg>
            <seg id="p030">30 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL The injunctive feature of the law should be greatly en - larged. The department should be given statutory au - thority for the bringing and prosecution of injunction pro - ceedings. It should also be given authority to issue in - junctive orders so that in the event some person or firm is engaged in issuing or selling securities, or some other transaction which is of a suspicious character and which Iinot be gotten at in any other manner by reason of the k of jurisdiction or otherwise, the department should in position and have statutory authority to issue an order oining further operation of the particular project, trans - ion or persons, for a stated period of time pending fur - t investigation, and should have full authority to make I conduct such investigation and issue a permanent order injunction, require the qualification of the securities sold the taking of such other action as might be found to be necessary xipon investigation. Section 8120 should be amended providing that any Eiority granted or conferred by the Securities Depart t should be by order in writing under seal and formally uted irrespective of the purpose or object of the order or the authority conferred or the circumstances leading up to it. Some question having been raised as to the saving clause in the original enactment, House Roll 408, Chapter 308, Session Laws of Nebraska for 1921. a proj&amp;gt;er saving clause should be appended to and made a part of the amendments made. These various matters relating to l&amp;gt;oth the general in - corporation statutes and the securities act, while of im - portance sufficient to warrant their recommendation to the Legislature and action thereon by the Legislature, are not of as great importance as the matter of amending the law, both the general corporation statutes and the securities act, in such fashion that so-called "tramp corporations'' cannot be brought into existence under the laws of Nebraska and that filings cannot be made only partially complying with </seg>
            <seg id="p031">LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS 31 the law and then the promoters of the project proceed to do business as a corporation and to take subscriptions for sale and issue various sorts of securities and then claim that they are relieved from personal liability because of the pretended corporate charter and plead ignorance of the law to those persons whose money they have taken. Cor - recting the law in this respect is of paramount importance. As the law now stands articles of incorporation or amendments thereto can be filed in the office of the secre - tary of state before or at the same time that the applica - tion for authority to issue or sell stock is filed with the securities department or in fact can be filed without mak - ing any application at all. In the past a considerable num - ber of articles of incorporation have been filed in the of - fice of the secretary of state and the concern then pro - ceeded to operate as a corporation and to take subscrip - tions for. issue and sell alleged corporate stock, in some in - stances taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Ne - braska citizens in exchange for absolutely worthless stock. The securities department has no opportunity to do any - thing in the way of preventing the fraud. The secretary of state's office under the existing law is helpless. That office as the law now stands acts in a purely ministerial capacity nnd must accept and file anything in the way of articles of incorporation which may be presented for filing as long as the incorporators verify their signatures before a notary public or other officer. Under the present law all that can be done under these circumstances is to enforce the penal provisions thereof. Usually the evidence necessary to do this cannot be obrained or the cost of obtaining evidence and prosecuting tht cases is prohibitive. Quo warranto does not provide an adequate remedy. The corporate charter may be cancelled but the damage has already been done and the person who has done business with such concerns or parted with money for its stock is still faced with having to l&amp;gt;ear the expense and uncertainty of instituting legal action for the recovery </seg>
            <seg id="p032">32 REPORT OF ATTORNEY GENERAL of whatever can be found, which is in fact nothing hut a fishing expedition. The general incorporation statutes and particularly Sec - tion 4(51 Compiled Statutes for 1922 should he amended in such fashion that articles of incorporation could not be filed in either the office of the secretary of state or the county clerk or in any other office until written approval thereof had l&amp;gt;een first obtained from the proper state de - partment having jurisdiction over the particular class of corporations, their business ami securities. This approval should 1m' in writing, properly executed by the department as a part of its approval of the proposed company's appli - cation for authority to do business as a corporation, issue and sell its securities and transact business and should In - presented with the articles of incorporation or amendments. and constitute the authority tor the secretary of state and the county clerk to accept articles of incorporation or amendments for filing. It is to be noted that this is the common method of procedure in other states and also ii this state insofar as certain classes of corporati to the jurisdiction of other state departments an Attention is directed to the fact that the I'.H'I of the Legislature made this provision with refe the incorporation of insurance companies. This m procedure is not an innovation, but a method of p resulting from experience, is well tried and a m common sense. The amendment in this regard should provide specifically that articles of incorporation or amendments relating to corporate stock filed without such written approval, in nowise cut off personal liability or create a corporation of any sort or create any capita] stock or in anywise affect or change the class or character of existing capital stock or have any effect whatsoever and that insofar as any pre - tended corporate charter is concerned same should be void where obtained in this manner. The law to this effect should include and apply with equal force to any and all </seg>
            <seg id="p033">LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS 33 amendments to articles of incorporation filed or offered for tiling having to do with the increase of corporate capital stock or changing the class or character of the existing corporate capital stock. In conjunction with this amendment to the general cor - poration statutes a further amendment should be made to the securities act to the effect that where any securities are issued or sold or subscriptions taken therefor, which secur - ities or the company issuing or selling same were subject to the provisions of the securities act, but the transaction whether it be the subscription, issue or sale &amp;#171;was consum - iiuited without compliance with the securities act are void- In order to 1k&amp;gt; fully effective such enactment or amendment must include the subscription, the sale, the issue ajid the security itself and must provide specifically that all are void where the transaction is consummated without first com - plying with the law. This amendment should further provide that any person into whose hands such void securities may fall in the usual course of business has a right of action for the recovery of the money or consideration paid therefor as in an action for money had and received with the legal right to recover not only against the person or concern taking the subscrip - tion and making the sale but as against the issuing com - pany, the promoters, incorporators, officers, directors and any and all persons connected with the issuing concern or responsible for, participating in or having to do with the purported subscription, issue or sale. The statutory provision that the subscription, issuance, sale and the security itself subscribed, sold or issued in vio - lation of the law or without complying with the law are each void is a necessary adjunct to requiring full compli - ance with the law l&amp;gt;efore issuing a corporate charter. This prevents flooding the country with bogus corporations and worthless securities and gives the purchaser who has been induced to do business with such concerns or to buy their securities at least an opportunity to recover his money with- </seg>

However, little or no definite information was available concerning this mat - ter. In order that the lawmakers, law enforcement offi - cials and the public might know the facts, it was decided to make a crime survey of the state of Nebraska covering the last four years. While I had desired to obtain a com - plete record of all the criminal prosecutions during this time, it was impossible to obtain extensive and accurate reports of prosecutions, other than those conducted by the members of this department ami the county attorneys. On September 11, lirJL*. there was sent to each county attor - ney in the state blank forms covering each of the last four years together with a letter which read in part : "With your co-operation I intend to incorporate into a biennial report of this department, a comparative survey of the crime situation in Nebraska. As far as I know, no such survey has ever been made and I think you will agree with me that such a comparative survey corerlng the last four years, would not only be very interesting but very valuable. It will be well worth our time and trouble in compiling it "The plan is to obtain from each county attorney s.para of their offices for the last four years, that is, one report to cover from October 1, 1918 to October 1, 1919, another covering from October 1, 1919 to October 1, 1920, another covering from October 1. 1920 to October 1, 1921. and the last covering from October 1. 1921 to October X, 1922. "The reason for making October 1st a starting point order for these reports to be consolidated into our biennial report. w&amp;#171; must have them by November 1st. "We are attempting this survey in addition to the required duties of this department in the hope that accurate records may be obtained, which will be of great benefit to furture legislatures and law enforcement officers. You may be sure that your co-operation in this matter will be appreciated and that you will be given credit for your assistance in the published summarized report.

I tear Sir : The solution of the question as to the proper recipient &amp;#9632;&amp;#187;( indemnity paid for tubercular mortgaged cattle is found in section 7, chapter 2it, Laws 1921. This section provides that when animals are destroyed pursuant to the the tubercular livestock indemnity act that pl-OVISlOl he representative of your department shall take reasonable &amp;#8226;recautions to ascertain whether there are any mortgages iens outstanding against the animals and if there are, t siiliinit full report concerning the same, together with Htatement showing what arrangements, if any, have been made to discharge the outstanding lien against the animals destroyed." This statement I would suggest should be signed by both the mortgagor and the mortgagee, and in itself solves the problem as to whom you should pay the indemnity. I would pay no indemnity in default of such a statement . Yours very trulv OLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General. MASON WHEELER, Assistant Attorney General. I'.v April 24, U&amp;#187;22 K </seg>
            <seg id="p088">86 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Anti-discrimination &amp;#8212; Complaint Directed to Creamery Companies To tht President ami Hoard of Director*: This is a letter which is l&amp;gt;eing written to each of the half dozen large creamery companies operating in Ne - braska. For more than a year this office has been receiving con - stant complaint from small, independent concerns through - out the state that there was an apparent attempt on the part of the large creamery interests by a system of discrim - ination and unfair competition to stifle ami put out of busi - ness, if possible, these small companies. Your company is doubtless aware that the Nebraska statutes prohibit a com pany which operates stations at several points from paying a different price at one point than that which is paid at another, making allowance for the difference in freight rates, for the purpose of injuring a competitor. Several analyses of the price scale maintained by the various large creamery companies throughout different sections of the state have convinced me that the price scale maintained is not uniform among the various towns; that there is a wide variance in the (trice paid for these products at towns a very short distance apart. Whether this variance is occasioned by a desire to stifle local com - petition is not certain, but it is worthy of note that in most canes the highest prices are paid where a local creamery is in oj&amp;gt;eration. This can only lead to the conclusion that the large creamery interests are attempting to pursue a pol - icy of stifling local competition.

Laws of Nebraska, 1!H7, that it is the duty of the State Auditor to draw all warrants upon the Treasurer for money, except only in cases otherwise expressly provided for l&amp;gt;.v law. It therefore follows if express provision is made for payment by another mode that no warrant from the State Auditor is required. The law provides : "Payments from the special reserve of the depositors' guaranty fund .all be made by the State Treasurer upon orders from the department. tate Treasurer shall convert the investment of the special the depositors' guaranty fund into money or such portion may be necessary to satisfy such orders, the special reserve shall be considered a part of the depositors' guarantee fund whenever the department shall draw against said fund as provided in Section 53 of this Chapter, and the department shall issue an order to the State Treasurer for payment of the prorated share thereof." Accordingly it is the opinion of this department that you should pay out the funds of this special reserve in accordance with the orders of the department, which should be in accord with the provisions of Section 53.

Dear Sir: With reference to Section 10, Page 7 of the compiled banking laws of Nebraska for the year HH'l which section requires hank directors to own in their own name and right a certain amount of the capital stock, and in answer to your question as to whether this requirement which was enacted into law in 1009 applies to the directors of such hanks that were organised l&amp;gt;efore the passage of this act will sttae that it is my opinion this requirement must l&amp;gt;e complied with by all l&amp;gt;ank directors affected by this section who have l&amp;gt;een elected or re-elected after the passage of the act.

            <seg id="p099">OPINIONS 97 Banks nt on bank stock runs against the stock and not against the An a individua Mr. T. M. Patterson, Plattsinouth, Nebr Dear Sir: Regarding the special assessment which may he levied against hank stock for the purpose of repair- ing the credit of a hank, as authorized by Section 5 of Chapter l!i&amp;#187;T of the 1921 Session Laws, this section gives the directors the power to levy assessments on the stock for pairing the credit of the hank, and any y that may occur l&amp;#187;v reason of the impairment of said hank. (|titstiou you raised in our conversation was whether i ssiiK ni amounted to an assessment against the i assessment against the individual. In this say the law specifically provides that the assess- the stock and that if the owner of such stock fails h assessment a sufficient amount of stock may for the purpose of raising the amount of the assess You also inquired as to whether the proceeds of tht ng insufficient to pay the amount of the assess - tockholders would he liable for the deficiency. tit nk such liability would exist, for the reason above the assessment is an assessment on As to the stockholder's double liability will say that do not think that a stockholder mav be relieved of such holder's liability bv the mere selling of his stock in the manner provided by this law, and for the purpose of rais- ing an assessment when the bank immediately fails there- after. It got s without saying that a stockholder knowing that his hank is in a perilous condition may not escape the stockholder's liability by transferring his stock, for which reason I think that he would be equally precluded from avoiding such liability by consenting to the sale of that stick in the manner provided in this law. </seg>
            <seg id="p100">98 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Therefore in the particular case in which you arc interested will say that the director* may levy an assessment against the stock and sell enough of such stock to pay the assessment, hut if the proceeds of the stock sold were insufficient to pay the amount of such as - sessment I hardly think they would have recourse against the individual. After this assessment has been levied if the hank should he thrown into the hands of a receiver 1 think the stockholder whose stock was sold conk be held on his double liability under the theory that he con - sented to the sale of his stock by refusing to pay the assess inent. being at all times await that the bank was in an unstable condition.

The question is: Must "A" pay the entire amount owed on his note to the hauk or may he have credited on the note the amount of his general claim against the bank. I do not </seg>
            <seg id="p101">OPINIONS 99 find that our court has passed on this question in recent years, but I ani satisfied that "A" has a right to setoff the amount of his general claim against the amount of his debt to the bank, assuming of course that his general claim was in existence at the time the bank was a going concern. Section 7U7N. Revised Statutes, 1913 provides: "When cross-demands have existed between persons under such l one had brought an action against the other a ff could have been set up, neither can be deprived neflt thereof by the assignment or death of the other, but the be deemed compensated so far as they equal each a In the case of Salladin v. Mitchell. 42 Xebr. 861, it appears that the defendant, Mitchell, was indebted to the X. W. Hanking Co., such indebtedness being secured by a mortgage. Before the failure of the bank Mitchell sold the mortgaged premises to one "B", "B" deposited in the said bank a certain sum of money to the credit of Mitchell. The bank paid from this money deposited to Mitchell's credit certain taxes and interest due from Mitchell, and issued to Mitchell a certificate of deposit in his favor for the balance. This amount was still due from the banking company to Mitchell at the time of the assignment, and Mitchell sought to setoff this amount against the amount ii the mortgage Tlie main question involved was whether Mitchell had the right to have the amount of his credit with the bank at the time of the assignment applied in satisfaction of his indebtedness to the bank. The Supreme Court in discussing the question and the meaning of the term "assignment" as set out in the code section, above referred to as Section 7678, held that this term is used by the legislature in the sense in which it is ( mployed in proceedings in bankruptcy and Insol - vency. The court further held that the right of setoff could be insisted upon independent of the code section, for the reason that this right existed before the adoption </seg>
            <seg id="p102">100 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL of the code, and that the assignee succeeded to the rights of the insolvent hank as they existed on the date of the assignment, and no other or greater rights. This subject is covered to considerable extent in a note set out in Annotated Cases. 1!H &amp;#187;&amp;gt;-!&amp;gt;. on Pa^c ."iitit. Tin trend of the authority, as indicated by the cases referred to therein, shows that the general accepted view is that t he illowance of such set off is not the creation of a preference but on the other hand is an ascertainment of the just amount dut from the debtor. The authorities seem t igree lli.it ,i demand held by an insolvent bank against a third )&amp;gt;( tsi.ii is an asset of the bank only insofar as ther may l&amp;#187;e a balance due upon the same after deducting what ever the bank may be owing the person against whom t tit demand is held. The reasoning employed by the courts in arriving at this conclusion is in substance to the effect that tlu assignment to the receiver passes the right an property of the corporation in the same condition subject to the saint equities as the corporation held them: that the receivers are not assignees for a valuab di deration. The strong argument in favor of this general rule is that then is no equity in putting a debtor of the bank, who lias a just and legal netoff as against th poration in a worse position and the creditors in a position by the failure of the hank and the appointment of a receiver. To allow this right of setoff, there of cours* must be a mutuality of debts and credits between th&amp;lt; parties, as of the date of the insolvency I cannot see that the passage of tin Guaranty Act would in any manner change this rule of setoff, since the rights of netflff as between the debtor and creditor must l&amp;gt;e considered to have become fixed before the date of in - solvency. The mere fact that the Guaranty Act makes provision as to preferred and general creditors could in my opinion have no bearing upon the right of setoff, which had accrued in the debtor at the time of the insolvency. </seg>

We are very reluctan' bout writing this letter, as we cannot dose our eyes to he fact that in many cases, this so-called right of setoff has been insisted upon to the prejudice of the insolver and the Guaranty Fund. A number of cases have arisen when certain banks holding bills payable against the insolvent bank and also carrying funds of the insolvent bank have insisted upon this proposition of setoff, and the banking department has in all cases taken the position that the bank holding such hills payable should release sucli sums as are in their hands to the receiver of the bank and should stand on their bills payable along with the other general creditors. For this reason I hope that the matter can be passed upon by our Supreme Court. Attorney General. By JACKSON B.

            <seg id="p104">REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL 102 Banks Letter concerning handling of state banks in the hand ver Hon. John B. Raprr, District Judge, Pmwnee City, Xebt Dear Sir: With the number of bank failures which we have had in the state during the last year and a half, involving as they do some $&amp;gt;:i,00( 1,0(1(1 of assets which the Depositors' (iuaranty Fund has paid to the depositors of these banks, and out of which assets the Guaranty Fund must reimburse itself, if possible, the problem of efficient management of these receiverships has become quite acute. All of the receivers hit men who have been selected by the Hankers' Association with the sole thought in mind I hat they were the l&amp;gt;est available men to handle the receiver - ships. The Department of Trade and Commerce and my own Department have deferred largely to the wishes of the Hankers' Association in the choice of these receivers. Our feeling has been that since the bankers had paid the ile - positors, that morally they own the remaining assets; that whatever reimbursement thev received had to come out &amp;gt;! of these assets, and that it was their own responsibility to make the most out of the process of liquidation. I feel that our receivers are on the wholt fcient work in the face of the general financia ion which lias made collections almost impossible. I do in feel, however, that we are now securing the uniformity of action on the part of receivers that we should. Also, there are great possibilities of assisting various receivers, through other receivers, in the sale of real estate, the exchange of assets and other business matters. The Banking Department and my own office have felt for some time that the designation of some person with no other duties than that of counseling with and assist ing the receivers would be a desirable thing. Such a man would amount to a specialist in the handling of these matters, in the working out of the complicated transactions which are involved in almost everv failed bank, and would </seg>
            <seg id="p105">OPINIONS 103 be a valuable spur to the receivers to do their most efficient work. The designation of some such person has been ap - proved bv ilic Bankers' Association and I think by almost iniliar with the general situation. It has been VI eatedly said that the Banking Department ought to hire h a man. hut the last Legislature did not appropriate anything bul the regular salaries to the Banking Depart - ment, and tlicv have no funds with which to hire such an lal executive and need all of their regular force and &amp;#8226; handle routine matters. The suggest inn has therefore been made that such iperintendent of receiverships be selected, and that carefully over the business of the various receiver - is frequently as possible, spending a few days with tctivcr. as it becomes possible, or as his services valuable in helping the receiver solve some I am therefore writing this letter to ask your idea the feasibility of the plan, and more especially whether you think it would be a proper allowance that this superin - tendent of receivership* should prorate his expenses and a nsonablc salary and file claims against the various re - iverships in proportion to the time he spends working with them. Our office is convinced of the legality of such remit it d the receivership, but we desire, if possible, an expression from the various district judges as to how they would view such a procedure as a matter of policy before we undertake it. If you think the plan outlined herein would be of benefit to tin Guaranty Fnnd as a whole by providing uniformity of action, additional incentive and supervision of receiverships, and the bringing into each case of a man who has specialized on these problems, I would be very glad if you would so advise me, and if most of the judges feel that the plan would help the Guaranty Fund and help them iiisc it is in payment for services actually </seg>

Attention: Frank Mwert Dear .Mr. Myers: Referring to your inquiry con - cerning binding twine, which is lieing sold in this state with tags attached such as you enclose, you are advised that it is the opinion of this department that these tags do not comply with the Nebraska law. Section ."&amp;gt;!&amp;#187;() of the Revised Statutes of 1913 read "A stamp or label shall be placed on every ball of binder twine eold, exposed or offered for sale in this state, giving the name of the manufacturer or importer, the number of feet to the pound in such ball, the material from which it is made, the tensile strength, and the per cent of oil it contains and the date cf inanufactur Section 591 reads : "Every manufacturer, importer or dealer, who fails to comply with the provisions of the next preceding 3ection, shall upon conviction, be liable to a fine of twenty-five cents for each and every ball sold, offered or exposed for sale; PROVIDED, however, the deficiency in length shall not exceed 5'v of the amount as stated on the label or stamp as herein provided." The tag does not comply with the law in that it does not state "the number of feet to the pound in such ball." All of the other requirements have at least been colorably complied with.

            <seg id="p109">OPINIONS 107 On opinion is that the word "shall" as used is man - datory in the sense that it directs that secretarial duties shall be performed in the department, and provides as to the amount that shall Im&amp;#187; paid the secretary who performs such duties. In other words, this section requires that the secretarial duties shall be performed and that the salary paid to the secretary shall be $1,800.00 a year and no more.

            <seg id="p120">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL be limited. The problem is to define the limitation. The section in its forepart sets forth a general limitation ostens - ibly covering every type of corporation. However, this is qualified in the central and in the latter part of the section by certain proviso clauses, which provisos apparently ex - empt certain specific types of corporations from the appli - cation of the general statement. The provisos exempt in a degree insurance companies, banks and loan and trust companies. It will In* noted thai these latter types of cor - porations constitute what are generally termed as "mon - eyed" corporations as differentiated between that type of corporation and the general trading or manufacturing Cporation. The section itself is incorporated under the icle pertaining to the organization of corporations or what is often termed the "general enabling act". The article complete constitutes the primary and general foun - tain head of |iower granted by the state for the purposi - of the creation of corporations. As a part of the general article and at section 583 it is specifically provided that "any violation of the provisions of this article shall cause a forfeiture of all the privileges conferred by the same. and the court may proceed to close the a Hairs of the cor - poration, by an information for that purpose." This article is in turn followed by other articles, such latter articles setting forth specific legislation for the creation and con - trol of special types of corporations. Article I. being the general enabling act, must accordingly l&amp;gt;e construed most strictly against the corporation claiming advantage of the powers conferred by it, and in favor of the public ami any powers not clearly granted under the article are to be regarded as implicdly withheld. (See sec. 77:?, chap. 20, vol. II. Fletcher Cyc. of Corporations and Cases therein cited i . As before stated, section 569 has for its ostensible purpose the limitation of corporate indebtedness. The reasoning back of such limitation is obvious. Generally speaking there are four practical reasons for such limita - tion, these reasons having been developed out of the general </seg>
            <seg id="p121">OPINIONS 119 commercial development of this country and from the decisions rendered in jurisdictions where statute* of limi - tation of this character are plain. Briefly stated these reasons are. (1 ) for the protection of creditors and persons dealing with corporations in the extension of credit; (2) the protection of stockholders who may purchase stock or who have purchased stock; (3) the protection of the gen - eral psblic, even though the public may not l&amp;gt;e directly interested in the affairs of the corporation, as has been bo fittingly said by one of the courts, such a limitation is &amp;#8226;&amp;#8226;to protect the public, as insolvent, irresponsible corporate trading bodies would be more apt to break and thereby endanger credit and stability"; the fourth reason is that of an express deviation from the common law rule pertaining to the indebtedness of corporations. Under the common law and in the absence of charter restrictions a corporation could incur indebtedness in excess of its capital stock. (See Kerry v. .Merchants Exchange Co., 1 Sandf. Ch. N. Y. 280: Roger v. Danbv I'niversalist Soc. V.) Vt. 187 I. Now, taking up the section in question for the purpose if attempting its interpretation in accordance with the stablished rules of statutory interpretation we would of course in the first instance give to the language utilized in the section that interpretation which would be consistent with a common and accepted meaning of such terms. The section seems to be very clear with exception of the defini - tion of the term "capital stock". We have noted the com - mon meaning attributed to said term, the general purpose of the sectit n is obvious, the reasoning back of such statute is as stated, and beyond question the section is subject to a strict construction in behalf of the public and against the- user thereof. In view of these things we would appar - ently be justified in placing a construction upon the term "capital stock" which would be consistent with the com - mon meaning attributed thereto. Such a meaning would give to the section a strict construction in favor of the public and would be consistent with the common reason- </seg>
            <seg id="p122">120 REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ing back of such sections. However, let us go further and me whether or not the legislative body of this state has utilized the term "capital stock" in other sections of the statute and whether or not such usage has been consistent in meaning, and if consistent in meaning, whether such &amp;#9632;&amp;#9632;age is &amp;lt;nnsistent with the meaning commonly attributed to the t&amp;#171; 1 m as hereinbefore set forth. For our general pur - ptmt- in this n-spect it will undoubtedly be sufficient to examine only these sections of the statute included within that portion of the statutes devoted exclusively to corpora - tions, to-wit, chapter 14 and running from article. I to and including article XXI. The legislature utilized the term "capital stock" in C following sections and manner. The term is used in tion ,"i31 and the section clearly indicates that the capital stock therein referred to means outstanding capital rk. The same situation is true with regard to sections 580. .".ST. 588, 592, 601, 625, 626, 698, 720, sub-sections | and .! of section I of article XV, sections 742, 743, 746, 74&amp;gt;. 75n. 712 and 715. In fact in most of these sections the legislative ImmIv has used such terms in connection with capital stock as "fully paid in", "paid up", ''subscribed" and "issued". In other sections of the statutes the use of the term "capital stock", although not expressly quali - fied, clearly indicates that the subscribed or paid up capital Btock is referred to. The term is also used in sections 572, r.::v r.N!&amp;#187;. ."&amp;#187;!&amp;#187;:{, 762. 765. subsection (h) of section 2, article XXI. in a manner which clearly indicates that in those sections the legislature intended the use of the term to refer to the authorized or nominal capital stock of the corporation as apart from the paid in or subscribed capital stock. In the latter sections the legislative body specific - ally used words of limitation such as "authorized" and "unsubscribed". Summarizing with regard to the sections noted it will be found that the term "capital stock" was utilized in the majority of instances without express words of limitation, </seg>
            <seg id="p123">OPINIONS 121 but in a manner clearly indicating the legislative intention that the term as lined should be defined as paid in or sub - scribed capital stock. While in the minority instance, towit, in seven sections, the legislative body utilized the term "capital stock" together with express words of limi - tation and in a manner indicating that it intended that the Urm should mean nominal or authorized capital stock. In other words, the general use of the term by the legis - lative lwidy indicates that where the term was so used that it was intended to refer to paid in or subscribed capital stock, and in the rare instances where it was utilized in a contrary manner specific words of limitation were inserted in conenction with the use of the term. Hence, from this analysis it would appear that the term "capital stock" where used throughout the statutory sections was used in a manner and with a meaning consistent with the com - mon accept ion of said term as developed throughout the country. Another point involved in the interpretation of this section is that of the necessity of giving to the section such a meaning as will in the majority instance be certain in application, definite, and such as will render the section difficult to evade. If the section is construed to have ap - plication only to the authorized or nominal capital stock of corporations, such a construction would not be in accordance with the common meaning attributed to the term "capital stock"; such a construction would be a liberal one and not consistent with the domestic legisla - tive use of the term and would render the application of the section uncertain, indefinite and subject to subter - fuge and evasion. Such a construction would not carry out the reasons heretofore enumerated underlying such action. For instance, if the term "capital stock" as used means authorized or nominal capital stock, then there would 1m virtually no reason for the section. The common deviate therefrom there would be no purpose in adopting law rule is well established, and if it is not intended to </seg>
            <seg id="p124">122 REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL this section. Corporation* could evade the application of the section at their will. Whenever their indebtedness reached a point where it might possibly exceed two-thirds of the par value of the nominal capital stock, all they would have to do to rectify the situation would be to in - crease the amount of their nominal capital stock. Credit - on depending upon such limitation would be at the mercy of Biich corporations, likewise stockholders. Corporations could l&amp;#187;e incorporated in such a manner as to never be embarrasst d by the application of this section. There is no limitation imposed by the statutes of this state with regard to the amount of nominal capital stock which a corporation may have. Such amount can run into bil - lions of dollars in par value. If the common meaning attributed to the term "capi - tal stock" applied to the section, to-wit, subscril&amp;gt;ed or paid in capital stock, such meaning would give t&amp;#171;&amp;gt; the section a strict construction in favor of the public; it would make the section definite in application; certain in application: the limitation prescribed easy of ascertain - ment; not subject the section to easy evasion; and would give the stockholders, creditors and the general pnblic essential protection. It would likewise constitute a devia - tion from the common law rule and give to the section as a whole a force and effect which it would not otherwise have, and without which the necessity for such section would lie nil. It should also W noted that this particular section has its primary application when and at such time as the corporation coming under it actually commences and transacts business. It is more than a mere statute of organizaticn ; it is a statute of control after organization. It |x rtains to the indebtedness created by the corporation in the transaction of its business. This being true, a practical interpretation of the statute would 1k&amp;gt; to give to the term "capital stock" the meaning subscribed or paid </seg>
            <seg id="p125">OPINIONS 123 in capital stock as it is upon the money rightfully due or in the hands of the corporation upon which business is transacted. This money is the measure in a financial way of the ability of the corporation. It is the connecting feature between prospects and actualities. Having in mind the fact that the statute has application at the time ihe corporation commences business and thereafter during the transaction of the business of the corporation, we can refer to the common law rule with regard to the ne - cessity of the subscription of stock prior to the com - mencement of business by corporations. The common law rule in this regard is also the stated rule of law in Nebraska. Under the common law rule, a corporation having a fixed amount of capital divided into shares of a certain amount each could not proceed with the execution of its main object until all its capital was subscribed unless it was clearly provided that it might do so with a less subscription than the amount fixed by the charter. Our Supreme Court in the case of Livsey v. Omaha Hotel Co.. .") Neb. ."&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;. stated as follows: "When the charter or subscription contract specifically fixes the capital stock at a certain amount divided into shares of a certain amount each the whole amount of capital so fixed and required for the main design of the company must be fully secured by a bona fide subscription before an action will lie upon the personal contract of subscribers to stock to recover an assessment levied on the shares of stock unless there is some clear provision in the contract to proceed in the execution of the main design with a less subscription than the whole amount of capital specified. This rule seems to be founded on the principle that by the terms of the grant to the corporation it is essential to the power of assessment for the general objects and purposes of the institution that the whole capital stock required by the condition precedent must be represented and acted upon by the assessment. This doctrine has underwent an exhaustive discussion in many cases and it is not deemed necessary to bring into review the arguments in support of it." The court cites cases in support of this doctrine, states it to be the English rule and the common law rule, and further states. </seg>
            <seg id="p126">124 REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL tTbe presumption is that the legislature had in their minds this ion law doctrine then so well established and understood." (See 79 Xeb. 591 and Macfarland v. Association 53 Neb. 417: Hale v. jrn, 16 Neb. 1; Hurds v. Improvement Co., 35 Neb. 263. Iii other words, this section has application in the Ejor instance at the time and after a corporation pro - ds with the general transaction of its business. In el to proceed with the transaction of its business, both at common law and under the rule of law in this stale. it must hive subscribed capital. This subscribed capital must reprt si nt its credit worth, and until capital is so subscribed it cannot legally commence the transaction of busint ss, and when it (Iihs so commence the transaction of buninos, thin this statute must have its application and have application to the funds upon which the business is transacted and these funds are primarily gained through the snbsci ipticn of capital stock. And if it is true as the court has stated, that the legislature must have had the common law rule in mind in the enactment of the general corporation statutes, then surely it must be presumed that the legislature in the use of the term "capital stock" in - tended that the term, unless specifically qualified, meant "subscribed capital stock". As hereinbefore noted, sections of t hi character of section 5P&amp;gt;9 have for their ostensible purpose the protec - tion of creditors, stockholders and the general public, or as has been stated by some of the authorities, such statutes have been set up for the purpose of "a check on improvi - dent management", and if this is the reasoning back of such statutes, then truly the statutes must have applica - tion to subscribed capital stock and not merely nominal capital stock. Our Supreme Court in the case of Hamilton National Rank v. American Loan and Trust Co., fifi Xeb. B7. had occasion to give consideration to section ofifl of our statutes and in its opinion the court clearly considered the fact that this section was intended as a protective measure for the public as a whole. The court in passing </seg>
            <seg id="p127">OPINIONS 125 on the section throws additional light on the subject of what the legislative body must have had in mind at the time the section was adopted. The court draws attention to sections 4 and 7 of Article XII of the constitution of the tate. The sections are here quoted ases of claims against corporations and joint stock Every stockholder in a banking corporation or institution lually responsible and liable to its creditors over and ;il above the amount ci stock by him held to an amount equal to his respective stock or shares so held, for all its liabilities accruing while he remains such stockholder, and all banking corporations shall publish quarterly statements under oath of their assets and liabilities." The court draws attention to the various phases of liability undertaken by stockholders in the different types of corporations specified under the constitutional provisions. It draws attention to the fact that in the moneyed corpora - tions, to-wit. banks, insurance companies and loan asso - ciations, the stockholders are liable not only for the 100% represented by their investment in stock, but an additional 100 f r . AVhereas in the general trading corporations the stockholders are liable only for the unpaid portion of their subscriptions to the capital stock. In referring to this sec - tion of our statutes the court stated as follows: "By the terms of this section it was obligatory upon every cor - poration to set out in its articles of incorporation the amount of in - debtedness which it was authorized to contract. This, in all corpora - tions, except banks and banking institutions and insurance companies, was limited to two-thirds of its capital stock, the legislature no doubt having in mind the constitutional provision which we have quoted, which made the stockholders liable to the creditors of the bank over and above the stock by them held, to an amount equal to their respective shares; while by section 4, article XI, of the constitution, stockholders in other classes of corporations are only made liable to creditors of the corpora - tion to the extent of the amount of remaining due and unpaid on their subscriptions to stock." issociations. the exact amount justly due shall be first ascertained, and s sfter tne corporate ircperty shall have been exhausted the original jubscribers thereof shall be individually liable to the extent of their .npaitl subscription, and the liability for the unpaid subscription shall ollow the stock." </seg>
            <seg id="p128">126 REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL This decision of our court further bears out the theory that the legislative body of this state had in mind the ne - ci-ssity of creating a definite credit margin which must not be exceeded by corporations. In the one case, to-wit, moneyed institutions, owing to the range of liability exist - ing against stockholders therein, the maximum limitation of indebtedness could be extended to a point beyond that pertaining to general trading corporations. Hence the provisos in section 569 of the statutes. On the other hand, owing to the limited liability resting against stockholders in general trading corporations, the maximum indebtedness is lowered to a point more consistent with such stock - holders' liability. In other words, the legislature must have had in mind what it considered a fair margin of safety for the public, creditors and stockholders in the matter of corporate indebtedness and that the legislature must have also had in mind the common law rule concerning the necessity for subscription to the authorized capital stock of a corporation prior to the transaction of its busi - ness, and that having these things in mind, the legislature certainly must have intended that the measure of indebted - ness which could be created by corporations must lie limited to a point of safety commensurate with the liability of the stockholders of corporations and that such liability must be measured by the actual capital subscril&amp;gt;ed or invested in the corporation. There is yet another feature which seems to bear out this statement that the legislative body must have had in mind the common law rule pertaining to the necessity of subscription for capital stock prior to the transaction of business, and that by using the tern "capital stock" in a general way the legislative body intended that such term should mean subscribed or paid in capital stock, for the reason that certain specific sections of the statutes pertaining to the organization of special types of corpora - tions specifically gives to such corporations the right to commence the transaction of business when an amount of </seg>
            <seg id="p129">OPINIONS 127 ( capital stock less than the amount of authorized capital stock has been subscribed. For instance see sections 58!), 593 ami Kill of the 1913 Revised Statutes. Undoubtedly the granting of these specific privileges is a clear indica - tion of the legislature's intention with regard to the mean - ing of the term "capital stock" and its understanding that in the general instance the capital stock of a corporation means the subscribed capital stock representative of the funds with which the corporation will transact its business. So far in this discussion the discussion has been con - fined to ;i general comparison of the statutes of the state wherein the term "capital stock" has been utilized, the decisions &amp;lt;f our own court, and now it will be well to turn attention to what the courts of other jurisdictions have de - cided in cases involving the interpretation of statutes of analogous character. In the case of Lehigh Ave. By. Ap - peal, Pa. 5 LRA :UJ7, it appeared that the articles of a street railway company provided that "the said company shall have the power and authority to borrow money in any sum or sums not exceeding in amount one-half of the par value of the capital stock". Ten per cent of the capital was paid in and the company proposed to issue l&amp;gt;onds in a sum not equal to one-half of its authorized capital but greatly exceeding that proportion of the amount of capital actually paid in. A suit was brought to enjoin the issuance of the bonds except for a sum equal to one - half of the capital paid in and it was held that the suit could be maintained. The court said in part: "Whether it be for the purpose of adjusting and paying dividends to stockholders or of regulating the amount of taxes due to munici - palities having the right and power to tax, the amount paid is the capital stock of the company. Neither the cost of the road nor the authorized capital can be made the basis of dividends or taxation, but these must rest on the amount of capital actually paid in. The company appar - ently proposes to exercise the power and incur a liability upon the basis of its capital stock and for this purpose, as for purposes of taxation or payment of dividends, its rights must be measured not by nominal or authorized capital, but by the actual amount of capital paid in."

City of Philadel - phia, 49 Pa. 351, the case involved these facts : An - action of assumpsit by the city against the company to recover alleged taxes due upon dividends paid, recovery iig sued under a provision of law reading. "And the said ipany shall annually pay into the treasury of the city Philadelphia for the use of said city whenever the idends shall exceed six per centum per annum on the ital st&amp;lt;M-k. the sum of six per centum on the dividends &amp;#9632; declared." The company claimed the term "capital &amp;#8226;k" meant "authorized capital stock". Prior to this case company had paid some taxes on the basis of paid up ital stock. The court held the tax to be based upon ital stock paid in Mi stated. "la this particular case feel sure that the law meant just what the company ught it. did &amp;#8212; that dividends were due to capital and not to mere moonshine". It has l&amp;gt;een held that a limitation of the indebtedness of a corporation to the par value of the "capital stock" or to a certain proportion thereof, is to be construed as meaning the capital stock actually paid up and not the authorized capital stock. Paid up capital stock within the meaning of ihese provisions includes both the original issue of stock which has been paid up and amounts added to any steak dividends from time to time out of the profits earned by the corporation and the aggregate amount of paid up stock so determined limits the extent of the power of the corporation to incur indebtedness. (See Cunning - ham v. German Ins. Bank, 101 Fed. 977). There are any mini tier of casts in the various jurisdic - tions involving the question of whether or not the excess of such limitations constitute an ultra vires or illegal act and whether or not a corporation can l&amp;gt;e compelled to pay an excessive indebtedness so created. In virtually all of the cases read the courts did not directly interpret </seg>
            <seg id="p131">OPINIONS 129 any particular statutory provisions so far as giving an express meaning to the term ''capital stock" is concerned. However, in virtually every case the effect of each case is to by implication give to the term "capital stock" under such statutory provisions the meaning of paid up or sub- Klibed capital stock. These cases are particularly prev - alent in the Iowa jurisdiction where a statute of similar nature to that of Nebraska is in effect. These cases are not cited for the reason that they do not involve the direct interpretation of the words "capital stock" and that the court does not set down a definition of the term in that connection. In various of the cases counsel for both sides of the (piestion apparently admit that the term "capital stock" means subscribed or paid up capital stock. The effect of all this is that apparently only in a very few cases have statutes of this nature l&amp;gt;een called upon for interpretation as to whether or not the capital stock re - ferred to is authorised capital stock or subscribed capital stock, the general practise seeming to be that such sections refer to paid up capital stock. Now. sumurizing the points developed it will be noted that the com bob acceptation of the term "capital stock" means subscribed or paid in capital stock. The legisla - ture of this state has used the term "capital stock" in a consistent manner and in a manner consistent with the common meaning of the term, and if any other than the common meaning is applied it will be found that the legis - lative use of the term then becomes grossly inconsistent. Only through the acceptance of the common meaning can a strict interpretation be properly applied to this section. To apply to this section and the term thereof the meaning "authorized capital stock" would mean a liberal construc - tion against the public and in behalf of the corporation claiming advantage of the effect of the statutes. Through the medium of application of the common meaning of the term to the term as used in section 569 of the statutes, the section then Incomes certain of application and difficult of </seg>
            <seg id="p132">130 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL evasion. Contrary use of the term renders the section uncertain in application and subject to evasion. By at - tributing the common meaning to the term "capital stock" as iisid in the section, we tarry out the ostensible purpose of the section so far as deviation from the common law rule is concerned. If we apply a meaning which would constitute the term "capital stock" as authorized capital stock, then we have not deviated from t,he common law rule and we have deliberately destroyed the fundamental reas - oning back of the enactment of such statutes as the section under construction. If we give to this section and the terms thereof the common meaning attributed in other jurisdictions with regard to the term "capital stock", such a meaning is then consistent with the theory espoused by onr Nebraska Supreme Court in the Livesey case, the American Bank case and others as hereinbefore referred to. Otherwise it would l&amp;gt;e inconsistent with the theory of the court. By attributing to the term "capital stock" the common meaning as given by other jurisdictions we are able to give definite protection to the creditors, stockhold - ers and the general public and to provide a check on im - provident management and to prevent corporations from borrowing money upon empty credit and to prevent their pledging as a security that which is not in being and which has no measurable value. If these things l&amp;#187;e true and if this interpretation is correct, then Nebraska corporations not specifically ex - empted from the operation of section ~&amp;#187;Wi&amp;#187; must not incnr indebtedness in excess of two-thirds of their sub - scribed capital stock. A violation in this respect will sub - ject such corporations to the forfeiture of their charters. as provided under section 5H3 of the ltlS Revised Statutes. and plainly the creation of such excessive indebtedness wonld be ultra vires, if not in some cases, illegal.

It is quite clear that your concern could not sell the stock of the issuing corporation or company without ob - taining the agent's license therefor. Individuals are en - titled under the law to sell the stock owned by them pro - viding same is sold within certain limitations set forth in the act. The exemption stated in sub-section h of section 12 of the act, that is, article 120, chapter 1!MI session laws of Nebraska, 1919, apparently applies to sale of stock by an individual owning the stock. I take it, however, that such individual could not legally and lawfully proceed to sell his stuck by and thru the medium of wide publicity, the appoint nun I of a number of agents and making of a con - tinued series of sales and at an expense in excess of '!'/&amp;lt; of the sale price. Such a course of procedure would seem to Ik' clearly not in the usual course of business or in good faith. However, assuming that the individual maken the ;ale within the limitations set out in this provision, it would eem that he would have the right to appoint an agent to act for him in such sale. This I realize is a very close question and possibly may lie said to be "splitting hairs" but it seems to me that the real test is the bona tides of the transaction, that is, is it in the usual course of business and in good faith. As 1 understand your situation your concern would merely list this stock for sale upon your bill boards or otherwise and act as the go-between between the owner of the stock and the prospective purchaser, receiving a commission for your services from either one or both parties. It would seem that ordinarily under these circumstances the relation of your concern to the owner of the stock offer - ing it for sale would l&amp;gt;e that of an agent and it would seem to me that as long as the transaction is kept within the limitations above stated, that it would not fall within the provisions of the act. </seg>

It appears that the Legislature exercised care and cau - tion in drawing the particular section in view of the well - known fact that this is one of the most frequently utilized means employed as a subterfuge and evasion of the law and for this reason, made this particular act as stringent as it is.

            <seg id="p146">144 REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Just what application this decision has to the question at hand is not clear. The opinion states the sole question presented on the record is whether a state law is uncon - stitutional which revokes licenses to a foreign corporation to do business within the state because while doing only a domestic business in the state it resorts to the Federal Court sitting in the state. Appellee was a Missouri cor - poration licensed and doing business in Arkansas. The Arkansas statute provided for the revocation of licenses of foreign corporations to do business in the state when and after they removed causes to the Federal Courts. Appellee had brought an original action and had removed a cause to the Federal Courl from the State Court. The court held this statute unconstitutional as violating Article :J. Section 2 and Sections 1 and :{ of the 14th amendment of the Federal Constitution. The opinion states that cases before the Supreme Court touching the power of a state to exclude a foreign corporation and the Federal constitutional right of such foreign corporation to resort to the Federal courts could not be reconciled, that the principle established is that a state may not in imposing conditions upon the privilege of a foreign corporation doing business in the state exact from it a waiver of the exercise of its constitutional right to resort to the Federal courts or thereafter withdraw the privilege of doing business because of its exercise of such right whether waived in advance or not. The principle does not depend for its application on the character of the business the corporation does, whether state or interstate. It rests on the ground that the Federal Constitution con - fers upon citizens of one state the right to resort to Federal courts in another, that state action whether legislative or executive necessarily calculated to curtail the free exercise of the right thus secured is void because the sovereign power of a state in excluding foreign corporations, as in the exer - cise of all others of its sovereign powers, is subject to the limitation of the supreme fundamental law. This case seems to follow the general rule covering this proposition, </seg>

Str. 3969, which does not in any wise cut off or restrict the right of each state to prescribe the conditions upon which foreign corporations may come into the state as long as certain specific constitutional provisions are not violated, which will be hereinafter pointed out. The attitude of the department should be that the securities act and all other state legislation is constitutional and enforceable and it should be so considered in all action taken by the department until such time as the court has pointed out that the particular legislation or some par - ticular part thereof is unconstitutional. The question as to whether or not anv legislative enactment is unconsti - tutional should not be determined by any executive or administrative body. This question is properly submitted to and determined by the proper court and until so declared unconstitutional such bodies must consider enactments under which they operate and which they enforce as con - stitutional enactments. The following general rules are pertinent and directly applicable to the proposition involved and are taken from the text mentioned later rather than citing the adjudicated cases upon which same are based for the reason that same are general rules and supported by such a large number of decisions that it is impractical to cite all of same or to sift out particular cases until such time as specific points are raised. The supporting citations are, however, in - tended to be included as the basis of the rule stated. No attempt is made to quote the text exactly but only that portion which seems to apply.

(Mi the contrary it is well settled that a corporation has the power, subject to charter or statutory restrictions and limitations, to act through its officers or other agents in any other state with its express or implied permission (14 &amp;lt;\ &amp;#8226;). Sec. 421.1 Chaiter or statutory provisions may, however, ex - pressly or iinpliedly prohibit a corporation from doing business, making contracts or doing other acts beyond the limit of the state, or may contain regulations affecting the right to act beyond the limits of the state and in such a caw. of course, its power in this respect is limited and con - tracts &amp;lt;&amp;gt;r other acts contrary to the express or implied pro - hibition arc ultra vires. (14 C. J. Sec. 422.) A corporation can exercise none of the functions and privileges conferred by its charter in any other state except by the comity and consent of such state. (14a C. J. Sec. :W27. i Applicant, a Michigan corporation, seems to be en - gaged in selling its capital stock in various states and pay - ing in such sales the commission or rate of stock sales commission allowed by the state in which the stock is sold. It is not shown whether or not these commissions are in excess of the stock sales commission allowed under the law of the parent state. If so it would seem that a further question is raised under the rules above cited. If the Michigan charter contains specific provisions in the way of limitations or prohibitions as to the amount or rate of commission which may be paid in the sale of stock or that the stock must be paid for in full at par or a certain percentage of par, and the stock is sold in these other states and commissions paid in excess of the commission allowed under the law of the parent state and the stock not paid for at par or the percentage of par required by the law of the parent state, the question is then raised as to compliance with all the requirements of law as this department in issuing the authorization order requested must find that the applicant has complied with </seg>
            <seg id="p150">148 REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL all the requirements of law. It is to be noted that snch limitations and restrictions are found in the charter of all Nebraska corporations, that is, that not to exceed 10 per Bit of the par value of the stock sold may be paid as stock es commission and that all stock must be paid for at par in money or its equivalent. These charter provisions necessarily, it appeals, follow a Nebraska corporation wherever it may 1h&amp;#187; and the Ne - braska corporation is limited thereby regardless of where it may l&amp;gt;e engaged in financing itself through the medium of the sale of its capital stock. To pay commission in excess of the amount allowed under the law of Nebraska or to fail to pay for the stock at par, as required by the law, in any other state would of course result in a fraud upon Nebraska stockholders and Nebraska creditors. Applicant's brief is upon the theory that a Nebraska corporation may sell its stock in any state where it may obtain proper authority and pay any stock sales commission not in excess of the maximum allowed by the state in which the stock is sold, or that the applicant or in fact that any corporation created in any state might do likewise, which does not seem to be in accord with the rules above enumerated. In addition to the matter of the commissions, the various statutory requirements with reference to paying for stock at par or a certain percentage thereof also enter in. By reason of the fact that applicants under these cir - cumstances invariably lay great stress upon the law and rules of comity the following discussion of that proposition is offered. Under principles of comity and except as otherwise provided by constitutional or statutory provisions a foreign corporation is permitted to enter other states and there exercise all the legitimate powers conferred upon it and to carry on as a corporation any business not prohibited by the local laws or against the local public policy. The </seg>
            <seg id="p151">OPINIONS 149 comity involved is the comity of the state not of the court's. No restrict ions can Ik imposed by the courts without the sanction of the law making power. This comity must be presumed to exist and does exist until a state expresses an intention to the contrary in some affirmative way, that is by direct enact ment on the subject or by its public policy deduced from the general course of legislation or the s&amp;#187; tiled adjudication of its courts of last resort. Legis - lative silence upon the subject is equivalent to permission. Construction and application of statutes prescribing the terms and conditions upon which foreign corporations will 1k&amp;#187; permitted to do business within the state form a large part of the law of foreign corporations. A foreign corporation will not be recognized as a corporation or its acts upheld in the exercise of comity when to do so would be contrary to local laws or policy or prejudicial to local interests. The domestis states will not permit a foreign corporation to exercise powers not granted by its charter or the governing law of its existence or powers which a domestic corpora - tion of like character is not permitted to exercise under the laws and policy of the state. The rule of comity does not go to the extent of placing foreign corporations on more favorable grounds than domestic corporations in the transaction of business within the state. In the absence of controlling constitutional or statutory provisions and provided the act is within the power* conferred on the corporation by its charter, it is the general rule that a foreign corporation may exercise the same powers as are permitted to domestic corporations of like character. A corporation can exercise no powers in a state other than of its creation except such as are conferred upon it by its charter and the laws creating and governing it. Whatever disabilities are thereby placed upon the corporation at home it retains abroad. A corpora - tion cannot exercise any powers in other states unless its charter or the governing law of its existence authorizes it </seg>
            <seg id="p152">150 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL, so to do, and in the absence of such authority corporate acts or contracts done or made beyond the limits of the state are void. Exceptions to this rule seem to be the case of charter or statutory restrictions in the state of domicile not intended as general restrictions upon the power of the corporation generally but merely as a prohibition of particular acts or contracts within the domicile, i.e., do not follow the corporation into other states. Interest and usury, insolvency, assignments, statute of wills, penal laws and torts have been considered such exceptions. A corporation created by one state can exercise none of the functions or privilege* conferred by its charter in any other state except by the comity and consent of the latter.

POWER TO EXCLUDE, RESTRICT OR REOl'LATE. &amp;#8212; Subject to constitutional limitations a state has the right to entirely prohibit foreign corporations from doing business within the state. Having the right to prohibit foreign corporations from doing business in a state at all, it is within the power of the state to prohibit the transaction of business by the foreign corporation within the state except upon compliance with such terms or conditions and subject to such restrictions as the state may in its discretion see fit to impose and it is the general rule often declared by express statute that a foreign corporation can exercise no powers which may not lawfully be exercised by domestic corporations of like character. (14a C. J. Sees. 3946 and 3948. Foot notes 6061 and 36.) The numlwrs of decisions cited from prac - tically every court of last resort establish clearly this general rule in the majority of jurisdictions, which is sup - ported by the great weight of authority.

The constitutional and statutory provisions herein in question impost upon foreign corporations such restriction*! and conditions upon its coming into the state with which thi foreign corporation upon coining into the state inuist comply, placing foreign corporations upon a parity with domestic corporations of similar character in all respects. These constitutional and statutory provisions are not prohibitory as against foreign corporations coming into the state l&amp;gt;ut merely prescribe the conditions upon which they may enter for the purpose of protecting Nebraska corpora - tions, Nebraska industries, citizens and investors, includ - ing p&amp;lt; i sons who may become creditors. And is no discrimi - nation but it is entirely within the power of the state to discriminate in favor of its own corporations and legisla - tion so designed is constitutional as will be hereafter set out in discussing particular constitutional limitations upon lie power of the state. CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS AS TO PARITY WITH DOMESTIC CORPORATIONS.&amp;#8212; A state may im - pose upon foreign corporations seeking to come within its limits and conduct their business the condition that they shall be subjected to the duties and obligations of domestic corporations. The purpose of such constitutional or stat - uti.ry provision is to produce uniformity and bring both under the influence of the same law. A provision of a state constitution that no foreign corporation shall be al - low* d to exercise or enjoy within the state greater rights or privilege* than those enjoyed l&amp;gt;y corporations of similar character created under the law of the state is merely an inhibition against the granting of greater rights or privi - leges to foreign corporations and does not affect the validity of laws governing domestic corporations although they cannot be applied to foreign corporations.

My dear Governor: Pursuant to your request for in - formation relative to the manner in which you shall pro - ceed to till the rticaney in the First ( 'ongressioual District caused by the resignation of the flonorable C. F. Reavis, permit me to advise you as follows: The Governor does not have any appointive power in this connection. The Constitution of the United States provides: "Article I, Section 2: That when vacancies happen in the represen - tation from any state, the executive authority thereof shall issue writ* of election to fill such vacancies." This is a very broad provision, and does not indicate whether the election shall be general or special, or shall lected in the manner provided by law. OcUiIkt :{. l'tl'L' </seg>

The state law provides that "When a vacancy occurs in the office of representative gress. or members of the legislature, and the body in wh vacancy exists will convene prior to the next general elec governor shall order a special election to fill such vacanc con This mould seem to indicate that the date &amp;lt; holding of a special election was somewhat wit hi (lovernor's discretion.

This I be - lieve would hardly l&amp;#187;e termed a special election, but would l&amp;#187;e a part of the general election machinery, in which case the primary would have the choice of nominees, and you might amend your primary election proclamation, so that at the July IS primary a nominee for the unexpired term Would be selected. The latter of those two courses seems to me by far the most practical. The day is long past when the people want a political convention to nominate their congressman. Che calling of a special election will necessitate this un - fortunate expedient, and also entail much expense. Letting the matter go until the general election in November would eliminate all additional expense and will give the people a chance to make their nomination under the primary law in July. In addition to these considerations, it is cur - rently reported that Congress will adjourn during July or early August, and will not, of course, meet again until l&amp;gt;ect'inl&amp;gt;er, so that even if a special election were called, the person elected would 1h&amp;#187; of little service until December, and by that time someone could lte elected at the regular election. I think I have outlined this matter rather fully. There is no denying the fact that the law is not clear, and that it is a complicated situation. The plan I have proposed is I think as much justified from the statutes as any other, and I believe has the additional merit of considering the practical aspects of the situation. Very truly yours.

            <seg id="p194">192 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL Elections It is possible to nominate a candidate by petition until twenty days before a general election. A candidate who is nominated by petition after the primary election is not required to pay the filing fee described in Section 2113. 1922 Compiled Statutes. Mr. Hrniff Fletcher, Rarthtt, \eb% Dear Sir: Referring to your inquiry of October 3d, you are advised that we arc unable to find any statute which fixes the length of time before a general election that a nomination petition can be filed. Section 1948, Compiled Statutes. 1!&amp;#187;22. requires the county clerk to have the ballots printed tivc days l&amp;gt;efore election. Section 19.~2. Compiled Statutes. 1922, requires publication of a copy of the ballot not more than ten days and not less than three days before the day of election. Section 209S. Compiled Statutes. 1922, provides for nomination of candidates by petition, but does not specify the time in which the petition shall be filed. Of course, there must be a limit to the time in which such petitions can l&amp;#187;e filed in order to allow the county clerk to make up the ballot and have it printed, and a copy of it published. AVe are then confronted with the question of fixing the time. Section 'IVl'l. Compiled Statutes. 1922, provides that party committees may fill vacancies for county offices on a ballot within twenty days before the election. Section 2124. Compiled Statutes. 1922. provides for the nomination certificates of candidates for county offices, exempted from the provisions of Article XI of Chap - ter IS, being filed up to within twenty days before election. We would think that in the absence of a statute fixing the time in which a candidate may be nominated by petition, twenty days would be a reasonable time. l&amp;#187;oth for the county clerk and the candidate. It may be that some - where in the statutes there is a provision fixing this time. but we, like you, have been unable to find any such provision. </seg>

Chapter 30 of the Laws of 1917, the partial suffrage He. was also in force, which statute provided: "Every on of the age of twenty-one years or upwards shall be &amp;#8226;lector and shall have the right to vote for all officers ie elected to public office and upon all questions and propositions submitted to the voters at any and all elections authorized or provided for by the constitution or laws of Nebraska : Provided, however, that no female person shall 1 to vote for United States Senator, United Slates Representative, or for any officers specified and desig nated in the Constitution of Nebraska, or upon any ques imposition submitted to the voters, the manner mi if the submission of which is .specified and designated n the Constitution of Nebraska." The intention of the Legislature in passing the afore - mentioned partial suffrage act was to extend the right of suffrage to women just as far as it could be constitutionally extended. The issuance of court house bonds is not men - tioned in the Constitution, nor the manner of submission of the same to the electorate. Since 1881, women have been permitted to vote at school elections, and such permission has been held consti - tutional in State v. Cones, 15 Neb. 444, and Olive v. School District, 86 Neb. 135. Following the reasoning in the Olive case, the Legislature has power to extend the right of suffrage in all cases not prohibited by the Constitution. </seg>

The ruling of these county attorneys seems to be ipported by the provisions of Section 6963 of the Revised llU'l', which provide that inmates of the home Stain &amp;#8226;ottage homes within one-half mile from the av Im ministration buildings, and have full advantage of the ol the act provided that the act shall apply li persons as cannot l&amp;#187;e provided with the aecom- he buildings on the home grounds.

Most certainly if the home was large to accommodate all these individuals living in cot - lie officials of the home could force them to take up i residence in the administration buildings or lose their rights and privileges as inmates. If one of these cottagers insisted on voting in the precinct in which the home is located, I do not think he could be deprived of voting at such place. I cannot see that he would have the right to vote in the other precinct within the boundaries of the city of Grand Island. My opinion is in full accord with that of the county attorneys, and I think these cottagers, who are residing outside of the administration grounds should be considered as residents of the home, and their voting place should be determined bv the situs of that home. </seg>
            <seg id="p206">204 REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL It is quite possible that you have Inn advised that these inmates, who were occupying cottages within the limits of Grand Island should have the right to vote in Grand Island.

An act of the legislature which has been referred to the people and approved by them becomes a law when the governor shall, within ten days after the completion of the state canvass, issue his proclamation giving the whole number of votes cast in the state for and against the measure in question, and declaring that such a meas - ure is approved by the constitutional number or majority </seg>

The same section provides that the canvassing board shall canvass the vote on referred measures in the same manner as they shall canvass the vote of presidential electors, and requires the governor to issue the above described proclamation when a referred law has been ap - proved. The state canvassing board meets the sixth Mon - dav after election. Your question as to whether the initiative might be voked to pass a law repealing an act which had been adopted on referendum is rather interesting. There seems to be some question about it in the minds of some lawyers with whom 1 have diaensed it. My personal opinion is that von may invoke the initiative against measures which have been referred if you see fit. The purpose of the initiative and referendum is to give the people a chance to i&amp;gt;ass i heir own laws, and if they want to pass laws repealing other laws, I see no reason why they should not have that rijjht. and utilize it to the fullest possible extent.

In other precincts, it seems that the election board, which functions as both a counting and receiving board, is made up of three judges and two clerks in precincts having cast less than two hundred votes at the last general election. The difficulty in answering your inquiry arises in attempting to reconcile the provisions of Section 3 just con - sidered with the provisions of Section 4, which provides that a clerk of the District Court shall select from the lists furnished by the precincts two judges and two clerks from the political party polling the highest number of votes at the last general election in the precinct, as shown by the votes cast for the set of candidates on the state ticket, two judges and two clerks from the party polling the next highest number of votes and one judge from the party polling the third highest number of votes.

Under this provision, and under the provisions of the actions referred to in Judge Barnes' letter, we are of the pinion that only the amount necessary for expenses can be so deducted by the treasurers who are acting as your agents, and that the balance must be accounted for. and inasmuch as it is not a collection made by the county treasurers, but money advanced for expenses for your department, it would seem that the excess should l&amp;gt;e returned to the source rather than to go into the general fund of the county. There seems to he no statutory provision for any such extra com - pensation to county treasurers. Yours very truly CLARENCE A. DAVIS. Attorney General. Ttv C. L. DORT January 6, 1921.

A warehouseman is iiiidcr bo obligation to receive grain, or to continue to store it, when the grain is not in proper condition for storage. In ease grain becomes unfit for storage the warehouseman nmy require the storer to remove it. In the last case cited the owners of an elevator stored certain wheat. After the wheat had been in storage some time it was discovered that it was being damaged by weevil. The warehouseman asked the stoVer of the grain to remove it. He neglected to do so and it was heavily damaged. The warehouseman sued for storage charges and the storer pleaded a counter-claim. Judgment was rendered in favor of the warehouseman. In deciding the case the court said: insisted for appellant that Oflutt &amp;amp; Blackburn were public jsemen; tha uch they were bound to receive all grain endered them, and that, if Carley had taken his wheat levator, he could have required them immediately to re- ceive it back; and that therefore he was under no obligation to take the wheat out cf the elevator when notified to do so. It is insisted for Offutt &amp;amp; Blackburn that they were private warehousemen; that by the written contract they agreed to put Carley"s wheat in a special bin and keep it at so much a month, and that therefore they could terminate the arrangement at any time on a month's notice. We do not find it necessary to determine whether Offutt &amp;amp; Blackburn were public or private warehousemen. In either event they were not insurers. They were only bound to use ordinary care to protect the property committed to them. They were not responsible for an in - jury tc the property which could not be guarded against by ordinary care.

statutes seem to inferentially restrict corporate bodies to the use of one name—and this in my opinion quite properly.
1 would suggest that by accepting, for filing any amendments to articles of incorporation which provides for the adoption of two names, your Department would be lending. countenance to and approving a most wide departure from the ordinary practice of corporate bodies. and by such consent it might possibly establish a quite unusual practice which could be carried to most unreasonable lengths. If corporations can have two names, why cannot a corporation have three names or a dozen names? This practice, it' indulged in, would unquestionably work a most serious inconvenience, it' not an actual hardship upon not only the state officials having supervision of corporations, but upon the general public with whom these corporations have dealings
Rather than to attempt to solve their outside troubles by this unusual manner proposed and which, if permitted, would prove burdensome upon our state, I think this company in question should seek in those states where it is experiencing' difficulty, such relief as it requires.
It is my opinion that by virtue of Article 12, Chapter 1911. and particularly Section :1:114 (25) thereof, you have sufficient authority to disapprove of these amendments to the articles of incorporation which provide for the adoption and use of two names.

Insurance
In computing its gross premium income in Nebraska for the purpose of taxation, a foreign insurance company must include therein premiums represented by business ceded to it by another company, and must may the tax thereon. notwithstanding the first company also reported said premiums in its premium income.
Mr. TV. B. Young, Chief of the Bureau of Insurance, Department of Trade and Commerce.
Dear Sir: In answer to your inquiry regarding taxation on the gross amount of premiums received by foreign life and accident insurance companies:
Sec. 2, Article 10, Chapter 133 of the 1921 Session Laws, provides, in substance, that foreign life and accident insurance companies, transacting business in Nebraska. shall at the time of making the annual statements, as required by law, pay into the state treasury two per cent of the gross amount of premiums received by them during the preceding calendar year for business done in this state.
We are asked the question whether a foreign insurance company doing business in this state, in computing the gross amount of premiums received by it for business done in this state, shall include the premiums or amounts received on reinsurance business ceded to them by other companies, which business represented by such premiums was written in Nebraska.
This raises the question whether the Legislature intended to impose a tax on premiums received on Nebraska business, and a second tax on such portion of those same premiums which were paid over to a reinsuring company.
Section 4, Article 10 of said Chapter 133, provides that companies organized in Nebraska shall pay four mills upon the gross premiums collected in this state, less the reinsurance paid in Nebraska business and dividends paid policy-holders in Nebraska during the same period. Therefore, as to home companies it is quite clear that the
</seg>
	           <seg id="p235">OPINIONS	233
Legislature does not require that the tax be paid twice on premiums received for business written in this state by Nebraska companies. When a Nebraska company makes its return it can deduct from the gross amount of premiums received and taxable that amount which pays the cost of reinsuring, and that company to which the business is reinsured only would be required to pay the tax. By this same section it is apparent that a Nebraska company shall pay four mills tax on gross premiums representing business which has been reinsured to it.
However, by Section 2, which pertains to foreign companies, we find no provision to permit the company from deducting from its taxable premiums the amount covering business which such foreign company is reinsuring to some other company and therefore we are forced to state that by virtue of said Section 2, a foreign company in computing the gross amount of premiums received by it must include in such gross amount the premiums on even that business which said company had later reinsured to some other company. Nor does this law provide that the gross amount of premiums taxable shall not include premiums received by such foreign company on business which it had taken by reinsurance from some other company.
As a result of a careful analysis of both of these sections I am convinced that a foreign company must pay a tax on all of the premiums received by it on business written in Nebraska, whether such business was written by itself or was originally written by some other company and reinsured to it. The fact that a tax on the business reinsured to it hail already been paid by the first company will not justify it in deducting from its return the amount of premiums representing such reinsured business.
I personally advised Mr. W. T. Blackburn as to my opinion in connection with this subject, but the views I expressed to him orally were not included in any formal opinion, and the substance of these remarks must of course be superseded by this written opinion. In fairness to the
</seg>
	           <seg id="p236">234	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
insurance companies I will say that I think premiums on reinsured business should not be subject to a second tax, as one tax on the premium should be sufficient regardless of whether such business is written by a foreign or domestic company. However. the Legislature has expressly set forth its views on the subject in the two sections above cited and it is not within our province to say what the law should be, as we are limited to merely stating our interpretation of the law as it actually appears on the statute books
In connection with this subject I would refer you to the following cases which bear upon it more or less directly:
State v. Fleming. 97 N. W. t Neb.). 1063.
People v. Continental Ins. Co.. 78 N. E. (N. Y.)10.
In re Continental Casualty ('o.. 179 N. \V. 185.
These cases are not exactly in point as you will observe, but they contain sufficient matter to convince me that both of my opinions as verbally expressed and herein set down, are sound.
I return herewith the letter directed to you by the Federal Life Insurance Company under date of May 16th.

Insurance—Hail
State hail insurance not effective until application is filed with county clerk.
Burkett. Wilson. Brown &amp; Wilson, Attorneys at Lair, First National Bank BIdg., Lincoln., Nebr.
Gentlemen : In response to your letter of March 25 setting forth your views as to the time in which a state hail insurance policy issued under Article 14, Title 5, Chapter 190 of the Laws of 1919. becomes effective and requesting our construction of this statute, we interpret it as follows:
When the application is made directly to the County Clerk the law is specific in its provisions that the insurance shall become effective from the time of filing the application.	(Section 3).
Section 2 provides that applications for hail insurance may be taken by the local assessor on application blanks, which applications should be forwarded by the assessor to the county clerk, and the policy is subsequently issued and delivered to the insurer.
It is quite true that the delivery of the policy is not essential to the completion of the contract of insurance, and that the acceptance of the application may constitute the contract. uuless here is some provision in the application in respect to the time in which the policy shall take effect. (('arter v. Bankers Life, 83 Nebr. 810, 518.)
It is, however, well settled that where the application for the insurance provides the time in which the policy shall take effect that there is no valid contract of insurance until such time arrives. (Lave v. St. P. Fire &amp; Marine Ins., SO Nebr. 499—a hail insurance case.)
The form of application for state hail insurance applies for insurance in a specified amount "from. the day this application. is filed in the office of the County Clerk of the county above mentioned, until September 15, 19—." The
</seg>

	           <seg id="p238">236	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
application also contains this statement : -That I know this application does not bind the state until filed in the office of the County Clerk of the county above mentioned."
Upon the reasoning of the Lame case (supra ) anti in view of the specific statement in the application that the insurance shall not become effective until the application is filed in the office of the County Clerk, it is our opinion that no risk attaches until the application is actually filed.
As a practical matter this construction invokes no hardship upon the insured. If he does not receive his policy within a few days, he should follow the matter up and see that the assessor, who frequently is his neighbor, tiles the application.

Insurance—Hail
Orders upon banks given for hail insurance premiums are given in lieu of cash payment for the premium. The law providing for lapse of the policy if the order is not paid when due constitutes a part of the contract. Failure to pay when due and lapse of the policy by operation of law does not relieve the insured from the obligation to pay the order.
Mr. L. G. Brian, Chief Official Adjuster, Division of Hail Insurance, state House.
Dear Sir: This Department is in receipt of your letter of June 21, with enclosure of letter from C. P. Anderbery of Minden, in which he states that one L. H. C. Milholm of Upland. Nebr., purposely refuses to pay his bank order
</seg>

	           <seg id="p239">OPINIONS	237
given in payment of premium for hail insurance. Mr. Ander-ery in his letter has adopted the position that the policyholder has the option of losing his policy by not paying the premium. or rather the order when it becomes
due.
You will note from an examination of the hail insurance law it provides that upon taking the application, the premium shall be paid in cash or by this bank order. It was undoubtedly the intent of the Legislature that this bank order should be taken therefor in payment of the premium and was merely an extension Of time for receipt of the money from the bank upon which the order was drawn. Certaiuly, it was not the intention of the Legislature that anyone should receive the benefits of this insurance without paying for it. and certainly no court would say that they would not be liable under such circumstances where application was received and tiled. the law providing that the insurance is in force within twenty-four hours thereafter, and the policy was duly issued.
it further appears that this policyholder anti others in like circumstances have failed to return their policies or expressly cancel them.
It is our view of this situation that while the law is not absolutely clear upon the question, a test case should be tried upon the state's contention that it is entitled to full payment of the bank order given for and received in payment of the insurance premium; that the contract was fully complied with upon the part of the state, or the Hail Insurance Department; that the contract was breached upon the action of the policyholder only; that the policy lapsed by operation of law which was a part of the contract, and that the Legislature intended that refusal or failure upon the part of the policyholder to pay this bank order when it became due should act as a forfeiture of further insurance under the policy.
</seg>

	           <seg id="p240">238	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
We have found a number of cases which hold that the policyholder cannot recover unearned premiums under similar conditions. These cases are found in:
58 Neb. 488 101 Neb. 857 65 Neb. 14 54 Neb. 740
21 Ruling Case Law, pg. 178
14 Ruling Case Law, pg. 959
There is also authority for the statement that the state may impose penalties, and for our position in this matter that the state may impose this penalty or forfeiture by reason of the failure of the policyholder to pay this order when due, see 21 R. C. L. 208.
It may be argued that by suing for the entire au'ount of the order the insurer will waive the forfeiture of the policy. If the state is a party to this insurance contract, there will then arise the question of whether or not the state could. by its officers, waive such a stipulation of law, and being a provision of statutory law, we do not believe that it could be waived. We cite upon this point:

Tyler v. Bailey, 71 Ill. 34. People v. Brown. 67 III. 435.
We suppose there would be nothing lost to the insurer if the full amount of the order could be recovered, even in the event that it should be found that the policy would remain in force irrespective of the forfeiture part of the statute.
There have also been decisions to the effect that where there has been a loss and the same has not been called to the attention of the insurer before he sues or recovers judgment, that the insurer would not be bound to pay the loss, but. could refuse to collect under the judgment.

Intoxicating Liqucrs
If upon a charge of illegal possession of liquor it is found as a matter of fact that a certain automobile was used in illegally transporting the liquor, this automobile may be confiscated upon that finding of fact and conviction.
Mr. C. H. Stowell, Police Magistrate, Chambers, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Referring to your inquiry concerning the confiscation of an automobile belonging to one W. M. Zaporowski and the conviction and fine of the same person you are advised that it is the opinion of this department that upon the conviction of a person under Section 41 of the present prohibitory law, for the illegal possession of intoxicating liquor, where the magistrate as a matter of fact found that an automobile had been used in connection with the illegal possession thereof and in the transportation of intoxicating liquors illegally, the same may be sold by the court at public sale on ten days' notice, and the proceeds paid into the school fund, as in the case of fines and forfeitures. and the purchaser of said property shall take title to it free and clear of all rights, title and interest of all persons whomsoever.
This question has never been presented to our Supreme Court, but this is our opinion of what the court would hold in the event such a question was presented to it.
In the case mentioned in your letter, I understand that in your court the defendant was not charged with the illegal transportation of liquor, but with the illegal possession of the same and with attempting to sell the same. Therefore, there is a question whether the defendant's automobile can be sold upon his being convicted of these charges. However, the last part of Section 41 of the present liquor prohibitory law I believe warrants the opinion that if you found as a matter of fact under the charges of illegal possession and illegal attempt to sell, that an automobile was used in these offenses in illegally transporting intoxicating liquors, the same may be sold upon this finding of fact and
</seg>
	           <seg id="p243">OPINIONS	241
conviction. However, I would advise your returning the package of sugar, the package of oatmeal and the box of matches.
Section 9142 of the 1913 Revised Statutes provides that in the event an offender is required to pay a fine or costs, or both, a magistrate may make a part of the sentence that the party stand committed and be imprisoned in the jail of the proper county until the same is paid or secured to be paid. Therefore, assuming that this was made a part of the sentence in the above described case, it is the opinion of this department that the defendant must stand committed until the statute is complied with. However, upon the signing of the bond by the defendant and the four other persons as surety, it is our opinion that this complies with the wording "or secured to be paid" contained in the first above mentioned section.
Therefore. I would suggest that the prisoner be released and that a civil proceeding immediately be instigated against the bondsmen and defendant.
Very sincerely yours,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General.

Intoxicating Liquors—Motor Vehicles
An automobile seized for the unlawful transportation of liquor should not be surrendered by the officials until the cause for which such car was seized has been adjudicated.
Mr. Frederic A. Crites, County Attorney, Chadron, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Answering your letter of recent date in which you ask the opinion of this department regarding the question as to whether a car that is seized by law enforcement officers in connection with the illegal transpor-
</seg>

	           <seg id="p244">242	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
tation of liquor may be properly surrendered to the owner at the time the owner is filing a bond or recognizance for his appearance at the time of trial:
I call your attention to Section 42, Chapter 109 of the 1919 Session Laws, which section is in force at the present time. This section clearly provides that when a vehicle is seized for the uulawful transportation of intoxicating liquors. such vehicle shall be held for trial. The vehicle and any liquor seized shall not be taken front the possession of any officer seizing and holding the saute by writ of replevin or other proceedings.
It seems to me that it is manifestly
improper to
turn the ear back to the owner before the matter has been finally adjudicated. and I think the wording of said Section 42 is sufficiently clear to firmly establish the intention of the Legislature in framing this law. The car should be held until trial is had, and it is not subject to any proceedings brought for the purpose of turning it back to the owner before the trial.
-When a complaint has been filed against the owner himself, he, of course. may secure his liberty by tiling a recognizance with sufficient securities, but 1 do not think that the law permits the release of the ear itself until after trial, and then ouly in the event that the trial results in favor of the defendant and ear.
As indicated above, it seems to me I he law is sufficiently plain on this subject and I am somewhat surprised to learn that its terms are being questioned. As long as this law is on the statute books, it seems to me that it should he fully enforced by all law enforcement officers and no exceptions to its terms should be made.

The above provision requires a state filing fee of $2,00 in any case which now requires a permit from the United States,
Sec, 14, Art. 3, of Regulation 60, under Title 2 of the National Prohibition Act of October 28, 1919, and as approved January 16, 1920, and under which such federal permits (for- 1405) are issued, provides in part the following:
"Where the same person operates several places of business for which he desires to obtain a permit, a separate application must be filed and a separate permit procured covering each place of business. but only one bond need be filed covering all such places of business operated by the same person within any one state."

Dear Mr, Thomas: My policy has been to go very slowly in accepting at face value the statements that are made about the manufacture and sale of wine for sacramental purposes, because it is a privilege that has been considerably abused, I believe that the State Liquor Law is fairly clear that the wine may be sold by certain wine makers for sacramental purposes, and I believe the Jewish Denomination is entitled to buy it,
As I remember, someone in Florence, and very probably the Walkers were arrested, and the wine confiscated a couple of years ago. The prosecution was subsequently dismissed, and I think the wine returned to them.
My suggestion is that you simply point out the provision of the statute to these people and tell them that if they follow it they will not be molested, but that they must follow it on their own responsibility. I think you will find as a general matter of policy that it is never wise to authorize specific transactions, because you rarely have all the facts in your possession, I am constantly beseeched by fellows that if they do so and so I will not prosecute them. I generally find that what they really intend to do is just a. little different from what. they state and yet they consider me bound by the promise, so that in the office here

Mr, McCoy is perfectly familiar with the liquor statute, As a matter of fact I think he defended Walkers before and probably secured their permit for them, and I think he knows what their rights are, and would simply suggest that he he told that so long as he follows the statute he is not in any possible danger, I believe that this attitude will relieve you of a lot of worry. not only in this matter but in a good many others with which you will be confronted,

Irrigation
Under like appropriations, water rights are determined as to priority in time of appropriation,
The order of priority is for domestic, agricultural and manufacturing purposes.
The irrigation season is from April 1 to October 1, with reasonable extensions by agreement.
Department of Public Works, Bureau of Irrigation, Power and Drainage, Brownell Block, City.
Attention: R.	Willi. , Chief
Gentlemen: Your letter of October 27th, 1921, is at hand. You inquire as to when the irrigation season begins and also as to the priority of water rights in this state.
Responding, we call your attention to Sections 3 and 4 (pg, 532) of the Laws of Nebraska for 1919, which determine the priority of water rights and which state that in considering like appropriations that the appropriation
</seg>
	           <seg id="p249">OPINIONS	247
which is prior in time has priority, and that appropriations tor domestic purposes have first priority, followed in order by purposes for agriculture and manufacturing,.
Section 7, (pg. 835) Laws of Nebraska for 1919, states that the Department of Public Works shall decide the method for determining priority and the amount of the appropriation.
Secion 11, (pg. 837) states that each appropriation
shall be determined in its priority and amount by the time
which it shall have been made, and the amount of water which I he works are constructed to carry. An appropriator shall at no time be entitled to the use of more than he can beneficially use for the purposes for which the appropriation may have been made; that no allotment for irrigation shall exceed one cubic foot per second of time for each seventy acres of land, nor three acre-feet in the aggregate during one calendar yea r for each acre of land for which such appropriation shall have been made; neither shall it exceed the least amount of water that experience may hereafter indicate is necessary, in the exercise of good husbandry, for the production of crops; and that where an appropriation is to irrigate au area of forty acres or less under an allotment of one-seventieth of one cubic foot or less per second continuous flow for each acre, and the amount is so small that a proper distribution and application is impossible. as much water as the applicant ran use without waste may he allowed for a limited time so fixed as to give each appropriator his just share without violating prior rights.
The following sections apply to the question of priority If rights, which, summed up, is priority for the purposes of domestic. agricultural and manufacturing uses in the order as named and between each class in accordance with priority of time of appropriation, which dates from the time of filing the application,
There seems to be no fixed fime for an irrigation season. Section 9 (pg. S49), Laws of Nebraska for 1919,
</seg>
	           <seg id="p250">248	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
among other things states that the majority of the water users under any ditch may designate such reasonable time for the use of water as such majority may determine upon, upon a written notice signed by such majority to the persons in control of such ditch. The section also provides that the ditch shall be kept open between April 1 and October 1, and ditches or canals which are supplied wholly or mainly from reservoirs shall not be required to furnish water for irrigation between November 1st and April 15th, next,
This would indicate as to the natural streams where irrigation is taken direct, that the ditches must he kept open from April 1st to October 1st, and it would seem, under the water rights given by Section 11 (pg, 837) that unless the appropriators shall receive all the water to which they are entitled prior to October 1st, that upon petition or written notice of the majority of the water users that such ditch may be kept open for a reasonable time as agreed upon, The statute does not attempt to define what shall constitute a reasonable time. but we presume that it was left to the good judgment of the persons in charge. as the seasons might be different in different years, requiring more water, possibly, during the latter part of the season in some years than in others.
Section 17, (pg. 852) Laws of Nebraska for 1919, provides the conditions under which persons entitled to construct and maintain storage reservoirs for irrigation or other useful purposes, may construct and maintain such reservoirs, Under this section, such applicants have the right to impound all waters not otherwise appropriated and any appropriated water not needed for immediate use, This would indicate that irrigation direct front the stream should have priority to the extent of the appropriations allowed by law and within such time as should be determined to be reasonable by a majortiy of the water users under any ditch, as provided in Section 9 (pg, 849). This seems to he specifically provided in Section 17 by the following language: "The owners or possessors of reservoirs
</seg>
	           <seg id="p251">OPINIONS	249
shall not have the right to impound any water whatever in such reservoirs during the time that such water is required in ditches for direct irrigation or for reservoirs holding senior rights."
While the statute does not attempt to define what shall constitute We a reasonable time by the users of the water taken by direct irrigation from the stream, yet it is stated in Section 9 that ditches or canals which are supplied wholly or maiuly from reservoirs shall not be required to furnish water for irrigation between November 1st and April 13th following, This would seem to indicate that between the dates of November 1st and April 15th irrigation from such reservoirs should be discontinued, probably upon the theory that such time was required for the filling of such reservoirs and during such time it would not be necessary for further irrigation, This might indicate that the Legislature had in mind the ordinary irrigation season should chose October 1st. except where the majority of the water users under any ditch should designate such reasonable fime as they might determine upon, which in turn the Legislature seems to hint might not be later than November 1st, all ho this is not expressly provided and for that reason we must say that the statute simply provides that a reasonable time shall be designated by a majority of the water users.
We believe that the foregoing will serve as a proper guide to you in determining the questions of priority and the length of the irrigation season,

Constitutionality of legislation introduced more than twenty days after commencement of the session in the form of an amendment to a bill introduced prior to twenty days after the commencement of the session.
Hon. James W. Good, Senator. Lincoln. Nebr.
Early in the session of 1021 Senate File 119, a hill to extend the powers of the Railway Commission so as to include supervison of leases tor industrial sites on railroad right-of-ways, lay dormant in committee for many weeks A few days ago and long after the expiration of twenty days after the commencement of the session an attempt was made to amend this bill by eliminating everything except the number and substituting for it legislation which would permit certain governmental subdivisions to issue bonds to aid in the construction of high school dormitories and other bits of internal improvement.
The Constitution of Nebraska. Articlic III, Section 7, provides:
"After the expiration of twenty days of the session no bills nor joint resolutions of the nature of bills stall be introduced, unless the Governor shall by special message call the attention of the Legislature to the necessity of passing a law on the subject matter embraced in the message, and the introduction of bills shall be restricted thereto."
The Constitution of 1875	the same provisions
in Section	Article III.
Inquiry is made as to whether new legislation may be introduced after the expiration of twenty days from the commencement of the session in the guise of an amendment to a hill introduced within the fime limit without contravening this constitutional provision, Unless requested by either the House or the Senate as a body, it is not the duty of the Attorney General to attempt to determine the constitutionality of proposed legislation, Yet when inquiry is made in good faith and for proper motives and not for use as all argument ill favor of or against contested legisla-

we have given such opinions, although appreciating they are merely prophesies as to the action of the Supreme Court, and are of no greater force than the opinion of any
her lawyer,
This Constitutional provision was considered by the Supreme Court in the rase of State v. Tibbets, 52 Nebr, 228, acid it was held that new legislation could he introduced after the expiration of the time limit in the form of an amendment to pending bills, provided that the new legisla tion was germane to the purposes of the pending bill, and that if not germane new legislation could not be introduced more than twenty days after the commencement of the session. The court said in that case:
"It is well settled that under the title of a bill to amend an existing act or section thereof no amendment is permissible which is not germane to the subject of the original legislation."
Miller v. Hurford, 11 Nebr, 377. State v. Pierce County, 10 Nebr, 476. Trumble v. Trumble, 37 Nebr. :140,
In the MiIIer case, supra, the court said:
"An amendment must be germane to the subject matter of the act or section to be amended. Our constitutional provision that 'No bill shall contain more than one subject which shall be clearly expressed in its title' is but making inviolable the rule governing legislative bodies that 'No proposition or subject different from that under consideration shall be admitted under color of amendment.' 	
But if. under the pretext of amending a section, a subject entirely foreign to the subject-matter of the section to be amended can be introduced this barrier will be entirely broken down and the constitutional guaranty in effect destroyed."
Many cases from other jurisdictions are cited in support of this general proposition, and in the Tibbetts case our Supreme Court held that if the subject matter of the Hew legislation was entirely foreign to the legislation embraced in the original pending bill that the new legislation was enacted in an unconstitutional manner.
</seg>
	           <seg id="p254">252	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
In State v. Ryon, 92 Nebr, 636, a similar attempt was made to introduce new legislation after the time limit, and in that case the court held that if the new legislation was germane to the subject of the original bill it was enacted in a constitutional manner. The court said:
"The legislature has full control over the passage of bills, and may amend the same and the title to the same at any time permitted by its rules during their progress through the legislature. If the amendment is germane to the subject of the original bill, and not an evident attempt to evade the constitution, the fact that the time limit for new bills has expired is immaterial."
In Chittenden v, Kibbler, 100 Nebr, 576 by a four to three decision the Supreme Court held a bill relating to Paving streets in second class cities could be amended after the twentieth day by a substitution therefor in respect to paving streets in first class cities, the court holding that the question of paving was the subject of the original bill, and that provision as to paving in first class cities was germane to the general fitle.
As to the legislation now pending in the Senate there can be no question but that the issuance of bonds for internal improvements is entirely foreign to a bill extending the powers of the Railway Commission over leases for industrial sites on railroad right-of-ways,
In our opinion the substitution of this dormitory bill for the original Senate File No. 119 is a mere subterfuge. and an attempt to evade the provision of the constitution that no new bill may be introduced more than twenty days after the session, and in our opinion this method of attempted legislation will be held unconstitutional by our Supreme Court.

Ruling respecting submission of gubernatorial appointments to senate for confirmation.
Hon, s, R. McKelvie, Governor of Nebraska, Lincoln, Nebr.
Your Excellency: You ask for an opinion upon the submission of gubernatorial appointments to the legislature under sections I to X, Article 4 of the new constitution.
Section 1 of this Article provides:
"The heads of all executive departments established by law, other than those to be elected as provided herein, shall be appointed by the Governor, with the consent of a majority of all the members elected to the Senate and House of Representatives meeting in joint session, etc,"
This section requires the submission by the Governor to the members of the joint session of appointments in executive departments already established by laws such as the Code Secretaries,
Section X in apparent conflict with Section 1 provides:
"The Governor shall nominate and by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, (expressed by a majority of all Senators elected, voting by yeas and nays) appoint all officers whose offices are established by the Constitution, or which may be created by law, and whose appointment, or election is not otherwise by law or herein provided for; and no such officer shall be appointed or elected by the Legislature,"
This requirement of submission to the Senate alone applies to executive appointments already provided by the constitution such as tax commissioners, and all appointments 10 executive positions which may hereafter be created by law.
In Our opinion your appointments of the various Code Secretaries must be submitted to the joint session, while your appointment to the office of tax commissioner or to other officers which in the future may be created by law need ouly be submitted to the Senate.

Legislature may condition legislation upon approval by referendum.
Senator J. C. McGowan, State House, Lincoln. Nebr.
Dear Sir: In our opinion there is no cause for alarm over the action of the Legislature in attaching a referendum clause to one of the primary bills,—the referendum clause providing that no part of the Act shall become effective until referred to the people of the next election. Most of our bond legislation expressly provides that the bonds can-not be issued until approved by a vote of the people.
The Constitution of Nebraska makes ample provision for a referendum on nearly all legislative matters. The right of the people to pass on such matters is expressly reserved to them by the Constitution and it is not a delegation of legislative authority to provide for the exercise of this right in respect to any particular piece of legislation.

Dear Sir: You ask for advice concerning whether or not you shall approve a voucher to the Kline Publishing Company for $1,393.63 covering 500 copies of House Journal, 2,144 pages at 65c per page.
Section 3733 of the 1913 Revised Statutes provides that the maximum number of House Journals to be printed
</seg>
	           <seg id="p257">OPINIONS	255
and distributed shall be 1,000 copies, therefore it is the opinion of this department that the House of Representatives can fix the number of House .Journals to be printed at any number not to exceed 1,000 copies, and in toy opinion it revolves itself into a question of the number of Journals which the House of Representatives wished to have printed. As far as I can discover, there is nothing in the record of the proceedings of the House which would determine this question. On the eighty-second day by resolution the House duly authorized the Chief Clerk to prepare the House Journal, but this resolution makes no mention of the number to lie printed.
The contract under which the Lincoln Typesetting Co. Geo. W. Kline printed the House Journals reads in part, as follows:
"This Contract. made and entered Into this 	day of January,
1921. by and between the State of Nebraska, party of the first part and The Lincoln Typesetting Co., by George W. Kline of Lincoln, Nebraska, party of the second part, witnesseth:
That for and in consideration of the payments hereinafter agreed to be made by the party of the first part, the party of the second part agrees to print and deliver to the party of the first part, work as follows, to-wit: 5410 copies of Permanent Journal, printed and bound according to specifications attached. In consideration thereof the party of the first part agrees to pay the party of the second part as follows: 600 copies Permanent Journal, per page. $1.99: additional hundred copies, per page $0.13.
"Said payments to be made when the work is completed and de-livered to the party of the first part and approved by the Secretary of the State Printing Board and to be paid by warrants drawn on the Treasurer of the State of Nebraska.
"Witness our hand this 		day of January. 1921. "STATE OF NEBRASKA, by A. B. Cole,
'KLINE PUBLISHING COMPANY, by Geo. W. Kline:

Mr. Cole informs me that he authorized the printing of only five hundred (500) copies of the House Journal, and this number only have been delivered to his department.
</seg>
	           <seg id="p258">256	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
However it is my opinion that the officers of the House of Representatives may when the House itself has not designated the number to be printed determine the number of copies which the House intended to have printed, and no one will be in a better position to accurately determine this than the Speaker of the House. Mr. Frank Corrick. Chief Clerk of the House, informs me that it was his understanding that one thousand (1,000) copies should be printed, and that accordingly Mr. Kline did actually print one thousand (1,000) copies, but has only bound and delivered five hundred (3(H)) of the same. Under these circumstances if it is your opinion that the House intended to have a larger number than five hundred (5004 copies printed and distributed you may after the additional copies are completed and delivered to and approved by the Secretary of the State Printing Board properly authorize the voucher against the incidental fund up to an amount not to exceed the maximum number fixed by statute.

Legislature—Budget
Hon. Walter L. Anderson, Speaker, House of Representatives, State House, Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Replying to your request for the opinion of this office in regard to the power of the Speaker to declare certain items of the general budget bill "carried" and other items "failed", permit me to say :
First—There is no question but that recommendations of either the Finance Committee or a Conference Committee recommending appropriations in excess of the amounts submitted by the budget, require a three-fifths vote of the Legislature before becoming law.
</seg>
	           <seg id="p259">OPINIONS	257
Second—The ordinary items as previously submitted by the Governor's budget require only a majority vote for their enactment into law. When items belonging to both these classes are included in the same general bill, or in the same general conference report, and the question is upon the bill or upon the conference report in its entirety, it is my opinion that unless the item requiring the highest number of votes carries, the entire bill fails. Unless this were the rule, it might be possible by the insertion of various items, to induce a vote for the bill in its entirety, where the general bill would not carry if these items were omitted, and at the same time the vote on the general bill not be large enough to carry the special item, which would result in a practical fraud upon those supporters of the general bill who voted for it because of the specific item.
The correct manner, therefore, of avoiding the difficulty of a perpetual deadlock on these large appropriation measures is for the conference committees to return a separable conference report setting out in separate reports the various unrelated items. Then as rapidly as these are proved by the two houses, they become eliminated from the conference committee and the field of conference thereby becomes constantly narrowed down to the place where eventual agreement will occur.
The opinion herein set forth is based primarily upon the constitutional provisions regarding appropriations and the general passage of bills.
Very truly yours,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS, April 26, 1921.	Attorney General.

Legislature—Charitable Institutions
The legislature cannot appropriate state funds for the support of any special charitable or educational institution not owned by the state.
Mr. Howell Wright. 602. Electric Building, Cleveland, Ohio.
Dear Sir: Referring to your inquiry of June 23rd addressed to the Secretary of State, you are advised that there is no provision in the Nebraska Constitution with respect to an appropriation of public funds for the support of any kind of charitable or educational institutions including hospitals.
Section 1 of Article 12 of the present (1920) State Constitution reads in part : "No corporations shall be created by special law, nor their charters be extended, changed or amended, except those corporations organized for charitable. educational, penal or reformatory purposes, which are to be and remain under the patronage and control of the state."
The state of Nebraska maintains a large number of charitable institutions. including hospitals for the insane, an orthopedic hospital. and a general hospital which is in connection with the College of Medicine of the University of Nebraska.
The county in which the city of Omaha is located has been authorized by state statute, Sections 1120 to 1127, to purchase and maintain a county hospital. All counties are authorized to establish and maintain poor farms.
It has not been the policy of Nebraska to appropriate any public funds for the support of any kind of charitable or educational institutions which are not owned and con-trolled by the state. I find no specific constitutional pro-vision which would forbid this, but under the general pro-visions of the State Constitution, 1 believe it would be im-

possible to make any such appropriation for any such special institution.

Minors
Rights are saved to females reaching 18 years of age before the ago of majority was changed to 21 years.
Mr. T. T. McCoy, County Judge, Trenton, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Your inquiry of August 17 asking the opinion of this department as to whether or not a girl who became eighteen years of age before Senate File 95 became a law is fulfil led to be married without procuring the con-sent of her parents or guardian is at hand.
Senate File 95 raises the age of majority of women from eighteen to twenty-one years. It provides, also, that a girl who shall marry under the age of twenty-one years shall also reach her majority. If this act ended there, there would be no question but that a marriage license could he issued to a female under the age of twenty-one years as Sections 1543 and 1544, Revised Statutes for 1913 provide that licenses shall not be issued to minors except upon the consent of the father, if living, or the mother, if the father is dead, or the guardian in the event of the death of both parents. Senate File 95, however, contains the following provision, evidently inserted as a saving clause, to-wit:
"Provided that this law shall not be construed as to restrict or limit the rights of the females who have attained the age of eighteen years before this law shall become effective."
</seg>
	           <seg id="p262">260	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
In an opinion delivered by an Assistant Attorney General of this department under date of August 24, it was held that this clause was in effect a saving clause and that it was not necessary for females who reached the age of eighteen years before Senate File 95 went into effect to obtain the consent of their parents to their marriage. The inquiry which you made raises a very important question for if the construction of Senate File 95 be determined that females who became eighteen years of age before the law went into effect have reached their majority for all purposes then and in that event persons dealing with females under the age of twenty-one who have reached the age of eighteen years before the law went into effect would be dealing with such females as majors; whereas, if the law he construed to mean that said females were protected only in property rights that might have accrued to them upon reaching their majority at eighteen and that for other purposes they remain minors, then it would he unsafe for persons to contract with such females because they might elect to raise a defense of infancy. You will note that the clause uses the words "restrict or limit the rights." There might be some question as to whether or not the mere qualification of a person to marry reached in this instance by the females reaching the age of eighteen is such a right which if not exercised before the new law went into effect would permit the females to obtain a license to marry without the consent of the parents. There is some authority for this latter statement in the statement set forth in 6 R. C. L. 334 which is to the effect that the protection of a constitutional pro-vision prohibiting the passage of law impairing the obligation of contracts does not extend to contracts of marriage and is sustained by,
Maynard v. Hill, 1 25 V. S. 190;
State v. Tutty, 41 Fed. 753;
Berthelmy v. Johnson (Ky.), 38 A. Dec. 179; Rugh v. Ottenheimer. 6 Ore. 231;
</seg>
	           <seg id="p263">OPINIONS	261
State v. Duket, 90 Wis. 272; and the famous Dartmouth College v. Woodward, 4 Wheaton 518,
which holds that the constitutional provision applies only to property rights. The case of Michigan University v. McGuckin, 62 Neb. 489 and IS R. C. L. 384, hold that marriage is a status rather than a contract and that the rights and obligations of the parties are not contractual but are fixed, changed or dissolved by law. Some of the authorities cited also hold that the legislature may pre-scribe the age and other qualifications of persons who may marry.
There is therefore some technical question whether or not the rights referred to in the saving clause include the right to obtain a license and mean that the female is excepted from her minority for that purpose as well as for the purpose of saving her property rights.
We are informed by a member of the recent legislature that it was intended that all the rights of the females reaching eighteen years of age should be reserved to them and that it was not intended that females who reached the age of eighteen should he restricted in their marriage rights. With this information, we are therefore inclined to disregard any technicalities in the matter and the wording of the saving clause in Senate File No. 95 and to hold that the clause designated as a saving clause permits the granting of a license to females who actually reached the age of eighteen before Senate File No. 95 went into effect.

Minors—Girls Industrial Home
The sentence upon girls committed to the industrial home until they become of age refers to the age of majority at the time of the sentence.
Hon. W. G. Sears, Judge of District Court. Omaha. Nebr.
Dear Sir: The Attorney General is in receipt of your letter of December 13th, 1921, asking for the opinion of this department as to the application and construction of the new law raising the age limit of women to twenty-one years, when considered in conjunction with the law for the commitment of girls to the Industrial Home at Geneva.
We have considered Sections 1252, 7385 and 7379 of he Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913. in reaching our conclusions on this matter.
It is our opinion that those girls who were sentenced prior to the passage of the new law raising the age limit, were sentenced under the all law (which was a part of their sentence t . where the age was expressly mentioned in the sentence as eighteen years or "lawful age", as the lawful age then was eighteen years. It would therefore seem that the subsequent law could not add to the sentence imposed by the court under the existing law at the time the sentence was given. If it had that effect, it would he retroactive and ex post facto.
Construing Section 7385 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913. it seems to us that this section applies merely to procedure and practice and to the manner of commitment and does not apply to the question of the re-lease of inmates from such institutions. and that it does not refer back to and include Section 7379 to the end that the age limit is therefore increased to twenty-one years.

Minors—Marriage
Persons under 21 years of age must have the consent of their parents or guardian before a marriage license can be obtained.
Mr. A. A. Bischof. County 'bulge, Nebraska City, Nebr.
Dear Sir: There is no apparent conflict, between Senate File 95 of the last session, which raises the age of majority of women to twenty-one years, and Section 1541 relating to the age of parties applying for a marriage license.
I n other voids Section 1541, Revised Statutes, 1913 is in effect. and girls over sixteen and boys over eighteen may be married with their parents' consent. The only difference that Senate File 95 will make in the situation is that hereafter if either of the parties are under twenty-one years. it will he necessary to obtain their parents' consent.

Monopolies—Price Discrimination Mr. L. D. Hunt, County Attorney, Alma, Nebr.
Dear Sir: You state that some local men have in-stalled a filling station, and that since this station has been opened for business, the Standard Oil Company has been selling gasoline to garages in that city for the same price as in neighboring cities and that the Standard Oil Company is then rebating one cent per gallon.
The section which would govern this case is Section 4029 of the 1913 Revised Statutes. If one could prove price discrimination after making due allowance for the difference if any in the grade and quality and the actual cost of transportation and that the discrimination was for the purpose of destroying the business of a competitor in any locality, the Standard Oil Company could be success-fully prosecuted under that section. You will note that the section provides that price discrimination shall be prima facie evidence that the party so discriminating is guilty of unfair discrimination.
It is the opinion of this department that if you can prove the facts as stated after making due allowance for the difference if any in the grade and quality of the product and the actual cost of transportation from the point of production, you can successfully maintain a prosecution under Section 4029.

Motor Vehicles
Residents of Nebraska must obtain Nebraska licenses to operate auto-mobiles in this state without violation of law.
Mr. Georg( E. .Johnson, Secretary, Department of Public Works, Lincoln, Nebraska.
Dear Sir: Answering your letter of recent date advising this office that Nebraska residents living near the Colorado line have been buying Colorado licenses for their automobiles and neglecting to buy the Nebraska licenses, and asking our advice in the premises, we respond as follows:
You are familiar with our law which requires the pro-curing of a license in order to legally operate an automobile in this state. In our opinion no Nebraska resident has a right to operate in this state under a license secured in another state although under the doctrine of comity we recognize the right of a non-resident of this state to operate his car in this state under a foreign license for a limited period of time. However, the Nebraska residents are not entitled to the benefits of this provision and before they can legally operate their automobiles they would be required to secure a Nebraska license. Of course, the Colorado license is probably valid in the state of Colorado but that does not relieve them from the provisions of our law.
It is. therefore, our opinion that any resident of the state of Nebraska who is operating his automobile within the state of Nebraska without first securing a license to do so under the provisions of the laws of this state is violating a law of this state and providing the evidence is sufficient should he prosecuted and a conviction should be secured.
Trusting that these violations may be called to the

Motor Vehicles
An incidental or occasional sale by a person not regularly engaged n handling motor vehicles does not enable him to operate his motor vehicles on a dealer's license.
A motor vehicle can only be operated on a paper number for ten days after the attachment of the number by the dealer.
Mr. George K. Leonard. Assistant Secretary. Department of Public Works, Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Referring to your letter of August 8th, it is the opinion of this department that anyone who is a dealer in automobiles, either new or second hand. is en-titled to registration under Section 19 of House Roll :H4, passed b the recent session of the Nebraska legislature. However, for one to he alllowed to take advantage of the dealer's registration, he must he engaged in the business of handling motor vehicles. An incidental or occasional sale by someone who is engaged in another line of business, does not make him a dealer under the provisions of this act.
It is the opinion of this department that Section 19 should he construed so as to allow a car to be driven only ten days upon the paper number. This interpretation is justified by the quotation in the second paragraph of the section, "good for ten days only from date perforated here-in." The last part of the second paragraph provides that such cards shall entitle the owner of such vehicle unless he be a dealer in motor vehicles, to drive the same upon the

Taking t he sect ion as a whole, it seems clear that the section provides that a car shall Only he lawfully driven on such a paper number for ten days after the attachment of the number by the dealer.

Additional plate for dealers' motor vehicles may be issued after July 1, for five dollars.

Dear Sir: Section 19 of the Motor Vehicle laws as amended in 1921, provides that the fee for assignment and registration for additional pairs of dealers' motor vehicle license plates shall be $10.00 per pair. Section 15 of the same Act provides that subsequent to July first of each year, registrations may be made for one-half of the regular fee. In our opinion the charge of $10.00 for additional pairs in Section 19 of the law is a registration fee and not a charge calculated to reimburse the state for the cost of the license plates furnished, the cost of such plates being less

Dear Sir: Referring to your letter of .January 30, you are advised that it is the opinion of this department that the party described owning three automobiles for trading. which cars are used by himself or his agents for pleasure purposes, cannot take advantage of Section 19 of Chapter 278 of the 1921 Session Laws.
It is our opinion that the intent of this section was to provide that only bona fide dealers of motor vehicles should take advantage of this section, and then only for the operation of motor vehicles for purely demonstration purposes. In addition to this it is our opinion that the words "motor vehicle of each class manufactured by or dealt in by him" does not pertain to the broad class of motor vehicles propelled by gasoline, but that each class covers only a certain make of pleasure cars and would not include trucks of the same make, and that if an automobile or a truck is used for pleasure or commercial purposes save only for demonstration purposes it is a private car. We think this is the intent and meaning of the motor vehicle

The law provides no mode of cancellation of a motor license. Liability is fixed for negligence by the civil and criminal law.
Mr. John J. Reinhardt, County Attorney, Aurora, Nebr.
Dear Sir: The Attorney General is in receipt of your letter of Mardi 30th concerning the possibility of annulling the license to operate an automobile of a person who has repeatedly been guilty of reckless driving.
I f you will refer to Chapter 222 of the Laws of Nebraska for 1919, you will note that the law provides for registration of motor ears, and such is not a license to operate a motor car. The law provides for registration and provides a penalty for anyone operating a motor car without the license tag or registration notice. We do not consider this as being a license which may be revoked at the pleasure of the person granting the license.
Under the present status of our laws, it is our opinion that any person has a right to operate a motor vehicle, providing he complies with the laws relative to registration, etc., etc., but he remains liable for damages for any negligence upon his part in the operation of the car. Of course, if this negligence is so great as to amount to wilful negligence or culpable negligence, which brings it within the manslaughter statute, the operator of the car would then be liable criminally, but under the present condition of our

Dear Sir: Referring to your inquiry concerning the power to compel an applicant for registration of a motor vehicle for a half year to make an affidavit. under oath. that he has not operated the motor vehicle during the first six months of the year, it is the opinion of this department that the county treasurer does not have the power to require such an affidavit.
We realize the difficulties which you have in the matter of the registration of a motor vehicle for the latter part of a year, and heartily agree that the law is sometimes evaded. This situation has arisen in several counties, but in the enforcement of the motor vehicle registration law, we must stay within the powers delegated by that law.

A municipality has only such powers as have been expressly conferred by the legislature and in addition thereto such incidental powers as are necessary to carry into effect its enumerated powers.

Dear Sir: Regarding the power of the Board of Trustees of a village to pass an ordinance providing for the cutting of weeds on vacant lots will state that the express power to pass such an ordinance has not been given by the legislature to villages. This power has however been conferred upon cities of the metropolitan class.
It has been held by our supreme court that a municipality has only such powers as are expressly conferred upon it by the legislature and in addition such powers as are necessary to carry into effect any enumerated power. Therefore, while your village has not the express power to pass ordinances such as the one under consideration this ordinance could be passed provided that it was necessary in order to make effective any other powers which you have, particularly in reference to such powers as are enumerated under Sections 5057 and 5058 of the Re-vised Statutes, 1913. There is no question but that villages may exercise police authority and may pass such reasonable regulations as are necessary for the preservation of the peace, welfare, safety and health of the inhabitants In this connection. I refer to that portion of Section 505- which provides as follows :
"And in addition to the special powers herein conferred and granted maintaining the peace, good government and welfare of the town or village."

Municipal Corporations—Water Commissioner
A village water and light commissioner may conduct his private business provided his private interests do not conflict with his official duties.
Mr. Frank E. Wilk, Syracuse, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Answering your letter regarding the powers of the village water and light commissioner, will say the office of village water commissioner is governed by Section 5119, Chapter 46 of the 1919 Session Laws.
Section 5 of Chapter 181 of the 1919 Session Laws provides with reference to lighting plants that in municipalities maintaining a system of water works and having a water commissioner, such water commissioner has charge of the lighting plant in addition.
Said Section 5119 provides that the water commissioner shall be a resident free holder nominated by the chairman of the Board of Trustees or the mayor and appointed by the consent of the city council or Board of Trustees. The water commissioner's salary shall not exceed $1,400.00 per annum.
This section provides that the water commissioner shall have the general management and control of the water works and shall perform such duties as may be pre-scribed by ordinance.
</seg>
	           <seg id="p276">274	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
Nothing is contained in this section which would indicate that it would 1w unlawful for the water commissioner to be interested in an outside business and therefore, I see no reason why it would be necessary for your water commissioner to dispose of his private business.
However, this does not necessarily mean that the water commissioner should be permitted to devote any considerable portion of his time to his private business and it is quite within the power of the board to prescribe by ordinance such additional duties as will keep him fully occupied in the service (If the village.
This section provides that the water commissioner may, at ally time, for sufficient cause, he removed by a two-thirds vote of the Board of Trustees and therefore, if your water commissioner insists on conducting his personal business to the neglect of the village's business, sufficient cause would be present to permit of his removal.
In conclusion, will say that I believe you are mistaken in the view that it is unlawful for your village board to appoint a person to the office of water commissioner who is interested in a private business.
However, this commissioner would he susceptible to severe criticism if he should conduct the affairs of the village in such a manner as to further the interests of his private business. The affairs of the village and his personal business should be kept entirely separate and it would he improper for him as the village employee to enter into any contracts which would draw a profit to his private concern. With reference to this feature of the situation. I refer you to my letter of August 3.

Section 5119, as amended by Chapter 46 of the 1919 Session laws gives cities of the second class the right to borrow money and issue bonds not exceeding twenty per cent of the assessed value of the taxable property for the purchase of steam engines and fire extinguishing apparatus, and for the purchase. erection and construction and maintenance of such water works, water supply, etc. Chap-ter 19s of the 1921 Session Laws gives the city council in cities having only volunteer fire departments the right to levy an annual tax of not more than four-tenths of a mill for the maintenance and benefit of the fire department.
It seems that your city council wishes to purchase fire fighting apparatus but does not intend to proceed in a manner authorized by Chapter 46, 1919 Session Laws and Chapter 198 of the 1921 Session Laws, but on the other hand they wish to merely issue warrants for the purpose contemplated. In this connection I imagine they contemplate proceeding under Section 3041 which merely gives a city of the second class the right to procure fire fighting apparatus.
It is my opinion that if they proceed under Section 5041 they must comply with the provisions of certain other sections which contain certain mandatory provisions effecting matters of this sort.

	           <seg id="p278">276	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
I call your attention particularly to Sections 5187 and 5184, Revised Statutes for 1913.
Section 5187 provides generally that no contract shall be made by the city council or expense incurred unless an appropriation has been previously made concerning such expense.
Section 5184 provides for an annual appropriation ordinance in which the officers may appropriate such sum of money as will defray all necessary expense, etc.
In view of the foregoing, will say that in proceeding under Section 5041 the city authorities would he obliged to comply with the terms of Sections 5187 and 5184, and I cannot believe as some of the city officials believe that they have the authority to issue warrants for the purchase of fire fighting equipment.
As to the issuance of warrants I will further call your attention to Section 5186, which defines the power of the city officials in the issuance of warrants, and places certain restrictions thereon.
It occurs to me that probably the following Nebraska cases contain matters of some interest to you with relation to the subject under discussion :

32 Nebr. 744 82 Nebr. 118

Municipal corporations are road districts and entitled to one-half of road taxes levied within their limits.
Mr. R. D. Flory, County Attorney, Albion, Nebr.
Dear Sir: The Attorney General is in receipt of your recent letter of January 31, 1921. We have carefully perused your letter and have examined the sections referred to.
You will note that in Section 2920 as amended by Chapter 53, page 1-13 of the Laws of Nebraska for 1915, the board may levy the same rate of road tax upon the property of cities, villages, etc., as is levied upon the property in the several road districts, and one-half of the said tax when collected shall go to the county road fund, the other half when collected to be paid to the city or village where levied. You will also note by the decisions tinder Section 2920 of the Revised Statutes for 1913, that municipal corporations are road districts and entitled to one-half of the tax levied within their limits.
Referring to the question of municipal corporations !wing road districts, will say that this department, through Judge Barnes. gave an opinion May 19, 1919, to L. D. Hunt. County Attorney at Alma, Nebr.. in which he stated the following: "The courts have held in construing tile provisions of Section 2920, that municipal corporations are road districts. You will find the decisions to that effect in a note to that section. This, however, relates to counties not under township organization, and in counties under township organization, the township board is given the power to control the expenditure of the road funds. This statute, if not modified by the other provisions of law, would leave the cities in counties under township organization, without any funds with which to care for their streets and highways unless they levy a special tax for that purpose and yet it is made the duty of the city marshal to care for the streets and highways within the city limits."
</seg>
	           <seg id="p280">278	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
Judge Barnes further suggests in the letter that one-half of the road funds so collected in the cities he expended on the streets and highways within the limits of the cities under the direction of the city marshal. It seems that this is what your commissioners have been doing and we con-elude that your country is not under township organization.
Referring to Section 2931 relative to the dragging of the roads, you will note that about midway in the section it is provided that the board shall furnish a road drag and pay for the same out of the county road fund. which indicates that this section of the statute should be considered within and governed by the provisions applicable to road funds. We conclude that there can be no question about this feature of the case.
In the latter part of the section it provides for the annual tax levy of one mill and simply provides that this levy shall be kept separate and apart and designated the "county dragging fund" and used only for that purpose. We take it that this simply means it is a part of the road fund, but set over under the statutes for a particular purpose.
We also take it as the intention of the Legislature that when cities are assessed and pay taxes under this section of the statute that the proportion set over to them under Section 2920 shall be used by the cities as constituting a road district within the purview of the statutes and as decided in the decisions cited under Section 2920.
There do not seem to be any decisions directly upon the point raised in your letter. but taking the different sections into consideration and construing them together. it seems to us that if the hoard taxes the cities for this proposition and adopts the road dragging plan, the taxes should be apportioned in accordance with the above suggestions.
If you have any suggestions to the contrary which you think might cause us to change our opinion, or if you find
</seg>
	           <seg id="p281">OPINIONS	279
any decisions to the contrary. we shall 1w glad to hear from you. Of course the commissioners of your county will be guided by your opinion, as county attorney, and our opinion is in no way binding upon them except as it may Ile of some value to yourself in an advisory capacity.

Municipal Funds—Banks
e city council has no interest in nor power of disposition over the funds of a school district such as to permit it to select the bank depository for such funds.
Mr. E. C. Nordlund, Stromsburg Nebr.
Dear Sir: The Attorney General is in receipt of your Ietter under date of July 8th making inquiry as to whether or not the city treasurer is bound to follow the designation of the city council of certain banks to act as depositories of city funds, and whether or not this also includes funds which he holds as ex officio treasurer of the school district.
There can be no doubt that the city treasurer is hound to deposit the city funds as designated by the city council, but you will note that the section of the statutes which designates him as ex officio treasurer of the school district is entirely distinct and separate from the section relating to the city treasurer. We cannot see that the city council has any interest in or power of disposition over the funds of the school district, as the school district is entirely

Municipal Corporations—City and Village Attorneys
City attorneys in cities of the second class and village attorneys are required to render legal services in the issuance of municipal bonds and cannot recover more than the amount per year for which they were engaged, which in no case shall exceed $450 per year.
Mr. John Minshull, City Clerk, Loup City, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Referring to your inquiry of September 9, you are advised that Section 5150 of the 1913 Revised
Statutes reads:
"The city or village attorney shall be the legal adviser of the council or board of trustee. He shall commence, prosecute, and defend all suits and actions necessary to be commenced, prosecuted or defended on behalf of the corporations, or that may be ordered by the council or board of trustees; and when requested, shall attend meetings of the council or board and give them his opinion upon any matter submitted to him, either orally or in writing, as may be required."
This section, I believe, would make it the duty of the city attorney to render legal service in the issuance of water extension bonds and the issuance of sewer bonds. Section 5000 of the 1913 Revised Statutes, as amended on page 130 of the 1919 Session Laws reads :
"The salaries of all officers of the city shall be fixed by ordinance, not exceeding the following amounts respectively; clerk, three hundred dollars per year; treasurer, three hundred dollars per year; city attorney, four hundred and fifty dollars per year; mayor, two hundred dollars per year; councilmen, each the sum of one hundred dollars per year. All other officers and employees of the city shall receive such compensation as the mayor and council may fix at the time of their appointment or employment"
</seg>
	           <seg id="p283">OPINIONS	281
Therefore, it is the opinion of this department that the city council cannot pay the city attorney more than $450 for services rendered during any one year and if the city attorney was engaged at a salary of $100 a year in compliance with Section 5000 he cannot recover more than this amount per year for services which come within the scope of his duties as city attorney. I am assuming that the salary of the city attorney was definitely fixed at $100 a year and it is the opinion of this department that under these circumstances the city council cannot pay a claim for *500 for special services rendered in connection with the issuance of water extension bonds and sewer bonds.
This department is not the proper legal adviser of your municipal corporation and we are giving you our opinion merely as an opinion of what the court would hold under the stated circumstances. In the case of Dean v. State, 56 Neb. 301, the Nebraska Supreme Court held that Section 5000 directs that salaries be fixed by ordinance and fixes the maximum only.
Hoping this answers your inquiry, I am,
Very sincerely yours,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General.

Nurses—Drugs
Nurse may administer anaethetics under supervision of licensed physician.
Mr. Charles E. Slagle, Alliance, Nebr.
Dear Sir: I am unable to find any statute which prohibits a non-registered nurse from administering anaesthetics
</seg>
	           <seg id="p284">282	REPORT OF' THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
under the direction of a licensed physician, and feel sure that such action is no violation of the criminal law.
As to the respective responsibility of the hospital or the surgeon for such administration of an anesthetic, the question is one of private law on which the Attorney General is not required to render any opinion.
It is my personal opinion, however, if the patient is a patient of the hospital, and the operation is conducted by a member of the hospital staff and the fees paid to the hospital both the hospital and the surgeon are responsible for any ease of malpractice.
If, however, the hospital merely permits a private surgeon to conduct the operation, offering merely the hospital facilities, the liability rests upon the surgeon alone. just as if he had conducted such operation in a hotel in which case there would he no responsibility resting upon the hotel people.
Very truly yours.

Office Holding
A candidate for office violates the law by announcing that he will per-form the duties of office for less than the compensation fixed by law.
Mr. P. J. Barrett, County Attorney, Greeley, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Your letter of April 14th has been received in which you ask us for our opinion as to the legality of the action of a candidate for the office of sheriff, who, in a published announcement, announces that if the electors of the county will support him, he pledges himself if elected
</seg>
	           <seg id="p285">OPINIONS	283
to perform the duties of the office without a deputy and agrees to turn hack to the general fund of the county $350 per year for four years from the salary provided by law.
It is the opinion of this department that said announcement conveying the offers to the electors is in violation of law. Section Article XV, Constitution of Nebraska provides that officers before taking their offices must take an oath in which, among other things, they must swear that they have not improperly influenced in any way the vote of any elector. Any one making false oath forfeits his right to office and is disqualified from holding another office in the state unless restored to civil rights after having been convicted of making the false oath. Chapter 36, page 104 Laws 1915, sets out further the expenses which a candidate for office may lawfully incur and we do Hot find that the expenses of such an announcement. together with the offer to pay to the county or the public in general, $350 per year. is permitted by law. Consequently it would follow that such action would be unlawful
The salaries of our public officers are fixed by law and it was never intended that any office should he auctioned off by the public to the person who may he willing to perform the duties of the office for the smallest compensation. There is no provision by law for an election to determine the amount of the salary to be paid public officers by any such plan. The salary and fees paid to public officers are fixed by law and naturally follow the offices. The case of State v. Meserve, 58 Neb. 451, holds that a public officer is required to perform all the duties of his office without extra compensation and solely for the compensation fixed by law. It has also been held that county commissioners are without power to allow any additional compensation for services. Logan v. Dean, 34 Neb. 104; Miles v. Holt, 86 Neb. 1. c. 255.
I n the case of Gallaher v. City of Lincoln, 63 Neb. 339, where a person agrees to perform services for less than the legal compensation provided, it was held where he
</seg>
	           <seg id="p286">284	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
sued the city that he could not be estopped by his agreement and that an officer cannot bind himself by an agreement to accept for his services any less sum than the statute allows. The agreement was held void as being absolutely against public policy. This is in line with logic and reason and such agreement is held to be void and absolutely against public policy.
In the case of State v. Collier, 72 Mo. 13, the syllabus is as follows :
"Bribery of the public by candidate for office. It is unlawful for a candidate for public office to make offers to the voters to perform the duties of the office if elected for less than the legal fees. An election secured by means of such offers is void."
It would therefore seem to follow that a candidate making such offer, directly or indirectly, is violating Chap-ter 36, Laws 1915 and even if elected by such means could be removed from the office by quo warranto proceedings.
We believe that we have fully answered your inquiry Yours very truly,

Pardons
The weight of authority sustains the proposition that an unconditional pardon from the President of the United States restores all civil rights.
Mr. E. A. Francis, Business Manager, Hastings Tribune. Hastings, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Your inquiry relative to the restoration of all civil rights after an unconditional pardon from the President of the United States, has received our attention.
</seg>
	           <seg id="p287">OPINIONS	285
You do not state whether or not this man was prosecuted for violation of the state laws as well as federal laws, and we are going upon the theory that he violated only a federal law. Upon this assumption of facts, it is our belief that the unconditional pardon from the President of the United States constitutes a complete restoration of civil rights in all the states of the Union.
There is some disagreement between the authorities on the question of whether or not civil rights are completely restored in the event that there is a violation of state law also. The general rule is, however, that a complete pardon with restoration of civil rights forgives the offense itself. Even in those states where it has been held that there would have to be a restoration of rights under state law, it has been referred to in commenting upon them by other authorities as an unsound proposition of law. Under the conditions stated in your letter however, we are of the opinion that the pardon has resulted in complete restoration of rights.

Paving
Statute requires annual payment of interest on all outstanding unpaid paving assessments.
Howard S. Foe. Esq., County Attorney, Red Cloud, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Because of the uncertainty as to the correct interpretation of Chapter 50 of the Laws of 1919 in respect to the time of payment of interest on outstanding install-ments of paving assessments, it seems desirable in response to many requests both from municipalities and bonding
</seg>
	           <seg id="p288">284	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
houses to adopt some uniform rule of construction and in default of court decisions on the subject this duty devolves upon the Attorney General.
The Legislature authorized municipaltities to incur a certain obligation for paving. It would seem unusual if a feasible method of liquidating this obligation were not also provided. If the interest on outstanding installments is only payable when the installment itself becomes due, the municipality has no way of meeting the annual or semi-annual interest as the case may be upon its bonds. Such a contingency is quite undesirable and was probably never intended by the Legislature. In our opinion the statutes should be so construed as to require the annual payment of all interest on all outstanding installments. This seems the only feasible financial plan of paying bond interest and is, L believe, the plan generally adopted throughout the state. In the city of Lincoln the statute specifically so pre-scribes (Section 4765. Revised Statutes. 1913) and in our opinion all municipalities and County Treasurers should enforce this plan.
Very truly yours.

Peddlers—Municipal Corporations
A person who takes orders for goods offered by a foreign company, which orders are to be subsequently filled, is not a peddler. Such a transaction by virtue of its interstate character is entitled to be treated as interstate commerce.
Mrs. Alma M. Strall, Wisner, Nebr.
Dear Madam : In answer to your inquiry regarding the imposition of the license tax or occupation tax on
</seg>
	           <seg id="p289">OPINIONS	287
peddlers and persons selling goods by sample in cities and villages of Nebraska :
Cities and villages have the power to license and tax hawkers and peddlers as this power is given them by Section 5028 of the Revised Statutes of 1913.
They also have the right to raise revenues by levying and collecting a license tax on any occupation or business within the limits of the city or village which power is given I v Sent ii at 5114, Revised Statutes of 1913.
The question raised in your letter is whether a person who solicits orders in such city or village for goods to be sold by a company located in another state and who subsequently tills such orders as agents for such foreign company is subject to the imposition of a license tax or occupation tax.
The authorities are almost unanimous in holding that a person who sells and obtains orders for goods by the display of samples and delivers none of these goods at the time of sale is not a peddler. (21 R. C. L. page 184.) In this connection I refer you to a Nebraska case entitled Scribner v. Moore, 90 Neb. Page 21. One Moore who was an agent for a tea company located at Fremont took orders for tea in the town of Scribner. It was sought by the village of Scribner to impose a license upon him as a peddler. The evidence showed that the Moyune Tea Company carried on a grocery business in the city of Fremont and employed William Moore to deliver groceries, teas and flavoring extracts in a delivery wagon and that he made periodical visits to the village of Scribner and that on these visits he would deliver groceries that had previously been ordered and would receive orders to be delivered later. The supreme court of Nebraska in deciding this case in favor of Moore held that Mr. Moore was not a peddler.
It has been held and settled by the courts that where the state has expressly conferred on a municipal corporation the power to tax certain classes, namely peddlers, that
</seg>
	           <seg id="p290">REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
power is to be strictly construed and the municipal corporation may not under that power or by virtue of any general police power extend the term peddler to cover others who are not peddlers. (21 R. C. L. Page 192.)
A great many statutes and ordinances go beyond the regulation of peddling and provide that there may be no solicitation for orders or sales by samples unless the peddler has secured a license. It is held that such statutes and ordinances are inapplicable to the soliciting for orders for goods which are to be shipped from one state into another, for such transactions are directly connected with interstate commerce. And an order taken in one state and filled by shipment from another state is so essentially and plainly interstate commerce that a local agent receiving a bulk shipment from outside the state in response to local orders and distributing the goods after breaking the hulk cannot be taxed as he is engaged in completing the inter-state transaction. (21 R. C. L. Page 195.)
A state or municipality cannot tax a business engaged in interstate commerce by imposing a license on its agents or salesmen. (17 R. C. L. Page 491.1
A distinction has been made where the goods or property at the time of the sale are within the state and under the control and care of the agent as opposed to the principle governing when the goods are outside the state at the time of the sale, that it is established that the property concerned is outside of the state at the time of the sale and is to be imported later. License taxes are as a general rule invalid as in such cases such license taxes are held to be a burden on interstate commerce transactions. (17 R. C. L. Page 495.)
The supreme court of the United States has passed on this question many times and I do not feel it is necessary to set forth all of the eases. However, I would refer you to the case of Crenshaw v. Arkansas, 227 U. S. 390. which was decided by the supreme court of the United States. It was held in this case that where a tax on peddlers who
</seg>
	           <seg id="p291">OPINIONS	289
sell and forthwith deliver goods is within the police power of the state but a tax on one who travels and solicits orders for goods to be shipped from out of the state is a burden on interstate commerce and is unconstitutional. This case is generally cited for the reason that it contains a resume of other cases decided upon this same question by the United States Supreme Court. The cases of Caldwell v. North Carolina. 187 U.S., 622; Brennan v. City of Titusville. 11 U. S., 829; Dozier v. Alabama, 218 U. S. 125; Robbins v. Shelby Taxing District, 120 U. S., 490 are all cases decided by the supreme court of the United States which support the legal proposition as above set out.
Therefore by virtue of the above this department advises you that by the weight of authorities, an agent of a foreign corporation which has goods to sell may solicit orders for such goods and may subsequently deliver the goods thus ordered without being subjected to a local tax for the reason that the agent in doing these things is merely working for his employer in the carrying out of an interstate commerce transaction. The courts have held that the foreign company would have the right to offer its goods for sale by advertising or by catalogue and subsequently deliver the goods without being subject to a local tax, and that therefore the same company could, if it so chose, employ an agent to make its sales rather than to rely upon a catalogue or other advertising methods.
But we wish to make it clear that if a person carries along with him a stock of goods (not samples ) and solicits orders and immediately tills from his stock of goods these orders, 1w would then be classed as a peddler and subject to it local tax.
Yours very truly,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General.

Dear. Mrs. Jacobsen : Your letter of the 29th instant addressed to Governor S. R. McKelvie has been referred to this Department for answer. You are advised that incorporated villages have the power to license, regulate or prohibit billiard or pool halls within the limits of such village; and to restrain or prohibit gambling. If the pool hall is outside of the limits of the village the proprietor of the same must get a license from the County Hoard and such a licensed pool hall is required by state law to close at 10 p.m. A village such as Eagle has a right to regulate or prohibit pool or billiard halls as the trustees see fit.
A state law forbids the owner or keeper of a billiard or pool hall to permit any minor under the age of eighteen years to he in the premises occupied by him for billiard or pool hall. This law is Sect ion 8813 of' the Statutes of 1913 as amended by Senate File 77 passed by the last session of the Legislature. Another state law, Section 8808 of 1913 Revised Statutes makes it unlawful for anyone to allow a billiard table to be used for betting and provides a fine of not less than $300.00 and not more than $500.00 or imprisonment in the pentitentiary not to exceed two years for violation of this law. Section 8809 provides that whoever permits a room. building. etc. to be used for gambling shall be fined or imprisoned. Section 8811 makes it unlawful to entice a minor to gamble. However. there is no state law forbidding gambling on the street except in certain specific cases some of which are mentioned above. However, the village board has power to regulate the same.

Primary Elections
To become a candidate for county superintendent at the primary election one must be a resident of the county.
Miss Blanche Benson, Angora, Nebr.
Dear Madam: Referring to your letter of May 12 you are advised that the Nebraska Election Laws provide that a person to he an elector in a county must have been in the county forty days, therefore we think it would follow as a matter of course that a candidate for an office in a vomit v should have been a resident in the county for a period of forty days preceding the primary election.
However. the question of whether or not a person should be a resident in the county in which he is a candidate for County Superintendent is definitely answered by Chapter 88 of the 191 ii Session Laws.
Chapter 88 provides that the judges of the supreme court of the Mate of Nebraska * * * county superintenents * * * shall hereafter he nominated regardless of political affiliation in the manner following:
At least thirty days prior to the date of holding the general primary election in the State of Nebraska,. all candidates for supreme judge, for district judge and county judges, state superintendent of public instruction, county superintendents and regents of the State University, shall file with the officer whose duty it is to issue the cer-tificate of election to the aforesaid officers, a statement of such candidate. in substantially the following form, to-wit:

"s   All persons who are candidates for such positions shall also file with said petitions and affidavits a receipt for the sum of ten dollars signed by the County Treasurer of the county in which such person resides, said amount to be used to help defray the expenses of said primary."
We are of the opinion that it is plain that the form of affidavit set out in the above statute indicates that the name of the county to be tilled in such an affidavit governs the county in which the person filing such affidavit is a candidate for such political office. You will note by a study of the affidavit and petition that nowhere except in the part of the affidavit stating the residence of the person is any reference made to the county in which they seek to become an officer.
You will note that the law further provides t hat such candidates must have a receipt from the county treasurer in the county where they reside to help defray the expense of said primary. One can see that should you pay the sum of $10.00 to the county in which you reside for the privilege of tiling in another county. that the money so paid would not in any way help to defray the expense of the primary election in which you seek to become a nominee.
The acquisition of a new place of residence is largely one of intention accompanied by acts which prove such intention. Therefore while you may have been a resident of one county you may move to another, and if such a move is accompanied by an intention to make the second county your permanent residence you are front that time a resident of such county.
Hoping this answers your question, I ant.

Primary Elections
In the case of a personal filing a person must not only pay and receive a receipt tor filing fees. but this receipt must be presented to the county clerk together with the application provided for by Section 2114, 1922 Compiled Statutes, thirty days prior to the primary election. to enable his name to appear on the primary election ballot.
Mr. John H. Hardin Route 1, Alma, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Referring to your letter of July 5, let me say that I am unable to find any trace whatsoever of any letters Of inquiry received from D. L. Hunt concerning the matter discusssed in your letter.
Your letter is not altogether clear in what you actually (lid in an attempt to become a candidate for the office of county treasurer. For the purpose of answering your inquiry I assume that you merely paid the required fee to the county treasurer and obtained a receipt during the time allowed by statute for filing for office. I also assume that you intended your tiling to be a personal filing and not one ma&amp; by twenty-five qualified electors on your behalf. Upon these assumed facts, it is the opinion of this department that your tiling was not completed within the time required by law.
Section 2157 of the 1913 Revised Statutes provides the manner of Hulking a personal tiling. You evidently did not comply with this section. Furthermore, Section 2156 of the 1 1913 Revised Statutes prohibits the county clerk from receiving your tiling papers until your receipt should be presented to that officer. Therefore, although you might make the proper application for filing yet your application could nut be tiled so as to permit you to appear upon the ballot 1111111 after the required receipt was presented to the county clerk.
Section 2157 of the 1913 Revised Statutes plainly provides that a personal tiling must have been completed at least thirty days prior to the primary election and directs

-that otherwise the name of the candidate shall not appear upon the official primary ballot. The Statutes provide certain means for persons to become candidates for political offices and these provisions must be followed to entitle a person to have his name placed upon the ballot in the primary election.
In view of the Statutes above referred to. it is the opinion of this department that the county clerk was correct in his ruling that your name could not appear upon the ballot at the primary election. This opinion is merely our idea of the construction that would be placed upon this Statute if this controversy should be brought before a court. It is very unfortunate that you did not comply with the Statutes and since you have asked for our opinion, we are compelled to advise you on the assumed state of facts, that we believe you are not entitled to have your name appear upon the ballot. You understand that an opinion of this department is as the word implies. merely an opinion. and is not in the least binding upon a court.

A candidate may have his name on separate ballots at the primary but is entitled to the nomination only as provided by law.
H. Leslie Smith, Lawyer, Scottsbluff, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Answering your letter of June 1 7th wherein you state that two persons have filed as candidates on the Democratic ticket and that later a petition was filed for them as candidates on the new Progressive party ticket, and on account of the failure of the petition of the Progressive
</seg>
	           <seg id="p297">OPINIONS	295
party members to state that these candidates were candidates of two parties, the county clerk has stated that their names may not be placed on the Progressive ticket, and you inquire as to whether or not the county clerk has misconstrued the law will state:
Section 2158, Revised Statutes 1913. as amended by Chapter 35. Page 111. Laws of Nebraska 1917, provides that the name of auy candidate play appear on one or more of the party tickets it' the proper filings have been made. The law then states under what circumstances he may be entitled to the nomination of the minority party. This clearly indicates that a candidate may appear as a candi- date of more than one party on the primary ballot. It does not seem to be opposed to the provisions of the law which prohibits persons names appearing more than once on the ballot for the reason that the name appears in the primary on separate ballots.
We believe that part of Section 2170, Revised Statutes 191:1 which says that when the name of a candidate appears on a petition presented by a political party or members thereof. etc.. and it is expressly stated in said petition that the candidate is a candidate of two or more parties, then that it should be the duty of the officer to put his name on the ballot, etc., should be construed as a special provision pertaining to circumstances where two parties have nominated a fusion or agreed candidate. This seems particularly true when it is considered that in the same connection it is provided that the candidates of the party may be nominated in a certain way. There seems to he nothing in the law prohibiting the persons' names from appearing upon the separate ballot in the manner indicated.
Yours very truly.

Primary Elections
A candidate for a county office, at the primary election, in order to obtain a recount under Section 2197, Revised Statutes. 1913. must file the proper affidavit with the canvassing board within three days after the canvassing board first convenes.
W. E. Hill, County Attorney, Stapleton, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Referring to your telegram of July 26, we wired von as follows: "Affidavit must be filed within three days after completion canvass by hoard convening first Friday after election.-
The Thirty-sixth Extraordinary Session of the Nebraska Legislature passed three arts (Chapters 1, 2 and 3) pertaining to people in the military service voting by mail. Chapter 1 limits the rights to vote to people in the military service who are situated within continental United States and provides that all ballots east under the provisions of this act must Aw returned to the commission (office of the Secretary of State before midnight of the day on which the primacy is held. This art further provides that the state election commission shall forward to the proper persons in the counties an abstract of the votes pertaining to these counties. Chapter 2 provides that the county canvassing board should take a recess until after 1 he county clerk should receive the certified copy of the abstract of votes east by absent electors who are in the military or naval service of the United States. Chapter 3. amending Section 2194 of the 1913 Revised Statutes, provides that the county canvassing hoard should after completing the canvass of the votes cast at the general primary within said county, adjourn until the second Friday succeeding the primary, at which time they should reconvene and canvass and make return of the votes cast by absent voters in the military and naval service.
Chapter 94 of the 1921 Session Laws is an art complete in itself pertaining to absent voting. This act specific-
</seg>
	           <seg id="p299">OPINIONS	297
ally repeals Chapter 1 of the laws and resolutions of the Thirty-sixth Extraordinary Session. Although this later act did not specifically repeal Chapters 2 and 3 of the laws and resolutions of the Thirty-sixth Extraordinary Session, yet it scents plain that Chapters 2 and 3 were based upon Chapter I and that the reason for the adjournment of the county canvassing hoard until the second Friday following the election, was to allow the State Election Commissioner to forward the abstract of votes cast by mail to the proper count y officials to be counted there.
Chapter 94 of the 1921 Session Laws makes provision for the votes cast by absent voters in the military or naval service of the United States or State of Nebraska, and further provides (Section 10) that the county canvassing board after meeting, but before proceeding to the canvass, should sit as an absent voter's election board. This would indicate that the votes cast by mail should be counted before the hoard proceeds to the canvass. Therefore, it seems that it should follow that when the county canvassing hoard meets on the first Friday following election and proceeds to count the votes cast by mail, and then proceeds to canvass all of the votes cast, that the time has passed for counting additional votes cast by mail.
It is therefore the opinion of this department that Chapter 94 of the 1921 Session Law repeals by implication Chapters 2 and 3 of the laws and resolutions of the Thirty-sixth Extraordinary Session as pertains to the time in which votes cast by mail shall be counted and canvassed. Therefore, it is our opinion that when the county canvassing board meets on the first Friday following election and proceeds to count the votes cast by mail and canvasses the total votes cast for the county and completes their canvass as required by law, that their duties as a canvassing board have been completed even though this is before the second Friday following the election.
We think it follows that for a candidate to obtain a recount under Section 21117 of the 1913 Revised Statutes,
</seg>
	           <seg id="p300">298	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
he must have filed the proper affidavit with the canvassing board within three days after the completion of the county canvass, which began when the county canvassing board first convened, that is, on the first Friday following the election.
It is true that there is a great deal of construction in this opinion, and that the answer to your inquiry is not something capable of definite and certain proof, but in giving you this opinion we simply give you our opinion of what a court would hold should this question be presented to it.
Trusting this answers your inquiry, I am. Very sincerely yours,

Primary Elections
Voters can select party candidate by writing name in on primary election ballot.
J. L. McPheely, Exq., Attorney at Law, Minden. Nebr.
Dear Sir: Assuming that you have duly filed as Republican candidate for county attorney, that there are no filings upon any ticket and that at the primary election the name of some Democrat is written in on the blank space on the Democratic ticket, in our opinion the name of the person so written in at the primary, should go upon the election ballot.
Section 2176, Revised Statutes of 1913 provides that the primary ballot shall be printed substantially as is required by law for the election ballots. Section 9995, Re- vised Statutes of 1913 provides for a blank space upon
</seg>
	           <seg id="p301">OPINIONS	299
ballots into which electors may write the name of any person for whom they wish to vote. It appears to have been the intention of the legislature not to limit the elector to the names printed on the ballots but to permit him to vote for anyone he chooses for the place. Such appears to be the ruling of the supreme court in the case of State v. Hogeboom, 103 Neb. tins. Of course the person nominated by having his name written in must file acceptance of the nomination under Chapter 9(1 of the Laws of 1919. but if he does so, in our opinion, his name should go on the election ballot provided he receives a majority of the votes in the primary.
We hesitate to disagree with you upon any legal matter. but in our opinion the case of State v. Hogeboom, 103 Nell. bus, shows pretty clearly the attitude of the supreme court in case such question comes before it.

Dear Sir: Your letter to the Attorney General under date of February 13. 1922. pertaining to the subject (of primary elections in cities of the second class having a population of less than five thousand, is at hand.
We have carefully read your letter and answering the inquiries contained in it, desire to say that in our opinion, Section 2138, Revised Statutes for Nebraska for 1913, as amended on page 101, Laws of Nebraska 1915,
and as amended on page 223, Laws of Nebraska 1919, provides:
"This article shall not apply to special elections to fill vacancies nor to municipal elections in cities having less than twenty-five thousand population."

A part of Chapter 9-, Laws of 1919, held up by initiative and referendum petition, but it does not apply to this particular clause as I recall the circumstances.
In any the same provision has been carried through in different amendments so that it seems that the article providing for primary elections does not apply to a municipality of the size of University Place.
It would, therefore, follow that the nomination of candidates at the municipal election in that city would lie governed by the provisions of Section 2166, Revised Statutes of Nebraska 1913, which provides that all nominations for candidates of any political party for office to be tilled by a special election or any other office to be filled by electors excepted from the provisions of this article shall be nominated by convention or a committee of their political party. This section provides further down the section that certificates for nomination Of municipal officers shall he tiled with the clerk of such municipal corporation wherein the officers are to be elected.

Railroads—Passes
Mr. John E. Curtiss, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission.
Dear Sir: In answer to your question as to what authority railroads have to issue passes to dependent relatives or their officers, agents or employees, I have this to say:
</seg>
	           <seg id="p304">302	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
Part of the statute reads as follows (Section 6081) :
"It shall be unlawful for any railroad company or corporation, owning or operating any line or lines of railroad in the state of Nebraska, or any officer or agent of any such company or corporation, to directly or indirectly issue or give to any person or persons any free ticket, free pass or free transportation in any form for the transportation of any passenger or passengers on or over any line or lines of railroad, or any part thereof, so owned or operated by it in the state of Nebraska, except to persons within the classes hereinafter designated and limited; and it shall also be unlawful for any person or persons not included within the classes hereinafter designated and limited to accept and use any such free ticket, free pass, or free transportation in any form for travel on and over any line or lines of railroad or any part thereof in the state of Nebraska. Provided, however, nothing contained in this section shall be construed to prohibit or make unlawful the issuing or giving of any such free ticket. free pass or free transportation to any person or persons within the classes hereinafter designated and limited, or the acceptance and use of the same by persons within such classes, viz: officers, agents, bona fide employes, the major portion of whose time is devoted to the service of such railroad company, and the dependent members of their immediate families; *	* * *"
"Dependent members of family" means those who derive their support from such family.
Baueau v. Gile, Administrator. 50 Wis.. 614;
Duval v. Hunt, (Fla.) 15 So. 876.
The term "immediate family" indicates a group of persons constituting one household. It does not include relatives who are not living in the family.
Davin v. Davin, 99 N. Y. S. 1012.
In Dalton v. Knights of Columbus (Conn.), 67 Atlantic 510, the court, in interpreting the provisions of an insurance policy, used this language:
"We think that the charter. in limiting the persons eligible to designate as a beneficiary. uses the words 'immediate family' with the meaning of a group of persons, of which the insurance member is one, connected as one family, and from which is excluded any member who has become separated from the group as constituting one household, and that 'immediate family' certainly includes all persons bound together by the ties of relationship, as parents and children living together as members of the household under one head."
The provision referring to dependent members of immediate families, or officers, etc., is contained in a proviso
</seg>
	           <seg id="p305">OPINIONS	303
which indicates that it should be strictly construed. The general tenor of t he section indicates that it was not the intention of the legislature to permit a liberal construction. Where persons are described in the reports of railroads as dependent relatives specific inquiry should be made as to the facts in each instance and unless they clearly fall within the definitions above indicated the respective companies should be notified to cancel such passes.

Mr. Hale, Holden. President, C., B. &amp; Q. R. R. Co., Chicago,
Dear Sir: Your favor of the 19th inst., enclosing a copy of your favor of August 17, 1921, duly received. Your former letter seems either not to have been received, or to have been misplaced after its receipt; at least, it does not appear in our tiles.
We appreciate your desire to cooperate with this Commission in the enforcement of the anti-pass law. In the proviso in Section 6081, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, "the interchange of passes" is not prohibited. Under the proviso in Section 1 of the Interstate Commerce Act, quoted by you. "the interchange of passes" is permitted. It is obvious that the language of the statute in each case implies mutuality and that there can he no giving of a pass by one carrier when the other carrier cannot give a pass in exchange. The term clearly carries the idea of correlation. As the Stock Yards company does not carry passengers it has nothing to exchange or interchange.
</seg>
	           <seg id="p306">304	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.
This meaning of the word was undoubtedly in mind when the case, United States v. Erie R. R., 236 U. S., 259, cited by you, was decided. This language is found in the opinion:
"Counsel seems to think that the railroads have an eager desire to distribute passes and burden their transportation service with a crowd of free passengers. Congress certainly had no such view and gave power to exchange passes, considering that the best safeguard against its abuse was the interest of the carriers."
The exception allowing an interchange of passes is contained in each instance in a proviso, which precludes liberal construction.
I should be glad to hear from you further in regard to this.

CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General.

Mr. Byron Clark. Solicitor, C., B. &amp; Q. R. R. ('o., Omaha, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Your favor of the 17th inst. at hand.
I have not previously considered Conference Ruling No. 466. In the Tap Line cases five roads were interested. Two of them have the same stockholders and officers and were apparently operated as one. Each of the roads had substantial mileage. Two of theta operated regular trains, carrying passengers for hire. The others did not. Whether the Interstate Commission intended to include all of the roads under Conference Ruling No. 466 or not is not clear, although the language may include all of them.
The construction of the act suggested by me does not
</seg>
	           <seg id="p307">OPINIONS	305
require exchange of passes by classes of employes, nor does it require equal numbers to be exchanged, nor compulsory exchange. It seems that the construction contended for by the company would make the word "interchange" synonymous wit It "give" The company's position would be sound if the language of the statute were
"Provided, further, the provisions of this section shall not be construed to prohibit and make unlawful the giving of passes to the officers, agents and employes, and dependent members of their immediate families, of other railroad companies."
The question simmers down to this: Can there be an interchange when one of the parties does not possess the article? Can you and I trade horses if you have no horse? The Tap Line decision, as quoted by you, seems to answer the quest ion. If the Stock Yards company actually carried passengers. no matter how few, it could interchange passes for passengers, but since it does not carry passengers at all it seems impossible that it falls within the proviso of the statute.

Railroads—Liability for Losses Grainger Brothers Co., Lincoln, Nebr.
Gentlemen: Your favor of the 27th inst., addressed to the Nebraska State Railway Commission, has been handed to me for answer.
"Under the Cummins amendment as amended it is provided:
"That it shall be unlawful for any such common carrier to provide by rule, contract, regulation, or otherwise a shorter period for giving notice of claims than ninety days, for the filing of claims than four
</seg>
	           <seg id="p308">306	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
months, and for the institution of suits than two years, such period for institution of suits to be computed from the day when notice in writing is given by the carrier to the claimant that the carrier has disallowed the claim or any part or parts thereof specified in the notice: Provided, however, that if the loss, damage, or injury complained of was due to delay or damage while being loaded or unloaded, or damaged in transit by carelessness or negligence, then no notice of claim nor filing of claim shall be required as a condition precedent to recovery."
The meaning of the section is very obscure, but it seems to be the rule that if damage in transit is due to the carelessness or negligence of the carrier notice does not have to be given nor does claim have to he filed.
See Halley v. Oregon Short Line, 53 Fed. 569.
It is not clear, as you see, whether the same rule applies in non-delivery or not. My advice in all these cases is to file claim at once. I do this because the express companies have taken advantage of all delays and have rejected great numbers of just claims. They treat claims without regard to ethical principles. We have received a number of letters where they stood squarely on the period of limitation, giving no regard whatever to the justice of the claim. In all cases it is best to bring snit unless they settle the claim forthwith.
The Cummins amendment applies only to interstate shipments. There has been no recent change as to the limitation on intrastate shipments.

Railroads—Tariffs
Mr. John E. Curtiss, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Your favor of the 21st., asking for an opinion as to whether or not the Chicago, Burlington &amp; Quincy Railroad company may be required to supply the Omaha Audit. Company with its tariffs, at hand.
The Omaha Audit Company is a concern engaged in auditing freight bills for shippers and securing adjustments where overcharges have been made. Examination of the statutes does not reveal any provision with respect to supplying tariffs. Section 6133, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 191:1. provides for the printing of schedules of rates and for the inspection thereof by the public. Its terms seem to preclude the idea of compulsion of free distribution of tariffs. Paragraph 1 of Section 6 of the Interstate Commerce Act, as amended. contains provisions similar to those of our statute.
My answer to your question is that under the statutes the company cannot. be compelled to furnish free schedules of rates. I think, however, that the Railway Commission has power to order the company, upon proper showing, to furnish such schedules on payment of a suitable charge.

The state highway fund cannot he expended for the construction of state highways upon land which the state does not own.
Mr. Geo.	Johnson, Secretary, Apartment of Public Works, Lincoln. Nebr.
My dear Mr. Johnson: Pursuant to your request for our opinion relative to the expenditure of money from the State Highway Fund for the construction of stale highways upon land, the title of which is not in the state. allow me to say that it is my opinion that such construction cannot be lawfully made.
Prior to the enactment of the Norris Act of May 25, 1920, which gave the railroads holding federal grants the right to alienate a portion of their right-of-way to munici-palities, counties and states for highway purposes. the Federal Department of Agriculture had approved certain pieces of state highway construction upon land which was leased front these corporations. Even these projects in my judgment should have been very cautiously approached by the Federal Department, because of the great danger of resulting litigation of the corporate lessor.
I am now advised by the Federal Department of Agriculture that they will not approve the expenditure of federal funds on highways located on any grant which the state or some of its subdivisions does not own.
Since the State Highway Fund was created as a complement of the Federal Act, and the State's expenditure must be approved by the Federal Department before the federal aid is given, I would suggest that any future state highway projects are possible only upon right-of-ways on which the State has absolute title.

Roads—School Lands
Under the present state constitution, state school land cannot be sold to
counties for road purposes, but the Board of Educational Lands and
Funds may grant easements over such land for lawfully designated
highways.C
.Cull. County Attorney, Center, Nebr.
Dear Sir: You ask whether under the present Constitution a road can he opened across school land. The present Section 8 of Article 7 of the State Constitution reads:
"No lands now owned or hereafter acquired by the state for educational purposes shall he sold except at public auction under such conditions as the legislature shall provide."
This section does not I think affect a road on a section line since Section 2899 of the 1913 Revised Statutes reads in part.
"The section lines are hereby declared to be public roads in each county in the state," etc.
However. the question of acquiring a title to school land for the purpose of the construction of a road when the saute will not be on a section line is a different question. Section 5855 of the 1913 Revised Statutes was the section under which school land was acquired for road purposes under the old constitution. This section reads in part,
"After the County Board of any county has established a public road, on, over or across any educational land, the county may purchase the land so taken for a public road."
Section 5855 is, in my opinion, contrary to the present Constitution and therefore void for the reason that this section provides a method for the sale of school lands contrary to the present constitution.
The Commissioner of Educational Lands and Funds does not under our present laws have the power to sell school land except in the case of isolated tracts containing less than forty acres, or from one to ten acres of school land for a school house site. Therefore it is the opinion of
</seg>
	           <seg id="p312">310	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
this Department that under the present constitution and our present laws a county board cannot acquire title to school land for the purpose of building a road across the same.
However, an easement may be obtained under Section 4 of House Roll 474 which was passed by the recent session of the Nebraska Legislature. This section reads,
"The Board of Educational Lands and Funds upon application of the Department of Public Works of the State of Nebraska may grant easements over school lands for lawfully designated highways on whatever terms it sees fit."
The obtaining of an easement may satisfy your conditions there.
Perhaps if this situation is brought to the attention of the next Legislature, a method will be devised whereby title to the school land may be obtained.
Hoping this answers your inquiry. I am, Very sincerely yours.

orized to arrange detours around the portion of the state highway closed for repairs. This section provides that the right of way through private land, or temporary right of way, may be secured if satisfactory arrangements can be made with the owner of the land, but that if the highway department cannot thus secure the right of way by agreement that then proceedings may be had for the securing of a right of way on private land, as provided by Section 3 of the act which pertains to relocation, alteration and widening of the highway.
Section 3 referred to provides that the portion of the highway May be relocated, altered or widened when in the opinion of the Department of Public Works it is necessary for the public convenience and safety, and for such purposes power is conferred upon the county hoard of the county to take hold and appropriate the necessary land as is provided for the appropriation of real estate, an prescribed by Sections 1092 to 1096, Revised Statutes, 1913.

Roads—Motor Vehicles—Counties
Machinery for dragging and maintaining highways may be purchased from that part of the motor vehicle registration fees set aside for the road dragging fund.
Mr. 0. E. Bozarth, County Attorney, Elwood, Nebr.
My dear Mr. Bozarth : Replying to your letter of April 7, permit me to say that this office has gone rather carefully into the question of what may be purchased out of
</seg>
	           <seg id="p314">312	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
the automobile fund, which is set aside for the maintenance of highways.
The law pertaining thereto is found in Title VII. Article IV, Section 16, page S24 of Chapter 190 of the Laws of 1919. in which the following language is set forth:
"Twenty-five per cent of all fees so paid to the road dragging fund of the county and it shall he used by the County Board of said county for road dragging, and equipment for road dragging, for strawing, claying or littering the roads and for no other purposes."
It therefore seems to me that the answer to your question is simply a careful scrutiny of the facts regarding the machinery your commissioners propose to purchase from this fund. If it is machinery which is for the dragging and maintenance of highways, it may properly be purchased from this fund. If it is not such machinery but it is machinery which is primarily for the construction or building of highways. then it is not within the phraseology of the statute.
I think we are justified in assuming that dragging of roads under modern conditions means the maintenance of these highways. In a great many of the counties where the highway system is fully developed, the counties are using caterpillar tractors and a certain blade machine instead of a drag, and this outfit accomplishes the same purpose as the dragging machinery. In fact I believe the Highway Department are recommending that these machines which we used to call road graders but which are now developed to the place where they have four or five blades which can be set at different angles to give exactly the proper curve and balance to the roadway, be used by the counties instead of what we used to call the drag. This is only a natural development, and the purchase of caterpillar engines and these machines we have held to he a proper purchase from the automobile road dragging fund.
I have taken the matter up with the Highway Department, and this is the view of the matter they have as well as our own, that these machines and the tractors to draw
</seg>
	           <seg id="p315">OPINIONS	313
them are the standard "drag" and ought to be used on state highways. Therefore by determining what the machinery is calculated to do and what it is to be used for you may determine whether it is chargeable out of the road dragging fund or not. I believe that it has been bought by several counties out of the highway fund, although we have never before formally rendered any opinion about it.

Roads—Advertising—Signs
Perry Reed, Chairman, Senate Committee on lnvestigation, State House Lincoln, Nebr.
My dear Senator Reed: Pursuant to your request of March 22. I have taken up with the Highway Department the question of the legality of a certain contract entered into between the Department of Public Works and the National Highway Signal Service Company. While you do not state I assume that the question at issue in your letter is whether or not it is mandatory upon the department to collect a fee for each one of these signs.
The only law governing this subject is found in Section 17. Article II. Title 7, Chapter 190, being found at page 814 of the 1919 Session Laws. Among other things that section says:
"The department of public works is authorized to remove all advertising signs for which permits have not been duly obtained and is authorized to charge a fee for such permits, such fee to be not less than twenty-five cents.	* "
While I was not consulted about the validity of the
</seg>
	           <seg id="p316">314	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
contract in question at the time it was entered into, I can well understand that the secretary has interpreted the word "authorized" to mean "may" instead of "shall", especially in view of the first part of the sentence which says:
"authorize:I to remove all advertising signs"
Certainly no one suspected at the time this statute was passed that we were placing upon the Highway Department the responsibility of removing all signs from our highways. As a member of the previous session, you will recall yourself that the purpose was merely to give the department authority to remove these signs. Why should the word mean any different in the last half of the sentence where the department "is authorized to charge a fee for such permit s?"
I realize that it is the consensus of opinion that a fee should be paid for the advertising privileges. I am not at all sure, however. that the statute requires it. Whatever the requirement may be the secretary of the department advises me. owing to the fact that it seemed to he the consensus of opinion that as a matter of policy he ought to charge a fee for these signs. that he has therefore altered his contract with the National Advertising Company to conform to this opinion, and that such fees have been paid.
Very truly yours,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS, March 25. 1921.	Attorney General.
Roads—County Commissioners
County commissioners are entitled to extra compensation provided by law for directing road work.
Mr. H. A. Brubaker. County Attorney, Nelson, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Answering your inquiry of September 15th pertaining to compensation to be paid county commissioners:
</seg>
	           <seg id="p317">OPINIONS	315
Your inquiry is in two parts; first, whether or not in addition to the fixed salary the commissioners are entitled to extra compensation under that provision of Section 2389, Compiled Statutes, 1922, which reads as follows:
"Provided, further, that for each day actually employed in directing road work in his district, each member of the county board shall be paid the sum of five dollars per day to be paid out of the road fund of his district."
The other part of your inquiry pertains to the legal payment of such per diem in the event that the road grading should have taken place after the first day of November and before the first day of April following. The time just stated is that fixed by Section 2631, Compiled Statutes, 1922, within which the grading of the public roads shall be done, containing an exception where it is necessary to grade in order to complete a bridge.
Referring to the first part of your inquiry, you will note that the allowance of 81300 as salary is for counties having less than two thousand square miles of territory and having more than thirteen thousand and less than twenty-five thousand inhabitants. We understand, therefore, that the fixed salary fur Nuckolls county would be $1300. You will note the section which provides the fixed salary, in referring to the maximum amount of compensation, states that it shall be the maximum amount of compensation, in-cluding mileage and per diem, to be paid or drawn by any member of the board "except as hereinafter provided." This language would seem to indicate that the following provisions might indicate other or additional compensation. One of the following provisions which comes within the meaning of the words "hereinafter provided", is undoubtedly that part of the section which refers to counties having an area of not less than two thousand square miles of territory. etc. This section is followed by the additional provision pertaining to compensation for directing road work. It is also to be noted that the compensation for directing road work is to be paid out of the road fund, thus indicating that this is a specific provision for additional
</seg>
	           <seg id="p318">316	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
compensation to be paid out of the specific fund designated. It is also to be noted that this compensation is not limited to directing work pertaining to grading. but pertains to directing "road work"
It is therefore our opinion that the commissioners would be entitled to extra compensation fur directing road work.
Referring to the second part of your inquiry, we call your attention to the latter part of Section 2649, Compiled Statutes, 1922.  which provides that the county board. highway commissioner or other proper authority may have full authority to exercise supervision and superintendence over all the road improvement under this act and shall take care that the same is done in a thorough and workmanlike manner under proper conditions of weather for securing the best results. By Section 2631, preceding, it would seem that the legislature has set the time within which grading can he done in order to secure best results. Section 2649, Compiled Statutes. 1922, is a later statute and if there is any need of construction of Section 2631, it would seem that the county board is given some discretion in determining what are proper conditions for performing the road work. It therefore might Ike said that Section 2631 is directory merely and not mandatory. I am unable to find any construction of this section by the courts. and a court decision might be necessary to determine whether or not this is a mandatory section.
Inasmuch as this section has one exception only would he an indication that the legislature intended to definitely determine the time within which the grading might be done. But in the light of the later section it would be our idea that Section 2631 is directory and that if the board has properly graded the roads in question that the commissioners would be entitled to compensation for this work so far as their duties are connected with it. under the theory
</seg>
	           <seg id="p319">OPINIONS	317
that it is supervision and superintendence over road improvements as provided by Section 2649.

Schools—Tuiticn—Residence
Only residents of a school district are entitled to free school privileges for their children or minor wards.
Residence includes an intention to make the abode permanent and fixed.
Marcus Hoops. M. D.. Springfield, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Referring to your letter of November 23d, let me say first that it is rather hard to decide the question without knowing all of the facts involved. In the main the question of whether or not tuition should be paid depends upon whether or not the children are residents of the district.	In the case of the little girl from South
Dakota. assuming your state of facts to be true and assuming that the uncle is not the guardian of the child, we would say that we believe tuition should be required in her case.
Referring to the other families who move into your school district during the year. we would say on the face of things it looks as though this were an attempt to evade the payment of tuition by a subterfuge. However, we decline to make this positive statement without being fully acquainted with the facts. The whole proposition turns on the matter of residence. The Supreme Court held in the case of State v. School District of Superior, 55 Neb. 317:
"Whereon, who owns a farm which has been his domicile for many years, moves his family and a portion of his furniture to a neighboring city during the fall, temporarily, for the purpose of educating his chil-
</seg>
	           <seg id="p320">318	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
dren, and not with the intention of gaining a new home, and returns to the farm at the end of each school year with his family and furniture, his legal residence remains at the farm."
In the case of Wood v. Roeder, 45 Neb. 311, the court held:
"To effect a change of domicile, there must not only be a change of residence, but an intention to permanently abandon the former home. The mere residing at a different place, although evidence of the required intention, does not per se constitute a change of domicile."
Before one can establish a residence in Springview there must be an intention of making this his permanent. home. Residence has been defined as personal presence in permanent and fixed abode. If, therefore, a family moves into a school district intending only to stay there during the school veal' without an intention to make this their permanent home, they are we believe, for the purpose of collecting tuition. non-residents of the district.
You will understand that in discussing this matter we are going outside of the duties and requirements of this department. and you will also understand that no one is bound by the opinion of this department. which is simply our belief of what a court would hold should the matter in question be presented to it for determination.
Very sincerely yours,

Schools—Tuition
The situs of children for school purposes and the fixing of tuition charges
is fixed by residence and location of land for taxation purposes.
Mr. M. H. Garvin, Fairfield, Nebr.
Dear Sir : Your letter pertaining to school privileges in Fairfield has been received. We note that your resi-
</seg>
	           <seg id="p321">OPINIONS	319
device is located in the country school district and that your farm for taxation purposes is divided and a portion of the tax goes to the country district and part to the town district. It seems that your residence therefore is really in the country district and that technically you would have to pay tuition for sending your children to the city high school.
We have taken this matter up with the state superintendent and he is of the same opinion as this department. The only recourse we can see for you would be to consult with your county superintendent and by the next school year make arrangement to have your land all taxed in the city district, move your house into the district, or take some other means by which you would be relieved of the tuition charge.
We agree with you that it does seem rather unjust in your particular case that you should pay taxes in the city district and not have privileges there even though you pay many times the amount of taxes paid by some others who send t heif children to the city district. This is a matter governed by residence and location of land upon which you reside, fur taxation purposes. So we cannot make any suggestions which would give you relief, other than the ones heretofore made.

district of attendance has the right to rely upon the certificate as being of full force and effect unless notified to the contrary.
Mr. W. 7'. Bourke, 603 City Hall, Omaha, Nebr.
Dear Mr. Bourke: In compliance with your request, I return herewith correspondence between you, the State Superintendent and this department in connection with free high school tuition.
Supplementing our opinion of October 7th in reference to the obligation imposed upon a school district which has granted a high school certificate to a pupil, to notify the school district of attendance in the event that the parents of such child move from the district to another district, or outside the state, will say that it is my opinion that this obligation to so notify the school district of attendance obtains in cases where the parents of such child move into another district in the state, as well as to somc point outside the state.
If the school district of attendance is granting a pupil high school instruction by virtue of a free high school certificate, such district of attendance has the right to rely upon said high school certificate as being in force. and if any conditions arise in the school district of issuance which tend to relieve such district of issuance and further liability on such certificate, as between the school district of attendance and the school district of issuance, in the event that one of the two districts would be forced to suffer a loss, the equities would favor the school district of attendance, unless they were notified by the school district of issuance that the parents moved from such district and that the certificate was no longer effective.

Public school district may not lawfully pay tuition to denominational or parochial school.
Hon. John .11. Matzen, State Superintendent, State House, Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir: The purpose of the free high school education hi W. Sections 6813 to 6818, Revised Statutes, 1913, the same being Article 8 of the School Law, is to insure a free high school course to every child in Nebraska.
In case the district does not maintain a free high school. the child may attend another "public high school" and the district of his residence is liable for his tuition in the amount of $3.00 per week.
Section 6814, Revised Statutes, 1913, as amended in 1921. authorizes the payment of tuition only to public high schools. The Nebraska Central College to which District 8 of Merrick County desires to send its high school pupils is I understand a denominational institution and not a public high school. The board of District 8 has no power	or authority to contract, with a denominational
or parochial school for high school education, even though a cheaper rate may be obtained from such private institution. Public money cannot be used directly or indirectly for the support of parochial or denominational instit t ions.

When a person transfers his school privileges to another district and has children of school age attending, the district into which the transfer is made is bound to furnish free high school tuition for-his other children who have complied with the requirements of the state law.
Anna Donahoe. County Superintendent, O'Neill, Nebr.
Dear Madam: Your letter of July 15th addressed to the State Superintendent and his reply, together with your letter of July 27th, has been referred to this department for our opinion.
We understand from the correspondence that Mr. Braddock transferred his school privileges from District 55 to District 128 under the provisions of Section 6942 of the 1913 Revised Statutes and that Mr. Braddock now has children of school age attending school in District 128 and has two children of high school age who are asking for free high school tuition from District 128. The question is: Is District 128, being the district into which Mf. Braddock transferred for school privileges, liable for the high school tuition of his children, Mr. Braddock having also children attending grade school in District 128. We believe that under the circumstances District 128 is liable for such high school tuition.
Section 6942 of the 1913 Revised Statutes was amended by Section 3 of Chapter 121 of the 1915 Session Laws. This act makes provision for parents or guardians of children of school age residing more than a certain distance from the school house in their own district transferring for school purposes to a near adjoining district. This act provides the procedure to be complied with in making such a transfer and further provides that :
"The county superintendent shall notify the county clerk of the transfer, and the county clerk shall be empowered, and it is hereby made his duty, to place the school taxes, except for the payment of existing bonds or interest on the same, of the parents or guardians and of the real estate on which they reside, not exceeding a quarter section of land,
</seg>
	           <seg id="p325">OPINIONS	323
for the year next ensuing, in the adjourning district instead of in the district of their residence, basing such school taxation upon the levy for school purposes in the adjoining district, and the assessed valuation of the property of such parents or guardians and the real estate as determined by the proper officers, and the taxes shall be collected as provided by law for the other taxes: Provided, when such transfer shall have been made, the children continue to have school privileges in the adjoining district until their parents or guardians shall, in writing, notify the county superintendent of their desire to be again transferred to the district of their residence or shall remove from said real estate; in either event. the county superintendent shall notify the county clerk of such re-transfer, and the taxes of the parent or guardian and the real estate shall again be placed in the district of their residence: Provided, further, the parents or guardians of the pupils so transferred, shall have the right to vote in the diarist to which such pupils are transferred on all school matters except that of issuing bonds."
It must be noted that upon such a transfer the property of the one who transfers lying in the district of his residence becomes taxable in the district into which he transfers, excepting only taxes for the payment of existing bonds or the interest on same. It seems plain that once the transfer is made it continues until the parents or guardian shall notify the county superintendent of their desire to be transferred to the district of their residence or until the party who transferred shall move from the real estate in the old district. In either event the County Superintendent should notify the County Clerk of the re-transfer and the property should again be taxed in the old district.
In the present situation it does not seem necessary to pass upon the question of liability of District 128 upon all of Mr. Braddock's children becoming eligible for high school instruction. In the present ease Mr. Braddock has children of school age who are entitled to attend the grade school in District 12S and his property is taxable in District 128, even for the payment of free high school tuition of other pupils living in the district into which he transferred. We think that it should follow that the reason for the transfer still exists, Mr. Braddock now having children of school age who are entitled to attend the school of District 128 and that since Mr. Braddock's property is taxable
</seg>
	           <seg id="p326">324	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
for the support, of District 128 and for the payment of free high school tuition of other pupils living in District 12' that District 128 is liable for the free high school tuition of his children eligible for high school instruction, providing the proper steps have been taken to secure such high school tuition.
The correspondence would indicate that the children of Mr. Braddock who desire high school privileges are of school age as provided by statute. This would seem to be another reason why District 128 should over and above the described facts, pay the high school tuition of these children.
We have passed upon this question before to the same effect and it is our opinion that the conclusions that we have reached in this letter would be reached by a court, should this matter be brought to it for adjudication.

Schools—Tuition
A country school district is bound to furnish high school tuition for a pupil who has complied with the free high school tuition law, for a period of more than four years, if additional time is required to enable the pupil to complete the regular four year course.
Mr. J. H. Horsey, President of School Board, District No. 81, Tobias, Nebr.
Dear Sir: It is the opinion of this department that a country school is liable for the tuition of a pupil in high school under the provisions of the free high school tuition law for a period of longer than four years, if it requires longer than four years for the pupil to complete
</seg>
	           <seg id="p327">OPINIONS	325
the regular four year course. Of course, the high school would have the right to expel the pupil if he was not doing justice to his school work, but in a case where the high school authorities feel that the pupil should be allowed to continue his work providing the pupil has made proper application, we believe that the high school board can collect this tuition, even though the country district refuses to pay. The high school board is probably the proper party to begin this action, although in the event that this board should refuse to act the parent or the County Superintendent might maintain a successful action.

Schools—Insurance
The trustees of a school district may insure the property of the district in a mutual insurance company.
Mr. Chas. E. Matson, County Attorney, Suite 826 Terminal Bldg., Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir: You ask whether or not trustees of a school district in Nebraska may legally bind the district as a member of a Mutual Insurance Company, by accepting a mutual policy covering fire and tornado hazards on school buildings and school furniture and whether they may thereby subject. the school district to the by-laws and policy form of the Mutual Company equally with individual policy holders.
Answering the latter inquiry first, it is the opinion of this department that a school district as a policy holder in a Mutual Insurance Company stands in exactly the same
</seg>
	           <seg id="p328">326	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
position as to the by-laws and policy form of the insurance company as do individual policy holders.
In answer to the first inquiry, there are three kinds of insurance companies authorized by our statutory law which are commonly known as Mutual Insurance Com-
panies; that is,	Mutual Insurance Companies, Assess-
ment Associations and Fraternal Insurance Companies. Only the first of these is a mutual company as defined by our statutes. Your inquiry concerning school districts could not involve the question of fraternal insurance companies and since your inquiry concerns "Mutual" Insurance Companies. this opinion will be confined to the same.
A mutual insurance company is a company operating in main the same as a capital stock insurance company except for the fact that there is no capital stock. fixed premiums being charged and a reserve being set up similar to a stock company.
Section :1216 of the 1913 Revised Statutes as amended on page 608 of the 1919 Session Laws reads in part :
"Companies may be formed upon the stock or mutual plan to transact any kind of insurance authorized by the next preceding section, or upon the assessment plan to transact the kinds of insurance described in subdivisions one, three, four and six thereof, or upon the fraternal plan to transact the kind of insurance described in subdivision two thereof.. The liability of a member of a mutual company shall he limited to the premium stated in the policy."
If the trustees of a school district have the power to insure the school property, I can see no reason why they should not have the power to insure the same in a mutual insurance company and legally bind the district as a member of that mutual insurance company by accepting the mutual policy. The district would not be liable for more than the premium stated in the policy so that one cannot say that the district is engaging in the insurance business or is being made liable for unlimited assessments. The business advantage of insuring with a stock company is that
</seg>
	           <seg id="p329">OPINIONS	327
the capital stock stands as a guarantee for the payment of all losses while the business advantages in insuring with a mutual company is often the obtaining of cheaper rates for insurance. However, the matter of choosing between a stock company and a mutual insurance company is, I think, a matter which the trustees or officers of a school district have the power to decide.
Hoping this answers your inquiry. I am, Very sincerely yours,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General.

An insurance policy, to protect a consolidated district against the negligence of a driver transporting pupils, should cover all the liability of the driver or the district.
Mr. John M. Matzen, State Superintendent, Lincoln., Nebr. Dear Sir : Referring to your inquiry of September 1,
you are advised that there has been considerable inquiry concerning how consolidated school districts may comply
with Section 7, Chapter 74 of the 1921 Session Laws. Seel ion 7 reads in part :
"When the board of education employes a driver to transport the pupils from their homes to the school and return by means of a public conveyance, said driver so employed shall be employed as and shall be an independent contractor for said purpose of transportation and shall assume all liability arising from, out of or because of his negligence in performance of said contract for transportation, to the exclusion of said school district and the school board or any member thereof, and he shall give a surety bond not exceeding five thousand dollars, the premium on which shall be paid out of the school district treasury, conditioned for the payment by such driver, or his substitute, of any and all damages that may accrue to any person or persons by reason of any negligence
</seg>
	           <seg id="p330">328	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
or carelessness in transporting said pupils from their homes to said school and return."
The purpose of this section is, first, to protect all who might be damaged by reason of the carelessness or negligence of the driver and, second, to transfer the liability from the hoard of education to the driver employed.
As far as we know, no bonding company has been willing to become surety for the liability described in the above quoted statute. This department has given its opinion that if a responsible private party will become surety for a driver that this will suffice. Inquiries have been made concerning whether insurance policies could take the place of the bond required. We have advised correspondents that an insurance policy might be drawn in such a way as to comply with this law. but to date no insurance policy has been submitted to this department which, in our opinion, complies with the statute in question.
Referring to the policy of the Union Automobile Insurance Company issued to school district No. 166, Filley, Nebr., it is the opinion of this department that the obtaining of this policy by the school district is not a full compliance with the law in question.
You will note that the statute makes the driver an independent contractor for the purpose of absolving the district from liability arising from, out of or because of the negligence of the driver in performance of his contract for transportation. The statute intends that the patrons of the school district shall have protection in the event any injury occurs through the driver's negligence. The policy in question does not give to the patrons such protection in this respect. The policy only insures the school district and does not insure the driver as was intended by the statute. In this respect we would recommend that the policy should insure both the school district and the driver, or if such a policy could not be obtained, the policy should insure the driver since by statute he alone is the party responsible.
</seg>
	           <seg id="p331">OPINIONS	329
We believe that statement No. 4 of the schedule of declarations is in a measure contravened in a policy, such as the one in question, made to a school district when the school district furnishes the car for the driver, which driver is paid for carrying passengers. It seems plain to us that the automobile in question is used by the driver for carrying passengers for compensation. Statement No. 4 should be changed so as to exempt from the exception the uses to which an automobile is used for hauling pupils to school.
We see no good reason for making the liability of the insurance company under Section 13 of Conditions, Limita- tions and Agreements less than the liability under Section 12 of the same part of the policy.
With the exceptions above noted, we believe that a court would hold, under the circumstances described in the first part of this letter, that such an insurance policy would be a compliance with that part of Section 7, Chapter 74 of the 1921 Session Laws reading "and he shall give a surety bond not exceeding five thousand dollars, the premium on which shall be paid out of the school district treasury, etc."
We are returning herewith the policy in question.

The statute requiring drivers of school passenger trucks to be bonded applies only to consolidated school districts.
Mr. John Matzen, Superintendent! of Public Instruction, Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Referring to your inquiry of September 11th, you are advised that it is the opinion of this department that Section 7, Chapter 74, Laws 1921, does not apply to any school district except a consolidated schools district,
If a school district other than a consolidated district wishes to secure protection against liabilities that may grow out of transportation of pupils they may secure this protec- tion by insurance provided the policy is so drawn as to cover all liability that may arise therefrom.
The school district board is vested with certain discre- tionary powers which, in our opinion, would include the obtaining of such insurance. We are not recommending that such districts obtain insurance, but only advising you how in our opinion they can protect themselves if they wish to pay for such protection. This is a matter o: business judgment which rests with the officers of the school board.

Proceeds of taxation for school purposes must first be used for current expenses to keep up a school for the minimum period prescribed by law.
Mr. D. S. Watson, Treasurer, Ellsworth, Nebr.
Dear Sir : This department is in receipt of gout letter of December 29 inquiring as to whether or not the proceeds of taxes for each school year should be applied toward the payment of expenses for that year and not to be used to settle previous debts which in your case are repre sented by registered warrants.
This question has been up before and our Supreme Court in the case of State v. Gardner, 79 Neb. 101, seem: to have laid down a rule which though commented upon in other later cases does not seem to have been changed Briefly speaking, the rule seems to be that the current expenses for the minimum time required by law for keeping the school open must be paid in order that children may receive their constitutional rights, to-wit : a free instruc- ion in the common schools of the state. It then seems tha the balance may be used in the payment of registered war rants, thus requiring the school districts to economize to keep their school open for the lawful period of firm provided, and at the same time to pay their debts. This matter is fully discussed in the ease to which I referred The opinion in that case is too long to comment upon a length and we believe that if you will read the opinion you will find that it indicates the action that should b taken by your school board.

Where bonds are voted for a new high school to be located at a certain place, the site may not be changed without affecting the validity of the bonds.
Mr. Lee Bayye, County Attorney, Alliance, Nebr.
Dear Sir: This department is in receipt of your letter of April 18th inquiring whether or not there is some manner in which the site of the new high school building might be changed from block B to the block adjoining. It seems that a proposition was put up to the voters to vote $250,000 of bonds for the erection of a school building upon block B, and that at this election the bonds carried, and have been sold.
In our opinion it is now too late to make any change which might in any way affect these bonds. You can readily see that the voters might be willing to vote for an issue of bonds for erection of a building upon a certain block, whereas they might be opposed to locating it upon another block.
The only suggestion we can make is that your building might be built to the extreme limits of block B adjoining the block desired by the school board. Then if additional ground is needed we presume that if found desirable an additional block might be secured and by ordinance the streets closed which cross between the two blocks.

Dear Sir: Pursuant to our conference this morning, we are advising you in writing as to the powers of the board of which you are a member of a rural high school district.
In our opinion Section 6809 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 as amended and set out as Section 110 of the School Laws gives to the qualified voters of the rural high school district the power to select a site for the school house by a vote of two-thirds of those present at the annual meeting. This indicates that a school house site may not be selected except at the annual meeting.
Section 6807 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, as amended and set forth as Section 108 of the School Laws merely gives the school board the right to acquire and dispose of the buildings, sites or property of the school district.
It is therefore the opinion of this department that your board having been appointed in a new district by the County Superintendent to serve until the next annual election that your board is a properly constituted and legal board of said district, as we presume the requirements for appointment were properly complied with.
Your appointment being proper, it is therefore our opinion that you have the legal right to call a special meeting of the electors of your district, giving notice of the time, purpose and place of the meeting, and there to vote upon the question of voting bonds of the district for the construction of a school house and the purchase of a site,

Schools—Elections—Bonds
Bonds for a rural high school must carry by a majority of the districts when there are more than two districts.
Electors vote in their own districts.
The State Superintendent's opinions supersede those of the Attorney General in school matters.
Mr. Henry W. Frohm, Martel, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Your letter of January 31 written in behalf of the proposed rural high school district near Martell has been received.
Your first inquiry is how to vote on bonds for the rural high school. You inquire whether the electors of each of the three common school districts united for purposes of the high school vote in their own districts on bond issues or whether they hold one election and vote as a combined district composed of the three districts. The answer to this inquiry is contained in Section 6811, Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, which is Section 112. of Article 7 of the 1921 Nebraska School Laws. Answering this inquiry in accordanace with the above, it is our opinion that the electors of each district vote in their own common school district upon the question of the bond issue and that it requires a majority of the districts where more than two districts are voting to carry the bond issue.
Your second inquiry is as to the qualifications of voters on bond issues. This is governed by the provisions of Section 6733, Revised Statutes 1913, being Section 34 of
</seg>
	           <seg id="p337">OPINIONS	335
Article 20, 1921 School Laws. Under the provisions of our present constitution and the law referred to, electors for high school purposes are those electors, both male and female citizens, who have the necessary residence qualifications provided by law and who have children of school age or who had property assessed for taxes in their respective names at the last assessment. All electors residing in the districts wherein the property will be taxed on the bond issue would be eligible to vote if they have the qualifications of school electors.
Your third inquiry refers to those electors who have transferred to another common school district under the provisions of law governing such transfer. Answering your inquiry as to whether these electors may vote on the bond issue. will say that the law provides that they cannot vote on bonds in the common school district to which they have been transferred although they vote in the district to which they have transferred for all other purposes. Therefore, we would say that if the common school district in which they reside is included in the rural school district in which the issue of bonds is to be made that they world vote upon the question of bond issues in the common school district in which they reside.
Your fourth inquiry pertains to the selection of a site for a rural high school building. Section 6809, Revised Statutes 1913. is the section which governs the selection of a site for a rural high school. Section 6738, Revised Statutes 1913, makes provisions for the selection of a site by the County Superintendent in the event that no site can be selected by the inhabitants of the district, but this applies to common school districts and is not a part of that chapter which applies to rural high schools. Hence, we conclude that site for rural high schools is selected in accordance with the first section cited under this paragraph and that it requires a two-thirds vote of the electors present at the meeting. If the electors cannot agree at the first meeting the law provides that they may adjourn from time to time until the selection is made.
</seg>
	           <seg id="p338">336	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
Your sixth inquiry is "Who is the highest authority on school laws, the Attorney General or the State Superintendent" Answering this inquiry we refer you to Section 6901, Revised Statutes 1913, which provides that the State Superintendent is the highest authority. This section provides that the State Superintendent shall decide disputed points in school laws and all such decisions shall be held to have the force of law until reversed by the court.
Very truly yours,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General.

Schools—Elections
All citizens over twenty-one years of age have constitutional right to vote at school elections regardless of parental or property qualifications.
Hon. John M. Matzen, Superintendent of Public Instruction, Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir: In our opinion the restrictions of Section 6733, Revised Statutes, 1913, restricting the right to vote at school elections to citizens of the United States over 21 years of age who either own property assessed in the district or who have children of school age, are in conflict with and are superseded by Section 1, Article VI of the new Constitution of Nebraska, which extends the right of suffrage to every citizen, man or woman, over 21 years of age. In such case the constitution takes precedence.
When the statute was first enacted it operated as an extension to women of the right of suffrage in school elections, our state constitution at that time granting the right to vote to men only. Since the adoption of the new constitution, what was formerly an extension of the right
</seg>
	           <seg id="p339">OPINIONS	337
to vote now becomes a restriction of the right to vote. This interpretation is substantiated by Chapter 92 of the Laws of 1921. which provides that every person 21 years of age "shall have the right to vote for all officers to be elected to public office and upon all questions and propositions submitted to the voters at any and all elections, authorized or provided for by the constitution or laws of Nebraska." The language of Judge Maxwell in the Cones ease. 15 Neb. 444, when considered apart from the actual determination in such case, would lead one to think that the constitutional provisions do not apply to school elections. Snell language., however, was not necessary to the decision. The new constitution granting an absolute right to vote, in our opinion, cannot be changed or restricted by legislative enactment.
Therefore. our conclusion is that every citizen, man or woman, over 21 years of age, who has resided in the school district forty days, has the right to vote at school elections regardless of whether he or she owns property or has children. The legislature may extend the right of franchise, but it cannot restrict it. The property and parentage restrictions in Section 6733 are superseded by the absolute constitutional grant of suffrage to all citizens.
Yours truly,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General.

A majority of the votes cast is required to authorize the issuance of bonds for the erection of a school house in a district organized under Art. VI. Ch. 71 of the 1913 Revised Statutes.
Mr. Guy Johnson, Elgin, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Referring to your letter of July 24, you are advised that it is the opinion of this department that the
</seg>
	           <seg id="p340">338	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
question of issuing bonds for the erection of a school house may be submitted to the electors of the school district as often as the necessary steps are complied with.
Furthermore it is the opinion of this department that Senate File 2211 of the Session Laws of 1921 govern the number of votes necessary to issue bonds for the erection of a school house in a school district organized under Article VI. It is true that Section 448 of 1913 Revised Statutes as amended by Chapter 9 of the 1917 Session Laws provides that:
"No bonds shall be issued until the question has been submitted to the qualified electors of the district, and three-fifths of all the qualified electors present, and voting on the question, shall have declared by their votes in favor of issuing the same. at an election ailed 'or the purpose, upon a notice given by the officers of the district, at least twenty days prior to such election."
However, Senate File -20 is not in the nature of special legislation. Section 4 thereof repeals by implication ('hap-ter 9 of the 1917 Session Laws in so far as it pertains to school districts organized under Article VI. In addition to this, said Section 4 of Senate File 220 is complete in itself, being an independent act governing the matter of levying taxes for a school house and issuing bonds. For the reasons above enumerated it is the opinion of this department that Senate File 220 governs the number of votes necessary to issue bonds for the erection of a school house in a school district organized under Article VI afocesaid.
Trusting this answers your inquiry, I am. Very sincerely yours,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General.

Method of ascertaining number of legal voters in a school district.
Mr. John Speedie, Deputy State :Superintendent, State Hoase, Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir: When a petition purporting to be signed by 51% of the legal voters is presented to a Board of Education praying for the issuance of bonds without submitting the question of issuance to the voters under Chapter 143 of the Laws of 1919, it is the function of the Board of Education to pass upon the sufficiency of the petition and to determine whether it carries the signatures of 51% of the required voters.
This may be done by counting the signatures to the petition and checking them as against the number of votes cast at the last general election. The number of votes cast for Governor at the last general election should be taken as the number of legal voters, unless a satisfactory showing is made that the number of legal voters in the district has changed
When the history of the bonds is written up, it should contain a certificate signed by one member of the Board as to the number of legal voters in the district and the number of signers to the petition.

School Fund—Bonds—State Treasurer
State Treasurer cannot lawfully use cash fund for purchase of bonds for school funds.
Hon. Samuel R. McKelvie, Governor, State House, Lincoln, Nebr.
Your Excellency: The State Treasurer is the custodian of the cash fund of the state and also of the school fund. In regard to the cash fund his duty is to receive and keep all monies belonging to said fund. (Section 5577, R. S. 1913, Par. 1) Section 6655, Revised Statutes. 1913, as amended in 1915, requires him to keep monies belonging to the current fund in the state treasury on deposit in certain banks. It is customary for such banks to pay 2% interest on the average daily balance for the use of this money. The 1915 amendment authorizes the Treasurer to invest not more than 60% of the funds in his possession in state or county warrants. There is no statute or other legal authority permitting the Treasurer to invest any portion of the state cash fund in bonds.
It appears from your letter of September 9 that you are advised that the State Treasurer has used some 1400,000.00 out of the cash fund for either the purchase or the initial payment upon various bonds, which he has purchased for the school fund, the school fund having insufficient cash on hand to make this purchase. Because of the depreciation of the cash fund by the $400,000.00 so used for the benefit of the school fund it now appears that there is or will be insufficient cash in the treasury to provide for the ordinary current state expenses and that it may be necessary to care for these expenses by the issuance and registration of state warrants upon which it will be necessary for the state to pay interest at the rate of 7% per annum. You inquire as to the legality of said alleged action of the State Treasurer.
In our opinion the State Treasurer is bound by the statute to keep the cash fund deposited in various banks,
</seg>
	           <seg id="p343">OPINIONS	341
or invested in warrants. His reputed action in using a portion of this fund to purchase bonds for the school fund is unauthorized and is a misappropriation of the state funds. We do not insinuate that this action constitutes embezzlement or that it has any criminal significance. However, we do believe that if said action necessitates the payment of current obligations by registration of warrants that the State Treasurer and his bondsman may be civilly liable for the interest on such registered warrants. This liability in part will be offset by the interest received from the $400,000.00 of bonds less the 2% the state would have received had the money been deposited in banks.
Very respectfully,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General.

Schools—Attendance Officer
Suggested procedure in appointment of school attendance officer.
Mr. N. A. Housel, County Superindendent, Madison, Nebr.
Dear Sir: In your letter of August 31 you state that your County Commissioners and the County Attorney do not favor the employment of a school attendance officer, as required by the 1921 amendment to Section 6925, Revised Statutes, 1913, Chapter 19 of the School Laws of Nebraska, and that these officers are of the opinion that the law is too drastic and should not be enforced. It is the province of the Legislature to make the laws, and the duty of the County Attorney and the County Commissioners to see that they are enforced. It is not within the province of these officers to determine whether or not the law is too drastic. Much of our disrespect for law
</seg>

	           <seg id="p344">342	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
arises from the acts of local officers attempting to determine whether or not laws should be enforced.
However, the compensation of the school attendance officer lies entirely within the discretion of the Board of County Commissioners, and they have the power to fix his compensation in any amount they see fit.
Yon have also sent us a list of children in District 15 of Madison County, who are not attending school as provided in Article 19 of the School Laws. I would suggest that you follow the provisions of Section 6925, Revised Statutes, 1913. as amended in 1921 and that you notify these children and their parents, warning them to comply with the statutory provisions and if this is not done after one week that you request the County Attorney to file complaints against them before the Judge of the Juvenile Court, and that if the County Attorney does not do so that you file these complaints yourself.

Schools—Child Labor
Hon. J. L. Grimm, County Attorney, Gering, Nebr.
Dear Sir: I am writing a supplement to the letter of October 14th by the Bureau of Child Welfare, Department of Public Welfare. In addition to that letter, permit me to call to your attention the fact that in city anti metropolitan city school districts, the Nebraska law provides that children shall attend school the full nine months, while in school districts other than city and metropolitan city school districts, persons who have the legal or actual charge or control of any child not
</seg>
	           <seg id="p345">OPINIONS	343
less than seven nor more than sixteen years of age, shall cause such child to attend school not less than six months each year.
In response to inquiries, this department has many times given our opinion that the six months during which the child is compelled to attend school means the first. six months of the school year, subject to the discretion of the school district officers.
As we understand Chapter 53 of the 1921 Session Laws. the appointment of an attendance officer in each county is mandatory and is not discretionary, and that therefore the county superintendent or the county board of commissioners have no choice in the matter except to comply with the statute.
It is the opinion of this department that a sheriff or deputy sheriff may be designated as attendance officer, !hereby saving considerable expense to the county. It is our opinion that the wording "county attendance officers shall be cm compensated for their services in such amounts as shall be determined upon recommendation of the county superintendent of schools to be paid out of the general fund of the county" presumes that the county board shall endorse a reasonable recommendation. In fact, every statute contemplates that any officer acting thereunder will act with fairness and wisdom.
I also wish to call to your attention Section 1 of Article 3, Title 4, Chapter 190 of the Session Laws of 1919, found on page 550. which reads in part, "No person, firm or corporation shall employ any child under fourteen years of age in any business service whatever during the hours when the public 'schools of the school district in which the child resides are in session."
Will you kindly advise this department at once concerning what has been done in your county to comply with

School Boards should not embarrass successors by long time contracts with teachers.
Mr. 31. W. Ryan, Tobias, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Section 6773, Revised Statutes for 1913, provides that contracts between school boards and teachers shall be valid only when signed by two members of the board whose terms of office extend beyond the date of the term of the school contracted for. In our opinion this provision applies only to the ordinary rural school with three member boards, and that there is no direct statutory prohibition against other classes of boards employing teachers for a term longer than the term of office of the members of the board. However, the purpose of the section quoted is excellent and as a practical matter, whenever possible, we would suggest that teachers' contracts be delayed until they can be signed by a majority of the board who will hold office for the time involved in the contract. Members of the board who are responsible for the school during the coming year should control the employment of teachers.
Names can be written in on the ballot at the polls in the school election.

Schools—Taxation
A board of regents of a county high school has the right to make needed repairs on the school building, but it does not have the implied right to install extensive improvements.
r. W. I. Tillinghast, County Attorney, Arthur, Nebr.
Dear Sir: There is no statutory provision bearing on the question as to whether the board of regents of a county high school has the right to spend two or three thousand dollars of the money in the general fund for improving the high school building.
By Section 6823, as set out in the Nebraska School Laws for 1921, we find that the board of regents shall annually make an estimate of the amount of funds required for the support of the school during the fiscal year next ensuing. It would seem that the proper proceeding would be to make provisions for the funds necessary for the repairs contemplated. The money in the general funds which you wish to use might he necessary for the purpose of defraying certain other expenses anticipated and provided for at the June meeting, and if such is the case, most certainly it would be improper to divert this money from the purpose for which it was provided and to use it for the improvement of the building, if said improvements were not taken into account at the June meeting.
The right to make incidental repairs on a school building is inferentially given to the board of regents, but I am not so certain that they have the right to arbitrarily spend two or three thousand dollars on improvements to the building. In other words, the distinction should be dcawn between the making of repairs and the installation of improvements.
As I say, the statutes are silent, but in view of the statutory enactments prescribing the power of other public officials, and placing restrictions thereon. I would be dis-

Contracts with school teachers for three years violate Section 6773, Revised Statutes, 1913, pertaining to hiring of teacher-.
Prof. W. C. Priestley Superintendent of Schools. Doniphan. Nebr.
Dear Sir: The Attorney General is in receipt of your letter of January 27th making inquiry as to the validity of a three year contract. which was unanimously accepted by the Board of Education of your district and yourself.
To answer this question requires the interpretation of Section 6773 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913. I have not contented myself wit h an examination of the statutes, but have looked up some additional authorities.
24 R. C. L. page 579, Section 27 states, "In the absence of an express or implied statutory limitation, a school board may enter into a contract to employ a teacher or any proper officer for a term extending beyond that of the board itself, and such contract if made in good faith and without fraudulent collusion binds the succeeding board." This statement is sustained by some authorities cited in 43 Century Digest, Section 293 or 594, from the states of Arkansas, Connecticut, Indiana, Iowa and Michigan. On the other hand, there are authorities from Iowa. Illinois, Missouri, Michigan and Pennsylvania which take practically a contrary position.
</seg>
	           <seg id="p349">OPINIONS	347
Some of them go so far as to say that the question of validity of the contract depends considerably upon the facts as to whether or not the contract is made in good faith and without collusion upon the part of the members of the board and the teacher to bind the district and the suc-cceding boards for their own benefit and in disregard of the rights of the succeeding board to select the teachers during their incumbency of the office.
There seems to have been no specific decisions upon the point you have raised in this state, and we are forced to return to a construction of the statute first cited herein, and to construe it in the light of the authorities we have examined.
Section 6773 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913 provides in part as follows: "Provided further, a con-tract made before the annual meeting, in order to be legal, must be signed by two members whose terms of oftice do not expire with the school year in which such contract is made"; also "No such contract with a teacher shall be valid unless agreed to either by all the members of the district board or by two members of such board who are not related to the fourth degree to such teacher and whose terms of office extend beyond the date of the term of school contracted for."
The latter part of the section is not worded as clearly as it might be. and it is not clear whether or not where all the members of the district board agree to the contract it requires that their terms of office extend beyond the term of school contracted for, or whether it merely requires that the terms of office of two members of the board extend beyond the date of the term of school contracted for in the event that all three members agree to the contract. But in either event, the preceding section requires that the contract luust be signed by two members whose terms of office do not expire with the school year in which such contract is made.
</seg>
	           <seg id="p350">348	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
The construction of this statute depends considerably upon the entire facts in the case, but we take it that the facts would not harmonize with the statute, and that your three year contract would, in some respects, violate these provisions. If this is true, of course the contract is invalid. It also seems clear to us that it was the intention of the Legislature that contracts for teachers should not be for such a length of time and that a contract for three years could not 1* construed to come within the provisions of the statute.
Of course, this is merely our opinion in the matter. This Department is not bound to give advice to persons other than those specified by the statute. This does not include school teachers, nor district boards, and you are therefore free to take your own action in the matter, but we trust that the foregoing may be of some benefit to you and to the board in reaching your conclusions.

CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General.

Schools—Teacher's Salary
A school teacher cannot be bound to accept a warrant for the amount of her salary, which warrant is worth less than its face value, unless the contract so provides.
Mr. TV. II. Plourd, City Superintendent, Fullerton, Nebr.
Dear sir: Your letter of October 1 concerning teachers' salary warrants has been referred to this office for answer. In reply you are advised that it is our opinion that if the board should decide to instruct a local hank or banks to cash the warrants for teachers at par with the understanding that the two per cent discount would be made good to the bank
</seg>
	           <seg id="p351">OPINIONS	349
or banks by the board from district school funds at the close of the school year this would be within the power of the school board and valid, providing the school board does not agree to pay more than their levy will allow. However I see no legal difference between this and the presenting to teachers of additional warrants to make good the shortage, although the first method is perhaps the better business method.
My conclusion in this matter is based upon the fact that a school teacher cannot be forced to accept a warrant which is worth less than the face value for her pay, that is, I mean that if a school teacher has a contract to teach at $100.00 per month, that the contract implies the salary shall be in cash, and that the teacher cannot be forced to take a warrant which is worth only $98.00 cash. Then too a school board has the right to raise salaries during the year, and I feel that in this case the school board would have the right to virtually raise a salary to the place where the teacher would receive in cash the salary as fixed in the contract.
Hoping that this answers your inquiry, I am, Very truly yours,

Dear Sir: I can find no provisions of law authorizing the district board to grant a bonus to a teacher at the
</seg>
	           <seg id="p352">350	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
end of the school term, and I find no provisions prohibiting such a procedure. I am inclined to think the proper manner in which to handle the situation is to provide in a teachers contract for a bonus, if a bonus is desired to be given at the close of the school term.
With reference to the expense of teachers attending institutes, will say that the school laws provide that the teachers salary shall be paid (luring the time the teachers are in attendance at such institute. Nothing is provided with reference to the paying of the teachers expense, for which reason I am satisfied the teachers should not be paid for the expense but merely their salary.

A school board is not bound in the absence of such a contract to pay for teaching on Saturdays when such Saturday work is a make up of an extra week of an emergency vacation for which the district has paid the teachers.M
r. M. M. Nelson, Secretary, Public Schools,
Newcastle, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Referring to your inquiry of July 22nd and your supplementary letter of July 25th, you are advised that it is the opinion of this department that you are not legally obliged to pay the teachers any extra compensation over and above the salary paid for the nine months.
We understand the facts to be that the teachers contracted to teach school in your district for a term of nine months, commencing on the 5th of September. 1921, and that it was orally agreed by the teachers and the superintendent that instead of having two weeks vacation during the Christmas holidays, that only one week vacation should
</seg>
	           <seg id="p353">OPINIONS	351
be had at that time and that two weeks vacation should be had somc timc during the spring for the purpose of allowing thc school to be moved from the old building to the new. This would have made the term of school close on Junc 2, 1922.
However on the 20th of February, 1922, your old building burned and the fact that the new building was not complcted, necessitated a vacation of three weeks. Later thc teachers taught on five Saturdays, making in all thirty-fivc weeks of school having been taught in addition to these five Saturdays, the school closing on June 2, 1922. The question is, are the teachers entitled to legal compensation over and above the salary received for the nine !months. We believe not.
It must be noted that the school closed on June 2nd. which was the same date on which the school would have closed had there not been three weeks vacation instead of two in thc spring. Furthermore the school closed in less than ninc actual months after the date it began. If the teachers agreed to teach the five Saturdays to take the place of the extra week vacation in the spring, we believe that this should have been reckoned as if the school had been taught hiring one of the three weeks of vacation.
Tt was within the power of the school board and teachers to makc such an arrangement, and since such an arrangemcnt was made and the teachers taught. in all only thirty-six weeks of school, covering a period less than nine months, it is our opinion that the teachers are not legally entitled to any compensation over and above the salaries you agreed to pay for nine months.
Trusting this answers your inquiry, T am. Vcry sincerely yours,

Community use of a high school auditorium and gymnasium lies within the discretion of the school board.
Mr. Walter E. Hager, Surprise, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Referring to your inquiry concerning the uses to which a high school auditorium and gymnasium may be put, I understand that the village of Adams is contemplating the erection of a high school auditorium and gymnasium and that some question has arisen concerning the uses to which such a building may be put after its erection. I understand that one specific question is whether or not the auditorium can be used by the American Legion.
It seems to me that Chapter 236 of the 1915 Session Laws answers your question. This act provides:
"The board of education of every school district in which is included any incorporated city or village may in its discretion permit the use of public school buildings for public assemblages under such rules and regulations as it may adopt. A majority of the qualified electors at any annual meeting in any rural school district may by resolution permit a similar use of school buildings within such district under rules and regulations which may be adopted at such annual school meetings, or in case none are adopted then under rules and regulations prescribed by the district board. The board of education may exact such rental as may be necessary to meet the expense of such meeting, restore the property and pay for extra help required. In rural school districts such rental may be fixed by resolution adopted at the annual school meeting, but in default of such provision the district board may fix the rental."
The Nebraska Supreme Court in the case of Brooks v. Elder, decided on June 12, 1922, in deciding the question whether or not a school building in North Platte could be used for dancing by school children incidentally embodied in its opinion some remarks which seem applicable to your inquiry.
Our Supreme Court discussed the case of Spencer v. Joint School District, 15 Kansas 259. In the Kansas case, Judge Brewer held that school officers could not lease school property for public gatherings and meetings. However, the Nebraska Court states that many changes have

taken place since this opinion was written, saying: "Dusty roads are now well oiled for fast flying motor cars and in a few months patrons will gather nightly to hear radio programs from far distant cities."
The court said further: "The legislature of any state has power to bestow upon school authorities unlimited control and discretion in the uses of school property within constitutional limitations."
Under the statutes above quoted and the late decision of our Supreme Court, it would seem that the school board of Adams might permit the uses of the high school auditorium and gymnasium for public assemblages under such rules and regulations as they see fit.
Trusting this answers your inquiry, I am, Very sincerely yours,

Schools
The reading of the Bible in the public schools without sectarian comment is not unlawful.
Rev. Henning Gustafson, Secretary, Swedish Evangelical Mission Association of Nebraska, Waverly, Nebr.
Dear Sir: You ask whether the laws of Nebraska prohibit the reading from the Bible in the public schools when the school opens in the morning, if the school board and a majority of the residents are in favor of such, no comment being made on the Scriptures. In reply you are advised that Section 11, Article S. of the old Constitution of the State of Nebraska read:
"No sectarian instruction shall be allowed in any school or institu
</seg>
	           <seg id="p356">354	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
tion supported in whole or in part by the public funds set aside for educational purposes, nor shall the state accept any grant, conveyance or bequest of money, lands or other property to be used for sectarian purposes."
To this has been added in the new Constitution the following:
"Neither the State Legislature nor any county, city or other public corporation shall ever make any appropriation from any public fund, or grant any public land in aid of any sectarian or denominational school or college, or any educational institution which is not exclusively owned and controlled by the state or a governmental subdivision thereof. No religious test or qualification shall be required of teacher or student, for admission to or continuance in any public school or educational institution supported in whole or in part by public taxation."
The new Constitution does not in our opinion change the law on the subject.
In the case of State v. Scheve, 65 Nebr. 852, one Freeman applied for and obtained an alternative writ of man-damns mining to the school hoard of said district, alleging that against his protest and in disregard of his objections and in opposition to his demands, the board permitted a teacher employed by them in said school to engage daily in school hours in the public school building in said district and in the presence of the pupils in certain religious and sectarian exercises, consisting of the reading of passages of her own selection from a book commonly known as King James' version or translation of the Bible, and in singing certain religious and sectarian songs, and in offering prayer to the Diety according to the customs and usages of the so-called orthodox evangelical churches of this country in accordance with the belief and practices of such churches. the pupils joining in the singing of said songs or hymns. The district court adjudged a dismissal of the suit upon the ground that the practices complained of were so far within the discretion of the district board not to be subject to control by mandamus. This case went to the Supreme Court Commission which decided that the return did not state facts sufficient to constitute a defense to the alter-

	           <seg id="p357">OPINIONS	355
native writ, and recommended that the judgment of the district court be reversed and that a peremptory writ as prayed issue from the court to the respondents (school board) and their successors in office. The Supreme Court so ordered.
On a motion for rehearing the Supreme Court affirmed their former judgment, but Judge Sullivan in writing the opinion said:
"It is said by Commissioner Ames that the morning exercises conducted by Miss Beecher constituted sectarian instruction. This conclusion is vigorously assailed, but, in our judgment, it is warranted by the evidence and we adhere to it. The decision does not, however, go to the extent of entirely excluding the Bible from the public schools. It goes only to the extent of denying the right to use it for the purpose of imparting sectarian instruction. The pith of the opinion is in the syllabus, which declares that 'Exercises by a teacher in a public school in a school building in school hours, and in the presence of the pupils, consisting of the reading of passages from the Bible, and in the singing of songs and hymns, and offering prayer to the Diety in accordance with the doctrines, beliefs, customs or usages of sectarian churches or religious organizations, is forbidden by the constitution of this state.' Certainly the Iliad may be read in the schools without inculcating a belief in the Olympic divinities, and the Korean may be read without teaching the Moslem faith. Why may not the Bible also be read without indoctrinating children in the creed or dogma of any sect? Its contents are largely historical and moral. its language is unequaled in purity and elegance; its style has never been surpassed; among the classics of our literature it stands pre-eminent. It has been suggested that the English Bible is, in a special and limited sense, a sectarian book. To be sure there are, according to the Catholic claim, vital points of difference with respect to faith and morals between it and the Douai version. In a Pennsylvania case cited by counsel for respondents, the author of the opinion says that he noted over fifty points of difference between the two versions—some of them important and others trivial. These differences constitute the basis of some of the peculiarities of faith and practice that distinguish Catholicism from Protestantism and make the adherents of each a district Christian sect. But the fact that the King-James translation may be used to inculate sectarian doctrines affords no presumption that it will be so used. The law does not forbid the use of the Bible in either version in the public schools; it is not prescribed either by the constitution or the statutes, and the courts have no right to declare its use to be unlawful because it is possible or probable that those who are privileged to use it will misuse the privilege by attempting to propagate their own peculiar theological or
</seg>
	           <seg id="p358">356	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
ecclesiastical views and opinions. The point where the courts may rightfully intervene, and where they should intervene without hesitation is where legitimate use has degenerated into abuse,—where a teacher employed to give secular instruction has violated the constitution by becoming a sectarian propogandist. That sectarian instruction may be given by the frequent reading, without note or comment, of judiciously selected passages, is, of course obvious. A great modern philosopher—perhaps the greatest—has said the persistent iteration is the most effective means of forcing alien conceptions upon reluctant minds. Whether it is prudent or politic to permit Bible reading in the public schools is a question for the school authorities to determine; but whether the practice of Bible reading has taken the form of sectarian instruction in a particular case is a question for the courts to determine upon evidence. It cannot be presumed that the law has been violated; the alleged violation must in every instance be established by competent proof. The value of the common schools as disseminators of knowledge and social levelers is well understood and justly appreciated, and there is little likelihood that the people will ever permit their usefulness to be impaired by sectarian controversies. When we consider that this is the first case of its kind ever presented to this court for decision, we feel assured that neither teachers nor school boards have been much inclined to bring discord into the schools for the chance of securing by indirection a slight sectarian advantage. But if the fact were other- wise it could not in any way affect our conclusion. The section of the constitution which provides that 'no sectarian instruction shall be allowed in any school or institution supported in whole or in part by the public funds set apart for educational purposes', can not, under any canon of construction with which we are acquainted, be held to mean that neither the Bible nor any part of it, from Genesis to the Revelation, may be read in the educational institutions fostered by the state. We do not wish to be understood as either countenancing or discountenancing the reading of the Bible in the public schools. Even where it is an irritant element, the question whether its legitimate use shall be continued or discontinued is an administrative and not a judicial ques. tion; it belongs to the school authorities, not to the courts.
"The motion for a rehearing is overruled and the judgment heretofore rendered is adhered to."
The mandate issued by the Supreme Court to the District Court said :
"Now, therefore, we command you, immediately upon the receipt of this writ, that you cause and require the teacher employed by you to teach the school in said District No. 21 in said Gage County, Nebraska, to discontinue the practice and refrain from engaging in exercises consisting of reading passages from the Bible to the pupils in said school and singing religious hymns in said school from the book

called "Gospel Hymns" and from the book called the "Pentecostal Hymn Book" and the offering of prayer to the Diety in said school during school hours; and that this writ and the commands thereof be interpreted in the light of an opinion filed in said cause on October 10, 1902, as stated in the syllabus of said opinion, a certified copy whereof is attached hereto and made a part hereof and a subsequent opinion filed by the Court in said cause on January 21, 1903, a certified copy whereof is attached hereto and made a part hereof."
You will see that in this case the teacher was by order of the court forbidden to read the Bible along with being forbidden to conduct the singing of religious hymns and the offering of prayers during school hours, the Supreme Court intimating that reading from the Bible alone with no comment being made upon it was not unlawful.
Since it might in the future become our statutory duty to assist in an action of mandamus or similar action, such as the ease discussed we cannot declare that the reading of the Bible in the public schools is lawful. However. it is the opinion of this department that the Supreme Court would in a case such as you describe follow the opinion written by Judge Sullivan and hold that the reading of the Bible with with no comment upon it is not unlawful. ,If your association desires to have this question of law settled, we would advise you to bring or have brought an action to set I le t he same.
Hoping that this answers your inquiry, we are, Very truly yours,

Schools—Religion
School board cannot introduce religious instruction into public schools.
Ho,,. J. M. Matzen, State Superintendent, State House, Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir: As Chapter 53 of the Laws of 1921 provides that in city school districts children of not less than seven or more than sixteen years of age must attend school regularly for the entire time in .which the schools are in session, it is our opinion that the school board has really no authority to excuse certain children from school at definite periods to receive religious instruction in churches.
Of course, the proposed religious instruction is an excellent thing. but it should not be linked with the public school system. The proposed religious instruction should be entirely voluntary and held at times outside of the regular school hours.
Bible study in the public schools is a different proposition. Bible study is valuable from a literary, historical or philosophical standpoint, entirely apart from its religious aspect. Probably a school board could establish a course of Bible study and give credit for the same as a part of the school curriculum.

Gross misdemeanors and persistent disobedience are the only grounds for suspension or expulsion from school. Suspension may not be for a longer period than the term.
Hon. John M. Matzen, State Superintendent, State Louse, Lincoln. Nebr.
Dear Sir : This department is in receipt of your letter from R..1. Barr of Grand Island. Mr. Barr inquires as to whether or not a certain regulation adopted by their board of education will stand the test of law. The regulation provides that a student must pass in at least three subjects in addition to the required work in gymnasium during each and every semester in the high school or he will be placed on probation at the beginning of the following semester. Failure to maintain a passing grade in three subjects during- thc probation semester will result in his being suspendcd from school. The regulation also provides that a pupil droppcd from school on account of poor work will not be reinstated before one semester has elapsed after the close of the semester in which he was dropped, and other like provisions as set out in the regulation in Mr. Barr's letter.
It is the opinion of this department that the regulation as a whole cannot be supported by the law. Section 6785 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, provides that pupils may be suspended or expelled only in cases of gross misdemeanors or persistent disobedience upon the part of the student. That seems to be only statutory grounds provided for suspension or expulsion. This section further provides that such suspension shall not extend beyond the close of the term. Hence, under the law, it is prohibited to extend thc suspension beyond the close of the term at which the penalty of suspension is inflicted.
It further seems to us that gross misdemeanors and persistent disobedience are the only grounds for suspension and expulsion, and mere failure to pass in three subjects
</seg>
	           <seg id="p362">360	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
is not a statutory ground. Of course, if the failure to pass in the three subjects is due to some gross misdemeanor or persistent disobedience of the student, as it usually is, the student might be suspended or possibly expelled; not because of failure to pass in the studies, but on account of the gross misdemeanor or persistent disobedience.
We trust the foregoing fully answers your inquiry.
Yours very truly,

M., and if the work which the school board asks you to do after 4 o'clock is a reasonable incident to school work and is not without the scope of the contract which you enterer' into, then it is the opinion of this department that the school board is within its rights in asking you to teach athletics after 4 o'clock in the afternoon.

Schools—Warrants
The law does not forbid the payment of semi-annual interest on school warrants.
Mr. C. L. Trombla, University Place, Nebr.
Dear Sir: With reference to your question as to whether you can legally pay semi-annual interest on school
warrants issued in your district:
Under date of October 22, 1920, Judge J. B. Barnes advised you on this matter as follows:
"If there are no funds in the treasury with which to pay these warrants when issued and delivered, they can be registered for payment and paid in the order of registration. These warrants draw interest by law at the rate of 7% per annum from the date of registration until they are paid, and we know of no provision by law which would authorize and guarantee the payment of interest semi-annually. Therefore, we would not advise you to make such a guarantee, as that promise, if made, might have to be redeemed by the Board making the guarantee."
To the above I can only add that while I would seriously question the advisability of guaranteeing semi-annual
payment, I have found no provision of law which specifically forbids semi-annual payment of interest. While as a general practice I would strongly urge against the making of semi-annual payments, I would suggest that in an emergency such semi-annual payments might be justified, in order to enable the Board to place the warrants which they otherwise could not do.
I return herewith the two blanks which Mr. Roper handed me this morning.

Soldiers' Relief Fund Expenditures permitted under Service Men's Relief Act.
Mr. Frank B. O'Connell, Department Adjutant. American Legion, 311i Richards Block, Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir: At the present time we are both unwilling and unable to attempt a comprehensive definition of the words "care or relief" used in Section 2, Chapter 40 of the Laws of 1921, the Service Men's Relief Act. It would seem that these words would permit expenditures for rent, shelter, and fuel for ex-service men, coining within the provisions of the Act.
The Act itself is not intended as a substitute for a pension or to provide anything except temporary assistance to deserving ex-service men pending the time when they receive the compensation from the Federal Government to which they are entitled. The Act was passed to afford relief in the needy cases, which were attracting public attention.
I would suggest that bearing this principle in mind in doubtful cases you communicate with Land Commissioner Swanson, Secretary of the Board of Educational Lands and Funds.
It is our opinion that the Act does not permit loaning of funds to ex-service men.

State Seal
State Seal Commission may recommend adoption of new state seal but cannot supplant present seal without legislative sanction.
Mr. Geo. A. Williams, President State Seal Commission, Fairmont, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Replying to your letter of August 30 as to the construction of House Roll 571, providing for a state seal and banner. in our opinion the adoption of a new seal will ma affect present notarial seals. Section 5521
providing for notarial seals specifies that every notary shall provide himself with a seal upon which shall be
engraved "notarial seal," the name of the county for which
he was appointed and commissioned, the word "Nebraska" and at his option his name and the date of expiration of his commission. Section 5521 provides that no notarial acknowledgment shall be defective for the reason that the seal of the notary contains surplus matter or matter differing from the statutory requirements. There is no provision that the seal of the notary must conform to or include the state seal.
As to the time when the new seal becomes the official seal of t he state, it may be interesting to note that House Roll 571 of the 1921 Session provides for the creation of a state seal and banner and for a commission to secure and select designs for the same and to report the same to the Governor on or before January 1, 1922. No provision is made for the official approval of such design.
An act approved June 15, 1867, officially adopts the present seal as does Section 5569, Revised Statutes for 1913. These statutes officially adopting the present seal are not repealed or affected by House Roll 571 and in our opinion the present seal of the state remains the official seal of the

State Treasurer—Certificate of Deposit
State Treasurer may take the certificate of deposit as evidence of deposit of state funds in banking institutions.
Mr. Harry S. Byrne, Resident Manager, Fidelity &amp; Deposit Co., of Maryland, 326 City National Bank Bldg., Omaha, Nebr.
Dear Sir: I believe that you are unnecessarily exercised in your thought that the deposit of state funds by the state treasurer in various banks evidenced by certificates of deposit is illegal or unusual.
Section 6655 of the Revised Statutes provides:
"The state treasurer shall deposit and at all times keep in deposit for safe keeping in the state or national banks * * * the amount of money in his hands belonging to the several current funds in the state treasury * * *"
The fact that the deposit in the bank is evidenced by a certificate does not affect its character as a deposit.
In Iams v. Farmers State Bank, 101 Neb. 778, which I assume is the case you refer to when you say that the owner of a certificate of deposit is not entitled to the protection of the bank guaranty law, the Supreme Court held that a deposit evidenced by a certificate drawing 5% upon which there was paid an additional 1% interest was not a deposit entitled to the protection of the guaranty law. Section 27 of the act specifically prohibits any hank from paying directly or indirectly a greater rate on deposits than 5% per
</seg>
	           <seg id="p367">OPINIONS	365
annum. Of course, under the banking law any deposit upon which is paid a greater sum than 5% per annum is an illegal deposit and not entitled to the protection of the guaranty fund. The case is no authority for the proposition that the guaranty fund does not cover certificates of deposit, and in our opinion the guaranty fund does cover certificates of deposit.

Streams—Public Health
Straightening a stream does not change its status, as a public stream
and incidental legislative regulation is not affected thereby.
Whether or not disposal of sewage in such a stream constitutes a
nuisance is a question of fact.
Department of Public Welfare, Bureau of Health, State House, Lincoln, Nebr.
Attention: Mr. R. N. Tracy
Gentlemen: Under date of June 8th, you have written this Department inquiring as to the manner of disposal of sewage. Evidently this refers to disposal by the City of Syracuse, Nebr.
Section 8$4 of the Revised Statutes of 1913 provides that no water-course, stream or water shall be corrupted, or rendered unwholesome or impure.
This question is one concerning which the authorities are somewhat in dispute in different states. The general rule is laid down in 9 Ruling Case Law, page 675 and following, and seems to be to the effect that if it is merely disposal of surface waters, that the municipality can discharge surface waters into the stream. If the sewage is
</seg>
	           <seg id="p368">366	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
sufficient in amount to pollute the stream and to amount to a nuisance, it becomes a question of fact to be determined upon the facts of the particular case.
There seems to be but a few cases on this subject in the State of Nebraska. Some of the earlier cases, including Barton v. Union Cattle Company, -8 Neb. 350 are to the effect that where the water of a running stream is befouled or polluted, rendering the water unfit for use, a continuance of the actions may be proceeded against at the suit of the injured party.
This case and others to the same effect, as cited in the ease of Todd v. City of York, 3 Nebr. Unof. Reporter, 763, hold that au injunction may lie to restrain the emptying of sewage into a stream, but in this case also the court held that it was a question of fact in each case, and in that particular ease the facts were found against the City of York and its action was determined to be a nuisance and the action of the city was restrained.
Practically the same rule is laid down in the ease of Abraham v. City of Fremont, 54 Neb. 391.
Hence it is the opinion of this Department that straightening the course of a running stream does not change its status as a public stream subject to regulation by the Legislature as to its use. Whether or not the disposal of sewage into this stream would be a violation of the law would depend entirely upon the amount of sewage so disposed of and 'whether or not the stream could carry it off without there being a resulting nuisance to other persons who have riparian rights along the stream.
If the disposal of the sewage in this manner should result in a nuisance, it is our opinion that an action of
</seg>
	           <seg id="p369">OPINIONS	367
injunction would lie to restrain the municipality from maintaining the nuisance.

Sunday Laws—Dancing
A dance on Sunday night (except cities of the metropolitan class, having a public welfare board), which is open to the public is illegal although conducted under the guise of a club.
Mr. Charlcs L. King, Deweese, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Referring to your letter of August 9, you alc advised that in our opinion a dance may be a public dance within the meaning of the Statute mentioned in our letter of August 1, even though the same is carried on under the subterfuge of being a club dance.
our understanding of the statute is that if a dance is open to the public, that the subterfuge of part of the admission being designated as a membership fee is immaterial. In other words, if a dance is conducted on Sunday which is open to the public, we believe that the same is prohibited by law and punishable under Chapter 141 of the 1919 Session Laws. We are sure that a court would sustain a prosecution against persons engaged in a dance run under the guise of a club dance when membership in the club was open to all who cared to come to the dance on any particular Sunday night and be admitted by paying a fee although part of such fee was designated as a membership fee.
This same scheme of evading the law has been tried in various places over the state, but this defense has availed them nothing except where the dance in question was ac-

Sunday Laws—Baseball
Sunday baseball may be played outside corporate limits of municipalities only upon authority of the county board expressed by resolution.
Mr. P. D. Fleming, Wilsonville, Nebr.
Dear Sir: The Attorney General is in receipt of your letter of April 25th concerning the question of playing baseball on Sunday in territory outside of the cities and villages in your county.
This question is covered by Section 8802 of the Revised Statutes of Nebraska for 1913, as amended by Chapter 141, page 319. of the Laws of Nebraska for 1919, which provides that in cities and villages such games may be authorized by a majority of the electors of such city or village, voting at a general or special election for that purpose. In the several counties of the state, outside of the corporate limits of the cities and villages therein, such games may be authorized by the county board, and the authority therefor shall be in the form of a resolution duly passed by the county board.
This seems to be the only authority for permitting the playing of baseball on Sunday outside of the corporate limits of a city or village, and it must be by resolution passed by the county board. The petition is not provided
</seg>
	           <seg id="p371">OPINIONS  369
tor by the statutes, but it may be presumed that a person or number of persons desiring to play a competitive game of baseball outside of the corporate limits of a city or village would make some application to the county board for such permission. The statute does not seem to state that the county board may authorize the playing of baseball generally except outside the corporate limits of cities and villages.
We believe that this answers your question.
Concerning the matter of what action you might take to bring pressure to bear on the board or to oppose the movement for Sunday baseball, we are not in a position to advise you for the reason that so long as the inhabitants of this state stay within the provisions of the laws of the state, it is not the duty of the county attorney nor of this office to take a partisan view of any matter.
We have quoted the section of the statutes applicable and you will undoubtedly be able to determine whether or not the statute is complied with.

Taxation--Counties
Emergency bridge levy not included in 3.5 county mill levy limitations.
(See other opinion)
W. P. Cowan, Esq., County Attorney, Stanton., Nebr.
Dear Sir: House Roll 127, passed by the 1921 legislative session, limits the tax levy to 35e per $100 actual valuation "for county purposes", this being a 3.5 mill levy.
In addition to this 3.5 mill levy, the statute specifically
</seg>
	           <seg id="p372">370	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
authorizes a levy of not more than one mill for the payment of indebtedness existing at the time of the adoption of the present Constitution, January 1, 1921.
Section 3001 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, providing for an emergency bridge fund and authorizing a levy of -one mill for this fund, was not amended or affected by House Roll 127. Section 3001, in our opinion. distinguishes between the emergency bridge fund and the annual levy for county purposes, and as we construe said section. the emergency bridge levy should not be included in the levy for county purposes, or in the 3.5 mill limitation.
The county levy is made up as follows:
County Judge Fund	2.2 mills
County Road Fund	1.1 mills
Mothers' Pension	1 mill
Soldiers' Relief	1 mill
constituting a 3.5 mill levy. In addition, there may be lawfully levied, one mill for old indebtedness and one mill for the emergency bridge fund.

Taxation—Religious Institutions
Real property purchased in anticipation of religious use but not actually used for religious purposes is not exempt from taxation.
Mr. J.	Berryman, County J ad ye, Bassett, Nebr.
Dear Sir: You ask in your letter of May 27, whether real property purchased by a church for the purpose of building thereon a church, is subject to taxation.
</seg>
	           <seg id="p373">OPINIONS	371
In our opinion it is. The only exemptions from taxation are those specified in Section 6301, R. S. 1913. The religious exemption exempts "Such other property as may be used exclusively for agricultural or horticultural societies, for schools, religious, cemetery, and charitable purposes." The land referred to was purchased with the expectation of using it for religious purposes. It is not now used for religious purposes, and is not entitled to the religious exemption, and will not be until it is used for religiouspurposes.
No other construction would permit a church to purchase property hoping to build thereon and to hold it tax free for a number of years, and at the end of this period to sell it at perhaps an enhanced value. In our opinion the religious exemption only applies to exemption for religious purposes.

Section 6456, Revised statutes, 1913, as amended by Chapter 109 of the Laws of 1915 provides that after the County Board makes the levy subsequent to the notice from the State Board of Equalization that, "Any taxes regularly voted, and certified to the County Clerk after the County Board shall have made such levy and before the County Clerk shall have completed the tax list, shall be levied by the County Clerk, if within the limit of the law, and extended upon the tax list the same as if levied by the County Board." I know of no fixed time when the County Clerk shall complete his tax list and I see no legal difficulty in his holding the list open to receive the returns of the election on August 26.
If the amount of the levy for School District No. 11 is determined by the vote of the district the County Board has no function ln the matter whatever.

Taxation—Banks
Real property of national banks in hands of receiver is subject to local taxation; personal property is not.
(See other opinion)
A. E. Warren, Esq., County Attorney, Sidney, Nebr.
Dear Sir: It appears from your letter of November 17th that a national hank at Sidney failed in May, 1921, after the assessment, hut before the tax levy had been made. By the express provision of the National Ranking Act, real estate owned by national banks is subject to taxation by local authorities.

First National Bank of Albuquerque v. Albright, 208 U. S. 548.
McCullough v. Maryland, 4 Wheaton, 316.
The personal property of an insolvent national bank in the hands of a receiver is exempt from taxation. Rosenblatt v. Johnston, 104 U. S. 462.
This is not because of the receivership, but because of the provisions of the Banking Act.
To quote from the authorities:
"The appointment of a receiver and the taking of property into the hands of the court or its officers does not withdraw it from taxation. It remains subject to assessment and to the payment of all legal taxes thereon while in custodia legis to the same extent as it was when in the possession of the owner."
Clark on Receivers, Par. 827.
Coy v. Title Guaranty &amp; Trust Co., 220 Fed. 90. Circuit Court of Appeals, 9th Circuit.
When a receiver is appointed for a national bank, he merely takes all the assets for purposes of administration, subject to all existing claims. The real estate itself is subject to taxation in whosesoever hands it comes. It does not become the property of the government by the appointment of a receiver, and when disposed of by the receiver, must be sold subject to taxes. It would perhaps be a more orderly way to file a claim for these taxes with the receiver rather than to attempt to sell the property at tax sale. The mere fact that the property is in the possession of a receiver does not exempt it from taxation.

Taxation—Banks
Live stock owned by a bank should not be assessed as part of its capital stock.
The assessment of real estate belonging to a bank depends upon the nature of ownership.
Mr. D. T. Heynen, County Clerk, Kimball, Nebr.
Dear sir: Referring to your letter of July 6 you are advised that it is the opinion of this department that. farm machinery and live stock owned by a local bank should be assessed as tangible property and not as a part of the capital stock of the bank.
As to the real estate, this depends upon the nature and the method of ownership. The Banking Act itself does not permit banking institutions to hold real estate in excess of one-third of the paid up capital and further provides that if any real estate should be conveyed to the bank for debts to the bank, that the bank shall hold it only for a limited time. If the real estate owned by the bank in question is real estate which is purchased by a part of the capital stock and is an investment of the capital stock proper, it should be assessed as a part of the capital stock. However, if it is real estate which is owned by the bank or an officer of the bank and has been taken as security for debts and was the result of the investment of the depositor's money. then it should be assessed as real estate and not a part of the capital stock.
The revenue law specifically says that liens or interest in real estate less than a fee title, and held as security for loans, shall not be deducted in capital stock assessment. Tt is impossible for me to decide in which class the real estate to which you refer falls, but no doubt you can determine this knowing the facts in each case.
Very sincerely yours.

Taxation—Banks
When the capital stock of a bank is worthless its assessment should be limited to the value of the real estate and tangible property belonging to the institution.
The only remedy in case of over valuation is an objection before the county board of equalization.
Mr. W. F. Parkcr, Receiver, Brown County Bank, Long Pine, Nebr.
Dear Sir: You ask whether there is any legal way by which taxes of an insolvent bank could be evaded. In answering your question I will say that the Supreme Court. has held that the statutory provisions relative to the tax. ation of banks in this state is a provision not for taxing the corporations therein named on their capital stock, but for taxing the shareholders upon the value of stock hold by them. (70 Neb. 529.)
This being true, the real and ultimate fact to determine is the real value of the capital stock. This would be de-termined by ascertaining the value of the capital stock, if it has any value, and deducting the real estate which is otherwise asscssed, and the personal property, if it is otherwise assessed. Tf you had found the capital stock to be worthless, then your assessment should have been limited to the value of the real estate and tangible property belonging to the institution.
It would seem from your letter that the return made out by you was entirely too large and you should have appeared before the county board of equalization asking that body to change the assessed valuation. As it now stands, the county board of equalization has made their levy upon the returned schedule.
The only possible remedy which I could suggest would be to pay the tax under protest as provided by Section 6491 of the 1913 Revised Statutes. However, even then T am of the opinion that you would not be successful. Ac-
</seg>
	           <seg id="p378">376	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
cording to that section, the only ground for refunding of taxes paid under protest is for property which was not liable for taxation,—that is churches, etc., and second, in the case of an illegal or unauthorized levy. It appears to me as though your situation does not come within either of these provisions.
This same question was presented to the Lancaster Board of Equalization in the case of the American State Bank of this city, the board holding that they had no authority to refund the taxes paid by this bank. It is very likely that if the county board of equalization would refund the taxes which have been paid by you, they would be personally liable on their bonds. Certainly they could not refund the taxes levied upon the tangible property of the Brown County Bank.
You will understand that this is merely our opinion of what the court would hold, since no Nebraska case is authority for the proposition that taxes paid under protest may be refunded when the assessed valuation was too large. There are cases which are authority for the proposition that injunction will not lie to restrain collection of taxes unless the same have been levied for unauthorized or illegal purposes, or where the assessment is void.
Hoping this answers your inquiry, I am. Very sincerely yours,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS. Attorney General.

Taxation—School Lands

Taxation of school land leases.
E. G. Meredith, Esq., Bushnell, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Replying to your letter of November 28 addressed to the Land Commissioner and referred to us for re- ply, I assume you refer to the assessment of a lease for school land as a personalty and to the tax levied thereon.
If less than the actual rental value is paid on a school lease, the lease itself has some value as personal property, and as such may be assessed and taxed. In ordinary farm leases the fall rental value is paid by the lessee, and consequently the lease in itself is worth nothing. Because of the low rental in school leases a different rule applies.
If a tax is not paid on school leases, the lease can be sold to the highest bidder, just as other personal property, upon which no tax is paid can be sold.

Taxation—Irrigation—School Lands
State school lands cannot be taxed to support irrigation projects.
Dan Swanson, Esq., Commissioner of Public Lands and Buildings, State House, Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir: I understand that the north half of the northeast quarter of Section 11, Town 20, Range 51, a parcel of land belonging to the State of Nebraska. as a part of its school lands is included in an irrigation district either formed or about to be formed in Scotts Bluff County, Nebr.
After an examination of the statutes relative to the formation of irrigation districts, Sections 3457 to 3528 of the Revised Statutes of 1913, it is our conclusion that it never was the legislative intention to include state land in such districts, without the consent of the state. Section 3472, as amended by Chapter 80 of the Laws of 1917, provides that the leasehold interest of the tenant may be assessed for irrigation purposes when the title to the land is in the state, and Section 3477, as amended by Chapter 69 of the Laws of 1915, provides for the disposal of such leasehold interest when the assessment is not paid. Section 3478, as amended by Chapter 80 of the Laws of 1917. permits the assessment to he protested when title rests either in the state or in the federal government. The
</seg>	    
	           <seg id="p381">OPINIONS	379
Act nowhere provides a method of collecting the assessment from the state.
There is no legal objection that I can see against the state entering into the district, but the only way in which the assessment can be paid, is by a future legislative appropriation. If, in your judgment, it is not wise to have this portion of the school land included in the irrigation district, I would suggest. that the district be so formed or altered as to exclude it under the provisions of Sections 3491 and 3404 to 3507 inclusive.

Taxation—Schools—Bonds
Limitation upon issuance of warrants to finance current expenditures of school district.
Hon. John M. Matzcn, State Superintendent, State House, Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir: In reference to the letter of Mr. E. W.
Rossiter, dated October 8, it appears that the Winnebago
school has an outstanding indebtedness evidenced by regis-
tered warrants amounting to $19,000, that there will be
approximately $4,000.00 available for the payment of the
warrants when the 1920 taxes are in, leaving the district
with an outstanding obligation of approximately $15,000.00.
Section 962, Revised Statutes, 1913 prohibits the
County Board from issuing warrants in excess of 85%
of the tax levy. This limitation does not apply to school
districts, and' we are unable to find any statutory limitation
upon the amount of warrants that school districts can
</seg>	    
	           <seg id="p382">380	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
issue, consequently in our opinion the outstanding warrants are not void, but if they represent an obligation incurred by the district they should be paid.
The whole situation is discussed in state ex rel Collins v. Gardner, 112 N. W. 373, and it is there held that. the total amount of the current taxes need not be applied upon outstanding warrant indebtedness, but that the school should be administered in as economical and businesslike manner as possible, and as much of the revenue as possible should be applied on the outstanding indebtedness without closing the schools. A school district should be managed just like any other business. The expenditures should be kept within the receipts. The unfortunate situation in Mr. Rossiter's district is probably due to extravagant expenditures in the past. Sufficient funds from the 1920 and 1921 tax levy may be retained to continue the operation of the schools. The balance should be applied to the outstanding indebtedness and such administration of the funds may be compelled by mandamus.
The district cannot compromise the outstanding indebtedness by a bond issue. Section 402, Revised Statutes, 1913. as amended in 1921 relating to compromised bonds does not authorize the compromising of outstanding warrants. (State v. Moore. 45 Neb. 13.1 The only remedy for this district is to continue an economical and businesslike administration of the school, which Mr. Rossiter is well fitted to direct. Further issuance of warrants will only make the situation
worse.

Taxation—County Treasurer—Checks
Payment of irrigation levies by installment, payment by check.
R. J. Curtis, Esq., County Attorney, Garden. County, Osh kosh, Nebr.
Dear Sir: According to Sections 3475, 3477, 3482, 3486. Revised Statutes, 1913, irrigation levies are collected in the same manner as other real estate taxes, and if it is the custom in your office to permit 'a taxpayer to pay a certain portion of his real estate taxes, the same rule would apply to his irrigation taxes, but if you require the taxpayer to pay all of his taxes or none, irrigation taxes should not be accepted separately from other real estate taxes.
The difficulty mentioned in the second paragraph of your letter where a man gave an unsigned check in payment of taxes , and after he acquired a receipt declined to sign the check could have been obviated by the County Treasurer using reasonable business discretion in looking at checks before he takes them. I do not think the action of the taxpayer could be made the basis of a criminal prosecution under Section 8874, Revised Statutes, 1913, unless the taxpayer at the time he delivered the check made some specific representation that it was a good check apart from merely handing it over. The practical remedy is to treat the taxes as unpaid, and collect them by a distress warrant. A receipt is not absolute evidence of payment and can always be explained.

Taxation—Agricultural Societies
An agricultural society must be organized and the fact of its organization certified to the county clerk in accordance with Section 6, Compiled Statutes, 1922, before the county board makes its levy, in order to receive the benefit of the levy therein provided.
Mr. Wm. C. Oelkers, Orleans, Nebr.
Dear Sir: You ask concerning the legality of a levy for the county agricultural society being made where the county fair association was not organized and that fact that its organization, etc., was not certified to the county clerk before the county board made their levy. It is the opinion of this department that the levy for the agricultural society should not be a part of the general fund and that therefore, if the levy cannot be legally made expressly for the agricultural society it cannot 1* paid out of the general fund.
It is the opinion of this department that if the County Board does not wish to make this levy under the circumstances stated in Paragraph 1 that they cannot be compelled to do so.
As to the question of whether they can legally make the levy at this date should they desire to so do there is a division of opinion in this department. It is my opinion and the opinion of the majority of the members of this department that the County Board cannot legally make the levy at this time since Chapter 5 of the 1921 Session Laws has not. been strictly complied with. That is, we are of the opinion that the organization must be in existence and must have certified to the County Clerk, etc., before the County Board makes their annual levy. However, one member of this department is rather of the opinion that Section 6456 of the 1913 Revised Statutes as amended on page 599 would authorize the County Clerk to make the levy and extend the same upon the tax list. This section reads in part:
</seg>
	           <seg id="p385">OPINIONS	383
"Provided any such taxes regularly voted and certified to the County Clerk, after the County Board shall have made such levy and before the County Clerk shall have completed the tax list shall be levied by the County Clerk, if within the limit of the law and extended upon the tax list the same as if levied by the County Board."
However, it is the opinion of the majority of the members of this department that notwithstanding this section, the organization of the County Agricultural Society and certification to the County Clerk was made too late to entitle your association to a levy for this year.
This is a matter which should be taken up with your County Attorney and you understand that our opinion would be in no way binding upon the court but it is simply our opinion of what the court would hold in the event an objection was made to levying the tax under circumstances stated in your inquiry.
Hoping this answers your inquiry, I am, Very sincerely yours,

Taxation
Under certain circumstances amounting to removal, etc., as prescribed by statute, personal taxes may be collected in the manner provided for collection before the taxes have become a lien.
Mr. W. 11. Osborne, Tax Commissioner, Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Responding to your inquiry of January 24 inquiring whether or not the county treasurer has a right to issue a distress warrant for collection of taxes on personal property prior to the tax becoming a lien on them November first and prior to February first, we respond as follows:
</seg>
	           <seg id="p386">384	REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
You refer to a specific case wherein cattle shipped into a county in the spring and are assessed as of April first, are permitted to graze during the summer and shipped out prior to November first following. Under such circumstances it would appear that the taxes had not yet become a lien upon the cattle before the same were sold and that there would be no lien to follow the property but that all that would remain would be a claim for taxes against the person against whom the taxes were assessed.
It seems logical to believe that the Legislature did not overlook the possibility that the state and counties might lose taxes under such circumstances to which the taxing power would be entitled. Our Legislature has provided by Section 6323 and Section 6324, Revised Statutes of Nebraska 1913, for action to be taken by the county treasurers in case of emergency arising under these sections. Section 6323 seems to refer specifically to the property of the taxpayer seized by legal process so that an insufficient amount of property is left to pay the taxes of the taxpayer. Section 6324 provides that if the county treasurer obtains knowledge of the fact that the taxpayer is making or attempting to make any sale or there has been a levy of attachment or a removal, it then is the duty of the county treasurer to immediately proceed with the collection of the tax as provided by law. This indicates that the tax shall under such circumstances be considered as due and payable and while there is no lien against the specific property, nevertheless there exists a right to collect the tax against any personal property of the taxpayer. Following the language of this section of the statutes it would therefore appear that the county treasurer in the manner provided by law could issue a distress warrant for the collection of the tax and could proceed to seize in the manner provided by law a sufficient amount of the taxpayer's property to make the tax. The seizure should not include more property than is absolutely necessary for the payment of the tax. We would also suggest that the county board authorize the county treasurer to proceed with the col-
</seg>

	           <seg id="p387">OPINIONS	385
lection of the tax if possible to give such authority before action is required.
The sections above referred to undoubtedly refer to sales. seizure under legal process and removals in cases where the taxpayer would have no other property out of which the tax might be collected. We would therefore suggest that if there is other personal property than that which is about to be sold or removed out of which the tax can be made when it becomes delinquent, probably it was not the intention of the Legislature that these sections would apply except in cases of emergency provided by these sections.

Taxation—County Beard of Equalization
The power of the county board to sit as a board of equalization ceased on July 10, 1921.
Mrs. Mabel Thompson County Treasurer, Bridgeport, Nebr.
Dear Madam: I understand from your statement that the county board of Morrill county attempted to sit as a hoard of equalization on July 18, 1921, and at that date proceeded to equalize the tax list, changing the valuations as fixed by the local assessors. It is well settled that the power of the county board to function as a board of equalization ceased on July 10, 1921.
Section 6437, Revised Statutes, 1913;
Sumner &amp; Co. v. Colfax County, 14 Neb. 524; Farmers Co-operative Creamery &amp; Supply Co. v. McDonald, 100 Neb. 33.
</seg>
	           <seg id="p388">386	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
Therefore, any action taken by the county board after July 10, 1921, as to equalizing, is null and void and should be disregarded. This I understand was the holding of the district court in the two cases already brought, and it is unquestionably correct.
In our opinion you are justified in, and it is in fact your duty, to disregard the attempted equalization of the county board, and the tax should be collected upon the assessment as fixed by the local assessors before the county board attempted to equalize. We think you are justified in taking this action without any court decision, but should an action be brought by a taxpayer, it would be simple to ask for a general decree setting aside the attempted equalization throughout the county.
All unpaid taxes should be adjusted upon the local assessments. If a tax has been paid upon the figures of the county hoard's equalization and such figure is in excess of the local assessment, a taxpayer, if he paid without protest is simply "out of luck". There is no legal way in which he can recover the excess tax. On the other hand, if he had paid less than the figure fixed by the local assessor. the difference is a lien upon his property.
There is no legal way that we know of to change levies which are based upon the equalization figures.

Masonic Lodge property not exempt from taxation.
R. C. James, Esq., County Attorney, Falls City, Nebr.
Dear Sir: It appears from your letter of August 15th that for several years past the real estate owned and occupied by the Masonic Lodge at Stella was assessed for taxation, the taxes have not been paid and that said property is now listed for sale and that there is some doubt as to whether said property should be sold in default of a showing that same was used for charitable and religious purposes.
After property is once assessed the only way it can be removed from the assessment rolls is upon protest tiled first with the county board within certain dates, and then in case the county board decides the property correctly assessed, upon action brought in the district court. I understand that neither procedure is adopted in case of the Masonic Lodge at Stella. Consequently the property can be sold for non-payment of taxes.
The last case on this proposition determined by our supreme court is Scottish Rite Building Company v. Lancaster County, 196 Neb. 95. We interpret this decision as holding that property owned and occupied by a Masonic lodge or similar organization is not exempt from taxation as used for religious and charitable purposes, that the use for Masonic purposes is neither a religious or charitable use.
Ouc conclusion is that the property of the lodge at Stella is not exempt from taxation, that it was properly assessed and that in default of taxes it should be sold the same as any other property upon which taxes have not been paid.

Taxation—County Treasurer
Ordinarily, if there is disagreement as to payment, taxes must be paid under protest and action taken as provided for recovery; but where tender is made of the portion not disputed, the treasurer may receive and receipt for such portion, only reserving all rights, pending decision, in order to save interest.
Mr. M. A. Mills, Jr., County Attorney, Osceola Nebr.
Dear Sir: The Attorney General is in receipt of your letter of November 22, 1921, relative to the acceptance or refusal by the county treasurer of the tender of the undisputed portion of the taxes assessed against the Union Pacific Railroad Company. It seems that the railroad company is withholding a portion of the tax assessed against their company upon the theory that the same is void, and refuse to pay the same.
This proposition of accepting the tender, even though not in full of the tax as shown by the tax record, seems to have been discussed in the ease of Clark v. Colfax County, 96 N. W. 607, under which decision, as you advise, it was held that the tender was properly made and that interest could not be collected thereon as against the railroad company in that case. This would indicate that your county treasurer would be justified in receiving the portion of the tax tendered, noting upon the receipt thereof that that receipt is not in full of the taxes as shown by the tax records, but that the portion unpaid is withheld on account of the dispute and that the amount paid is received without prejudice to the collection of the unpaid portion as shown by the records.
With these precautions it seems to me that the county treasurer would be justified in receiving the portion tendered even though the law does provide that taxes shall be paid, and in the event of a dispute shall be paid under protest and action to recover, and that there is no justification in the refusal to pay taxes.
I believe that the county treasurer could take either
</seg>

position, requiting full payment before giving a receipt, but in that event upon their claiming the tender good, the county would probably lose the interest on the money under the decision above cited. Our opinion in this matter seems to be in accord with your own.
T trust that the matter will be adjudged without difficulty.

Taxation—Drainage Bonds—Bonds
Drainage bonds of a district organized for a public purpose and under conditions making it a public corporation are classified as municipal bonds for taxation purposes.
W.	Osborne,	Tax Commissioner, State House,
Lincoln-, Nebr.
Dear Sir: In answer to an oral inquiry from a representative of your office as to whether or not bonds issued by drainage districts organized in this state are subject to taxation, we respond as follows: Article 8 of Senate File 65 provides for an intangible property tax upon bonds. etc., other than those of the United States, of this state or a governmental subdivision of this state and the question arises whether or not bonds issued by drainage districts come within the excepted class. A drainage district is generally deemed to be a form of governmental corporation with very limited powers. It is sometimes called a municipal corporation and generally is considered to be a political subdivision of the state acting as an agent thereof to which certain powers and duties have been delegated. 9 R. C. L. 644 is in accord with the fore-
</seg>
	           <seg id="p392">390	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
going statement and specifically holds that such districts are not private corporations but are of a public nature, public or quasi public corporation. You will note that Section 391, Revised Statutes for 1913, as amended, page 544, Session Laws of 1921, requires bonds of irrigation and drainage districts to be registered the same as municipal bonds, etc. This to a certain degree indicates that they are placed in the same class as municipal bonds.
It is also to be noted that bonds issued by drainage districts are to the extent of the benefits or taxes which will be assessed to cover the cost of the district, or in other words, to pay the expenses of organizing and laying out the drainage district. In the case of Burr v. Boston, 208 Mass. 537, 95 N. E. 208, it was held that where income was specifically limited by the terms of the agreement to defray expenses of a particular public enterprise that the property will 1* exempt. This would seem to apply to drainage district bonds that are used to defray the expenses of the drainage district.
In addition to the foregoing, we have certain decisions in this state which are to the effect that drainage districts organized under Article 4, page 89, Compiled Statutes 1909, are public corporations and in reality governmental subdivisions of the state. The section of the statutes referred to is practically carried forward into our present laws with amendments which do not change the status of the drainage district as to the question now involved. III this connection the latest case is O'Neill v. Learner, 93 Nebr. 786, which holds that:
"When a public corporation is organized for subordinate governmental purposes, such as a village, township, city, or drainage district it is not necessary that all of the people embraced within the corporate limits should consent to incorporation. The legislature has power to provide for such incorporation by the required number of inhabitants and property owners therein without the unanimous consent of all."
This case further held that a drainage district is a public corporation. This case reached the United States
</seg>
	           <seg id="p393">OPINIONS	391
Supreme Court and the decision upon it is reported in 239 V. S. 244. The Supreme Court of the United States upheld the decision of the state court and held that such districts have the right of eminent domain as decided in the Supreme Court of the state and that where the district is organized for public purposes that, in reality, is a public corporation. In the report last cited, it is stated that the decision does not pass upon the question as to the status where private interests alone are served by the drainage district. However, in this connection, it is the view of this department that if the drainage district is for a private purpose only and that the public is not interested or served, that such bonds as authorized would not be exempt from taxation as they would partake of the same nature as mortgage bonds which might be placed upon a farm by the owner thereof _for his private purposes. Other Nebraska cases holding the same way are: White v. Drainage District, 147 N. W. 218; Drainage District No. 1, Richardson County v. Richardson County, 36 Neb. 355; Neal v. Van Sickle, 72 Neb. 105; State, ex rel v. Hanson, $0 Neb. 724. Other states have held the same way upon the proposition although there are some states which dissent but these are very much in the minority. 19 ('. 615, holds that drainage or irrigation districts have generally been held to be public or quasi public districts. The test seems to be that such districts must be for a public purpose and to serve the public. Therefore, it should appear in the bond record somewhere that the purpose is one for the benefit of the public and not merely to serve the petitioners. In this connection however, it must be taken into consideration that the fact that the district is incorporated under a decree of the district court indicates that the purpose is one to serve the public and there might be a presumption that such a decree would be for a public purpose. Whether or not such district is for a public purpose may also be gathered from the petition and a record of organization of the district.
Our conclusion therefore is that if you are satisfied
</seg>
	           <seg id="p394">392	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
that these bonds in cases considered are for a public purpose and that such drainage or irrigation districts come within the definition of a municipal or public corporation as opposed to a private corporation, as we have set forth in this letter, that the bonds in such case would be specially classified but if the purpose be merely private and without benefit to the public, then the bonds would be subject to taxation.
Very respectfully yours,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General.

Taxaticn—Hail Insurance
Hail insurance premiums are not taxes.
Mr. John. B. Heintz, County Treasurer, Harrisburg, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Your letter of September 12th pertaining to the collection of hail insurance premiums paid under the state hail insurance law, has been received.
The writer is inclined to believe that your county attorney is right in holding that premiums paid or agreed to be paid for state hail protection are not taxes that may be recovered as preferred liens in a mortgage foreclosure case. They do not appear to be assessed as a tax, nor do they appear to be entirely uniform; nor are they collected as taxes by being made a lien against the land. It also appears that it is a matter of discretion whether or not to take the protection of insurance.
The law of 1919 provided the county board should include in the assessment for personal property the application of the persons desiring state hail insurance in that these premiums should be collected in the same manner as
</seg>
	           <seg id="p395">OPINIONS	393
other personal taxes. The use of the word "other" in referring to personal taxes might indicate that it was the intention to include this as a tax in 1919. So if this suit is for the collection of premiums for 1919 and 1920, it might be desirable to have this matter tested,
Generally speaking the purpose of taxation is for the purpose of raising revenue to defray the expenses of government. Section 1 of Article VIII of the Constitution provides that taxes shall be levied by valuation uniformly and proportionately upon all tangible property and fran-chises. The procuring of state hail insurance is more in the nature of a contract than an enforced contribution. It seems more nearly akin to the sale of a commodity. The tax laws are defined as an enforced contribution of money or other property assessed in accordance with some reason-able rule of apportionment by authority of a sovereign state on persons or property within its jurisdiction for the purpose of defraying the public expenses.
If you desire to consult some authorities we refer you to 26 R. C. L., pages 13, 14, 15 and 16, and also the section of the constitution heretofore stated.
Very truly yours,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General.

Telephone Companies
Mr. John E. Curtiss, Secretary, Nebraska State Railway Commission, Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir : I have examined the question propounded by Messrs. Quade and McCain, to-wit :
"Should the State Railway Commission institute action to forfeit the
</seg>
	           <seg id="p396">394	REPORT OF THE ATTONREY GENERAL
franchise granted by a municipality to a telephone company when the company has ceased to do business?"
This question arises because of the action of the Tri-County Telephone Company in closing its exchange at Stapleton on January 1 of this year. The Commission is interested in the maintenance of service and if conditions seem to warrant an action will be instituted against the Tri-County Telephone Company to compel its resumption of service. The Commission has no power over the granting of franchises and, generally speaking, has no power to institute actions looking to the forfeiture of franchises. It is clear that in the present instance the Commission is not authorized to institute such an action.
See Nebraska Telephone Co. v. City of Fremont, et al., 72 Neb. 25.
The granting of the franchise to the Tri-County Telephone Company does not preclude the granting of other franchises.
May v. City of Gothenburg, 88 Neb. 772.
If another company wishes to enter the field it will not be necessary to forfeit the franchise of the Tri-County Company as a condition precedent thereto.
. Please advise the gentlemen that the Commission will not take action in regard to the franchise.
Very truly yours,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General.

	           <seg id="p397">OPINIONS	l Tractor Parts Sonia
Mr. George Johnson, Secretary Department of Public Works, Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Referring to your letter of November 24th pertaining to the question of failure of tractor sales companies to keep open a sales station for the providing of parts for tractors :
The question at issue is whether or not their failure to so keep a place where parts may be obtained releases the purchaser of the tractor from the sales purchase contract.
Section 5534, Compiled Statutes, 1922, requires these companies to maintain a service station upon the penalty of being denied the right to do business in the state. This seems to be the only penalty for failure to maintain the service station. Unless stated in the contract that they will maintain the service station for the benefit of their customers, we presume that it would not affect the contract, al-though it might result in their being banished from the state so far as doing business is concerned.
Very truly yours,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General.

Trust Companies
A trust company must pay up in cash all of its capital stock before commencing business.
Judge A. A. Bischof, Nebraska City, Nebr.
Dear Sir : The Attorney General is in receipt of your letter of May 11, 1921, making inquiry as to the incorporation of a trust company, and specifically inquiring whether
</seg>
	           <seg id="p398">396	REPORT OP THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
or not it is necessary to pay up all of the capital stock of such an organization at the time it is organized, or whether a larger amount of capital stock may be designated in the articles of incorporation and only a part thereof paid up, and a proportionate deposit made with the Department of Trade and Commerce and the amount in-creased from time to time.
The above plan would, of course, contemplate an in-crease of capital stock and a deposit from time to time without the necessity of filing new articles. This plan might be advisable if the law permitted it. However, after reading Section 5, page 719, of the Laws of Nebraska for 1919, we are of the opinion that a trust company cannot be authorized to do business by the Department of Trade and Commerce until all of its capital stock is fully pail up in cash, and therefore it would not be possible under the construction of the law, to adopt the plan that you suggest.
The section above referred to specifically states, in referring to the capital stock of such organizations, "All of which shall be fully paid up in cash before the corporation is authorized to commence business." The first line of the same section provides that no corporation shall be authorized to transact business under this article unless it shall have the capital stock specified in proportion to the number of inhabitants at the place where it intends to do business.
Yours very truly,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS, Attorney General.

Since September 1, 1915, the only way to become a Bcmused veteriamian has been to take the examination provided for by statute.
Kr. H. H. Antlex, Secretory, Department of Public Welfare, Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir: You ask whether a person, who has been practicing veterinary medicine, veterinary surgery or veterinary dentistry for a period of ten years and a period of one year in the county of his residence immediately pre-ceiling the taking effect of Chapter 51 of the 1915 Session Laws, may upon filing the affidavit mentioned in the amended Section 2832 of that act practice veterinary medicine, veterinary surgery or veterinary dentistry by virtue of that affidavit.
Before deciding that question you are advised that it is the opinion of this department that if the applicant could practice by virtue of the affidavit presented now, he should not be required to pay the fee of $10.00 mentioned in the amended Section 2834, since that fee is an examination fee.
It is our opinion that the time has passed during which an unlicensed practitioner may file with the Board of Examiners an affidavit by ten (10) freeholders in the county in which he resided setting forth *  * thus enabling the unlicensed practitioner to continue the practice of veterinary medicine, veterinary surgery or veterinary dentistry, without taking the examination provided in that act. In other words under the most liberal construction of Section 123 (2832) an unlicensed practitioner should have presented such an affidavit within a reasonable time following September 1, 1915.
It is the opinion of this department that the filing of such an affidavit before September 1, 1915, was a condition precedent to any unlicensed practitioner being allowed to continue his practice without taking the examination, as provided by statute, and that such unlicensed practitioner must to lawfully practice veterinary medicine,
</seg>
	           <seg id="p400">398	REPORT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL
veterinary surgery, and veterinary dentistry take the examination provided by statute.
You understand that the opinion of the Attorney General, is not law, but merely is our opinion of what the court would hold in interpreting the above considered act. The Veterinary Board is not bound to accept our opinion.
Trusting that this answers your inquiry, I am,
Very sincerely yours,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS,
Attorney General.

Veterinarians
The examining board has no authority to prescribe educational requirements for applicants for examination to practice as veterinarians.
Mr. H. H. Antics, Secretary, Department of Public Welfare, State Capitol, Lincoln, Nebr.
Dear Sir: Referring to your inquiry of October 13th pertaining to the examination of applicants to practice veterinary medicine, veterinary surgery, or veterinary dentistry in this state, it is the opinion of this department that members of the Examining Board have no authority to make rules and regulations requiring the applicants for examination to have had certain required education.
The provision in Section 1, "All examinations provided for in this article shall be conducted under the rules and regulations prescribed by the Department in our opinion only pertains to the manner of conducting the examination. Any other interpretation would be inconsistent with the general meaning of this act.
Very sincerely yours,
CLARENCE A. DAVIS,
Attorney General.
